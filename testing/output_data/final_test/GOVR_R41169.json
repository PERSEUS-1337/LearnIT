    "content": "In April 2009, President Obama highlighted nuclear terrorism as the top threat to global security and initiated an international effort to secure vulnerable nuclear material worldwide within four years. A Nuclear Security Summit was held in April 2010 in Washington, DC, where leaders from 47 countries gathered to address this issue. The Obama Administration's Nuclear Posture Review Report in April 2010 emphasized the risk of terrorists acquiring nuclear materials, underscoring the importance of securing them. Securing nuclear materials is crucial to preventing nuclear terrorism. The threat includes stolen nuclear weapons, improvised nuclear devices, radiological dispersal devices, and sabotage against nuclear power plants. Terrorist groups would need to acquire weapons-usable fissile material, making it a priority to prevent theft or purchase of such materials. The United States has made nuclear security a policy priority. The United States prioritizes securing nuclear material to prevent terrorism. Nuclear security measures include physical protection, material control, personnel screening, and training. Preventing illicit trafficking is also crucial. The government collaborates with other countries through various programs to address this issue. The United States collaborates with other countries through various programs to prevent nuclear terrorism. The 2012 Nuclear Security Summit aims to enhance measures against nuclear terrorism, protect nuclear materials, and prevent illicit trafficking. The summit may also discuss radiological material security, information security, and the interrelationship of nuclear security and safety. The International Atomic Energy Agency plays a key role in facilitating these efforts. The International Atomic Energy Agency plays a crucial role in facilitating states' implementation of nuclear security measures. The Netherlands will host a third Nuclear Security Summit in 2014 to measure progress and make announcements on contributions to nuclear security. President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have emphasized the importance of securing vulnerable nuclear materials and countering the threat of nuclear terrorism. Leaders of 47 countries, including heads of state, attended the summit to promote a common understanding of the nuclear terrorism threat. The Nuclear Security Summit had 47 countries attending, including heads of state, with a focus on improving nuclear security standards and preventing nuclear terrorism. Representatives from IAEA, UN, and EU were also present. Vice President Biden emphasized the need for international action before a nuclear terrorism incident occurs. The summit aimed to secure weapons-usable nuclear materials. The Nuclear Security Summit focused on securing weapons-usable nuclear materials and addressing the nuclear terrorism threat. Participants discussed steps to combat nuclear smuggling and highlighted the role of the IAEA and nuclear industry in promoting best practices. The Nuclear Security Summit aimed to attain the highest levels of nuclear security globally, endorsing key international treaties and initiatives. President Obama expected a clear plan to secure all nuclear materials within four years, with specific steps for each country. The summit also resulted in a work plan for follow-up actions. During the preparatory process for the Nuclear Security Summit, participating governments reviewed their nuclear security practices and export controls. Some countries made progress before the summit, such as Chile removing remaining HEU, Malaysia passing export control legislation, Ukraine committing to remove all HEU, and Canada returning HEU spent fuel to the United States. Additionally, a trilateral agreement was announced between Canada, the United States, and Mexico to convert Mexico's research reactor to LEU fuel. The Nuclear Security Summit led to agreements with Mexico to convert its research reactor to LEU fuel, Russia's announcement of shutting down its plutonium production reactor, and Kazakhstan securing sensitive material. The summit facilitated progress on long-term objectives, with countries pledging new actions on nuclear security. Non-NPT states like Pakistan, Israel, and India participated, endorsing discussions on nuclear security outside the NPT context. Egypt's involvement was also significant. Egypt's participation in the Nuclear Security Summit endorsed the nuclear security agenda, with Russia offering assistance in conference preparations. The United States and Russia have a history of cooperation on nuclear security, including the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism. Continuing this partnership at a high political level could ensure progress in nuclear material security goals and strengthen the nonproliferation regime. The Nuclear Security Summit aims to strengthen the nonproliferation regime by involving countries like China and India in discussions about nuclear security. Countries are reevaluating their approach to nonproliferation, with India announcing the creation of a nuclear energy training center with a security component. This summit process prompts countries to consider how they can prevent nuclear terrorism attacks. The 2010 Nuclear Security Summit focused on preventing nuclear terrorism by securing weapons-usable materials and bridging gaps in threat perceptions among participating countries. Preparation for the next summit in 2012, hosted by South Korea, is ongoing. The term \"nuclear security\" is associated with the security of nuclear weapons and the broader efforts to prevent nuclear terrorism. It also encompasses the role of nuclear weapons in national security, including maintaining the U.S. nuclear weapons arsenal. Vice President Biden's speech in 2010 addressed stockpile stewardship and nuclear nonproliferation efforts, while the NNSA is working on modernizing the U.S. nuclear weapons complex for various missions such as nonproliferation, disarmament, arms control, counterterrorism, and nuclear forensics. Nuclear security involves measures to prevent theft or diversion of nuclear material, including physical protection, personnel screening, and detection of illicit trafficking. It also includes establishing national export controls and improving international cooperation. The concept of \"nuclear security culture\" focuses on personnel attitudes towards nuclear security practices, emphasizing the importance of the human factor in ensuring effective protection measures. The insider threat at nuclear facilities involves workers potentially aiding terrorists or smugglers. President Obama's goal of securing all vulnerable nuclear materials globally raises questions about what constitutes vulnerability and security. Senator Lugar defines nuclear security as accountability, transparency, and safety, with the US prioritizing securing weapons-usable material. The U.S. government aims to secure nuclear materials, including HEU and separated plutonium, which are widely distributed globally. The challenge lies in the sheer volume of material to be secured, with 1,600 tons of HEU and 500 tons of plutonium estimated to be in stocks worldwide. The Obama Administration emphasizes the need for all states to improve nuclear security practices and commit resources. Establishing a baseline accounting of current nuclear material holdings will be crucial in measuring success towards the four-year goal. The 2006 NSPD-48/HSPD-17 established the Nuclear Materials Information Program (NMIP) to consolidate worldwide nuclear materials holdings and improve transparency about nuclear security practices. Data collection completeness and threat assessments are unclear, especially for nuclear weapon states and non-NPT states. The IAEA tracks nuclear material at safeguarded sites, but there is limited inventory data for other states. The 2010 Nuclear Security Summit involved most states with weapons-usable material, except North Korea, Iran, and Belarus. Belarus is returning HEU fuel to Russia, Iran has U.S.-origin HEU fuel under safeguards, and North Korea's plutonium stocks are for weapons without international monitoring. Developed countries need to enhance security on their nuclear materials, but some countries are hesitant to be transparent about their practices. Some developed countries are hesitant to be transparent about their nuclear security practices, especially regarding the use of highly enriched uranium in the civilian fuel cycle. While progress has been made to minimize HEU use, there are still concerns about its diversion for medical isotope production or research reactors. The Obama Administration has not called for a ban on HEU for civilian use, with some analysts suggesting U.S. leadership is needed to garner international support for such a ban. The Fissile Materials Working Group urged the Obama Administration to propose a timetable for HEU phase-out in the civilian fuel cycle at the summit. Some countries were initially concerned that the summit was meant to overshadow the 2010 Review Conference for the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The Review Conferences traditionally do not include in-depth discussion of nuclear material security or nuclear terrorism issues. Some states propose nuclear security as the \"fourth pillar\" of the NPT, linking it to prevention of proliferation. Developing countries resist new commitments until disarmament progresses. Obama Administration holds separate summit on nuclear security to include non-NPT states. The United States held a separate summit on nuclear security to include non-NPT states and address the problem of nuclear terrorism at the highest political levels. Multiple agencies, including the Department of Defense and Department of Energy, are involved in improving U.S. nuclear security. The Department of Energy (DOE) is working on converting civilian HEU-fueled research reactors in the U.S. and recovering high-priority radioactive sources. They have converted 17 university research reactors to LEU fuel, with two remaining reactors at MIT and MURR needing new fuel. DOE is also consolidating weapons-usable material in the nuclear weapons complex to enhance security. The NNSA is consolidating special nuclear material at five sites by 2012 to reduce security risks. The Department of Energy is working on converting civilian HEU-fueled research reactors in the U.S. and recovering high-priority radioactive sources. They have converted 17 university research reactors to LEU fuel. The NNSA is consolidating special nuclear material at five sites to reduce security risks. Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Nevada Test Site, the Savannah River Site, Y-12 Security Complex, and the Idaho National Laboratory are involved in ongoing work to enhance security. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Y-12 nuclear complex have made significant progress in removing SNM. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission improved security measures at nuclear power plants after 9/11. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 mandated the NRC to revise security standards. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 mandated increased security measures at nuclear facilities, including more extensive security checks and improved radiation detection technology. Different countries have varying perceptions of nuclear security threats, with some viewing nuclear terrorism as urgent while others see it as a remote concern. The IAEA document addresses the physical protection of nuclear material. The IAEA document provides guidelines for strengthening a country's system for nuclear material control, focusing on physical protection against unauthorized diversion or sabotage. Discussions are ongoing at the IAEA to amend and enhance these guidelines. The Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material is the primary legally binding international instrument for nuclear material security, but not all countries adhere to it. A 2005 Protocol to strengthen the convention requires two-thirds of parties to adopt it for it to enter into force, a process that may take years. The summit called for universal adherence to the Convention and prompt implementation of the Amendment. The IAEA promotes nuclear security and its role was endorsed at the summit. Member states have adopted guidelines for nuclear security through various documents. The IAEA has been assisting countries with nuclear security practices since the 1970s. IAEA safeguards agreements require effective State System of Accountancy and Control for nuclear material. The focus on nuclear safety increased after the Chernobyl accident. Following the Chernobyl accident, nuclear safety significantly improved. The IAEA's role in nuclear security activities also increased after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, leading to the establishment of a dedicated Nuclear Security Program. The program includes a Nuclear Security Plan adopted for 2006-2009 and 2010-2013, focusing on sustainability and training. The IAEA provides guides, assessments, and training on nuclear security topics, such as through the International Physical Protection Advisory Service (IPPAS) for expert advice on strengthening physical protection measures and compliance with international guidelines. The Nuclear Security Program focuses on recovering radioactive materials, tracking nuclear trafficking, and receives funding from the Nuclear Security Fund (NSF). The NSF's annual budget is around $33 million, with the majority of funds coming from voluntary contributions. The United States has supported increasing funding for the NSF within the IAEA regular budget, dedicating $7 million in FY2011 and $8 million in FY2012. Both the Bush and Obama Administrations have advocated for strengthening the IAEA's nuclear security activities. Several initiatives were developed in the past decade to address a wide range of approaches for gaining broader participation in preventing nuclear terrorism. These include nonproliferation assistance programs, joint law enforcement activities, interdiction coordination, and sharing best practices. Efforts such as the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism, the G-8 Global Partnership, and the Proliferation Security Initiative aim to better coordinate governmental efforts. The United States provides extensive aid to foreign countries to secure or remove nuclear materials through various agencies. Funding for these programs is discussed separately, and nongovernmental organizations also play a role in nuclear security efforts. Nongovernmental organizations actively recommend addressing nuclear terrorism threats and point out gaps in governmental efforts. They urge more funding and faster action on nuclear material security. A Fissile Material Working Group formed by NGOs recommended courses of action at the Nuclear Security Summit. Skeptical voices criticize the Obama Administration's nuclear weapons policies. Industry associations and medical organizations are advocating for nuclear security measures, including halting the production of medical isotopes with highly enriched uranium. The World Institute of Nuclear Security (WINS) is facilitating collaboration among nuclear plant operators to enhance security practices. Industry representatives met to discuss improving nuclear security following the 2010 summit. The House and Senate Judiciary Committees are considering legislation for the Nuclear Terrorism Convention, CPPNM Amendment, and 2005 SUA Protocols. The Senate approved resolutions for ratification in September 2008, but implementing legislation is needed before the US can ratify them. Draft legislation was submitted to the 112th Congress in April 2011 to update the US Criminal Code for investigating and prosecuting acts of nuclear terrorism. The House Judiciary Committee held a hearing on legislation to update the U.S. Criminal Code for investigating and prosecuting acts of nuclear terrorism. Senator Jeff Bingaman introduced the American Medical Isotopes Production Act of 2011, which aims to promote domestic production of molybdenum-99 for medical isotopes and phase out the export of HEU for medical isotope production within seven years. The House Foreign Affairs Committee approved H.R. 1280 sponsored by Committee Chairman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen on April 14, 2011. This bill would strengthen U.S. calls for eliminating the use of HEU for civilian purposes and amend provisions of the Atomic Energy Act. It would also require partner states to comply with nonproliferation requirements and international conventions on nuclear material protection. The Nuclear Forensics and Attribution Act (P.L. 111-140) became law in February 2010, urging the President to pursue agreements for nuclear forensics. The Nuclear Trafficking Prevention Act introduced in 2009 aims to establish protocols for nuclear forensics analysis and create a National Technical Nuclear Forensics Center. It prohibits the transfer of nuclear weapons or materials to terrorist organizations, with severe penalties for violations. Senator Akaka introduced the Strengthening the Oversight of Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 2009 (S. 1931), which aims to enhance U.S. nuclear nonproliferation efforts. The act requires reporting on prevention of weapons of mass destruction proliferation and cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency. The commission's recommendations focus on preventing nuclear terrorism, while Congress decides on funding for related programs annually. Congress determines funding for U.S. nuclear security programs, primarily implemented by Departments of Defense, Energy, State, and Homeland Security. The intelligence community analyzes nuclear terrorism threats. Budget requests under the Obama Administration aimed to increase funding for nuclear security, particularly in DOE NNSA Defense Nonproliferation programs. Critics note budget increases are partly due to costly construction projects for U.S. fissile material disposition, impacting international material security programs. The DOE, DOD, State Department, and DHS have reprogrammed funds for global nuclear security goals. Congress faced challenges passing appropriations bills for FY2011, leading to continuing resolutions. The nuclear security-related assistance programs were at risk of significant budget cuts. The nuclear security-related assistance programs faced significant budget cuts, particularly in the Department of Energy's defense nuclear nonproliferation accounts. House leadership proposed cuts to non-defense-related programs, but the House Armed Services Committee Strategic Forces Subcommittee urged full funding for NNSA programs as national security programs. Ultimately, P.L. 112-10 provided greater funding for nuclear security programs than expected. In FY2011, NNSA's defense nuclear nonproliferation funding was approximately $2.3 billion, slightly lower than the requested $2.7 billion. DOD's nuclear security programs remained stable in total funding, with some shifts between subprograms. A new initiative under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program, Global Nuclear Lockdown, was proposed with a budget of $74 million to establish regional centers of excellence for nuclear security. Despite uncertain funding levels, work on nonproliferation programs has continued on schedule. The Global Nuclear Lockdown initiative aims to establish regional centers of excellence for nuclear security worldwide. Funding for these programs has increased under the Obama Administration, with requirements for reporting to Congress on disbursements over $500,000. Despite budget cuts, nonproliferation programs are expected to continue as planned. The FY2012 budget request includes funding for nuclear security programs, such as removing highly enriched uranium from Belarus, Ukraine, and Mexico. The House leadership's budget blueprint did not specifically address nonproliferation or nuclear security funding but promised full funding for U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile-related programs. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency's Cooperative Threat Reduction program requested $121,143,000 for the Global Nuclear Security account for FY2012. The Global Nuclear Security account requested $121,143,000 for FY2012, with a reduction of $45,877,000 from the FY2011 request due to phasing out work in Kazakhstan and reduced efforts in Russia. The Nuclear Weapons Transportation Security program for Russia was eliminated in the FY2012 proposal. Other CTR programs, like Proliferation Prevention, focus on detecting and interdicting illicit transfers of WMD-related materials. DTRA's work includes Ukraine's borders with Moldova and Russia, coordinated with DOE's Second Line of Defense program, State Department's EXBS program, and DOD's International. The Administration requested $2.5 billion in FY2012 and $14.2 billion over the next five years for NNSA's defense nuclear nonproliferation accounts. Congress has often added funds to enhance security at facilities housing nuclear weapons, secure borders and ports, and remove vulnerable nuclear materials. The higher FY2011 request aimed to encourage congressional funding for these programs. The FY2012 request for State Department's Nonproliferation Programs remains fairly constant at $293,829,000, with changes in subprogram funding. Notable increases in Export Control and Weapons of Mass Destruction Terrorism accounts, with a $45 million reduction in the Nonproliferation Disarmament Fund. A $1.5 million contribution to the U.N. Security Council Resolution 1540 Trust Fund aims to enhance foreign countries' capacity to prevent illicit nuclear trafficking. Programs addressing nuclear security are primarily funded through the Department of Energy's Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation account, the Department of Defense's Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, and the State Department's Nonproliferation, Antiterrorism, and Demining programs. The House fully funded requests for these programs in the FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act. The House report raised concerns about the $26 million from DOE funds proposed for the Center for Excellence in China, questioning the necessity of paying for best practices training in an economically advanced country like China. H.R. 1540, Section 2112, requires that no more than $7 million may be obligated or expended until required reports are submitted to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees. The Senate version of the Defense Authorization Act (S. 1253) was approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee on June 17, 2011 (S.Rept. 112-26), recommending full funding for DOD's Cooperative Threat Reduction program and emphasizing coordination between the Departments of Energy and Defense on nuclear security efforts. The committee supports securing vulnerable nuclear material in 4 years with interagency cooperation between the Department of Energy and Department of Defense. The FY2012 Energy and Water Appropriations Act funded the Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Account at $2.091 billion, a reduction from previous years. House appropriators reduced funding levels for defense nuclear nonproliferation accounts. The committee reduced funding levels for several defense nuclear nonproliferation accounts, citing inefficiencies and overly optimistic estimates. A successful amendment on the House floor restored $35 million of the proposed cuts to the Global Threat Reduction Initiative research. In a floor statement, Representative Loretta Sanchez mentioned that restoring $35 million to the GTRI research reactor conversion program would prevent delays in converting Highly Enriched Uranium reactors in several countries. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved funding the DOE's Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Account at $2.383 billion, praising NNSA's progress in securing nuclear materials worldwide. Since April 2009, NNSA has been working towards securing all vulnerable nuclear materials within 4 years. Over 960 kilograms of highly enriched uranium have been removed, including from six countries like Libya, reducing the risk of nuclear terrorism. This accelerated campaign is faster than the previous rate of one country per year. The NNSA has accelerated efforts to secure enriched uranium from six countries in 2 years, faster than their previous rate of one country per year. Security upgrades have been completed at 32 buildings in Russia with weapons-usable materials. The State Department's request for Nonproliferation programs was fully funded, with recommendations for funding levels and nonproliferation work in Libya. The Obama Administration submitted its FY2013 budget requests related to international nuclear material security programs. The Administration's budget requests for nuclear material security programs are being debated due to reduced funding levels, which some experts criticize as contrary to the goals of the Nuclear Security Summit process. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency's Global Nuclear Security account saw a decrease in funding for FY2013, reflecting pressure to reduce spending under the Budget Control Act. This debate is expected to continue in upcoming hearings. The GNS account was reduced from a $121,143,000 request and appropriation in FY2012 due to completed security efforts in Kazakhstan and reduced efforts in Russia. FY2013 efforts include support for warhead security upgrades, transportation of deactivated Russian warheads, development of nuclear security centers, and assistance in transporting spent nuclear fuel. Other DOD CTR programs also contribute to nuclear security goals. The Administration requested $2.46 billion for NNSA's defense nuclear nonproliferation. The Administration requested $2.46 billion for NNSA's defense nuclear nonproliferation accounts in FY2013, reflecting completion of efforts to secure nuclear materials. Proposed budget increases include funding for U.S. disposition of excess plutonium stocks and $150 million for USEC's American Centrifuge enrichment technology. The DOE's budget shift towards national security over nuclear energy funding is causing concerns about cuts to nuclear and radiological security efforts. Proposed budget decreases are seen in the INMP&C program due to the completion of key projects in Russia. There is also a reduction in the Second Line of Defense program, reflecting the completion of detection equipment installation at various sites. House appropriators have recommended a review of the program's goals and effectiveness measures. The NNSA budget request includes a proposed overall decrease of nearly $32 million for GTRI activities, mainly due to reductions in Nuclear and Radiological Materials Removal. While the Gap Nuclear Material Removal program sees an increase, Russian-Origin and U.S.-Origin Nuclear Material Programs face a combined $49 million decrease. Additional reactor conversions and HEU removals are planned through 2017, with some activities funded in FY2012. Congress should consider how funding impacts removal and conversion timelines. State Department programs addressing nuclear material security are also part of these efforts. The State Department's Nonproliferation Programs funding decreased by $12.5 million, with cuts to Export Control and Global Threat Reduction accounts. A $1.35 million contribution to the U.N. Security Council Resolution 1540 Trust Fund aims to prevent illicit nuclear trafficking. Congress is reviewing the budget request and overseeing management issues. The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee will hold a hearing on nuclear nonproliferation efforts on March 14, 2012. The U.S. commitment to nuclear security goes beyond budget amounts, focusing on securing nuclear materials globally. Some countries may still view sensitive materials as assets, posing challenges to international cooperation. The U.S. faces challenges in nuclear security due to countries' preferences for working with other donors or organizations. U.S. persuasion and diplomacy are crucial, as funding for nuclear security programs may decrease while still providing benefits. President Obama chaired a U.N. Security Council Summit in 2009 on nuclear nonproliferation. Resolution 1887 was unanimously adopted at a U.N. Security Council Summit focusing on nuclear nonproliferation. It endorsed President Obama's goal of securing all vulnerable nuclear material within four years and called for improved nuclear security measures globally. Previous efforts at the Security Council, such as Resolution 1540, aimed to address the threat of nuclear terrorism by requiring states to criminalize proliferation and secure sensitive materials within their borders. Resolution 1540 focuses on preventing the proliferation of WMD and related materials through border controls and national export controls. The resolution does not provide enforcement authority but extends the duration of the 1540 Committee. The committee is currently working on assistance projects for states in need, with the Obama Administration proposing extra-budgetary contributions for a Trust Fund. UNSCR 1540 is a mandatory legal obligation for all U.N. member states. The U.N. Charter and various international treaties govern nuclear security, with efforts like the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism and the Proliferation Security Initiative. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1373 calls for preventing terrorism financing and denying safe haven for terrorists. The Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material sets international standards for nuclear security. The Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, adopted in 1987, establishes international standards for securing nuclear material in trade and commerce, including security requirements for international transit against terrorism. The 2005 Amendment expanded the scope to include nuclear material in domestic use, storage, and transport, as well as protection from sabotage. The Amendment could enhance U.S. efforts to prevent nuclear terrorism through cooperation with other countries. The 2005 Amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material aims to enhance international efforts to secure nuclear material. Critics argue that the Amendment lacks coverage of military stocks, verification measures, and specific protection guidelines. It requires ratification by two-thirds of the Convention parties, with only 46 states having ratified it as of January 2011. President Bush submitted the Amendment to the Senate for ratification in 2007. The 2005 Amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material aims to strengthen worldwide physical protection of nuclear material and facilities. President Bush and the Obama Administration supported the Amendment, highlighting its importance in combating nuclear terrorism and proliferation. The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations recommended approval in 2008, and implementing legislation is required before ratification. The U.N. General Assembly also adopted the Nuclear Terrorism Convention in 2005. The Nuclear Terrorism Convention, also known as the NTC, was adopted in 2005 after years of debate. The United States strongly supported the Convention, with President Bush being the second to sign it. The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations recommended approval in 2008, and implementing legislation is required for ratification. The Nuclear Terrorism Convention, also known as the NTC, defines offenses related to the unlawful possession and use of radioactive or nuclear material or devices. It commits parties to adopt measures in national law to criminalize these offenses and cooperate to detect, prevent, and investigate nuclear terrorism. The NTC could enhance U.S. efforts to combat nuclear terrorism through cooperation with other countries. While the treaty lacks enforcement mechanisms, it can serve as a legal basis for collaboration and support existing international initiatives like the UNSCR 1540 and the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism. Thirteen nations have endorsed a Statement of Principles under this initiative, including Russia and the United States. The Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism was established in October 2006 with 82 partner nations agreeing to a statement of principles. The initiative aims to prevent, detect, and respond to nuclear terrorism by enhancing information sharing and building capacity worldwide. Participating states pledge to improve their ability to secure radioactive material, prevent illicit trafficking, respond to terrorist attacks, prevent safe havens for nuclear terrorists, and ensure liability for acts of nuclear terrorism. The Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism aims to prevent nuclear terrorism through multinational exercises and expert meetings. Legal guidance is taken from international conventions and U.N. Security Council Resolutions. The G-8 Global Partnership was established in 2002 to raise $20 billion for nonproliferation assistance, with the U.S. committing $10 billion. The Global Partnership, established in 2002, aims to provide nonproliferation assistance with $10 billion committed by the U.S. Recently extended to recipients worldwide, it focuses on nuclear security and fissile material disposition programs. Some countries, including the U.S., seek to renew the Global Partnership for another 10 years with a focus on nuclear material security. The G-8 decided to continue the Global Partnership past 2012 at their 2011 Summit in Deauville, France, reaffirming goals for future activities. The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) was formed in 2003 to increase international cooperation in interdicting shipments of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). It does not create new legal frameworks but uses existing national authorities and international law. 97 countries have committed to PSI principles, with an Operational Experts Group coordinating activities. The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI), formed in 2003, aims to increase international cooperation in interdicting shipments of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). With 97 countries committed to PSI principles, the Operational Experts Group (OEG) coordinates activities. Supporters believe PSI's training exercises and boarding agreements enhance interdiction efforts, while observers see it as a successful approach to counterproliferation policy. President Obama proposed turning PSI into a durable international institution. U.S. policy strategies focus on material removal, conversion, consolidation, and improved protection at sites, with related assistance programs spread across federal agencies. Funding for these programs is discussed in detail. The Department of Defense's Cooperative Threat Reduction program, authorized in 1991, helps foreign governments dismantle nuclear weapons infrastructure and enhance security of fissile material storage. The program has shifted focus globally and includes scientist redirection programs. Funding for nuclear security programs is discussed in detail across federal agencies. The Department of Defense's Cooperative Threat Reduction program has shifted focus globally to address the WMD terrorism threat. The DOD proposed $74 million for a new initiative called Global Nuclear Lockdown to enhance nuclear security worldwide. This initiative includes establishing regional centers of excellence for nuclear security and working with foreign partners on warhead and material security. The DOE's National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) oversees nuclear nonproliferation efforts abroad, focusing on security upgrades, material removal, and reactor conversion. Programs like GTRI and MPC&A aid in reducing weapons-usable nuclear material. The Fissile Material Disposition program aims to decrease excess HEU and plutonium in the US and Russia. Other NNSA initiatives also contribute to preventing nuclear terrorism. The United States, through NNSA's Global Research Reactor Security program, is enhancing nuclear material security at research reactors globally. Security upgrades have been provided to 18 out of 22 HEU-fueled civilian research reactors. NNSA collaborates with the IAEA to ensure sustainability of these upgrades. A 2009 GAO report noted that most upgraded foreign research reactors meet international standards, but some sites showed security weaknesses. The voluntary nature of the program means not all governments promptly implement or maintain the upgrades, emphasizing the importance of security sustainability at nuclear sites. The NNSA's Global Threat Reduction Initiative program aims to convert 129 HEU-fueled research reactors by 2018. So far, 67 reactors have been converted or shut down, with 62 remaining. The NNSA's Office of Fissile Material Disposition has down blended over 375 metric tons of Russian HEU into nuclear fuel, providing 10% of U.S. electricity. The NNSA has converted Russian HEU into LEU, with 217 MT of excess U.S. HEU to be downblended. Over 124 MT of surplus U.S. HEU has already been downblended, with an additional 17.4 MT for the Reliable Fuel Supply Initiative. Some HEU is not yet available for disposition due to weapons dismantlement schedules, while others will likely be stored at waste facilities. The Second Line of Defense program helps foreign countries establish detection capabilities for nuclear materials. The Department of Energy (DOE) has expanded the Second Line of Defense (SLD) effort through the Megaports Initiative to detect illicit transport of nuclear materials at international borders. The State Department plays a facilitating and coordinating role in nuclear security and terrorism prevention efforts, managing assistance programs to prevent weapons of mass destruction proliferation. The State Department coordinates nuclear security and terrorism prevention efforts through various assistance programs funded by the Non-proliferation, Anti-terrorism, Demining Programs account (NADR). Key programs include Export Control and Related Border Security (EXBS), Nonproliferation Disarmament Fund (NDF), and Global Threat Reduction. The department also contributes to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and coordinates diplomatic meetings for initiatives like the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism and the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI). The EXBS program helps nations improve their ability to interdict nuclear smuggling. The State Department, through programs like EXBS, helps nations improve their ability to interdict nuclear smuggling and illicit trafficking of materials for weapons of mass destruction. It also plays a key role in setting up agreements with foreign countries related to nuclear security. The Department of Homeland Security has initiatives like the Container Security Initiative and the Secure Freight Initiative to increase security. The Container Security Initiative and Secure Freight Initiative aim to enhance nuclear material detection during shipping. The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office coordinates federal agencies for a global nuclear detection system. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration's Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation accounts appropriations are detailed from FY2007 to present. The Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration has programs such as International Nuclear Material Protection and Cooperation, Fissile Materials Disposition, and the Global Threat Reduction Initiative. Subprograms are listed below the shaded program totals."
