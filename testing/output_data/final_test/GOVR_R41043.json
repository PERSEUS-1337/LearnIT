    "content": "The People's Republic of China (PRC) is a key player in U.S. policy towards North Korea, being its closest ally and largest provider of food, fuel, and machinery. China's influence in Pyongyang is crucial for U.S. efforts to address North Korea's nuclear weapons program, enforce sanctions, maintain peace on the Korean Peninsula, and ensure humane treatment of North Korean refugees in China. China's role as North Korea's main trading partner allows it to act as an intermediary or exert leverage during crises. China's role in U.S. policy towards North Korea is crucial, as it is the closest ally and largest provider of food, fuel, and machinery to the DPRK. China hosts the Six Party Talks on denuclearization and plays a key role in reforming North Korea's economy. The Obama Administration emphasizes common interests with China regarding North Korea, but must consider possible spillover into other areas when criticizing China's actions towards North Korea. China's significant role in global affairs, particularly in cooperation with the United States, is crucial due to its status as the second largest economy in the world. The intersection of interests between the U.S. and China, who together account for over half of global energy imports and emit a significant portion of global greenhouse gases, influences how they address issues like North Korea. Cooperation with China is essential for resolving the U.S. trade deficit and reliance on capital inflows, given China's surplus in merchandise trade and holdings of U.S. Treasury securities. The United States and China's conflicting interests drive their relations and spill over into their dealings with North Korea. Tensions arise from various issues such as military exercises, currency manipulation, territorial disputes, arms sales to Taiwan, cyberattacks, and competition in Asia. China prioritizes stability on the Korean peninsula, while the U.S. focuses on denuclearization and human rights in North Korea. In 2010, Beijing and Pyongyang had a relatively friendly diplomatic relationship. In 2010, Beijing and Pyongyang had amicable diplomatic and economic relations despite China's support of UN sanctions on North Korea. China's enforcement of the sanctions is unclear, with lax control on exports and suspicious air traffic. Chinese shipments of luxury goods to North Korea are increasing, posing challenges for both China and the United States. The DPRK is facing a delicate time with various forces pulling the government in different directions. Kim Jong-il's efforts to ensure a smooth succession to his son Kim Jong-un require credibility with the Korean People's Army leaders and support from the Kim regime members. However, U.N. and U.S. sanctions have banned luxury goods shipments to North Korea, impacting the regime's ability to maintain support for the dynastic succession. The Kim regime in North Korea has a distorted view of the world, seeing the United States as hostile. They aim to be recognized as a nuclear power and seek peace with a nuclear-armed North Korea. The country is striving to become strong and prosperous by 2012, but this goal is challenging without more trade and investment. North Korea follows a cycle of provocations, charm offensives, and requests for aid. In 2010, they provoked events against Chinese interests. In 2010, North Korea engaged in provocations against South Korea and revealed its uranium enrichment program, followed by a diplomatic offensive to buy time for nuclear capabilities development. This phase often leads to negotiations and economic assistance deliveries. North Korea released American journalists and a South Korean captive, restarted diplomatic exchanges with the US, South Korea, and China, hinted at returning to the Six Party Talks, and proposed a peace treaty to replace the Korean War armistice. US officials praised China for its role in addressing North Korea's nuclear program, but China's security concerns and influence on North Korea remain unclear. China has called out North Korea for breaching U.N. nuclear safeguards. China has criticized North Korea for breaching U.N. nuclear safeguards and has supported sanctions against the DPRK. There are signs that some Chinese officials are growing frustrated with North Korea's actions, with Beijing allowing harsh criticisms of the DPRK in its media. There is a growing view in Beijing that China could accept Korean unification under Seoul's control. China has supported sanctions against North Korea for breaching U.N. nuclear safeguards. Despite Beijing's emphasis on a nuclear-free Korean peninsula, it has also backed North Korea's nuclear activities. China has been unable to prevent North Korea from conducting nuclear tests and uranium enrichment programs. China has been unwilling to curtail North Korea's uranium enrichment program and discounts the threat of nuclear proliferation by the DPRK to non-state terrorist groups. China is less concerned about nuclear cooperation between the DPRK and countries friendly to China. The U.S. policy debate has been hindered by differing opinions on China's real security concerns and political objectives regarding North Korea's nuclear issue. This has paralyzed much of the U.S. policy process with respect to the DPRK during the George W. Bush Administration. Some proponents believe that China is sincere in wanting a non-nuclear Korean peninsula despite its ties with North Korea. They argue that China may have limited leverage over Pyongyang and risks losing it if it reduces aid. Others argue that China is being deceitful about North Korea and its nuclear program. Some believe China supports North Korea's nuclear program to complicate US strategy in Asia. They suggest Beijing and Pyongyang may coordinate their policies to keep the US off balance. China prioritizes stability in the Kim Jong-il regime. The priority for China on the Korean peninsula is stability in the Kim Jong-il regime and the country as a whole. Beijing prefers diplomacy as a solution to provocations by North Korea, as long as talks are ongoing. Economic and humanitarian aid resulting from these talks can help maintain stability. The U.S. is concerned about North Koreans crossing the border into China since the 1990s famine. China did not condemn the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island but called for emergency consultations with countries involved in the Six Party Talks. Since the 1990s famine in North Korea, estimates suggest that between 30,000 to over 100,000 North Koreans reside in China. Despite being party to UN refugee conventions, China does not allow UN agencies or NGOs access to these individuals, considering them economic migrants rather than political refugees. China has deported or allowed North Korean authorities to seize border crossers, who may face punishment upon repatriation. Reports highlight the challenging conditions faced by North Koreans in China. The division of the Korean peninsula into south and north occupation zones in 1945 led to the establishment of South Korea and North Korea in 1948. The Cold War solidified this division, with North Korea invading the South in 1950. The PRC-DPRK military alliance was formalized in 1961, committing both parties to aid each other if attacked. The PRC-DPRK alliance was based on mutual defense, shared ideologies, military cooperation, and economic assistance. Both countries saw each other as crucial buffers against external threats. However, their relationship began to diverge in the 1980s when the PRC started economic reforms. In the early 1980s, the PRC initiated economic reforms under Deng Xiaoping's leadership, leading to a divergence in the PRC-DPRK alliance. Despite improved official ties and increased economic flows in the 2000s, recent years have seen growing incompatibility between PRC and North Korean interests and goals. The PRC has transformed into a market-driven economy but still maintains close relations with North Korea due to shared interests in preserving stability. US policymakers face challenges in convincing China to be more coercive towards Pyongyang while being cooperative with Washington on North Korea's nuclear program. China's relationship with North Korea is complex, with shared socialist ideologies and significant investments from China. Beijing seeks a buffer against South Korea but faces frustration with North Korea's unpredictability and nuclear ambitions. The potential for military involvement in any conflict with Pyongyang poses challenges for Chinese leaders. Beijing's fundamental policy objectives remain unchanged despite the challenges posed by North Korea's unpredictability and nuclear ambitions. China prioritizes stability on the Korean peninsula to safeguard its political, economic, and security interests. Any disruption, such as another economic collapse in North Korea, would strain China's resources and potentially lead to criticism regarding its treatment of refugees. The world spotlight on China's treatment of refugees has increased criticism. Armed conflict between North and South Korea could disrupt PRC economic interests and risk conflict with the U.S. Beijing faces challenges if North Korea undergoes political upheaval like East Germany. This could lead to a united Korea under South Korea's terms, potentially creating a nuclear armed U.S. ally on China's border. Beijing's economic assistance to North Korea may be to maintain stability rather than support its nuclear program. China's food and energy assistance to North Korea can be seen as an insurance premium to avoid higher costs of a collapse, war, or reunification. Beijing aims to maximize its influence on the Korean Peninsula and leverage in Asia. Uncertainty exists regarding China's leverage over Pyongyang, leading to hesitancy in assertiveness. In calculating their leverage over North Korea, Chinese leaders provide food and energy aid to stabilize the regime, increase economic influence, and potentially encourage economic reform. This aid also serves to raise the costs of misbehavior while offering rewards for good behavior, showcasing China's economic power and ability to limit options for smaller economic partners. Beijing aims to align North Korean interests with China's by providing investment and economic benefits. The PRC sees value in its involvement in the Six Party Talks, particularly with the United States. Continuing the talks allows Beijing to expand its mediating role and potentially craft a key international agreement. It also provides a neutral forum for conversations with Japan. Continuation of the Six Party Talks provides a neutral forum for conversations with Japan and enhances Beijing's credentials with South Korea. China also sought to lift sanctions on North Korea if it returned to negotiations, but later focused more on U.S.-North Korea bilateral talks for denuclearization. Beijing's policy goals include regional stability and safeguarding China's territorial integrity. China's concern about regional stability and its own territorial integrity is heightened by the potential for a nuclear-armed North Korea to prompt neighboring countries like Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan to develop their own nuclear deterrents. Beijing aims to prevent the proliferation of nuclear-armed governments around its periphery, as it could lead to conflicts with China's interests. Additionally, China anticipates that increased security programs in the region may result in an accelerated missile defense program by the U.S. and its allies. China is concerned about regional stability and its territorial integrity due to the potential for a nuclear-armed North Korea to prompt neighboring countries to develop their own nuclear deterrents. This could lead to conflicts with China's interests. Beijing anticipates an accelerated missile defense program by the U.S. and its allies, which could undermine Beijing's missile deployment threat against Taiwan. The Kim Jong-il government's main concerns are security, regime preservation, and generational leadership succession. The North Korean government focuses on acquiring resources to support the elite, with short-term goals including a smooth succession for Kim Jong-un and preparations for the 100th anniversary of Kim Il-sung's birth in 2012. Pyongyang aims to be recognized as a nuclear weapon state and a military and economic power by then. North Korea's military capabilities are crucial for its security, lacking modern equipment and technology but still capable of causing significant damage to South Korea. Without nuclear weapons, the country would be considered a \"basket case\" from the Cold War era. The goal of becoming an economically powerful state is essential for supplying the army and fulfilling Kim Il-sung's lifelong desire. DPRK leaders publish their annual goals on January 1st each year. In their annual editorial, Pyongyang outlined goals for a general offensive focused on improving people's standard of living through light industry and agriculture. They emphasized the importance of heavy industry, strengthening the military, workers, and the Party, and achieving national unification. The editorial also called for ending the hostile relationship between North Korea and the USA for peace and stability in Asia. The 2010 editorial by Pyongyang outlined goals for improving people's standard of living through industry and agriculture, emphasizing military strength and national unification. Despite the call for peace with the USA, North Korea continued to impose restrictions on private sector activity, leading to food shortages and inflation. This crackdown was followed by military provocations, trade cut-offs with South Korea, and increased economic sanctions. China's relationship with North Korea has evolved over the years, with North Korea becoming more of a burden than a reliable ally. Despite being a close partner in the past, China now has to deal with North Korea's cycle of provocations, diplomacy, and aid deliveries. While North Korea's provocative actions are usually aimed at the United States, South Korea, or Japan, China often finds itself having to fend off hostile actions as well. China advises against provocative actions to maintain stability on the peninsula. North Korea's interest in regime preservation aligns with China's goal of stability. Beijing has supported North Korea economically and diplomatically to ensure stability, despite concerns about dependency. China cooperates with North Korea along their border to monitor activities. In November 2003, China transferred border security responsibility from police to army along its border with North Korea. China built a 20-kilometer fence in 2006 along the Yalu River, a key crossing point for North Korean refugees. Trade between China and North Korea flows through the port of Dandong. China has been a reliable supporter of North Korea, despite occasional alignment with UN sanctions. During the Cold War, North Korea strategically leveraged the rivalry between the Soviet Union and China to receive economic assistance. When Chinese support decreased in the mid-1990s, North Korea sought aid from other countries like Taiwan. South Korea provided economic assistance and diplomatic support under the \"Sunshine Policy\" until 2008. North Korea has also sporadically sought aid from the United States and Japan for food and energy assistance. China has emerged as North Korea's dominant trade and aid partner, especially after the DPRK's nuclear program escalated tensions in the region. Pyongyang's nuclear tests in 2009 strained its relationship with Beijing, which previously believed North Korea was using its nuclear activities as a bargaining tool. China's attitude towards North Korea shifted after realizing Pyongyang's deceitful intentions regarding its nuclear weapon programs. Beijing's goals of denuclearization and stability on the Korean peninsula became more focused, but denuclearization may not be achievable. Hosting the Six Party Talks puts China in a delicate position balancing its relations with North Korea. China, Beijing acknowledges Pyongyang's security concerns of being surrounded by nuclear powers and views South Korea, Japan, and the United States as hostile. Beijing prioritizes stability and regime preservation in North Korea, preferring the US to lead denuclearization efforts. China has encouraged bilateral negotiations between the US and North Korea while also supporting the DPRK's return to the Six Party Talks in 2010. Beijing's actions, such as supporting UN Resolution 1874, aim to protect its interests in peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. China supports UN Resolution 1874 to protect its interests in peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. The Chinese representative emphasized respecting North Korea's sovereignty and development interests, including the right to peaceful use of nuclear energy. The Security Council's actions should not hinder the country's development or humanitarian assistance, and compliance with the resolution may lead to a review of lifting the measures. Use of force should be avoided under all circumstances. China supports UN Resolution 1874 to protect peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao visited Pyongyang to strengthen economic cooperation and signed agreements with North Korea. Pyongyang engaged in diplomatic efforts with China and the West following the tightening of sanctions. China and North Korea agreed to construct a new bridge over the Yalu River, funded by China and costing over $150 million. Additionally, China offered an economic cooperation package worth $50 million. China also planned a Tonghua-Dandong Economic Zone along the North Korean border to boost trade, including a rebuilt bridge, a new port, a duty-free zone, warehouses, and international transit facilities. Chinese Defense Minister Liang Guanglie visited Pyongyang in November 2009 as part of a three-nation Asian tour. Chinese Defense Minister Liang Guanglie visited North Korea as part of an Asian tour to enhance military exchanges and cooperation between the two countries. The visit aimed to strengthen ties between the Chinese and North Korean armed forces, with a focus on promoting friendly exchanges. Denuclearization was not a stated goal of the visit. This visit marked a significant reversal in military relations between the two countries, which had been strained since the late 1950s. China's military communication with North Korea has increased, indicating the importance of their alliance. Kim Jong-il visited China multiple times, with the last visit in 2006. Tensions rose after North Korea's attacks on South Korea in 2010, putting Beijing in a delicate position. China reportedly intervened to prevent North Korea from threatening nuclear war if South Korea conducted live-fire exercises on a disputed island in December 2010. China's economic support sustains North Korea, but Beijing has been pushing for economic reforms similar to its own. The rise of markets in North Korea has been driven by necessity as the central government struggles to provide essentials. The rise of markets in North Korea has been driven by necessity as the central government faltered in delivering essentials. Inflows of consumer goods from China and cooperative industrial projects have created a market-based means of income generation. However, the Chinese penetration into the economy and spread of private markets have raised concerns for the Kim regime's control over individuals. The DPRK government carried out a currency reform that confiscated wealth from \"illegal\" merchants and traders who accumulated wealth through private markets. The reform issued new currency at a much lower value, limiting households to exchange only a small amount initially. Holdings of foreign exchange were also prohibited, effectively confiscating wealth earned through trade with China. This reform was a rebuke to those who had accumulated wealth through private markets. The currency reform in North Korea was a disaster, leading to the shooting of the government official in charge. China plays a crucial role in North Korea's economic relations, being its main trading partner and a key player in implementing economic sanctions. In 2009, China accounted for half of North Korean imports and a quarter of its exports. Trade with South Korea was significant until most intra-Korean trade was blocked after the sinking of the Choenan naval ship. In 2009, North Korea ranked low among China's export markets and import sources. Sino-DPRK trade has been increasing steadily, although dwarfed by China's trade with South Korea. Despite the global financial crisis, DPRK exports to China rose to $793 million in 2009. In 2009, North Korea's exports to China increased to $793 million, while Chinese exports to North Korea slowed slightly to $1,888 million. The bilateral trade imbalance resulted in China's surplus exceeding $1 billion. North Korea's total merchandise exports were $2,235 million, with imports at $3,488 million, creating a trade deficit of $1,253 million, of which $1,095 million was with China. China is the main source of North Korea's imports, while South Korea was the largest buyer of North Korean products. In 2009, North Korea's trade with China increased, with exports to China reaching $793 million and imports from China slowing slightly to $1,888 million. The trade imbalance resulted in a surplus for China exceeding $1 billion. North Korea's total exports were $2,235 million, with imports at $3,488 million, creating a trade deficit of $1,253 million, of which $1,095 million was with China. China is the main source of North Korea's imports. North Korea partners with Chinese firms for modern equipment in exchange for products. China is a major source of North Korean imports, including petroleum. Chinese economic assistance to North Korea accounts for half of all Chinese foreign aid. China provides a significant amount of foreign aid to North Korea, bypassing the United Nations to pursue its own political goals. Some Chinese food aid may be diverted to the DPRK military. China is also the largest foreign direct investor in North Korea, with investments totaling $18.4 million in 2007 and $41.2 million in 2008. Chinese companies have invested heavily in developing mineral resources in North Korea, with investments totaling $41.2 million in 2008. This is part of China's strategy to stabilize the border region, reduce migration pressure, and improve living standards in North Korea. Notable investments include China Tonghua Iron and Steel Group investing $875 million in the Musan Iron Mine and Tangshan Iron and Steel Company building a steel smelting plant with an annual output of 1.5 million tons. Chinese companies have heavily invested in developing mineral resources in North Korea, with projects involving iron ore, molybdenum, copper, zinc, lead, and gold mines. Joint ventures and partnerships have been established with North Korean companies for mining operations, electricity transmission, and ore exchange. Notable investments include China Tonghua Iron and Steel Group in the Musan Iron Mine and Tangshan Iron and Steel Company in a steel smelting plant. The \"DPRK-China International Mining Company\" and China Minmetals established joint ventures for coal mining at the Ryongdu'ng Coal Mine. Another joint venture was formed to mine gold in Mt. Sangnong, with the gold concentrate being shipped to Zhaoyuan for smelting. Tensions arose in 2006 after Pyongyang's missile and nuclear tests, leading China to agree to U.N. sanctions on North Korea and halt certain transactions and petroleum shipments. China agreed to stronger U.N. sanctions on North Korean entities after missile and nuclear tests in 2009, including an arms embargo, ban on luxury goods, and restrictions on nuclear-related items. China's minimal approach to implementing sanctions on North Korea allows for continued flow of luxury goods and evasion of restrictions through air and land routes. China's role is crucial in enforcing U.N. Security Council Resolutions on North Korea, but more resources are needed to detect and prevent violations. China imposed \"sanctions\" on North Korea by reducing crude oil shipments and tightening inspections of weapons-related exports. They also cancelled a joint venture for vanadium production and intercepted a vanadium shipment. Additionally, China halted a copper mine project in North Korea. In November 2006, a Chinese firm signed an agreement with North Korea Mining Development Trading Corporation to develop a copper mine. China's exports of small arms and ammunition to North Korea increased significantly in 2009, reaching $4.32 million. In July 2010, Kim Jong-il provided 160 luxury cars (made in China) to high-ranking officials in North Korea. Kim Jong-il's love for luxury goods is well-known, including items like caviar, Mercedes Benz cars, and Martell cognac. The ban on luxury goods to North Korea under UNSCR 1874 is not clearly defined, with China arguing that the ban is not enforceable without specific definitions. In 2009, countries reported exporting $212.2 million in luxury goods to North Korea, with China leading at $136.1 million, mainly in tobacco, computers, and cars. In 2009, luxury goods exports to North Korea totaled $212.2 million, with China leading at $136.1 million. Luxury goods included tobacco, computers, cars, precious stones, and more. Western visitors in Pyongyang noted an abundance of luxury goods, mostly from China and Japan. Kim Jong-il gifted 160 luxury cars (from China) to officials. China's luxury goods exports to North Korea fluctuated but generally increased after UNSC resolutions. In 2009, luxury goods exports to North Korea totaled $212.2 million, with China leading at $136.1 million. The total for 2009 was down from $146.8 million in 2008. By mid-2010, Chinese exports of luxury food and alcoholic beverages had tapered off to $0.7 million per month from as high as $6 million in December 2008. China has not been enforcing sanctions on luxury goods, possibly viewing them as \"unenforceable.\" China's focus on large security items rather than luxury goods is evident in their approval of U.N. Resolution 1874, showing commitment to enforcing the ban on luxury goods exports to North Korea."
