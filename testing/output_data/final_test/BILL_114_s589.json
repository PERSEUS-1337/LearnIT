    "content": "The Act titled \"Defending Our Great Lakes Act of 2015\" establishes an Aquatic Invasive Species Control Zone at the Brandon Road Lock and Dam Site in Joliet, Illinois. The Act establishes immediate actions to prevent the transfer of aquatic nuisance species from the Mississippi River basin to the Great Lakes basin through the Brandon Road Lock and Dam site, with a focus on Asian carp and other species of concern. The Corps of Engineers will implement measures to improve the Brandon Road Lock and Dam site to prevent the transfer of Asian carp and other aquatic nuisance species from the Mississippi River. This includes constructing an engineered channel and adding technologies for species control while protecting the ecosystem. A cost estimate and schedule must be provided within 180 days. The Chief of Engineers must provide a cost estimate and schedule for measures to be constructed at the Brandon Road Lock and Dam site within 180 days. The Director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service, in consultation with other agencies, will implement measures to prevent the transfer of Asian carp and other aquatic nuisance species from the Mississippi River. The focus is on controlling Asian carp and other aquatic nuisance species at the Brandon Road site. Strategies include real-time monitoring, testing new control technologies, implementing effective strategies, and developing best practices to prevent species transfer by boat and barge operators. The focus is on controlling Asian carp and other aquatic nuisance species at the Brandon Road site through real-time monitoring, testing new control technologies, and implementing best practices to prevent species transfer by boat and barge operators on the Illinois River and Chicago Sanitary and Shipping Canal. The Chief of Engineers may acquire real estate necessary for this purpose and must coordinate with relevant authorities. In carrying out control measures at the Brandon Road site to prevent species transfer, the Chief of Engineers, the Director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Director of the US Geological Survey will consult with relevant government entities, business, commerce, and environmental communities. SEC. 3. Actions to prevent aquatic nuisance species transfer between the Great Lakes Basin and Mississippi River Basin. The Secretary of the Army, Chief of Engineers, Secretary of the Interior, Director of US Fish and Wildlife Service, Director of US Geological Survey, and other federal entities will work to prevent aquatic nuisance species transfer between the Mississippi River basin and the Great Lakes basin. The Chief of Engineers will collaborate with Illinois Governor, City of Chicago, Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago, and other entities to design and construct flood mitigation and water quality measures on the Chicago Area Waterway System for this purpose. The Chief of Engineers will coordinate with the City of Chicago and the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago to combine infrastructure with relevant projects, improve flood mitigation in the Chicago Area Waterway System, and protect water quality in the Great Lakes. The administration will ensure water quality protection in the Great Lakes, Chicago Waterway System, and Mississippi River basin, maintain watercraft traffic on the Chicago Area Waterway System, and prevent the transfer of aquatic nuisance species. Coordination will be done with relevant authorities and Governors of certain states. The administration will work with relevant authorities and Governors of certain states to ensure water quality protection in the Great Lakes, Chicago Waterway System, and Mississippi River basin. The Chief of Engineers may delegate parts of the project to non-Federal entities, and consult with entities in the business, commerce, and environmental communities. The Chief of Engineers will identify non-Federal cost-share partners for projects and acquire necessary real estate in accordance with existing laws. A report on progress and future actions will be submitted to relevant committees annually. Reports under paragraph (1) will be publicly available online. Congress recognizes the need to protect tributaries and waterways in the Great Lakes region from aquatic nuisance species, including the St. Croix River, Minnesota River, Wisconsin River, and Ohio River."
