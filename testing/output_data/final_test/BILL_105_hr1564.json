States can also restrict entity classes. Qualified entities must provide necessary forms and assistance for applying for medical assistance for children. If a child is deemed presumptively eligible, the entity must follow State plan guidelines. The regulations allow certain entities to determine a child's medical assistance eligibility. If a child is found presumptively eligible, the entity must notify the State agency within 5 days and inform the parent to apply for medical assistance by the end of the following month. The determination of the application used for medical assistance by individuals described in section 1902(l)(1) is made during a presumptive eligibility period for children.

Conforming amendments are made to section 1902(a)(47) of the Act to provide for medical assistance. The amendments made by this section aim to provide medical assistance for items and services to children during a presumptive eligibility period.
