It is mandated by state or federal law and is a no-fault system that compensates workers for work-related injuries or illnesses. Workers' compensation in the United States is a no-fault system that compensates workers for work-related injuries or illnesses. In exchange for guaranteed benefits, workers give up their rights to sue employers in civil court for damages. State and federal laws vary on how employers can insure against economic losses from workplace injuries. In the United States, firms can self-insure or purchase workers' compensation insurance from private providers or state funds. Each state, except Texas, has its own policy mandating that employers insure against financial damages from work-related injuries and provide benefits to affected employees. The federal government has a limited role in workers' compensation, administering programs for federal employees and some private-sector workers. State programs paid $52.1 billion out of $55.4 billion in total costs in 2007. State workers' compensation programs paid $52.1 billion, or 94%, of the total benefits, while federal programs paid $3.3 billion, or 6%. The federal government typically defers to states on workers' compensation policy, but intervenes in cases involving federal employees, longshore and harbor workers, and railroad industries. The federal government administers workers' compensation programs for specific groups like longshore and harbor workers, coal miners with black lung disease, and energy workers with radiation-related illnesses. The Defense Base Act (DBA) requires federal contractors working outside the US to provide workers' compensation insurance. This ensures overseas contractors have the same coverage as maritime firms under the Longshore Act. The Defense Base Act (DBA) provides workers' compensation insurance for federal contractors working outside the US, ensuring they have the same coverage as maritime firms under the Longshore Act. DBA benefits are administered by the Department of Labor (DOL) and provide coverage for employment-related injuries, illnesses, and deaths without the need for fault determination. The number of DBA cases and total claims amount increased significantly after the start of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) in 2003. The DBA caseload increased significantly during Operation Iraqi Freedom, with the largest caseload in 2007. Despite the increase in cases, the average compensation and medical benefits paid per claim in 2007 were at the lowest level since 2003. The number of DBA payments decreased in 2008, but the average benefits per case rose. Compliance efforts led to more claims involving minor medical care and no lost work time. Between 1997 and 2008, 55,988 DBA claims were processed, with nearly half involving no lost work time. Between September 2001 and December 2009, the DBA processed 1,987 cases involving contractor deaths, with 73.4% in Iraq and 14.5% in Afghanistan. Service Employers International Inc., a subsidiary of KBR, had the most cases, including 107 deaths. Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan accounted for 87.9% of all covered contractor deaths during this period. During the period between September 2001 and December 2009, there were 1,987 cases of contractor deaths processed by the DBA, with the majority in Iraq and Afghanistan. Congress is concerned about contractor behavior jeopardizing the health and safety of personnel, leading to proposed legislation requiring reports on incidents where contractors have lost award fees for such behavior. The Defense Base Act (DBA) was enacted in 1941 to extend workers' compensation coverage to persons working on American military bases outside of the continental United States. Significant amendments in 1958 expanded coverage to non-citizens and those working on projects funded under the Mutual Security Act of 1954. The War Hazards Compensation Act (WHCA) program was also established to provide coverage for public works contractors working outside the US. The Defense Base Act (DBA) was expanded in 2006 to include service contracts and directed the Department of Defense (DOD) to improve its procedures. The DBA extends workers' compensation coverage to federal contractors working outside the US, similar to the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) for maritime occupations. Injured workers covered by the LHWCA and DBA are entitled to full medical benefits and cash disability benefits. Disability benefits are based on a worker's pre-disability weekly wage, with total disability benefits capped at 200% of the national average weekly wage. Benefits are also paid to survivors of covered workers killed on the job. The DBA extends workers' compensation coverage to federal contractors working outside the US. The Defense Base Act (DBA) extends workers' compensation coverage to federal contractors working outside the US on military, air, or naval bases, public works projects, or projects funded by the federal government under the Mutual Security Act of 1954. Benefits are provided by a privatized insurance program purchased by the employer. The DBA allows federal contractors working outside the US to purchase insurance from approved providers or self-insure. Failure to provide compensation can lead to criminal prosecution and civil suits. Major providers of DBA insurance include ACE-USA, AIG, and CNA. Between September 2001 and December 2009, 97.3% of new DBA cases were insured by these companies, with the Insurance Company of the State of Pennsylvania insuring the most cases. Between September 2001 and December 2009, there were 43,901 DBA cases. Insurance prices fluctuate between \"hard market\" periods with high premiums and \"soft market\" periods with low premiums. Some consumers opt for self-insurance instead of purchasing insurance. Self-insurance ranges from entities ignoring risks to setting up savings for future losses. Self-insurance options include setting up captive insurers or self-insuring under federal regulations. Employers can self-insure under certain financial criteria and approval by DOL. Nearly 170 employers are authorized self-insurers, and over 6,000 firms self-insure under state workers' compensation laws. Many corporations self-insure their workers' compensation risks, often purchasing a \"catastrophic\" policy as required by federal rules. Third-party administrators can help manage claims without taking on financial risk. Self-insurance is chosen to reduce costs and ensure insurance availability, capturing insurer profits and saving on administrative costs. Self-insurance for workers' compensation can save costs by managing claims in-house or with a third-party administrator. A waiver from the Secretary of Labor exempts firms from the DBA if they have an alternative workers' compensation system. DBA covers all eligible federal contractors, including foreign nationals, with some exceptions for benefits. Benefits for survivors of foreign nationals not residing in the US or Canada are limited to the worker's spouse, children, father, or mother if supported by the worker for at least one year before death. American citizens and nationals have broader eligibility for survivors benefits, including spouses, children, siblings, parents, grandparents, or grandchildren. Disability or survivors benefits for foreign nationals can be converted to a lump-sum payment equal to half the future compensation value. The decision to commute benefit payments for foreign nationals under the Defense Base Act (DBA) is made by the Secretary of Labor. DBA claims are processed through LHWCA regional offices, with claims from Iraq and Afghanistan handled by the New York office. Dissatisfied applicants can request a hearing before a DOL Administrative Law Judge, with further appeals possible to the DOL Benefits Review Board and U.S. District Court. Additionally, the DOL has an informal dispute resolution process for workers. The DOL has an informal dispute resolution process for workers involved in DBA cases originating in Iraq or Afghanistan between 2001 and 2005. The War Hazards Compensation Act provides reinsurance for injuries and deaths related to military conflict, with benefits provided by the federal government if caused by a war hazard. The War Hazards Compensation Act (WHCA) provides reinsurance for injuries and deaths related to military conflict, with benefits provided by the federal government if caused by a war hazard. Covered employees may receive DBA benefits for injuries or death caused by various hostile actions or war activities. Insurers and employers may be reimbursed for benefits paid under the WHCA. The War Hazards Compensation Act (WHCA) provides reinsurance for injuries and deaths related to military conflict, with benefits provided by the federal government if caused by a war hazard. Employers may be reimbursed for benefits paid and administrative costs associated with the claim, capped at 15% of the total benefits due. WHCA benefits are paid out of the Employees' Compensation Fund, administered by the DOL OWCP Division of Federal Employees' Compensation (DFEC). WHCA claims make up a small percentage of total DBA claims originating in Iraq and Afghanistan. Between September 2001 and June 2009, over 37,000 DBA claims were filed, with only 823 WHCA claims during the same period. WHCA claims accounted for just over 2% of all DBA claims filed. $12.1 million has been paid for compensation and benefits in WHCA cases since 2003. The Departments of State (DOS) and Defense (DOD) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) are major contractors under the Defense Base Act (DBA) in Iraq and Afghanistan. DOS and USAID use competitive blanket contracts with fixed rates, while DOD allows private contractors to negotiate individually with insurers. Rates for DBA insurance charged to DOD have been higher than those for DOS and USAID. DOS used to require contractors to obtain DBA insurance independently before 1990. In 1991, DOS competitively awarded a multi-year contract to CIGNA Property and Casualty Insurance Company to reduce costs for DBA insurance. CNA was competitively awarded the DOS contract in 2001 and has held it since. DOS issued a notice in April 2008 to solicit bids for a permanent contract. The Department of Defense (DOD) permits overseas contractors to purchase Defense Base Act (DBA) insurance from any DOL-approved insurance company. Currently, DOD contractors pay over 76% of their DBA insurance premiums to AIG. CNA's Continental Casualty Company holds single provider contracts for USACE and JCC-IA claims, receiving nearly 14% of DOD insurance premiums. ACE USA receives over 6% of DOD premiums. Department of the Army contracts are responsible for 69% of DOD's DBA insurance premiums, while Department of the Navy contracts account for 23% of premiums. Activities in Iraq and Afghanistan make up 88% of DOD's DBA insurance premiums, with KBR contracts holding the largest share. A pilot DBA project was awarded to CNA in 2005, covering activities until 2008. The USACE pilot program for DBA insurance coverage began in December 2005 and was extended through March 2008, resulting in estimated savings of over $19 million to the federal government. The program was extended through September 2008, with a new contract awarded to CNA's Continental Casualty Company in October 2008. Richard Ginman projected that the program's success could lead to it becoming a permanent DOD program. The USACE pilot program for DBA insurance coverage, which began in December 2005 and was extended through March 2008, is likely to become a permanent DOD program. The program's goal was to provide data for a formal business case to determine its expansion Army or DoD-wide. The Army Audit Agency is reviewing the results to decide if the program should be permanently placed at USACE and extended in the Army. Once the review is complete, USACE will develop a business case for further evaluation. Federal contractors working overseas must purchase workers' compensation insurance or self-insure, with costs passed on to the government in cost-plus contracts. Comparing DBA insurance costs between USACE, DOS, and USAID contractors shows limited competition, with CNA's Continental Casualty Company being the sole bidder. USAID contractors currently pay the lowest DBA insurance costs. Currently, USAID contractors pay the lowest DBA insurance premiums for services, construction, and security. The competitive market for DBA insurance for non-USACE DOD contracts results in lower premiums than are paid by USACE under its single insurer system. The weighted average premium for competitive market DOD contracts is $5.30 per $100 in covered payroll, compared to $8.32 for USACE contracts. The Department of Defense (DOD) pays lower premiums for DBA insurance compared to the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) system. In Iraq and Afghanistan, DOD premiums are $5.64 per $100, while USACE premiums are $8.64. Outside of these areas, DOD's competitive market premiums are still cheaper than USACE premiums. The Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP) was established by the Department of the Army in 1985 to manage civilian contractors supporting DOD missions during war and military mobilizations. The LOGCAP program, established in 1985, provides combat support and service support to military forces. It has faced scrutiny since the start of OIF, particularly regarding oversight, waste, fraud, and financial mismanagement in Iraq. Concerns also exist about the DOD's ability to manage large logistical contracts. Congressional worries about the lack of transparency and oversight of costs under the DBA insurance program have been driven by these issues. Recent assessments from the GAO, DOD's IG, and the SIGIR highlight a lack of federal oversight and accountability for funds spent on Iraq contracting. An audit by the DOD IG found that $7.8 billion out of $8.2 billion spent in Iraq lacked proper documentation. DOD officials disclosed that $1.4 billion in commercial payments lacked necessary justification and documentation. Additionally, a $320 million cash payment was made without proper justification. The U.S. Army Audit Agency initiated an audit of the DBA program in early 2007. The U.S. Army Audit Agency initiated an audit of the DBA program due to factors like program complexity, rising costs, and government efforts to reduce expenses. The audit report revealed that KBR paid $284.3 million in DBA premiums from FY2003 to FY2005, with premiums increasing significantly each year. DBA insurance costs were a significant part of the overall LOGCAP contract. Total DBA costs rose from FY2003 to FY2005, but premiums as a percentage of total payroll fluctuated. The audit found that Iraq and Kuwait's DBA premiums increased from FY2003 to FY2004, then declined in FY2005 and FY2006. The audit also noted inconsistencies in rate fluctuations and lower accident rates reported by the LOGCAP contractor compared to the industry average. Despite this, the Department of the Army paid significantly more in DBA premiums than expected claims, with only 26% of premiums going towards actual claims and potential future claims. The audit found that between FY2003 and FY2005, there were $73.1 million in DBA claims and potential future claims. USAAA attributed the high premiums to basing them on total payroll costs, including overtime and hazard pay, while DBA benefits were only based on base pay. KBR paid $23.1 million in premiums for hazard pay incentives, with a portion going towards salary above the benefit cap. This resulted in KBR essentially paying insurance on payroll that may not be replaced by DBA disability benefits. The Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) audited KBR's costs for DBA insurance under LOGCAP in 2003. DCAA found no evidence of competitive bidding for DBA insurance or verification of labor costs, making it unable to determine the reasonableness of the rates paid by KBR. The DCAA audit of KBR's DBA insurance under LOGCAP in 2003 revealed that KBR was not verifying actual labor costs of subcontractors, leading to paying DBA premiums on estimated costs. The DCAA recommended that the Department of the Army consider reimbursement for some DBA insurance costs billed by KBR. Congressional concerns have been raised regarding the overall cost and variability of DBA insurance in current military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Concerns have been raised over the cost and variability of DBA premiums paid, the basis for DBA premiums, costs to the federal government, contractor selection of DBA providers, and coordination with the WHCA. In 2006, Congress required the DOD to review DBA procedures and collaborate with DOS and USAID for better overseas military contractor insurance. A 2008 hearing focused on DBA costs in the LOGCAP contract and the potential adoption of a single-source model for DBA insurance by the DOD. Section 843 of the FY2009 National Defense Authorization Act mandates DOD to implement department-wide DBA insurance. The FY2009 National Defense Authorization Act requires DOD to adopt a department-wide DBA insurance provision to minimize costs, tie premium prices to expected claims, minimize risk, and ensure a competitive marketplace. H.R. 5658 outlines policy options for DOD to consider in formulating its DBA strategy, falling into three categories similar to those identified by GAO, CBO, USAAA, and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. These options include using a single contracted source or a limited set of sources for all DOD. Options for DOD DBA contracts include using a single contracted source, a rating system for premiums based on past claims, or having the federal government self-insure. Currently, DOS, USAID, and USACE use single-source contracts for DBA insurance. The comparison of premiums for DBA insurance among different government agencies shows that DOD pays lower average premiums than USACE overall, but the highest DOD premiums are double those of USACE. Both DOS and USAID have lower negotiated premium rates under their single-source contracts compared to USACE. A report found that underwriting gains were higher for independently negotiated DBA contracts than for single-source contracts used by DOS and USAID. The CBO estimates that implementing a single-source model for all DOD DBA insurance could save $33 million in the first year and $362 million over 10 years. However, challenges may arise due to the size and complexity of DOD contracts compared to DOS and USAID. Only one insurance carrier bid for coverage under the LOGCAP contract, and previous attempts to find a single carrier for all DBA contracts in Iraq were unsuccessful. The four largest DBA insurers oppose a single-source contract system and would not bid for such a contract if offered. The CBO estimates that a single-source model for DOD DBA insurance could save money, but challenges exist due to the size and complexity of DOD contracts. USACE reports administrative costs even with a single source for DBA insurance. USAAA found that premiums paid by KBR for DBA insurance did not reflect expected claims or risks. USAAA found that KBR's DBA insurance premiums did not align with expected claims or risks, despite the company's low accident rates. Experience rating could help adjust premiums based on past claim rates, bringing them more in line with the risks faced by contractors. This system is common in the insurance industry and workers' compensation systems, allowing for adjustments based on claims history to reflect the actual insurance risk. The difficulty in assessing factors used to set current DBA premiums is compounded by fluctuations in premiums charged under the LOGCAP program. Determining whether a claim should be paid under the DBA or WHCA adds complexity, as seen in concerns over increased DBA claims due to a plane crash. The federal government may cover certain incidents under the WHCA instead of the insurer under the DBA. The federal government may find it difficult to obtain insurance carriers using retrospective rating plans for DBA insurance premiums in countries with war risk hazards. One option for DBA insurance reform is for the federal government to become the sole insurer and cover all administrative and claim costs. Having the federal government self-insure for DBA insurance would eliminate the need for insurance premiums and cover all administrative and claim costs. Benefits would be paid from a trust fund similar to FECA and WHCA programs, with the option to administer the program internally or through a third-party administrator. This approach could potentially reduce costs significantly. Having the federal government self-insure for DBA insurance under the LOGCAP contract could lead to cost savings and eliminate issues with premium loading. This approach would also simplify claims processing by having all claims paid by the government directly. The current process of reimbursing insurers for expenses has resulted in significant costs that do not directly benefit claimants. The current system of reimbursing insurers for expenses under the DBA has led to higher costs than compensating claimants. Claimants often face delays and obstacles from insurers before their cases are transferred to the DOL. This process can be burdensome for claimants with clear WHCA cases. The current system of reimbursing insurers for expenses under the DBA has led to delays for claimants, including those with clear WHCA cases. Federal self-insurance for DBA hazards would change the program's private nature and go against trends in state workers' compensation programs. The DOD's 2009 report to Congress on DBA insurance alternatives highlighted the potential moral hazard of a self-insurance system. Contracting firms without financial stake in employee safety may take risks without consequences. DOD reviewed four DBA insurance alternatives in response to NDAA Section 843. These alternatives were evaluated based on six criteria. The DOD evaluated four DBA insurance alternatives based on six criteria from NDAA Section 843. The analysis resulted in the highest rankings for Alternative A: improvements to the existing open-market DBA system; and Alternative D: federal self-insurance with third-party administration. The DOD evaluated four DBA insurance alternatives based on six criteria from NDAA Section 843. Alternative A focused on improving the existing open-market system to minimize costs and risks, while Alternative D suggested federal self-insurance with third-party administration for a competitive marketplace. However, the DOD report's focus on DOD contractors may limit its applicability to other federal agencies like DOS and USAID. The DOD analysis of four DBA insurance alternatives was evaluated based on six criteria, including considerations for a competitive marketplace and ease of policy implementation. The study may have been biased against options like self-insurance or limited-source contracts that do not support competition but could still be viable policy choices for Congress. The DOD report suggests four improvements to the current DBA insurance system, including providing comprehensive data to all approved carriers to address competitive disadvantages. The DOD recommends establishing a national clearinghouse for loss and cost data in DBA insurance. They also suggest giving the DOL authority to create assigned risk pools for small contractors and requiring insurance carriers to separate pricing for DBA insurance. Additionally, a single DOD contact should be established for country-waivers under the DBA program."
