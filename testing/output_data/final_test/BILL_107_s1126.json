    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Broadband Deployment and Competition Enhancement Act of 2001\". Congress finds that broadband services should be subject to little or no regulation to promote competitive markets, ensure deregulatory parity, and avoid inhibiting the development of a competitive market. Facilities used for broadband services, like packet switching, are widely available in the market and should not be considered a network element for common carriers. Access to essential facilities should be maintained. It is crucial for the economic development of the United States that all areas have access to high-speed Internet and broadband services. Common carrier regulation will not promote broadband deployment but hinder it. Federal and State regulatory agencies have followed a regulatory scheme for broadband services, which needs to be reversed. The Act aims to accelerate broadband deployment nationwide, achieve deregulatory parity among providers, and reduce government regulation of broadband services. SEC. 262. DEPLOYMENT OF BROADBAND SERVICES. Part II of title II of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to include this new section. The section applies to an incumbent local exchange carrier if they notify the Commission. The carrier is exempt from certain requirements for optical fiber facilities used for residential service if deployed in specific conditions. The incumbent local exchange carrier is required to coordinate with other carriers for access to rights of way. They may also be required to provide an existing copper loop to another carrier upon request. Additionally, the carrier is exempt from certain requirements under section 251(c) for competition enhancement. The incumbent local exchange carrier must provide collocation at its central offices for equipment used in advanced services, as per Commission rules. Collocation is not required for equipment in remote terminals for advanced services. The incumbent local exchange carrier must provide advanced service equipment collocation in remote terminals within 5 years of the Broadband Deployment and Competition Enhancement Act of 2001, excluding collocation inside the terminal's existing equipment. The incumbent local exchange carrier or its affiliate may use any technology to provide advanced services to customers, with exemption if not feasible. Retail advanced service rates are not regulated by government authorities. Enforcement of regulations for incumbent local exchange carriers includes consequences for failure to comply with build-out requirements and loop provisioning rules. Failure to meet specified deadlines results in the cessation of certain regulations for the carrier. The incumbent local exchange carrier may face consequences if found to have willfully and materially failed to comply with collocation or loop provisioning rules, causing harm to competitors. The burden of proof lies with the complainant in such cases. Additionally, if a carrier fails to comply, certain regulations may cease to apply. If a State determines that a carrier has not complied with regulations, the carrier can petition for reinstatement of certain rules. If the State later finds that the carrier has fully complied, the rules will be reinstated. If the State fails to make a determination within 90 days of the petition, the rules will be reinstated. The term 'incumbent local exchange carrier' is defined in section 251(h). 'Customer premises' refers to a customer's property and adjacent easements. 'Packet switching capability' is defined in section 51.319(c)(4) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulation. The term 'remote terminal' in the telecommunications industry refers to a point in a local exchange carrier's network where advanced services are deployed. Advanced services include high-speed internet access with a minimum speed of 364 kilobits per second. SEC. 4. AMENDMENT. Section 251(c)(3) of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to exempt incumbent local exchange carriers from converting special access circuits provided before June 1, 2001. SEC. 5. REGULATORY PARITY. The Federal Communications Commission must identify and address any disparities in regulations for advanced service providers and high-speed Internet access within 6 months of this Act. Within a year, regulations must be modified to eliminate any identified disparities unless deemed necessary for the public interest. Biennial reviews will be conducted to ensure regulatory parity. The Federal Communications Commission is required to determine if any disparities in regulations for advanced service providers and high-speed Internet access should continue to apply in the public interest. If not, regulations must be modified to eliminate such differences. Advanced service is defined as high-speed Internet access service according to the Communications Act of 1934."
