    "content": "The \"Identity Theft Protection Act of 2006\" may be cited as the short title. It includes provisions for the protection of data through security freeze measures. The Fair Credit Reporting Act is amended to include a new section on protection of data through security freeze. Consumers can request a security freeze on their consumer report to block the release of information. The consumer reporting agency must disclose the process of placing and removing the security freeze and explain the potential consequences. The Fair Credit Reporting Act allows consumers to request a security freeze on their consumer report, preventing the release of information without authorization. Third parties can be informed of the security freeze, and if a credit application is made, the freeze remains until removed or temporarily suspended. A security freeze can be placed on a consumer report, which will remain until the consumer requests its removal. The freeze can be removed by contacting the consumer reporting agency either in writing or by telephone. The agency can only remove the freeze if requested by the consumer or if there was a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer. If the agency intends to remove the freeze due to a misrepresentation, they must notify the consumer. Consumer reporting agencies must promptly place a security freeze on a consumer's report upon request, within 5 business days. The freeze can be temporarily suspended by the consumer specifying start and end dates. If the agency intends to remove the freeze, they must notify the consumer beforehand in writing. Consumer reporting agencies must promptly place a security freeze on a consumer's report upon request, within 5 business days. The agency should also remove or temporarily suspend the freeze within 3 business days upon the consumer's request. If the consumer asks, other covered entities must be notified within 3 days of the freeze being placed, removed, or temporarily suspended. Consumer reporting agencies must place, remove, or temporarily suspend a security freeze on a consumer report within 3 business days of receiving the request. They must also send a written confirmation to the consumer within 10 business days. Consumer reporting agencies must comply with regulations when placing, removing, or temporarily suspending a security freeze on a consumer report. Proper identification is required from the consumer for these actions. There are exceptions to this rule, such as when a consumer credit report is used by specific entities. The curr_chunk discusses entities that can access a consumer's financial information, including prospective assignees, law enforcement agencies, child support agencies, and the Department of Health and Human Services. Entities authorized to access consumer financial information include the Department of Health and Human Services, State agencies, IRS, State taxing authorities, and entities administering credit file monitoring subscriptions. Consumer reporting agencies can charge a reasonable fee for placing or temporarily suspending a security freeze on a consumer's credit report. The fee amount is determined by the Commission and takes into account prevailing state law fees before the Identity Theft Protection Act of 2006. The Identity Theft Protection Act of 2006 prohibits consumer reporting agencies from charging a fee for placing, removing, or temporarily suspending a security freeze for identity theft victims or those affected by a data breach. The Identity Theft Protection Act of 2006 prohibits consumer reporting agencies from changing certain official information in a consumer report without written confirmation to the consumer within 30 days if a security freeze is in place. The Identity Theft Protection Act of 2006 prohibits consumer reporting agencies from making technical modifications to a consumer's official information without written confirmation within 30 days. This includes changes to name, address, and other details. Additionally, certain entity exemptions exist for agencies that act as resellers of credit information and do not maintain a permanent database of consumer information. The Identity Theft Protection Act of 2006 prohibits consumer reporting agencies from making unauthorized changes to a consumer's information. Certain entities, such as check services or fraud prevention companies, are exempt from placing security freezes on consumer reports. The Identity Theft Protection Act of 2006 prohibits consumer reporting agencies from sharing consumer information with depository institutions for account review purposes. The amendment will take effect after a 6-month period from the enactment of the Act."
