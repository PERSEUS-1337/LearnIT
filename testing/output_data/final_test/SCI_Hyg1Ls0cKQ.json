    "content": "Learning representations of data is crucial in machine learning. While GAN has improved data representations, it faces challenges like unstable training and high computational overhead. GAN lacks control over desired features and scalability due to hidden data manifold. A novel GAN model, LSC-GAN, is proposed to address these issues by controlling latent semantic representation for efficient data generation. Unlike traditional GANs, LSC-GAN defines explicit distributions to generate data based on desired features, improving scalability. The proposed method involves using a VAE to define distributions for latent variables and modify the loss function to map data into a pre-defined latent space. The decoder of VAE is used as the generator in LSC-GAN to generate data with desired features efficiently. Experiments on the CelebA dataset validate the effectiveness of this approach in stable and efficient data generation. The proposed method utilizes a VAE to define distributions for latent variables and modify the loss function to map data into a pre-defined latent space. The model achieves a high compression ratio and can generate data with desired features efficiently. This approach has been validated through experiments on the CelebA dataset. The auto-encoder (VAE) and GAN models construct explicit and implicit densities, respectively, to generate data from hidden manifolds. Manual data structuring is costly, so automatic structuring is needed. Generative models only produce data from latent variables, making it difficult to control the generated data. Previous research addressed this by generating data first and identifying feature distributions in the latent space. This latent space can be deceptive in representing specific features of interest. The proposed model aims to address issues with generative models by generating data with specific features and a higher compression rate. It is based on VAE and GAN, modifying the loss function to generate data following specific feature distributions. The proposed model addresses issues with generative models by generating data with specific features and a higher compression rate. It utilizes an auto-encoder model to create a more efficient latent space distribution, allowing for easier recognition of manifolds and production of neutral features. The proposed model improves the stability of LSC-GAN with LSC-VAE through weight initialization. It achieves conditional generation without additional parameters by controlling the latent space. The model automatically learns to process data continuously through latent space control and achieves an efficient compression rate. The paper reviews related works in Section 2 and presents the LSC-GAN model in Section 3. Performance evaluation is discussed in Section 4. In Section 5, the conclusion and discussion are presented. Research works on data generation, including text, grammar, and images, are categorized into only generation, conditioned generation, and transforming data for different features. Generative models like VAE and GAN are fundamental, with variations like DCGAN and EBGAN introduced for improved performance. Recently, researchers have been focusing on setting conditions on the data they generate. Some studies have introduced methods like conditional VAE (CVAE) and vector quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE) to control the type of generated data. However, challenges remain in continuously controlling latent space and analyzing the manifold of data when using a combination of VAE and GAN in generative models. To improve data generation, researchers have explored models like conditional GAN (CGAN), InfoGAN, and PPGN. These models allow for the creation of specific features in generated images by manipulating latent space. However, challenges persist in understanding and controlling latent space. To address this, a new model is proposed to generate desired features from a trained latent space in LSC-VAE. Studies have explored disentangled representation learning GAN for pose-invariant face recognition, matching latent space of text and images, and translating text to image. Models like CycleGAN, DiscoGAN, and StarGAN have been used to discover cross-domain relations and perform multiple translation tasks with one model. However, challenges remain in generating new data without input data and controlling the size of latent space. The proposed method aims to generate conditioned data with specific characteristics using a modified VAE called LSC-VAE. The model consists of two phases: initializing latent space and generating data. The LSC-VAE is trained with L prior to project data into desired positions in the latent space, and the trained decoder is used as a generator for LSC-GAN to generate data with corresponding features. The LSC-VAE is trained to project data into a specific location in latent space and reconstruct compressed data. The generator (G) of LSC-GAN uses the decoder of LSC-VAE. G and discriminator (D) are trained simultaneously to produce data similar to real data. Auto-encoder, particularly VAE, is commonly used for unsupervised learning of complex distributions. The manifold constructed is hidden due to lack of supervision. The proposed LSC-VAE model learns to project data into a specific location in latent space and compresses it. It consists of two modules for encoding and decoding data, with a prior imposed on the latent distribution. The latent space is controlled by choosing specific values for z i, allowing for the generation of data with multiple features. The LSC-VAE model aims to project data into a defined latent space for compression. It utilizes a loss function involving Kullback-Leibler divergence and reconstruction error. This approach allows for the generation of data with multiple features, making it suitable for initializing GAN. The effectiveness of LSC-VAE in LSC-GAN is demonstrated in the following section. The LS-GAN aims to reduce the gap between real and fake data distributions by adversarially training G and D. It utilizes a least squares objective function. LSC-GAN, based on LSC-VAE, initializes a latent space to control data generation. The encoder from LSC-VAE ensures the generated data has desired features by projecting back to the latent space for training. The encoder in LS-GAN projects back to latent space to minimize the difference between where data is generated and where compressed data is projected. Pre-training G with the decoder of LSC-VAE helps stabilize the learning process. Training G with equation 8 using the LSC-VAE decoder can achieve the goal of GAN. The LSC-VAE aims to reach a stable goal of GAN by ensuring that the probability distribution of generated data matches the real data distribution. The GAN reaches Nash equilibrium when the generator and discriminator reach optimal points. The Nash equilibrium of the LSC-GAN is defined by equations 9 and 10, where fully trained G and D are denoted as G* and D*. Theorem 1 states that if the data distribution is close to the generated data distribution, the Nash equilibrium is reached. The proposed GAN reaches Nash equilibrium and converges to optimal points when the data distribution is close to the generated data distribution. The method is useful for initializing the generative model weights and efficient in learning GAN. Theorem 2 states that a model is well-trained if the loss function gradient is close to zero. The proposed learning process is validated using the celebA dataset, a large-scale face attributes dataset with 14 attributes. Images are resized to 64x64 and 20 dimensions are assigned to each feature. The performance of the model is verified using 162,769 images. The proposed model generates images with specific features using LSC-GAN and latent variables. Images are transformed based on different features, demonstrating the model's ability to understand and generate data. The model is tested by generating images between random images to show its understanding of features. The LSC-GAN model can generate images with inverse-features by understanding and transforming latent variables. It automatically learns and generates features like 'pale skin', 'smile', and 'mustache' based on the input data. The proposed model can deduce negative features by itself, even when trained only on positive features. A subjective test was conducted to evaluate the quality of generated data from DCGAN, EBGAN, and the proposed GAN models. 30 subjects evaluated 25 generated images each, scoring them on a scale from very low to very high. The model not only generates images based on input conditions but also compresses efficiently. The proposed model, LSC-GAN, has the best compression rate compared to others, as shown in TAB1. It addresses issues in generative models and can generate data based on input conditions efficiently. The LSC-VAE helps in initializing weights and achieving good performance in small latent spaces. The proposed LSC-GAN model efficiently compresses data and generates it based on input conditions. It deals with features continuously, compresses data efficiently, and can be extended to various datasets. Future work includes conducting more experiments with different parameters to confirm model stability and reducing the dimension of the latent space. The encoder can also be used as a classifier."
