    "content": "Subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include chapters on computation of taxable income, determination of tax liability, exempt organizations, and withholding. Chapter 1 defines nonbusiness taxable income, business receipts, cost of business inputs, cost of capital equipment, structures, and land, and business taxable income. The term \"nonbusiness taxable income\" includes all compensation and any income other than compensation. Compensation encompasses cash amounts paid by an employer or received by an employee, such as wages, salaries, pensions, bonuses, prizes, and awards. It also includes the cash equivalent of financial instruments given to an employee and certain payments for injuries or damages. Compensation excludes reimbursements for business expenses. The nonbusiness taxable income includes compensation like wages, salaries, pensions, bonuses, prizes, and awards. It also covers cash equivalents of financial instruments and certain injury or damage payments. Business expenses reimbursed by the employer are excluded. Additionally, income from the sale of the taxpayer's principal residence is not included in the taxable income. \"SEC. 102. BUSINESS RECEIPTS DEFINED.\" Business receipts are the revenue generated by a business through the sale or exchange of products or services in the United States. This includes gross revenue from sales, fees, commissions, rents, royalties, and the market value of goods and services provided to owners or employees. The market value of goods and services provided to depositors, insurance policyholders, and others with a financial claim upon the business is included in business receipts. SEC. 103 defines the cost of business inputs as purchases of goods, services, and materials for business purposes, including actual amounts paid, market value of inputs brought into the US, and reasonable travel and entertainment expenses. Exclusions are purchases of goods and services for employees or owners unless included in business receipts. SEC. 104 defines the cost of capital equipment, structures, and land as purchases made for business purposes, including market value at entry into the US. SEC. 105 defines business taxable income as receipts minus business inputs, employee compensation, and the cost of capital assets. CHAPTER 2 outlines tax liability determination with sections on personal allowance, nonbusiness tax, and business tax. The personal allowance for a taxpayer in any taxable year is the sum of allowance amounts for the taxpayer, spouse (if filing jointly), and dependents. The allowance amount for an individual is $4,000, adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index. Special rules apply for marital status and household classification. The taxpayer's home can be considered a household if it is the main residence of a dependent, who can be a son, stepson, daughter, stepdaughter, mother, or father, and for whom the taxpayer provides more than half of the support for a taxable year. The tax code imposes a nonbusiness tax on individuals' nonbusiness taxable income, with rates of 15% for income below a certain limit and 25% for income exceeding that limit. The limit is $100,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly, heads of household, and surviving spouses, and $50,000 for other taxpayers. Each sole proprietorship, partnership, and corporation is considered a business under the tax code. Businesses pay a tax of 19% of their taxable income, or zero if it is negative. They can file multiple tax returns for subsidiaries, with all receipts reported together. Negative income can be carried forward to offset future taxes with an interest rate applied. The carryforward of negative income can be augmented based on the average daily yield on 3-month Treasury Bills during the first year, with no limit on the amount or duration. \"Exempt organizations from business tax include state and local governments, educational, religious, charitable, and community service organizations that do not distribute income to owners. Withholding tax is covered in Chapter 4.\" \"Employers, including exempt organizations, must withhold from employee wages and remit to the IRS as per Secretary's tables. Employees receive a tax credit for the amount withheld. Effective for taxable years after December 31, 1993.\""
