    "content": "Services are a crucial part of the U.S. economy, encompassing a wide range of activities like transportation, telecommunications, financial, and professional services. They account for 78% of the U.S. GDP and 82% of private sector full-time employment. U.S. services are a significant component of the economy, accounting for a large portion of GDP and private sector employment. They also play a crucial role in international trade, with $752.4 billion in exports in 2016. Advances in technology have made many services tradable across borders, but barriers still limit their full potential. The United States aims to lower barriers to trade in services through various trade negotiations. Congress plays a significant role in negotiating and implementing trade-liberalizing agreements, including those on services. It establishes trade negotiating objectives and priorities, and must pass legislation to implement trade agreements requiring changes to U.S. law before they can enter into force. This report provides background information and analysis on U.S. trade policy. The report analyzes U.S. international trade in services, policy issues, and trade agreements like NAFTA, TiSA, and T-TIP. Services are complex due to their intangibility and various delivery formats. The WTO has classified four modes of delivery to address this complexity. The World Trade Organization (WTO) classifies four modes of delivery for services to measure trade and government measures in international agreements. U.S. international trade in services is significant for the economy, with a wide range of services delivered through different modes. Trade in services is captured in data for cross-border trade and services sold by local affiliates of foreign companies. In 2016, services accounted for a significant portion of U.S. exports. In 2016, services accounted for a significant portion of U.S. exports and imports. The United States has consistently had surpluses in services trade, offsetting deficits in goods trade. Service providers often establish a presence in the consumer's country through foreign direct investment for direct contact and expert knowledge. Advances in information and communications technology are expected to impact trade in services as virtual delivery via the Internet expands services offered and drives increased demand. In 2015, U.S. firms sold $1,463.5 billion in services to foreigners through their majority-owned foreign affiliates, while foreign firms sold $952.5 billion in services to U.S. residents through their majority-owned foreign affiliates in the United States. The data show that a significant portion of service sales occurs through companies' commercial presence in foreign markets rather than through cross-border trade. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the WTO estimated that in 2009, close to 50% of the value of U.S. exports of manufactured goods was attributable to services inputs, indicating a larger role for services in international trade. Trade statistics may have discrepancies according to an economist at Standard Chartered. An economist at Standard Chartered highlights discrepancies in trade statistics, estimating that services represent 45% of global exports. The United States is a major supplier of services to various regions, with Europe being the largest market. The UK accounted for 9% of US services exports and 10% of imports in 2016, while other European countries received 28% of US exports and contributed 32% of imports. Canada, China, and other Asian countries also played significant roles in US services trade. In 2016, Japan's consumption of U.S. services was similar to China, but Japan imported double the amount of U.S. services. Europe's dominance in U.S. services trade is evident through services provided by multinational corporations (MNCs) and their affiliates. In 2015, 44% of services from U.S. MNCs went to the EU, 25% to Asia, and 8% to Canada. U.S. affiliates of foreign-owned MNCs based in Europe accounted for 56% of services sold to U.S. persons. In 2016, U.S. exports of services covered a diverse range including travel, insurance, financial, intellectual property, telecommunications, and government goods. Travel accounted for the largest percent at 27%, followed by royalties, other business services, transportation, and financial services. Sales of services by U.S.-owned MNCs through their foreign affiliates included wholesale and retail trade services. The OECD and WTO report that services play a significant role in the global economy, with over two-thirds of global GDP and three-quarters of global FDI in advanced economies coming from services. World exports of commercial services reached $4.73 trillion in 2016. Foreign MNCs through their U.S. affiliates also provide a variety of services, with wholesale and retail trade, financial services, professional services, information-related services, and other industries being the main sectors. Manufacturing, mining, and real estate services make up a smaller portion of the services provided. The United States is a major player in global commercial services, with exports and imports totaling $4.73 trillion in 2016. The growth of global value chains has increased interconnectedness in the global economy, providing access to wider markets and potential for increased productivity and efficiency. U.S. firms are leveraging information technology to expand these value chains. Global value chains are expanding using information technology to bring goods and services to market. Over half of global manufacturing imports are intermediate goods within supply chains, while over 75% of services imports are intermediate services. These services include transportation, research, design, engineering, and business services. The value of these services can be captured in trade in value added statistics. Manufacturing and agriculture's consumption of value-added services grows as they become more complex. Global value chains have redefined the role of services in international trade. Global value chains have redefined the role of services in international trade, with over 20% of foreign value added in domestically manufactured goods in many countries. This motivates countries to seek open markets for moving intermediate goods and services. For example, a French wine imported into the United States may use U.S. express delivery services and marketing firms for labels. U.S. firms supplying many world services imply a significant reliance on foreign skills and components. The increased use of Global Value Chains (GVCs) in international trade has led to a greater reliance on foreign skills and components by U.S. firms. This has implications for trade liberalization and the potential economic impact of trade barriers in the service industry. The disaggregation of value chains into smaller modules creates opportunities for specialized firms or small and mid-sized enterprises (SMEs) to focus on specific pieces of the value chain, leading to more efficient access to markets. Expanding through Global Value Chains (GVCs) allows U.S. industries to access markets, labor, and talents globally. However, managing complex supply chains across countries and time zones can be challenging and costly. Analysts warn of potential risks like overreliance on foreign suppliers, intellectual property theft, and exposure to external shocks. Liberalizing trade in services faces barriers within importing countries. The GATS identifies market access barriers for service providers, including restrictions on foreign service suppliers, transactions, legal entities, and foreign capital. Government regulations may unintentionally discriminate against foreign providers, hindering trade. Regulatory rights are essential to protect consumers. Governments regulate professional service providers to protect consumers. Concerns in international trade include discriminatory regulations on foreign service providers that limit market access. Trade barriers for foreign companies often involve establishing a commercial presence through direct investment. The most significant barriers to trade in services are not easily quantifiable, and economists have developed methods to estimate their effects. As restrictions are eliminated, cross-border trade could increase, potentially shifting from local presence requirements to foreign investment. Economists argue that reducing barriers to trade in services can benefit economies. Economists argue that reducing barriers to trade in services can benefit economies in the long term. Opponents of liberalization in trade in services argue that countries may have to give up some regulatory control. The Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE) conducted an analysis on the impact of barriers on services trade, finding that U.S. trade in \"business services\" is lower than expected despite the country's comparative advantage in those services. The PIIE study compared trade profiles of U.S. manufacturing and service firms, finding that only 5% of U.S. business service firms export, despite the country's advantage in this sector. Foreign trade barriers are a major reason for low participation. Increasing the export ratio of business services could boost total U.S. exports by 15%. If more U.S. businesses engage in exporting services, it could have a significant impact on the sector workforce. Nontariff barriers related to digital trade and data flows may restrict what services a firm can offer in a market. Data transfer regulations, such as forced localization barriers, could limit financial transactions and services that a firm can sell in a country. Country-specific data regulations may also discourage U.S. firms from investing in certain markets if they are hindered in exporting data from foreign affiliates to U.S.-based headquarters for analysis. Data localization proponents aim to protect privacy, security, and domestic control, but opponents argue that it may not guarantee security or prevent foreign attacks. Restrictions on digital trade can lead to lost efficiencies and increased costs. Decreasing barriers to cross-border data flows could boost the GDP in the United States. One OECD study shows that restrictive countries import and export less, indicating that restrictions harm trade. The negative impact of trade restrictions on services is evident, affecting both imports and exports. Financial services are particularly affected by limitations such as market entry restrictions. SMEs benefit more from reduced market access barriers compared to larger firms. The United States is relatively open for foreign providers in most sectors, scoring highest in sound recording, motion pictures, and distribution services. The United States is the most open country for sound recording, motion pictures, and distribution services, but has restrictions in air transport, maritime transport, and courier services. The STRI shows the impact of reform efforts, with Indonesia reducing trade restrictiveness in certain sectors in 2016. The U.S. has worked with trading partners to reduce barriers and facilitate trade in services. The United States has been working with trading partners to reduce barriers and facilitate trade in services, including through multilateral rules in the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) administered by the World Trade Organization (WTO). The U.S. has also pursued more comprehensive rules in free trade agreements (FTAs) and may continue services discussions in Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP). The U.S. aims to establish a flexible, rules-based trade regime to increase services flow while allowing governments to regulate sectors. States regulate services, but must comply with federal commitments in international trade agreements. Multilateral negotiations in services trade began over 40 years ago, with Congress pushing for an agreement under GATT in 1974. During the Tokyo Round negotiations in 1979, there was a push for a trade agreement on services under GATT. Despite initial reluctance from developing countries, services were eventually included in the Uruguay Round negotiations in 1986. The GATS was established at the end of the round in 1994, providing a multilateral framework for government policies and regulations in services trade. The GATS, established in 1994, is the only multilateral framework for trade in services among 164 WTO countries. It applies to all services except those under government authority, all government barriers to trade, and all modes of service delivery. The agreement is divided into six parts, defining scope and presenting principles and obligations similar to GATT for goods trade. The GATS, established in 1994, is the only multilateral framework for trade in services among 164 WTO countries. It includes provisions such as most-favored-nation treatment, non-discriminatory treatment, transparency, and market access obligations for members. The GATS, established in 1994, is a multilateral framework for trade in services among 164 WTO countries. It prohibits less favorable treatment than committed, provides market access by limiting government restrictions on foreign service suppliers, requires national treatment for service providers, and allows for further trade barrier reductions through negotiations. The GATS, established in 1994, is a multilateral framework for trade in services among 164 WTO countries. Unlike MFN treatment and other principles, the obligations under Part III apply only to services listed in each member's schedule of commitments. This positive list approach means national treatment and market access obligations do not apply unless specifically committed. Each member's schedule is in an annex to the GATS, with market access commitments at its core. Parts IV-VI are technical elements requiring new negotiations to expand coverage by 2000. The GATS, established in 1994, is a multilateral framework for trade in services among 164 WTO countries. New negotiations were started after 2000 to expand coverage of the agreement. Conflicts between members regarding GATS implementation are handled in the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism. The agreement includes annexes such as MFN exemptions and a \"prudential carve out\" for governments to take prudent actions to protect investors. In 1997, 56 WTO members made commitments on financial services, reflecting existing national regimes. In 1997, 69 WTO members agreed on principles for telecommunications services, including competition safeguards and regulatory transparency. A total of 108 WTO members have committed to facilitating trade in telecommunications services. Article XIX of the GATS required new negotiations on services in 2000, which were later folded into the Doha Development Agenda in 2001. The Doha Round, launched in December 2001, aimed to improve commitments in services negotiations, enhance regulatory transparency for foreign providers, and expand market access in various sectors. Persistent differences between developed and developing countries were observed in negotiations on tariffs and nontariff barriers for goods, services, and agriculture. The Doha Round aimed to address major issues in tariffs and nontariff barriers for goods, services, and agriculture. Developing countries sought reduction of agriculture tariffs and subsidies, while developed countries sought reciprocal trade liberalization and protection for their sectors. The complexity of the services agenda and the number of players involved may have hindered progress in negotiations. The complexity of the services agenda and the number of players involved may have contributed to the lack of progress in the Doha Round negotiations. Exporters face different trade barriers across service sectors, making trade rules formulation challenging. Negotiators struggled to distinguish between protectionist government regulations and those with legitimate purposes. After 14 years, divisions in the Doha Round questioned the viability of the \"single undertaking\" negotiation approach. The 2015 WTO Ministerial in Nairobi failed to reaffirm the continuation of the Doha Round, with some progress made on issues like the LDC Services Waiver. The December 2017 Ministerial did not result in any multilateral agreements, but a joint statement by 60 countries aimed to address domestic regulation, excluding the United States. The group, excluding the United States, is discussing a proposed text similar to TiSA negotiations. Frustration with the Doha Round has led to more bilateral and regional trade agreements focusing on services and foreign direct investment. The US prioritizes services in FTAs with 20 countries, each with varying treatment based on trade relations and agreements. The US FTAs prioritize services with partner countries using a negative list approach for market access and national treatment coverage. This approach covers all services unless specifically listed as exceptions, making it more comprehensive. The negative list approach in US FTAs is considered more comprehensive and flexible than the positive list used in other agreements. It allows any service provider organized under US or partner country laws to be eligible for FTA benefits, potentially benefiting providers from non-party countries. In US FTAs, trade in services is a key focus with specific chapters on cross-border trade. The agreements require nondiscriminatory treatment for services originating in each other's territory, prohibiting restrictions on service providers and transactions. The US FTAs focus on trade in services with specific chapters on cross-border trade, requiring nondiscriminatory treatment for services. The agreements prohibit restrictions on service providers and transactions, including provisions on foreign direct investment and intellectual property rights. Many FTAs also have separate provisions on specific service categories prioritized in US trade policy. The US FTAs prioritize specific service categories in trade policy, including financial services and telecommunication services. Financial services encompass insurance, banking, and related services, allowing for restrictions for prudential reasons. Telecommunication services ensure nondiscriminatory access to public services and prevent anticompetitive practices by dominant domestic suppliers. The US FTAs prioritize specific service categories in trade policy, including financial services and telecommunication services. Telecommunication services ensure nondiscriminatory access to public services and prevent anticompetitive practices by dominant suppliers. FTAs include provisions for e-commerce to ensure fair treatment of electronically supplied services and prohibit forced localization. The FTAs require partner countries to provide notice of investigations affecting service providers, allowing for comments and appeals. Regulatory heterogeneity across markets can increase operational costs and limit firms' ability to do business abroad. Regulatory cooperation in trade agreements aims to address differing regulatory regimes for services, facilitating market opportunities for service providers. The U.S.-South Korea FTA and Trade Promotion Authority legislation emphasize expanding competitive market opportunities for the United States in services trade. The U.S. Congress aims to expand competitive market opportunities for the United States through trade agreements, including digital trade and cross-border data flows. They support reducing trade barriers through plurilateral agreements and eliminating localization regulations in trade agreements. The TPP was a proposed FTA among 12 Asia-Pacific countries. The TPP was a proposed FTA among 12 Asia-Pacific countries, including the United States, to reduce and eliminate tariff and nontariff barriers on goods, services, and agriculture. The United States decided not to ratify the agreement, ending the TPP's potential entry into force. The 11 remaining TPP countries are concluding a revised Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement. Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam are finalizing a revised Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) without the United States. President Trump may consider joining a better agreement in the future. Negotiations for a Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) involving 23 WTO members, including the US, aim to liberalize trade in services. The Trump Administration has not officially stated a position on TiSA. The Trump Administration has not officially stated a position on the continuation of TiSA negotiations, but USTR Robert Lighthizer indicated potential support. TiSA participants are guided by the \"Elements of Political Guidance\" from the 8th WTO ministerial in 2011, allowing negotiations outside the single undertaking to achieve Doha Round objectives. The plurilateral approach offers advantages for services trade liberalization, including flexibility in agreement scope and aiming to reduce trade barriers. The TiSA negotiations aim to expand trade and services by reducing barriers beyond GATS commitments. Critics point out drawbacks like the absence of key emerging economies like Brazil, India, and China. A plurilateral services pact may reduce the credibility of multilateral trade negotiations. The agreement should align with GATS and have five basic objectives for negotiations. The TiSA negotiations aim to expand trade and services by reducing barriers beyond GATS commitments. The agreement should align with GATS and have five basic objectives for negotiations, including broad participation, comprehensive scope, improved market access, new disciplines, and consideration of least developed countries' development objectives. Market access obligations are negotiated under a positive list, while national treatment obligations are negotiated under a negative list. The TiSA negotiations aim to expand trade in services by reducing barriers beyond GATS commitments. Participants agreed to conduct negotiations on a non-MFN basis to avoid \"free-riders.\" U.S. business community supports TiSA for greater market access in trade in services. The TiSA negotiations aim to expand trade in services beyond GATS commitments. Opponents argue it should be used to reverse infringements of GATS provisions. 21 rounds of negotiations have occurred since April 2013. The agreement would likely include a core text and sections on transparency, movement of persons for business purposes, domestic regulation, and government procurement. Sectoral annexes are said to cover air transport, e-commerce, maritime transport, telecommunications, and financial services. The final structure of TiSA is not yet decided, with contention over the inclusion of \"new services\" under nondiscrimination obligations. The e-commerce annex covers various provisions, but discussions on data flows with the EU have not started, creating an obstacle. The United States separately proposed a ban on data localization for financial services. The negotiations for the Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) include discussions on data localization for financial services and professional services without explicit mutual recognition agreements. China's interest in joining TiSA has caused differences among participants, with the US expressing concerns about China's readiness. The agreement is being structured to potentially become multilateral in the future and applicable to all WTO members. The TiSA negotiations aim to create multilateral rules on trade in services for the future. Discussions to renegotiate NAFTA began in 2017, supporting economic integration in North America. NAFTA includes chapters on services trade, telecommunications, and financial services, unlike TiSA which may employ a different approach for liberalization. The Trump Administration aims to \"modernize\" NAFTA through renegotiation by updating provisions in services and digital trade. U.S. stakeholders see this as an opportunity to gain greater market access in sectors like financial services and express delivery to Canada and Mexico. Regulatory harmonization and improved regional trade facilitation are also key goals. The Trump Administration aims to \"modernize\" NAFTA through renegotiation by updating provisions in services and digital trade. Canada and Mexico also aim to further open U.S. markets, but stakeholders voice concerns about disrupting existing supply chains. Some suggest using TPP provisions as a starting point for NAFTA negotiations. New services provisions could include removing barriers to electronic payment card services, electronic signatures, and mobile telecommunications. The U.S.-South Korean FTA (KORUS FTA) entered into force on March 15, 2012, with industry representatives calling it \"the gold standard\" for services treatment. The Trump Administration requested a review of the KORUS FTA agreement's services provisions, aiming to address concerns about implementation and effectiveness. The review will focus on implementation issues related to financial and other services, seeking transparency into South Korean trading and regulatory systems. Each side agreed to publish relevant regulations, administrative decisions, and proposed regulations under KORUS. The KORUS financial services annex allows for data transfer between the U.S. and South Korea, addressing concerns about globalization and data storage for multinational companies. Under KORUS, the United States and South Korea revised guidelines and rules for data transfers, addressed concerns about state-owned enterprises in services trade, and agreed to reduce restrictions on foreign ownership of telecommunications companies. They also formed a professional services working group to develop mutual standards. The United States and South Korea formed a professional services working group to develop mutual standards for licensing professional service providers. Challenges in opening up the legal services market were noted, with concerns raised about recent legislation impacting benefits under KORUS. South Korea has commitments to open its legal services market to foreign law firms in various free trade agreements. The potential T-TIP agreement could address barriers in transatlantic trade in services, but negotiations are currently on hold. Negotiations for the T-TIP agreement are currently on hold, with the Trump Administration not indicating when they will resume. One key point of debate is the treatment of financial services, with the US pushing for market access but opposing discussions on financial regulation. The EU, on the other hand, wants to include both market access and regulatory cooperation in T-TIP. US concerns stem from potential impacts on financial services regulation under the Dodd-Frank Act, preferring to handle regulatory cooperation through bilateral dialogues or multilateral forums like the G-20. The T-TIP negotiations are currently on hold under the Trump Administration. One key point of debate is the treatment of financial services, with the US pushing for market access and opposing discussions on financial regulation. The EU wants to include both market access and regulatory cooperation in T-TIP. Both sides have different approaches to services provisions, with the US seeking improved market access in the EU and the EU using a positive list approach in its FTA with South Korea. The 10th round of T-TIP negotiations in July 2015 saw the EU publishing its initial textual proposal. In the 10th round of T-TIP negotiations in July 2015, the EU proposed a positive list of commitments for services, investment, and e-commerce. The proposal covers various sectors such as computer and telecommunications services, international transport, and business services. It excludes public services like health and education, as well as audiovisual services under a \"cultural exception.\" The EU also addresses worker mobility with a draft framework for mutual recognition of professional qualifications. A mutual recognition agreement would cover licensing requirements for all 50 states and EU member states, excluding data flows and online consumer protection. U.S.-EU cross-border data flows are significant, with U.S. exports of ICT services to the EU at $178 billion in 2016. The absence of these areas in the EU proposal has disappointed some in the U.S. business community. The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield agreement could aid discussions on data protection in T-TIP, despite facing challenges in court. The record on liberalization of trade in services through reciprocal agreements is mixed. The WTO's efforts to expand multilateral rules on trade in services have stalled, leading to the rise of sector-specific plurilateral agreements like TiSA. The United States is pursuing a services-specific plurilateral agreement with the EU and Japan, among others, as an alternative path forward. The United States is focusing on services trade liberalization in FTAs with limited countries, facing complex negotiations. Congress and negotiators need to address consistency with U.S. trade objectives and work with the Administration on pending agreements like NAFTA, KORUS, TiSA, and T-TIP. The United States is considering new bilateral FTA negotiations with specific countries and examining the impact of proposed agreements on the economy and stakeholders. There is a focus on services trade liberalization in FTAs, with a need to develop a model services agreement to address advancements in information technology and the changing services sector. Congress may conduct hearings to examine implementation of past agreements and potential new negotiations. The text discusses the need for more comprehensive data collection in the services sector for international trade. It also raises questions about regulatory cooperation with trading partners and involving state regulators in trade negotiations."
