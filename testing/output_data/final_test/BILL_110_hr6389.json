Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System, created by Congress in 1982, consists of specific areas of undeveloped coastal land and aquatic habitats. With 856 units covering 3.1 million acres, the System has been expanded and modified through 17 public laws since 1990 to correct mapping errors and ensure fairness. The State of South Carolina has a coastal management program to protect sensitive areas from development. Regulations initially prohibited development on Kiawah Island's western end, but a setback line established in 1999 allowed for development in Captain Sam's Inlet Unit M08. In 2005, the Town of Kiawah Island's Town Council authorized development in Captain Sam's Inlet Unit M08 to enhance fish and wildlife habitat value in the area. Kiawah Island is known for responsible development and provides opportunities to increase ecological health for native species. Congress aims to enhance the ecological value of Captain Sam's Inlet Unit M08 by adding 178 acres and removing 61.5 acres for low-density development, while promoting voluntary ecological enhancement projects. This modification will ensure equal treatment for all area residents. Captain Sam's Inlet Unit M08 at Kiawah Island's western end was created in 1982 and expanded in 1990. It currently consists of 1,182 acres, including 200 acres of fast land and 982 acres of aquatic habitat. A larger unit, Unit M07/M07P or Bird Key, covers the eastern portion of Kiawah Island with 7,094 total acres. The modification of Captain Sam's Inlet Unit M08 expands it by 116 acres, increasing the total size to approximately 1,299 acres. Specific changes include adding 178 acres (25 acres of land and 153 acres of aquatic habitat) and removing 61.5 acres (39 acres for development and 22.5 acres on islands). Additional projects are planned to enhance ecological value. The owners of land added to Captain Sam's Inlet Unit M08 are willing to reduce entitlements for 44 dwelling units and grant conservation easements. Similarly, owners of land being removed from the Unit are willing to reduce entitlements for 460 dwelling units to increase habitat value and reduce allowable density. A privately funded project is being developed to increase the ecological health and habitat value of the modified Captain Sam's Inlet Unit M08 and surrounding areas on Kiawah Island. Consultation with various organizations and conservation groups is ongoing for project design and implementation, aiming to enhance habitats for native fauna and flora species. The project aims to enhance habitats for various species, from plants like Muhlenbergia filipes to animals like the bobcat, piping plover, and painted buntings. SEC. 5. REPLACEMENT OF COASTAL BARRIER RESOURCE SYSTEM MAP FOR CAPTAIN SAM'S INLET UNIT M08 IN CHARLESTON COUNTY, SOUTH CAROLINA. The map dated October 24, 1990, is replaced by a new map dated March 2008. The Secretary of the Interior will keep the replacement map available for inspection."
