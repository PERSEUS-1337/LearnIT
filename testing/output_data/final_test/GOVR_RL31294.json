    "content": "Ensuring the security of the nation's drinking water supplies is a significant challenge due to the large number of water systems and the shared responsibility among federal, state, and local governments, as well as public and private utilities. There are approximately 155,000 public water systems in the US, serving a wide range of populations. Community water systems (CWSs) serve around 292 million people, with some systems serving over 100,000 individuals. Disruption of water supplies could have major impacts due to the various uses they support. The 1996 executive order on critical infrastructure protection identified water supply systems as vital to national security. The President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection highlighted the importance of water availability, pressure, and safety. Threats to water supplies include physical destruction, contamination, and cyber attacks. Drinking water systems were found to have inadequate protection. The 1997 Commission found that water systems lacked protection against chemical or biological contamination and were vulnerable to cyber attacks due to reliance on technology. Information sharing was deemed crucial, leading to the issuance of Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) 63 in 1998 for critical infrastructure protection. President Bush issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HPSD-7) in 2003, designating the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as the lead federal agency for coordinating the protection of the nation's critical infrastructure for the water sector. EPA is responsible for developing tools and training to improve security for community water systems and municipal facilities. The EPA established a Water Security Division to improve security for water utilities and respond to threats. They provide technical assistance and training to the water sector, focusing on antiterrorism measures. EPA has been involved in security-related activities for years, including establishing an information center for drinking water alerts. The EPA established a Water Security Division to improve security for water utilities and respond to threats, including establishing an information center for drinking water alerts. PDD-63 in 1998 aimed to establish an Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC) for critical infrastructure sectors, with the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies leading the effort for water utilities through WaterISAC. The WaterISAC is a system supported by membership fees and EPA grants that gathers, analyzes, and disseminates threat information specific to the water sector. It provides security and disaster preparedness information for drinking water and wastewater utilities. The Water Security Channel (WaterSC) offers free email notifications of water security alerts issued by federal government agencies. EPA, along with water sector partners, provides practical tools and technical assistance to utilities on security matters. In collaboration with AWWARF and Sandia National Laboratories, a project was initiated in 2000 to help utilities assess vulnerabilities and develop risk mitigation plans. After September 11, 2001, a project was expedited and completed in November 2001 to assess vulnerabilities and minimize risks in large water systems. EPA awarded $51 million in grants to community water systems serving over 100,000 people for conducting vulnerability assessments and emergency response plans. Technical assistance has been provided to smaller water systems to address security concerns. The EPA provided training, technical assistance, and guidance documents to address security concerns in water systems serving fewer than 50,000 people. On-site assistance for vulnerability assessment and emergency response planning was offered to small and medium wastewater utilities at no cost. The Response Protocol Toolbox was developed to help public water systems respond to contamination threats and incidents. The EPA developed response guidelines and tools to assist water utilities in managing contamination threats and incidents. Drinking water utilities acted quickly to assess vulnerabilities and improve security of critical infrastructure. The water sector made strides in protecting facilities and systems, focusing on potential attacks with significant health or economic consequences. The report emphasized the need for better threat information in the water sector to prioritize security investments and develop new monitoring capabilities for detecting contaminants in the water supply. Research is required to create real-time monitoring methods and technologies to remove or inactivate contaminants, especially in water already distributed to consumers. EPA has been involved in research projects to enhance water security measures. The EPA conducts research on drinking water treatment systems to remove biological and chemical agents, contaminant fate and transport in water systems, and biodetectors for detecting contaminants. The National Homeland Security Research Center focuses on water infrastructure protection, decontamination, threat assessment, and consequence management. The EPA's Office of Water and NHSRC developed a Water Security Research and Technical Support Action Plan in 2004. The EPA and NHSRC developed a Water Security Research and Technical Support Action Plan in 2004 to protect drinking water and wastewater facilities from terrorist threats. The plan addressed research needs in infrastructure protection, contaminant identification, monitoring systems, decontamination, contingency planning, risk assessment, and communication. Financial resources were not discussed in the plan. The NRC recommended that EPA quantify costs and benefits for research projects in the action plan to improve water security. EPA reported over 100 initiated projects including early warning systems, tracer studies, treatability guides, and detection technologies for water contaminants. The Water Infrastructure Protection Division leads research on detection technologies for water contaminants and biological toxins' impacts on water systems. The Water Security Initiative aims to develop a contamination warning system for drinking water systems through intensive monitoring in selected cities. EPA considers this initiative crucial for meeting water security responsibilities. The EPA's Water Security Initiative is a key element in meeting water security responsibilities under HSPD-9. Congress has partially supported the initiative by providing funds for improving public water supply security since 2001. The Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for FY2002 allocated $175.6 million to EPA for emergency expenses related to the September 11 attacks and counterterrorism activities, with $90 million designated for improving security at EPA laboratories and conducting drinking water vulnerability assessments. During FY2002, EPA allocated $89 million from the emergency supplemental appropriation for security enhancements at drinking water systems. This included grants for vulnerability assessments, emergency response plans, technical assistance, and development of counterterrorism tools. EPA allocated $51 million in water security grants to community water systems serving over 100,000 individuals. Grants were provided for vulnerability assessments, emergency response plans, and security enhancements, with funds up to $115,000 per grant. Utilities could use the grants for in-house or contractor support but not for other purposes. EPA provided $20 million in FY2002 supplemental funds to states for technical assistance and training for small drinking water systems. In FY2003, EPA requested $16.9 million for vulnerability assessments and emergency response plans for small and medium-sized systems, along with $5 million in grants for homeland security coordination. The Consolidated Appropriations Resolution for FY2003 provided this funding, including earmarks for the National Rural Water Association. In FY2004, EPA received $32 million for critical water infrastructure protection, including $5 million for state homeland security grants. This funding supported states' efforts to enhance emergency operations plans, conduct training, and develop detection technology for water security. Additionally, $2 million was allocated for the WaterISAC to provide security information to water systems. In FY2005, EPA requested $5 million for state water security grants and $6.1 million for critical infrastructure protection. The budget justification explained a shift in priorities from vulnerability assessments. Congress provided the requested amount in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2005. The President also requested $44 million for the Water Sentinel Initiative, now called the Water Security Initiative (WSI). EPA received $32 million in FY2004 for water infrastructure protection. The EPA developed the Water Security Initiative (WSI) to meet Homeland Security Directive 9, aiming to establish early warning systems for water contamination in five cities. Congress provided $8.1 million for the initiative in FY2006, with recommendations to clarify goals and seek advice for the program. The committee recommended that EPA develop clear goals for the Water Security Initiative (WSI), seek advice from the Science Advisory Board, and justify the budget request for FY2007. Congress provided $5 million for state water security grants, with the FY2007 budget request including $4.95 million for these grants. Additionally, the request included $41.7 million for the WSI, noting it as an essential component of water security activities to demonstrate an effective contamination warning system for drinking water utilities. The EPA FY2007 funding bill, H.R. 5386, would have provided $16.7 million for the WSI, $25 million less than requested. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $18.13 million for the Water Security Initiative (WSI), $23.6 million less than requested but $10 million above the FY2006 enacted level. The House Appropriations Committee report for H.R. 5386 stated that the recommended funding level included money for one additional WSI pilot project in a highly vulnerable metropolitan area. Congress did not complete action on the appropriations bill, but EPA allocated $27 million for the WSI in the final continuing appropriations resolution for FY2007. EPA requested $25.6 million for FY2008 to support critical water infrastructure, including $21.88 million for the WSI. The EPA proposed $21.88 million for the Water Security Initiative (WSI) to protect critical water infrastructure. The goal is to establish additional pilots by 2008 and provide special assistance to high-priority water systems under the Water Alliance for Threat Reduction program. The House Appropriations Committee recommended reducing the WSI funding by $3.88 million due to budget delays. The EPA requested $21.4 million for the Water Security Initiative (WSI) in FY2009, with plans to support new surveillance and monitoring pilots. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008 provided $11.7 million for the WSI and $4.87 million for state grants after a $10 million decrease recommended by the Senate Appropriations Committee. Both House and Senate committees urged EPA to report on the status of WSI pilot projects. The EPA planned to increase the total number of pilot projects to five in FY2009 to generate necessary data for broad application. They also aimed to establish the Water Laboratory Alliance to aid in confirming and responding to contamination events. Research was proposed to develop methods for detecting contaminants, as most high-concern contaminants lack validated analytical methods. Congress did not pass specific EPA appropriations for FY2009, and funding was generally at FY2008 levels under the 2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act (P.L. 111-8). EPA's FY2010 budget request aimed to eliminate state homeland security grants for drinking water and wastewater systems due to completed actions required by the 2002 Bioterrorism Act. The request included funding for cooperative agreements supporting WSI pilot programs, the Water Alliance for Threat Reduction program, and research on CBR analytical methods and detection software. The Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2010 fully funds the remaining two Water Security Initiative (WSI) pilot projects with $18.6 million for FY2010. The President requested $11.6 million for FY2011 for water security initiatives, including $10.4 million for WSI and $1.2 million for WATR. The funding is primarily for WSI outreach, support, and evaluation activities. The Continuing Appropriations and Surface Transportation Extensions Act, 2011 (P.L. 111-322) continues funding for EPA programs at FY2010 levels through March 4, 2011. Congress has not provided funding in EPA appropriations for grants to water systems for security improvements, but eligible security measures can be funded through the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) program. Measures include facility improvements, securing storage, hiring guards, and enhancing filtration. Approximately $830 million annually is provided for the DWSRF program, but availability for security measures is uncertain due to the program's focus on compliance with federal drinking water regulations. The State Homeland Security Grant Program provides funding for community water systems to enhance security measures, such as training and infrastructure protection. Local public works agencies, including water districts, are eligible for funding, with a focus on supporting first responders. Congress allocated $950 million for each of FY2008 and FY2009 for this program. In 2002, laws were enacted to address critical infrastructure security, including the Homeland Security Act and the Bioterrorism Preparedness Act. The latter aimed to improve drinking water supply security by amending the Safe Drinking Water Act. The Bioterrorism Preparedness Act required water utilities to assess vulnerability to terrorist attacks and submit assessments to EPA. Utilities had to prepare emergency response plans based on assessments within six months. EPA provided guidance for smaller water systems not covered by the act, with large and medium-sized systems achieving 100% compliance. The Bioterrorism Act required water systems to assess vulnerability to terrorist attacks and submit assessments to EPA. Compliance was high, with smaller systems achieving nearly 100% compliance. The act exempted vulnerability assessment details from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and provided protocols for protection. Civil and criminal penalties were in place for inappropriate disclosure. Financial assistance was authorized for water systems to conduct assessments, prepare response plans, and address security enhancements. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 authorized funding for security enhancements and emergency response for water systems. It also allocated funds for EPA to review methods to prevent disruptions in safe water supplies by terrorists. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 consolidated functions of federal agencies into the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) but did not transfer EPA water security functions. The White House issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7) in 2003, designating EPA as the lead agency for protecting the water infrastructure sector from terrorist attacks. Under HSPD-7, DHS is responsible for coordinating national critical infrastructure protection efforts, while EPA is tasked with developing water security tools and training for water systems and wastewater facilities. HSPD-9 further outlined EPA's role in defending water, agriculture, and food systems against attacks and disasters, instructing the development of a surveillance program for early contaminant detection and a network of water quality labs. EPA has been fulfilling these responsibilities through its Water program. The EPA and DHS have separate responsibilities for protecting critical water infrastructure, leading to potential overlap and duplication. To address this, the Water Sector Coordinating Council (WSCC) was established in 2004 to coordinate efforts between the two agencies. In 2005, the Water Sector Government Coordinating Council (GCC) was formed to enable interagency coordination. Members include DHS, EPA, and other relevant agencies. The Water Sector Government Coordinating Council (GCC) includes members from various government entities such as DHS, EPA, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and others. Chaired by EPA and co-chaired by DHS, the GCC coordinates strategies and policies for critical infrastructure protection within the water sector. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) issued by DHS in 2006 and revised in 2009 aims to unify CI/KR protection efforts into one national program. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) aims to unify critical infrastructure protection efforts by setting security goals, identifying key assets, assessing risks, prioritizing assets, implementing protection programs, and measuring effectiveness. Sector Specific Plans (SSPs) are developed by each sector's lead agency, with EPA's Water SSP being one of seven publicly available plans. The Water SSP's goal is to develop strategies and programs to protect CI/KR assets, identify priorities based on risk analysis, describe needed resources, track progress, identify gaps, establish research priorities, and coordinate activities under various laws and directives. The Water Sector Specific Plan (SSP) aims to assist utilities in preparing for various threats, including terrorist attacks and natural disasters. It defines roles and responsibilities for EPA and other partners, and addresses debates on security requirements for water utilities. The adequacy of public and private efforts to improve water sector security is a key issue. The water sector issue involves the status and adequacy of efforts to improve security of public water systems. Vulnerability assessment and planning efforts have progressed rapidly due to actions by drinking water utilities, EPA, and Congress. Many water utilities have implemented practices to enhance security. A 2008 survey found that 98% of responding drinking water utilities have controls in place to safeguard hazardous chemicals. However, it is unclear how widely security upgrades have been implemented in the sector. The water sector has made progress in vulnerability assessments and emergency planning, but there is still a lack of security upgrades for identified vulnerabilities. Legislative attention has focused on the security of chemical facilities, including drinking water utilities with onsite hazardous chemical storage. Bills have been proposed to improve security at these facilities, but none have been enacted yet. In FY2007, Congress authorized DHS to regulate high-risk chemical facilities for three years, excluding certain facilities. DHS established CFATS to set security standards, require vulnerability assessments, and categorize facilities into tiers based on risk. The highest-risk tier faces the strictest security requirements. The CFATS regulations, initially set to expire in October 2009, were extended through various Congressional actions until March 4, 2011. In the 111th Congress, H.R. 2868 was passed in the House to revise security requirements for chemical facilities and introduce new regulations for water and wastewater utilities. EPA would have been given regulatory authority for water and wastewater security provisions. In the 111th Congress, H.R. 2868 was passed in the House to revise security requirements for chemical facilities and introduce new regulations for water and wastewater utilities. The Senate bill would have extended the current DHS CFATS program for three years and established voluntary security training programs, but did not address water utilities. Water sector interests generally argue that water utilities should remain exempt from DHS regulation of chemical facilities. The EPA has implemented various security requirements for water utilities under the Bioterrorism Act and Clean Air Act. Stakeholders are pushing for expanded security measures for chemical facilities and potentially including water utilities. EPA and DHS officials have testified in support of enhancing security measures. The EPA and DHS officials have testified in support of closing the security gap for drinking water and wastewater utilities by addressing their exemption from CFATS. EPA should lead chemical security for water facilities with DHS support, using existing risk assessment tools and performance standards. DHS is responsible for ensuring consistency in high-risk chemical facility security across all infrastructure sectors. The EPA and DHS aim to enhance security at high-risk chemical storing facilities by promoting the use of safer technology like less toxic chemicals. Facilities with the highest risk should implement IST methods if feasible and consider public health and environmental requirements. Legislative provisions may give states a key role in regulating chemical security at water systems, including IST determinations and audits. Bills in the 109th Congress targeted high-consequence facilities within the water sector, proposing the use of inherently safer technologies. In the 109th Congress, bills were proposed to enhance security at high-risk chemical storing facilities by promoting the use of safer technologies, such as switching from chlorine gas to liquid chlorine. Legislation also aimed to address security at wastewater treatment facilities by providing grants for security-related efforts. Bills in the 109th Congress aimed to enhance security at chemical facilities, including water treatment plants, by authorizing the Secretary of DHS to regulate them for certain risks. S. 2145 and H.R. 4999 proposed rules for designating regulated facilities and establishing security standards. H.R. 5695 had similar provisions but exempted water facilities from redundant requirements. The 109th Congress proposed legislation to enhance security at chemical facilities, including water treatment plants, by authorizing the Secretary of DHS to regulate them for certain risks. S. 2486 aimed to cover a wider range of facilities and establish a general duty for safe operation, including the use of IST. H.R. 1562 required consultation between DHS and EPA for stronger security measures, while H.R. 2237 expanded EPA's authority with consultation from DHS. Chemical facility security remained a congressional priority due to limitations in DHS authority and implementation issues. In response to concerns about preempting state and local regulations, the 110th Congress amended P.L. 109-295 to allow states to enact chemical facility security regulations as long as they are as stringent as federal regulations. H.R. 5577, the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Act of 2008, aimed to revise and expand DHS authority over chemical facilities. H.R. 5577 aimed to revise and expand DHS's authority to regulate chemical facility security, including water and wastewater facilities. The bill would have directed the DHS Secretary to maintain a list of high-risk chemical facilities based on specific criteria and authorized DHS to designate certain chemical substances as \"substances of concern.\" H.R. 5577 proposed to expand DHS's authority to regulate chemical facility security by designating substances of concern, establishing threshold quantities, and requiring vulnerability assessments and security plans for covered facilities. It also aimed to address redundant federal requirements and mandate the analysis of methods to reduce terrorist attack consequences. The amended H.R. 5577 granted DHS authority to order high-risk water facilities to cease operations if they did not comply with compliance orders. The bill also allowed DHS to shut down a water facility if it posed a clear danger to homeland security. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce was given an extension to consider the bill, but no further action was taken. In November 2009, the House of Representatives passed legislation addressing security at chemical, drinking water, and wastewater facilities. The Senate proposed an amendment to extend the current DHS Chemical Facility Anti-terrorism Standards authority for three years. The House of Representatives passed legislation in November 2009 addressing security at chemical, drinking water, and wastewater facilities. The Senate proposed extending the current DHS Chemical Facility Anti-terrorism Standards authority for three years beyond the expiration date of October 4, 2010. Congress extended CFATS authority through March 4, 2011, but ultimately no chemical facility security legislation was enacted. H.R. 3258 proposed new security requirements for covered drinking water systems serving a population greater than 3,300. It required regulations for risk-based performance standards, vulnerability assessments, site security plans, and annual training for employees. The EPA Administrator could designate chemical substances of concern for water system security standards. The House passed H.R. 2868, the Chemical and Water Security Act of 2009, addressing chemical and wastewater facilities. It aimed to expand CFATS regulations, increase regulated facilities, require methods to reduce consequences of attacks, and establish citizen-suit provisions. H.R. 2868 proposed to give EPA lead regulatory authority for water and wastewater facilities, while keeping authority for chemical facilities with DHS. The EPA Administrator would develop risk-based standards for water systems, assign systems to risk-based tiers, consult with states and DHS, and review vulnerability assessments and security plans. H.R. 2868 proposed to require water utilities to involve a bargaining agent in developing security plans and emergency response plans. It also mandated assessing methods to reduce consequences of a chemical release for systems with substances of concern exceeding a threshold amount. States would determine if systems in the highest risk tiers must implement these methods before considering inherently safe technology. The bill H.R. 2868 aimed to reduce risks of injury from chemical releases in water systems by implementing security measures. States would determine if systems needed to implement these methods, with EPA authorized to enforce decisions if states failed to act. The bill also allowed for more stringent security requirements at the state and local levels, established criminal penalties for unauthorized disclosure of information, and authorized EPA grants for vulnerability assessments and emergency response planning. The bill H.R. 2868 aimed to reduce risks of chemical releases by implementing security measures, including vulnerability assessments and emergency response plans. It also authorized a worker-training grant program and required EPA to report on threats to drinking water from intentional contamination. The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs reported the bill with amendments, extending CFATS authority for three years and establishing voluntary training and technical assistance programs for chemical facility security. The Secure Water Facilities Act, S. 3598, proposed to regulate water systems and wastewater facilities for security purposes, including establishing risk-based performance standards and methods to reduce consequences of intentional chemical releases. EPA would issue regulations for site security plans and prohibit unauthorized disclosure of protected information. The Secure Water Facilities Act, S. 3598, aimed to regulate water systems and wastewater facilities for security purposes by establishing risk-based performance standards and methods to reduce consequences of intentional chemical releases. It would have authorized EPA to provide grants or enter into cooperative agreements with states or covered systems to assist with compliance. Several local government and water associations, including the American Water Works Association (AWWA), opposed legislation that would require water utilities to comply with inherently safer technology (IST) requirements without considering specific utility circumstances. AWWA cautioned that for some water utilities, chlorine gas remains the only viable form of disinfection to provide sufficient public health protection. The American Water Works Association (AWWA) has testified that new security rules must align with public health requirements under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). They emphasize the need for flexibility in decision-making for utilities based on factors like public health, treatment reliability, water chemistry, and worker safety. Some argue for safer technology adoption due to the risks posed by hazardous chemicals like gaseous chlorine. AWWA opposes chemical facility security provisions that could lead to closure of noncompliant water utilities, citing the critical importance of water supplies. The Administration supports consistent approaches for high-risk chemical facilities. The Administration supports consistent approaches for high-risk chemical facilities, including requiring assessment and implementation of IST methods for tiers 1-4 facilities. EPA emphasizes the need for funding for water systems to make security upgrades, estimating over $1 billion needed for improvements in community water systems. EPA reported in a 2007 survey that utilities would need $422 million for security projects, but this amount was underestimated. Congress has not allocated specific funding for water system security improvements. Water systems can potentially receive funding from states through the DHS State Homeland Security Grant Program, but competition for funds is intense. The definition of \"local unit of government\" was modified to include water districts in an effort to address funding issues. Congress has allocated $950 million annually since FY2008 for a grant program that includes water districts. However, most funds have been used for first responders, limiting availability for water security. Proposed bills in the 111th Congress aimed to fund security improvements at water and chemical facilities. H.R. 2868 would have authorized grants for security measures at drinking water and wastewater systems, including vulnerability assessments and emergency response plans. H.R. 2868 and S. 3598 proposed authorizing appropriations for water system security, with funds allocated for vulnerability assessments, emergency response plans, and reducing consequences of chemical releases from intentional acts. H.R. 2868 would have authorized $315 million for FY2011, while S. 3598 proposed $340 million for each FY2011 through FY2015. Additionally, $200 million would have been authorized for wastewater treatment works. The water security bills proposed appropriations for water system security, including funds for vulnerability assessments and emergency response plans. However, none of the bills were enacted, leading to uncertainty about whether legislative proposals will be considered in the future. Utilities have made security improvements, but the extent of sector-wide improvements is unknown."
