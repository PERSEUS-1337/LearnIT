    "content": "The \"Truth-in-Billing, Remedies, and User Empowerment over Fees Act of 2018\" or the \"TRUE Fees Act of 2018\" amends the Communications Act of 1934 to include requirements relating to charges for covered services. The \"TRUE Fees Act of 2018\" prohibits providers of covered services from advertising prices that do not include all related charges, taxes, and fees, except for those required by federal or state law that are not uniform nationwide. The \"TRUE Fees Act of 2018\" requires providers of covered services to be transparent in e-billing by providing bills in an electronic format with itemized statements breaking down the total amount charged for the service and related taxes. The \"TRUE Fees Act of 2018\" mandates providers to disclose detailed breakdowns of charges, including taxes and fees, in electronic bills. Providers cannot increase charges unless costs have objectively risen. The provider must give clear notice of any increase in charges to the consumer at least 21 days before it takes effect, regardless of the reason for the increase. The provider must notify the consumer of any bill availability and allow termination of the contract without penalty. Fees for equipment rental can only increase if there is a substantial upgrade in functionality. The consumer can request additional services or upgrades without certain restrictions. Providers cannot force consumers into alternative dispute resolution in contracts, and any such provision is void. In this section, \"covered dispute\" refers to a disagreement between a service provider and a consumer regarding increased charges without proper notice or changes during promotional rates. The covered dispute involves discrepancies in billing, such as charges not reflecting promotional rates or services not subscribed to by the consumer. The bill covers various services including internet access, voice service, commercial mobile service, commercial mobile data service, and service provided by a multichannel video programming distributor. The bill defines internet access service as a retail service that allows data transmission to and from all internet endpoints, including any incidental capabilities. It also includes services deemed functionally equivalent by the Commission. The bill defines internet access service as a retail service that allows data transmission to and from all internet endpoints, including any incidental capabilities. It also includes services deemed functionally equivalent by the Commission. A transitional rule is established regarding the definition of voice service, and the effective date for the Communications Act of 1934 is set to 180 days after the enactment of the Act. The enactment of this Act sets the effective date for the Communications Act of 1934 to be 180 days after enactment, excluding certain contract provisions."
