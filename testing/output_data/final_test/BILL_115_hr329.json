    "content": "SECTION 1. EXPENSES FOR HOUSEHOLD AND ELDER CARE SERVICES NECESSARY FOR GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT. This section adds a new provision to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, allowing for the deduction of expenses related to household and elder care services essential for maintaining gainful employment. The provision allows for a tax credit for employment-related expenses paid by an individual with qualifying dependents. The credit amount is determined based on the taxpayer's adjusted gross income. The provision allows for a tax credit of $15,000 for employment-related expenses paid by an individual with qualifying dependents who are age 50 or older and meet certain criteria. In section 152(d)(1), if the taxpayer has provided over one-half of the individual's support for the calendar year and the individual's modified adjusted gross income meets certain criteria. The taxpayer may claim an exemption if the individual is physically or mentally incapable of self-care and shares the same principal place of abode for more than half of the taxable year. The spouse of the taxpayer who is also incapable of self-care is eligible for the exemption. The term \"modified adjusted gross income\" is defined in this context. The term 'modified adjusted gross income' is defined as adjusted gross income without considering section 86. 'Employment-related expenses' include costs for household services and care of a qualifying individual to enable the taxpayer to be gainfully employed. The exception for employment-related expenses incurred for services outside the taxpayer's household is only applicable for the care of qualifying individuals as defined in the tax code. Dependent care centers must meet specific criteria for expenses to be considered. Dependent care centers must comply with state laws, care for more than six individuals, and receive payment for services to be considered for tax purposes. The tax credit for employment-related expenses has a limit of $3,000 for one qualifying individual or $6,000 for two or more qualifying individuals. This amount is reduced by any income excluded under section 129. There is also an earned income limitation on the expenses that can be claimed. The tax credit for employment-related expenses has a limit based on earned income. For individuals, the limit is their earned income for the year, and for married individuals, it is the lesser of their earned income or their spouse's earned income. Special rules apply, such as not having the same principal place of abode if in violation of local law, and married couples must file a joint return. If a taxpayer is married at the end of the tax year, the credit is only allowed if they file a joint return with their spouse. Legal separation or living apart rules apply for married individuals filing separately. During the last 6 months of the taxable year, if an individual maintains a household and their spouse is not a member of that household, the individual will not be considered married for tax purposes. Additionally, no tax credit is allowed for payments made to related individuals who are eligible for a deduction as a dependent or who are the taxpayer's child under 19 years old. The taxpayer must include identifying information of the service provider on the return claiming the credit, such as name, address, and taxpayer identification number. Failure to provide this information will result in disallowance of the credit. The taxpayer must provide identifying information of the service provider on the return to claim the credit. Failure to do so will result in disallowance of the credit. If the taxpayer can show due diligence in attempting to provide the required information, the disallowance may not apply. Regulations will be prescribed by the Secretary to carry out the purposes of this section. The amendments made by this section regarding expenses for household and elder care services necessary for gainful employment will apply to taxable years beginning after the enactment of this Act."
