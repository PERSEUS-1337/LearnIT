    "content": "A patent box offers a lower tax rate on income from patents and other intellectual property. Countries like the U.K., France, the Netherlands, and China have adopted patent boxes with tax rates ranging from 5% to 15%. The purpose is to incentivize research and development and attract profits from intellectual property. The design of patent boxes raises issues such as coverage breadth, including income from patented inventions, non-patented innovations, and non-technological items. Design also considers restrictions on innovations developed and income derived in the United States. European patent boxes have fewer restrictions. Treatment of income from existing patents and innovations is another issue, with a focus on encouraging domestic innovation. The design of patent boxes raises issues such as coverage breadth, including income from patented inventions, non-patented innovations, and non-technological items. Proposals for a patent box in the United States include a draft proposal by Representatives Boustany and Neal, the Innovation Promotion Act of 2015, proposed legislation made by Senator Feinstein in the 112 th Congress, and a bill introduced by Representative Schwartz in the 113 th Congress ( H.R. 2605 ). The Feinstein proposal provided a 15% tax rate on income from patents developed and used for manufacture in the United States, whereas the Boustany-Neal proposal and H.R. 2605 allowed a 71% deduction of income, which produces an effective 10% statutory rate on income in the patent box. The proposal covers income from patents, inventions, formulas, processes, knowhow, computer software, and other IP for domestic earnings. It discusses the effects of a patent box on research and development incentives in the United States, including potential impacts and the effect on multinational corporations. The report also examines current R&D incentives and subsidies, considering a patent box as a supplement or substitution for existing tax incentives. The research and experimentation (R&E) credit, allowed under Section 41 of the Internal Revenue Code, provides a credit of 20% in excess of a fixed base or 14% in excess of 50% of past three years' R&E spending. This credit was made permanent in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016. Companies can choose between these two types of credits for intangible investments. The research and experimentation (R&E) credit offers a choice between a 20% credit or a 14% credit based on past R&E spending. The effective credit is calculated at 11.3% after weighting the two credits. The patent box provides a lower tax rate on innovation profits to address potential underinvestment in research due to spillover effects. Innovations can lead to competition after patent expiration, increasing societal value. Overinvestment in R&D can occur due to product market rivalry. Empirical studies show positive spillover effects of research and development, with some finding negative or ambiguous effects. A recent study found positive spillover effects of R&D, with social return being 3.5 times higher than private return. R&D tax subsidies are effective in encouraging R&D spending, but the impact varies across studies. Patent boxes are too new for a comprehensive assessment. There is a debate on whether R&D tax subsidies are the best way to support R&D compared to government spending. The existing tax benefits for R&D provide lower effective tax rates compared to other investments in the economy. To compare the incentive effect for investment in research and development, the effective tax rate on a new investment at the margin is examined. The effective tax rate is the share of the return paid in taxes. The effective tax rate captures the value of tax subsidies in a single measure, with lower tax rates indicating greater subsidies. Comparing effective tax rates for intangible and tangible investments shows that expensing intangibles results in a zero tax rate on income earned from intangibles, while tangible assets face tax rates of 24% or more. The research credit results in a negative 99% effective tax rate, providing a subsidy for projects. Lower effective tax rates lead to lower required pre-tax returns, making more projects profitable. A Canadian study compared taxation of intangibles and found equipment with a 27% effective tax rate and structures with a 36.6% rate. The research credit results in a negative 99% effective tax rate, providing a subsidy for projects. Lower effective tax rates lead to lower required pre-tax returns, making more projects profitable. A Canadian study compared taxation of intangibles and found equipment with a 27% effective tax rate and structures with a 36.6% rate. The weighted overall effective tax rate is estimated at 6.1% without the credit and -57% with the credit, reducing the cost of capital by 10% and 19.2% respectively. The research credit decreases the cost of capital by around 10% due to its negative effective tax rate. The tax rates only consider corporate tax on equity investment, with debt-financed investment and taxes on shareholders and creditors resulting in lower tax rates. The incentive effect of a patent or innovation box depends on its design, with a narrowly focused box covering licensing fees and royalties, while a broader box includes income from products produced from patented inventions. The patent box incentive can be extended to income from non-patented innovations, trademarks, business names, and copyrights. The scope is influenced by factors like the application of the patent box rate to innovations developed outside the US and whether it is limited to income from innovations used for manufacturing within the US. The incentive effect on the patent box depends on whether R&D expense deductions are valued at the patent box rate, with each dollar of R&D spending deducted saving $0.10 in taxes. The Boustany-Neal proposal suggests a lower tax saving of $0.10 for each dollar of R&D spending deducted compared to the regular rate of $0.35. The innovation box's rate can be applied to net or gross income, impacting incentive effects. The proposal involves allocating net profit from qualified innovations to the patent box based on R&D expenses. This approach aims to separate income from innovation and production, applying a 10% rate for estimating effective tax rates on innovation. Estimates in Table 2 use a 10% rate to estimate effective tax rates on innovation with and without the research credit. The innovation box does not provide additional incentive when investments are already expensed, as the effective tax rate on intangibles without the credit is zero. The credit is not affected by the statutory rate, resulting in no additional benefit from the innovation box. The innovation box results in no additional incentive for investments already expensed and is mainly a windfall for preexisting innovations. If an innovation box replaced the R&D credit, the effective tax rate would rise from negative to positive, and the user cost of capital would increase by about 10%. The total effective tax rate on earnings from intangible R&D would rise with the innovation box, as the lower statutory rate reduces the value of interest deductions. The effective tax rate for intangibles would rise without the credit, but with the credit, it would still increase. The finding that a patent box has no effect on R&D incentives is due to the equivalence of expensing to a zero tax rate. An example is given to explain this effect, showing how the rate of return and effective tax rate are affected by economic depreciation and tax rates. The firm saves $35 on its investment for a net cost of $65 and earns $71.5, resulting in a return of 10%. By treating the investment as a partnership with the government financing 35% of the cost, the firm could expand its R&D investment by grossing the size of the investment. This would result in a net investment of $100, equivalent to a zero tax rate scenario. Arguments have been made that expensing at a lower statutory tax rate is preferable. Some argue that expensing at a lower statutory tax rate is better than at a higher rate due to issues with loss offset and investment scale reduction. However, there are opposing views as well. The research in the United States by multinational firms involves profit shifting to tax havens with low tax rates. This is more common among larger firms with intangible assets. The total size of the investment, not just the scale, is crucial for the social value of the investment. The presence of taxes reduces the variance of returns on R&D investments, leading firms to increase R&D spending relative to other investments. Higher statutory tax rates encourage R&D investment, especially with expensing. Effective tax rates change significantly when the patent box applies to gross income. This is seen in narrow patent box proposals that only cover royalties and licenses from patented products. When all income comes from royalties and license fees, taxes fall on gross income, and expenses are deducted at the regular tax rate. A patent/innovation box could be designed to deduct expenses at the statutory rate, splitting net profit into patent box and non-patent box shares. Research expenses could be added back to the net patent box profit and subtracted from the non-patent box profit, or a credit equal to 25% of research expenses could be added. This results in generous subsidies that can lead to negative pre-tax returns in some cases. The analysis focuses on the impact of lower tax rates on gross investment, particularly on intangible R&D investments. The innovation box results in negative pre-tax returns, while the five-year amortization provision shows a small positive return without the credit. The user cost of capital decreases significantly with the patent box rate, falling by 25% without the credit and 19% with the credit. This effect is larger than the impact of the R&D credit and can influence the location of investment in an international setting. In an international setting, the tax system can impact investment location, with U.S. multinationals interested in a U.S. patent box to counter profits shifted to low-tax countries. The OECD has proposed actions to address profit shifting, including concerns about preferential tax regimes like patent boxes. This raises worries that R&D may move overseas to meet these requirements, affecting choices in the global economy. The analysis discusses how a patent box can influence investment location in the global economy by attracting infra-marginal investments and potentially shifting profits. Lower tax rates could encourage investments with high returns to locate in the United States, while concerns about profit shifting and R&D moving overseas are raised. The patent box regime may impact investment in the United States by attracting profits from abroad and affecting marginal investment. Evidence suggests profit shifting out of the US due to difficulties in enforcing arms-length pricing. Lower tax rates in the US could retain more profits from US investments. Design plays a crucial role in this scenario. The Boustany-Neal proposal aims to tax additional dollars shifted to U.S. firms at a rate between 35% and 10%. Peter Merrill suggested a 27% tax rate across industries. A patent box can be designed to tax the marginal profit at 10% by subtracting an imputed return on tangible assets. This change could also apply the rate to gross profit. Profit shifting and design are key issues in the patent box regime. Profit shifting can occur when R&D takes place in the United States but profits are allocated abroad through cost-sharing arrangements. If the cost-sharing payment is too small, profits are shifted abroad. A patent box based on net profit may discourage investment in the U.S. as R&D costs are deducted at a 10% rate instead of 35% without a corresponding decrease in the tax rate on profit. Estimates of effective tax rates use a discounted cash flow approach to attract capital for investments. The effective tax rate is the pre-tax return minus the after-tax return divided by the pre-tax return. The formula for pre-tax return (r) is calculated using various factors such as after-tax real return (R), economic depreciation rate (d), tax rate applied to deductions (u), present value of depreciation deductions (z), tax credit (k), and tax rate applied to gross income (v). Changes in tax rates can significantly impact the effective tax rate on investments, with reductions in u and v leading to lower effective tax rates. Effective tax rates can vary based on the treatment of depreciation and tax credits, influencing investment decisions, especially in R&D where most investments are in intangibles. The effective tax rate on investments in R&D is influenced by factors such as economic depreciation rates for equipment, structures, and intangibles. A Canadian study compared taxation of intangibles across countries, with 7.3% investment in equipment, 6.6% in structures, and the rest in intangible investments like salaries for scientists. Different depreciation rates are used for instruments (13.50%), industrial structures (3.14%), and research intangibles (17.00%). These factors are used to calculate effective tax rates in Table 2 and Table 3. The effective tax rate on investments in R&D is influenced by economic depreciation rates for equipment, structures, and intangibles. Instruments are depreciated largely under a 7-year life, with a present value of depreciation estimated at 81.4 cents per dollar of investment. Structures are depreciated over 39 years at a straight-line basis, with an estimated value of depreciation at 34.2 cents per dollar of investment. Intangible assets are expensed when incurred, and research expenditures are eligible for a research and experimentation credit. The discount rate is set at 5% and inflation at 2%. The effective tax rate on investments in R&D is influenced by economic depreciation rates for equipment, structures, and intangibles. The discount rate is set at 5% and inflation at 2%. The 5-year amortization of intangible R&D expenses results in z being 84.4 cents per dollar. Firms can choose between two research tax credits, one with a marginal effective rate of 20% and the other with a rate of 14% based on past research expenditures. The effective marginal rate is slightly more than half, or 7.9%. The effective tax rate on investments in R&D is influenced by economic depreciation rates for equipment, structures, and intangibles. The discount rate is set at 5% and inflation at 2%. When aggregating different assets into a single tax rate, the pre-tax returns are weighted by investment shares to produce an overall return, which is then used to calculate the effective tax rate. To estimate the total tax rate, the total discount rate, R T , is used in equation (1) which is a combination of the firm's equity discount rate and the interest rate on debt net of taxes. The effective tax rate is (r-R i )/r, where r is the estimated pre-tax return and R i is the after-tax return. The tax rate formula is (r-Ri)/r, where r is the pre-tax return and Ri is the after-tax return to capital suppliers. Additional data needed include rates of return, inflation rate, debt finance share, and tax rates. The equity rate of return is set at 7% after corporate tax but before individual tax, with a 4% dividend rate and 3% real growth rate. The nominal interest rate is 7.5%. The nominal interest rate is set at 7.5%, reflecting recent experience with the Baa bond rate prior to the recession. Debt is weighted at 36% and equity at 64%. The overall discount rate is close to 5%. Marginal rates for interest, dividends, and capital gains are 22%, 14.6%, and 15.4% respectively. A large fraction of interest and dividends paid do not appear on individual income tax returns. The small share of assets reported is largely due to pension, retirement, and insurance plans. Half of privately held capital gains are assumed to be untaxed until death. The statutory tax rate for patent box income may not precisely match the rate implied. The derivation aims to calculate the tax rate applied to R&D investment, showing it will be equal to the patent box rate. The tax rate imposed on research profits is calculated using a formula involving ordinary tax rate, patent box rate, profits from non-research activities, and costs associated with non-research spending. The variable x represents the share of costs related to non-research spending and is determined by the costs of investment in ordinary capital and research capital. The effective statutory tax rate on income from R&D is determined by the share of costs related to non-research spending and the profits from non-research activities. If profits are a smaller share than costs, the tax rate will be less than the statutory rate, and if profits are a larger share, the rate will be greater. The formula for calculating the tax rate involves the ordinary tax rate, patent box rate, and costs associated with non-research spending. The effective statutory tax rate on income from R&D is equal to the patent box rate of 10% when profits and costs are equal shares, used in tax rate calculations."
