    "content": "Section 6 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 gives OSHA the authority to set safety standards for private sector employers, the USPS, and the federal government. The General Duty Clause requires employers to provide safe workplaces. OSHA can enforce compliance through orders, citations, and penalties. The OSH Act does not cover state or local government agencies. The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 authorizes OSHA to set safety standards for private sector employers, the USPS, and the federal government. State and local government agencies are not covered by the OSH Act or subject to OSHA regulation. States can establish their own safety and health plans under Section 18 of the OSH Act, with 21 states and Puerto Rico having plans that cover all employers. State and local government employers in states not covered by the OSH Act are not subject to OSHA standards or enforcement. State plans can adopt OSHA standards or create their own, as long as they are as effective. OSHA can create standards on its own or in response to petitions, and may consult with advisory committees for assistance. The rulemaking process for standards promulgation is not required to respond to petitions. OSHA follows the APA and Section 6(b) of the OSH Act for rulemaking. They must publish a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and allow a 30-day comment period. Public objections can be submitted, and a public hearing can be requested. Section 6(e) requires OSHA to publish reasons for its actions in the Federal Register. When OSHA promulgates a standard or conducts rulemaking, it must publish reasons for its actions in the Federal Register. Various federal laws, such as the Paperwork Reduction Act and Regulatory Flexibility Act, apply to OSHA rulemaking. Executive Order 12866 requires regulatory actions to be reviewed by OMB and OIRA before promulgation. OSHA's rulemaking process for new standards has historically been time-consuming. In 2012, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reviewed 59 OSHA standards promulgated between 1981 and 2010. The average time from formal consideration to promulgation was 93 months. OSHA published a flowchart of the rulemaking process on its website in 2012, outlining estimated duration ranges for various actions. The flowchart outlines estimated duration ranges for rulemaking actions, from pre-rule activities to post-promulgation activities. The time from preliminary rulemaking to standard promulgation ranges from 52 to 138 months. After a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, it takes 26 to 63 months for the standard to be promulgated. OSHA provides estimated timelines for major pre-rulemaking and rulemaking activities leading to standard promulgation, with judicial review allowed under the APA and OSH Act. The OSH Act allows for judicial review of OSHA standards, with a 60-day window to challenge a standard in the U.S. Court of Appeals. A petition for review does not automatically halt enforcement, but the court can order a stay. OSHA can issue Emergency Temporary Standards without public input, which are immediately effective upon publication. Post-promulgation activities, including judicial review, can take 4 to 12 months. An Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) is immediately effective upon publication in the Federal Register and serves as the proposed standard for the full rulemaking process for a permanent standard. OSHA must promulgate a permanent standard within six months of publishing the ETS. State plans must adopt or adhere to an ETS, with unclear timelines for compliance. OSHA can issue an ETS if employees are exposed to grave danger from toxic substances, new hazards, or physically harmful agents. The term \"grave danger\" in an Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) is not clearly defined in statute or regulation, leading to uncertainty in its interpretation. Federal courts have not provided clear guidance on what constitutes a grave danger, as seen in a 1984 case where an ETS lowering asbestos exposure limits was invalidated. This lack of clarity raises questions about how Congress intended the term to be defined and applied in ETS determinations. The court rejected the asbestos ETS due to lack of sufficient support for the claim that 80 workers would die from asbestos exposure. The ETS was also invalidated for not demonstrating its necessity, citing duplication with existing respirator standards. The court rejected the asbestos ETS for lack of support and necessity, citing duplication with existing respirator standards. OSHA has not issued an ETS since 1983 but has considered the need for one, such as in the case of diacetyl exposure petitioned by UFCW and IBT in 2006. Airborne exposure to diacetyl, used in artificial butter flavoring, was linked to \"popcorn lung.\" OSHA considered issuing an ETS due to the danger but industry actions reduced diacetyl, making it less necessary. ETS is effective until a permanent standard is established within six months. The ETS issued by OSHA is effective until a permanent standard is established within six months. There is uncertainty regarding whether OSHA can extend an ETS without going through the normal rulemaking process, as historical precedent shows ETS authority has been used sparingly. OSHA has issued an ETS, which has been challenged in court cases. Some cases fully vacated or partially vacated the ETS, while others were upheld. OSHA has issued permanent standards within the required time frame in cases not challenged or upheld by courts. Pre-1980, OSHA did not attempt to extend ETS expiration dates. In a 1974 case, the court ruled OSHA could amend an ETS without full rulemaking process. The court ruled that OSHA can amend an ETS without full rulemaking process, recognizing the need for quick responses in emergency situations. OSHA faces challenges in promulgating standards within six months due to lengthy procedures. Currently, there is no OSHA standard for exposure to airborne diseases in the workplace. OSHA can enforce protections for workers exposed to SARS-Cov-2 under the General Duty Clause if hazards are present. Standards for personal protective equipment may apply, including the use of NIOSH-certified respirators when engineering controls are insufficient. Surgical masks are not considered respirators. NIOSH certifies respirators based on their efficiency at filtering airborne particles and oil protection levels. N95 respirators filter out 95% of airborne particles and do not protect against oil particles. R or P respirators can be used as alternatives to N respirators. An N95 respirator filters out 95% of airborne particles and does not protect against oil particles. Respirators past their shelf life are no longer certified by NIOSH, but certain models have been approved for extended use. Respirators for medical use are regulated by both NIOSH and the FDA. Respirators with exhalation valves should not be used in surgical settings. FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization on March 2, 2020, for certain respirators for medical use. On March 2, 2020, FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for certain NIOSH-certified respirators in medical settings. CDC updated guidance on March 10, 2020, allowing healthcare workers to use facemasks when respirators are scarce. Respirators should be prioritized for procedures likely to generate respiratory aerosols. The OSHA respiratory protection standard requires employers to provide a medical evaluation to determine if an employee can use a respirator. Fit testing must be done before using a respirator to ensure a complete seal. Employees must be fit tested annually or when using a different respirator model. OSHA issued guidance on March 14, 2020, allowing employers to suspend annual fit testing of respirators for employees already fit tested on the same model. Exceptions to the respiratory protection standard include using expired respirators and extended/reuse of respirators due to COVID-19 PPE shortages. Employers may allow the use of expired or reused respirators as long as they remain structurally intact and uncontaminated. Non-NIOSH certified respirators from certain countries can also be used, following equivalency tables. Cal/OSHA has an ATD standard for aerosol transmission in healthcare, labs, correctional facilities, and shelters. The Cal/OSHA ATD standard classifies SARS-Cov-2 as a disease requiring airborne isolation, with stricter control standards than diseases needing only droplet precautions. Requirements include an exposure control plan, employee training, use of PPE, engineering controls, medical services provision, and specific PPE for laboratory workers. Employers must provide employees with PPE, including gloves, gowns, eye protection, and N95 respirators certified by NIOSH. A powered air purifying respirator with a HEPA filter is required for high-hazard procedures on known or suspected COVID-19 cases. Cal/OSHA has issued interim guidance for using surgical masks for low-hazard patient contacts and respirators for high-hazard procedures in response to shortages of N95 respirators and PAPRs during the COVID-19 pandemic. OSHA initiated a rulemaking process in 2010 to control infectious disease exposure in healthcare workplaces. After completing the SBREFA process in 2014, no further public actions have been taken. In March 2020, Representatives called on OSHA to issue an Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) for COVID-19 exposure among healthcare workers. Several groups and individuals have called for OSHA to issue an Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) to address COVID-19 exposure. This includes Senator Patty Murray and a group of Democratic Senators, David Michaels, the AFL-CIO, National Nurses United, and the Center for Food Safety and Food Chain Workers Alliance. They have all petitioned OSHA to implement an ETS to protect workers from potential exposures to the virus. Alliance and AFL-CIO petitioned for OSHA to create a COVID-19 ETS to protect workers. Representative Scott introduced a bill requiring OSHA to implement the ETS within one month. The ETS would cover healthcare workers and those at elevated risk, based on CDC or OSHA guidance. It must include an exposure control plan and meet or exceed state standards for novel pathogens. The bill requires OSHA to implement an Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) for healthcare workers and high-risk individuals, based on CDC or OSHA guidance. Hospitals and skilled nursing facilities receiving Medicare funding must comply with the ETS. The American Hospital Association opposes the ETS provisions, citing differences in COVID-19 transmission compared to SARS. The 2007 CDC guidance requiring N95 respirators for patient contact is deemed unnecessary for COVID-19 protection. Surgical masks are recommended by the World Health Organization. The American Hospital Association warns of respirator shortages impacting patient care capacity. The OSHA ETS provisions were not included in the legislation passed as P.L. 116-127. Division D of H.R. 6379 mandates OSHA to create a COVID-19 standard within 24 months for healthcare workers and emergency responders. Division D of H.R. 6379 would expand coverage of the OSH Act to include state and local government employers in states without state plans under the ETS. The legislation grants OSHA enforcement discretion in cases where full compliance with the ETS is not feasible. The ETS and permanent standard proposed in H.R. 6379 would require employers to implement alternative means to protect employees when PPE is unavailable. It must include an exposure control plan and provide at least as much protection as any state standard on novel pathogens. The legislation does not specifically reference the 2007 CDC guidance but requires incorporation of guidelines from CDC and NIOSH to prevent transmission of infectious agents in healthcare. The COVID-19 Every Worker Protection Act of 2020, introduced in the House, includes provisions for protecting healthcare workers and other employees at risk of COVID-19 exposure. It requires employers to record work-related COVID-19 infections and strengthens protections for whistleblowers. States with safety and health plans must adopt the ETS within 14 days of enactment. The OSH Act requires employers to maintain records of work-related injuries and illnesses according to OSHA regulations. Employers with 10 or more employees must keep records of injuries and illnesses that result in lost work time or require medical care. They must report workplace fatalities within 8 hours and injuries or illnesses resulting in hospitalization, amputation, or loss of an eye within 24 hours to OSHA. Certain industries are exempt from recordkeeping but must still report serious incidents to OSHA. OSHA regulations require employers to determine if an employee's injury or illness is work-related and subject to recordkeeping. The presumption is that workplace injuries or illnesses are recordable, except for exemptions like the common cold or flu. COVID-19 transmission sources can be challenging to pinpoint due to community and workplace spread. OSHA issued guidance on how COVID-19 cases should be treated under recordkeeping requirements. Cases are recordable if work-related, with specific industries required to comply fully. Other employers must determine work-relatedness only if specific conditions are met. The guidance from OSHA requires that COVID-19 cases be recorded if they are work-related, with specific conditions to be met for determining work-relatedness. H.R. 6559 would mandate the recording and reporting of all COVID-19 cases in accordance with OSHA regulations at the time of enactment, superseding OSHA's guidance. The provision in H.R. 6559 would supersede OSHA's guidance and require all employers to determine the work-relatedness of COVID-19 cases. Section 11(c) of the OSH Act protects employees from retaliation for exercising rights under the Act, including filing complaints, causing OSHA proceedings, testifying, and informing employers about unsafe work conditions. The protection provisions in H.R. 6559 expand whistleblower protections for employees reporting unsafe work conditions, injuries, or violations of safety standards. Employees have the right to refuse work if there is a risk of serious injury or death. Reporting to the employer, government agencies, media, or social media platforms is protected from retaliation. The provisions of H.R. 6559 expand whistleblower protections for employees reporting unsafe work conditions, violations of safety standards, or infectious disease hazards in the workplace. These protections include reporting to the employer, government agencies, or using personally supplied PPE with higher protection levels. H.R. 6559 was included in the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act (HEROES Act) passed by the House on May 15, 2020."
