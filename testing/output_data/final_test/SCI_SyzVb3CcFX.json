    "content": "Prediction is a fundamental function of intelligent systems, especially in predicting events in the future or between waypoints. A new approach called time-agnostic predictors (TAP) decouples visual prediction from a rigid notion of time, allowing for the discovery of predictable \"bottleneck\" frames. This method was evaluated for robotic manipulation tasks, resulting in higher visual quality predictions that correspond to coherent semantic subgoals. Visual prediction approaches aim to predict future events in temporally extended tasks by mitigating uncertainty through iterative prediction in small time steps. Prediction is considered fundamental to intelligence as it enables anticipatory actions, planning, and representation learning. The key challenge lies in uncertainty, but by learning to predict the future, agents can make informed decisions and use prediction as a proxy for representation learning. Visual prediction approaches aim to predict future events in temporally extended tasks by mitigating uncertainty through iterative prediction in small time steps. Sophisticated probabilistic approaches have been proposed to better handle uncertainty in prediction models. Time-agnostic prediction (TAP) changes the goal of prediction models by allowing predictors to skip more uncertain states and make predictions based on the likelihood of a frame occurring in the future. Our time-agnostic reframing of the prediction problem targets the minima of uncertainty profiles, known as \"bottlenecks,\" which are reliable subgoals for predicting future events. In experiments with simulated robotic manipulation tasks, we evaluate the usefulness of these predictions as subgoals. Our main contributions include reframing the video prediction problem to be time-agnostic, proposing a novel technical approach, effectively identifying \"bottleneck states\" as subgoals across various tasks, and showing that these subgoals aid in planning. The text discusses visual prediction approaches for video frames, focusing on addressing uncertainty in prediction models using conditional variational autoencoders. The approach aims to model uncertainty efficiently by factorizing the joint distribution over all pixels. The text introduces a general time-agnostic prediction framework for video prediction tasks, aiming to identify low-uncertainty bottleneck frames without timestamps. The framework can be combined with conditional GANs and VAEs to handle residual uncertainty. Bottlenecks are used in hierarchical reinforcement learning to discover options in low-dimensional state spaces, with a focus on subgoal prediction for a hierarchical planner. We propose using bottleneck predictions as subgoals for hierarchical planning, leveraging predictability to identify bottlenecks in high-dimensional visual state trajectories. Our approach improves on time-agnostic prediction with enhancements in various sections, enabling its application in general tasks like robotic object manipulation. Experiments validate the quality of discovered bottlenecks as subgoals for hierarchical planning in visual prediction tasks. In visual prediction, different scenarios are used as subgoals for hierarchical planning. Forward prediction involves predicting future frames given context frames, while bidirectionally conditioned prediction involves predicting frames between two context frames. Various models are used for video prediction, where a frame at a specific time is selected as the target for training. The predictor takes context frames as input to predict future frames. In visual prediction, different scenarios are used as subgoals for hierarchical planning. Forward prediction involves predicting future frames given context frames, while bidirectionally conditioned prediction involves predicting frames between two context frames. Various models are used for video prediction, where a frame at a specific time is selected as the target for training. The predictor takes context frames as input to predict future frames, and a time-agnostic predictor (TAP) is proposed to predict bottleneck video frames through a minimum-over-time loss function. The TAP loss function incentivizes the model to predict bottleneck states in the video by penalizing predictions based on the closest matching ground truth target frame. This ensures that the model's prediction is different from the input conditioning frames by at least one step, preventing degenerate predictions close to the input frames. The TAP loss function penalizes predictions close to input frames, encouraging the model to predict bottleneck states successfully. It simplifies the predictor's task by not requiring timestamped predictions, only specifying the agent's path through the maze. TAP models can also be trained for recursive prediction by minimizing a specific loss function. The TAP loss function penalizes predictions close to input frames to encourage successful prediction of bottleneck states. It simplifies the predictor's task by not requiring timestamped predictions, only specifying the agent's path through the maze. TAP models can also be trained for recursive prediction by minimizing a specific loss function, with dynamically adapted input and target sets at recursion levels. Bidirectional TAP models target all intermediate frames for both forward and backward prediction. The model aims to predict predictable frames in the maze example by specifying preferences for certain times or visual properties. The \"generalized minimum\" loss function allows for expressing preferences about which frames to predict, with the possibility of assigning different weights to different times for predictions. The model allows for expressing preferences for certain times or visual properties when predicting frames in the maze example. Preferences are incorporated by adjusting the error term E t based on the preference value w(t) for each target time t. This approach ensures that frames with higher preferences are favored during prediction. However, directly optimizing the error term E t /w(t) would downweight errors against frames with higher preferences, which is counterproductive. Decoupling the outer and inner errors, as shown in Eq 5, allows preferences to be applied selectively to the target frame for computing the outer loss, while still penalizing prediction errors effectively. The generalized minimum formulation allows for expressing preferences in predicting frames. TAP can handle various losses, including GAN losses for improved quality. A CGAN in fixed-time video prediction involves a discriminator and generator trained adversarially. The CGAN objective involves training discriminators per timestep and defining a time-agnostic CGAN loss. A single discriminator network with multiple outputs is used for computational efficiency. The approach targets low-uncertainty bottleneck states and can be integrated with a conditional variational method. Additional details are provided in Appendix A. The approach targets low-uncertainty bottleneck states and can be integrated with a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to handle residual uncertainty at these bottlenecks. In a time-agnostic CVAE, z must capture stochasticity at bottlenecks, such as when the agent crosses specific points in a maze. The approach integrates a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to handle residual uncertainty at low-uncertainty bottleneck states. The training objective includes a combination of a generalized minimum loss and the CVAE KL divergence loss, with error terms weighted by user-specified time preferences to stabilize training.

The training objective combines a generalized minimum loss and the CVAE KL divergence loss, with error terms weighted by user-specified time preferences for stability. The time-agnostic prediction (TAP) paradigm differs from fixed-time prediction models, focusing on comparing TAP against a representative fixed-time prediction model in three simulated robot manipulation settings. In robot manipulation settings, tasks include object grasping, pick-and-place, and multi-object pushing with varying numbers of episodes. Testing data accounts for 5% of the total. Tasks involve moving objects on a table, lifting them vertically, placing them at new positions, and pushing objects to random final positions. Object shapes and colors are randomly generated. The approach is evaluated for forward prediction on grasping using fixed-time baselines targeting predictions at specific time intervals. In robot manipulation tasks like object grasping, pick-and-place, and multi-object pushing, the approach is evaluated for forward prediction on grasping using fixed-time baselines targeting predictions at specific time intervals. Different methods with varying time preferences are compared, with GENMIN2, GENMIN4, and GENMIN7 performing best in producing visually high-quality and semantically coherent predictions for grasping tasks. TAP produces high-quality predictions with varying stepsizes, outperforming fixed-time methods like GENMIN0.5. The method encourages semantically coherent bottleneck predictions and achieves lower errors across the entire range. The TAP approach produces high-quality predictions with varying stepsizes, outperforming fixed-time methods like GENMIN0.5. It encourages semantically coherent bottleneck predictions and achieves lower errors across the entire range. Additionally, the TAP models successfully discover interesting bottlenecks in bidirectionally conditioned prediction settings, generating clear images in various scenarios such as grasping and pick-and-place tasks. GENMIN consistently identifies bottlenecks in various tasks, producing coherent predictions such as \"pick\" and \"place\". It outperforms FIX in quality, reducing errors by significant margins. GENMIN consistently outperforms FIX in quality, reducing errors by significant margins. The CVAE approach helps capture meaningful sources of stochasticity at bottlenecks, producing different grasp configurations for pick-and-place tasks. TAP methods make better predictions than fixed-time prediction at the same time offsets. Figure 9 shows bidirectional prediction results on two-object pushing, with GENMIN+VAE capturing residual stochasticity at the bottleneck. The best VAE results are significantly better than deterministic methods for pick-and-place tasks. Recursive TAP can be applied recursively, producing different subgoals compared to a fixed-time model. In example #1, \"ours\" identifies bottlenecks at different subgoals and outperforms FIX on the BAIR pushing dataset. TAP shows superior performance despite the dataset's lack of natural bottlenecks. Our approach \"ours\" excels at identifying bottlenecks in 2-object pushing tasks compared to FIX. We evaluate bottleneck discovery frequency quantitatively by tracking object movements in predictions. This method helps detect when only one object moves during the task. Our approach \"ours\" excels at identifying bottlenecks in 2-object pushing tasks compared to FIX, predicting bottlenecks more frequently. The time-agnostic approach latches onto low-uncertainty states to improve predictions, evaluated through experiments for hierarchical planning. Visual MPC internally makes action-conditioned predictions of future object positions to reach subgoal positions with a planning horizon of 15. The model plans towards a subgoal for half the episode length before switching to the final goal. Results show that GENMIN performs best on two-object and three-object pushing tasks, especially on the more complex three-object task. Visual MPC has been successful on pushing tasks, but there is a plan to adapt it for more complex tasks like block-stacking. A new time-agnostic prediction task is proposed, which aims for predictions to occur at any time rather than at a specific scheduled time. This approach leads to higher quality predictions with relatively small changes to standard methods. In a new time-agnostic prediction task, model predictions naturally attach to specific semantic events like a grasp, leading to higher quality predictions. The goal is to address limitations of the TAP formulation, such as providing timestamps for predicted states and generalizing to different settings. The TAP formulation aims to address prediction problems in various settings by exploring more general formulations. The results show promise for applications like hierarchical planning and reinforcement learning. Additional details can be found in the appendices. The TAP formulation introduces a loss function for training discriminators in a conditional variational autoencoder. The loss function includes terms for positive and negative instances, as well as label smoothing to stabilize training. This approach offers an alternative to the TAP CVAE formulation discussed earlier. The TAP formulation introduces a loss function for training discriminators in a conditional variational autoencoder. It suggests an alternative approach to the TAP CVAE formulation by considering the minimum-over-time over the whole loss. However, this would be computationally expensive as both the inference network and generator would have to process multiple frames. The predictor architecture involves an encoder-decoder structure, producing an appearance flowfield used for flow-warped input. The predictor architecture involves an encoder-decoder structure that produces an appearance flowfield used for flow-warped input frames. The encoder reduces the input image size through convolution blocks, resulting in a 128-dimensional code. The VAE latent code is 32-dimensional, making the overall input size to the decoder 160. The decoder utilizes a DCGAN-based architecture to generate the output frame. The predictor uses a DCGAN-based architecture with transposed convolution and upsampling-5x5 convolution blocks to generate new pixels, appearance flow maps, and masks for the final output. The decoder architecture includes three outputs: appearance flow decoder produces |C|x64x64 flowfields, masks decoder produces (|C| + 1)x64x64 masks. The discriminator and recognition network have similar architectures to the predictor encoder, with specific input and output layer changes. Pretraining involves initializing the decoder as an unconditional frame generator on training video frames. For pretraining, a learning rate of 0.0001 is used for 10 epochs with batch size 64 and Adam optimizer. Training involves a learning rate of 0.0001 for 200 epochs with batch size 64 and Adam optimizer. Data generation is done using a CEM-based planner in the MuJoCo environment. Time preference for minimum loss during frame prediction is set heuristically in experiments. The proposed metric for two-object pushing quantifies the network's ability to generate a bottleneck state. This state involves one object being moved while the other remains in its original position. This metric, called bottleneck frequency, measures the consistency of generating predictions in this bidirectional state. The proposed metric for two-object pushing quantifies the network's ability to generate a bottleneck state where one object is moved while the other remains in place. To measure bottleneck frequency, a technique similar to BID5 is used, training \"genmin\" and \"fix\" to synthesize predictions purely by appearance-flow-warping and masking inputs. By tracking where pixels at ground truth object locations in start and goal images end up in the prediction, the model can determine how each object moves. This involves applying appearance flow transformations and masks to one-hot object location maps, resulting in a probability map. The proposed metric for two-object pushing quantifies the network's ability to generate a bottleneck state where one object is moved while the other remains in place. The output is a probability map for each object indicating its location in the predictor's bidirectional prediction output. The score is calculated based on the expected distance between the predicted positions of each object and the bottleneck state. The lower distance score indicates a higher likelihood of predicting a bottleneck. Our approach produces predictions attached to semantically coherent low-uncertainty bottleneck events, with a higher bottleneck frequency at lower thresholds compared to the fixed-time baseline. This is verified by achieving about 58% bottleneck frequency at a low threshold distance score of approximately 2 pixels. The predictions generated are tested for usefulness as subgoals for planning multi-object pushing using a hierarchical planning approach. Visual MPC uses a fixed-time forward prediction model and sampling-based planning to solve short-term and medium duration tasks. When used with our method, object locations at bidirectional predictions are computed and fed to Visual MPC as subgoals towards the final goal. The appearance flow maps and masks computed by our predictor are used to transform one-hot maps of object locations to compute subgoal object locations. The Visual MPC planner uses fixed-time forward predictions and sampling-based planning to select action sequences that bring object distributions closest to the predicted probability map. It iterates through 200 random action sequences using CEM search to find the best sequence within a planning horizon of 15 steps. The process repeats with updated object distributions until the goal is achieved. In experiments, Visual MPC uses a time budget of 40 steps for 2-object pushing and 75 steps for 3-object pushing. Subgoal predictions improve multi-stage pushing tasks compared to direct planning. Additional prediction results are shown in Figs 13-17. The experiment involves using Visual MPC with a time budget for 2-object and 3-object pushing tasks. Subgoal predictions enhance multi-stage pushing tasks. The output columns correspond to different model predictions, with \"match\" being the closest image to the GENMIN prediction."
