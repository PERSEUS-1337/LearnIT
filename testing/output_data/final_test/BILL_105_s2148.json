    "content": "The \"Religious Liberty Protection Act of 1998\" is cited as the short title. It aims to protect religious exercise. The \"Religious Liberty Protection Act of 1998\" prohibits government from burdening a person's religious exercise, except in specific cases where it serves a compelling governmental interest and is the least restrictive means. This applies to programs receiving federal assistance and commerce, without affecting funding. The \"Religious Liberty Protection Act of 1998\" prohibits government from burdening religious exercise, allowing for remedies without withholding federal financial assistance. It also states that a government can eliminate burdens on religious exercise by changing policies or exempting the exercise from them. Definitions include terms like \"government,\" \"program or activity,\" and \"demonstrates.\" The term \"demonstrates\" means meeting the burdens of going forward with evidence and persuasion. SEC. 3. ENFORCEMENT OF THE FREE EXERCISE CLAUSE. If a claimant shows evidence of a Free Exercise Clause violation, the government must prove all related issues, except the burden on religious exercise. Land use regulations cannot substantially burden religious exercise unless necessary to prevent harm, deny religious assemblies a location, or exclude them from areas where nonreligious assemblies are allowed. The subsection allows non-Federal forums to adjudicate claims of Free Exercise Clause violations, with full faith and credit in Federal courts if there was a fair adjudication. State laws that protect religious exercise are not preempted. Land use regulation is not covered by Section 2 of the act. SEC. 4. JUDICIAL RELIEF. (a) A person can use this Act to claim or defend against a violation in court and seek relief against a government. Standing to make a claim or defense will follow general standing rules under the Constitution. \n(b) Attorneys' fees provisions are updated to include the Religious Liberty Protection Act of 1998. \n(c) Prisoner litigation under this Act is subject to the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995. \n(d) States cannot claim immunity under this Act. States and the United States can be held liable for violating the Free Exercise Clause, including for money damages. SEC. 5. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. The Act does not authorize the government to burden any religious belief or regulate religious exercise. It also does not affect a religious organization's right to receive funding or impose conditions on funding. The Act prohibits the government from regulating activities or policies of non-government entities for funding. It does not imply that religious exercise is subject to other commerce laws. If any part of the Act is deemed unconstitutional, the rest remains unaffected. SEC. 6 of the Act clarifies that government funding, benefits, or exemptions granted in accordance with the Establishment Clause of the first amendment to the Constitution do not violate the Act. SEC. 7 addresses amendments to the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. SEC. 7 of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act addresses amendments to the definitions within the Act, including changes to the term \"covered entity\" and clarifying what constitutes an act or refusal to act based on religious beliefs. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act defines key terms such as \"religious exercise\" as an act motivated by religious belief, \"Free Exercise Clause\" as protecting the free exercise of religion, and \"government\" as entities acting under state or federal law. The curr_chunk states that the actions mentioned are carried out by individuals under Federal law."
