    "content": "TITLE I--PROTECTION AGAINST SCAMS ON SENIORS\n\nSEC. 101. SHORT TITLE.\n\nThis title may be cited as the ``Protection Against Scams on Seniors Act of 1999''. The Congress finds that telemarketing fraud costs consumers billions annually, with a significant percentage of firms engaging in fraud. Senior citizens are often targeted, with fraudulent telemarketers creating \"mooch lists\" of vulnerable individuals. Successful investigations and prosecutions have been carried out by the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Federal Bureau of Investigation assists organizations like the American Association of Retired Persons in warning senior citizens about telemarketing fraud. The Administration on Aging provides resources and information to help seniors avoid falling victim to fraud. Senior citizens need to be informed about the dangers of telemarketing fraud to prevent becoming victims. The purpose of this title is to protect senior citizens from telemarketing fraud and aid in prosecuting fraudulent telemarketers through education and outreach. Information dissemination is also emphasized. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will disseminate information in each State to educate senior citizens about telemarketing fraud, including its prevalence, how it works, how to identify and protect against it, and how to report suspected fraud. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will disseminate information to educate senior citizens about telemarketing fraud, including reporting suspected fraud, consumer protection rights, and other necessary information to protect against fraudulent telemarketing. The means of dissemination may include public service announcements, printed materials, an Internet website, and telephone outreach to individuals on \"mooch lists\" from fraudulent telemarketers. Priority will be given to areas with high concentrations of senior citizens in disseminating information about telemarketing fraud to educate and protect them. The Secretary is authorized to accept gifts to carry out the provisions of this title. $10,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1999, with additional funds for future years. The definition of \"State\" includes various territories. Telemarketing fraud statutes are extended to cover internet fraud. SEC. 201 amends the criminal fraud statute to include Internet communication. It defines the term 'Internet' and how it operates. SEC. 202 introduces Federal Trade Commission sanctions. The Federal Trade Commission will establish rules regarding deceptive practices in online commerce, including unsolicited commercial emails. The term \"Internet\" refers to the interconnected network of computer and telecommunications facilities using TCP/IP to transmit information."
