The Congress recognizes the need for adequate scientific and environmental information before leasing and developing oil and gas resources on the outer Continental Shelf to protect the natural resources of coastal areas. The Secretary of the Interior is responsible for ensuring proper stewardship of public lands and must conduct environmental analysis before leasing lands for oil and gas development to comply with federal laws. The goal is to safeguard marine, coastal, and human environments. To protect marine, coastal, and human environments, citizens of coastal States are entitled to adequate scientific and environmental information with minimal uncertainty before leasing and developing oil and gas resources on the outer Continental Shelf. SEC. 2. AREAS COVERED. This Act applies to specific areas in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, Straits of Florida, and South Atlantic Planning Areas. SEC. 3. RESTRICTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS. The Secretary must complete all required assessments, studies, and research, have them peer-reviewed by qualified scientists, and submit a report to Congress and the Governor of Florida before conducting any activities under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act in specified areas. The Secretary must ensure that oceanographic, ecological, and socioeconomic information is adequate for carrying out responsibilities under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. There are specific prohibitions on preleasing activities in certain areas of the Eastern Gulf of Mexico Planning Area. The Secretary is prohibited from conducting preleasing activities or lease sales in certain areas until after the next oil and gas leasing program is issued under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. SEC. 4. ASSESSMENTS, STUDIES, AND RESEARCH. The assessments, studies, and research mentioned in section 3(a)(1) and (2) include the Assessment of the Historical, Social, and Economic Impacts of Outer Continental Shelf Development on Gulf Coast Communities, the Northeastern Gulf of Mexico Marine Ecosystem Study, and additional physical oceanographic studies recommended by the Northeast Gulf of Mexico Physical Oceanography Workshop. Additional studies or research may be needed to acquire information where current data is inadequate, including physical oceanographic, ecological, and socioeconomic studies. Requests for endangered species and marine mammal surveys may be made to minimize uncertainty about the effects of various activities on the marine, coastal, and human environments of Florida. The expansion of assessments, studies, or research related to the Straits of Florida planning area, including physical oceanographic, ecological, socioeconomic, and environmental studies requested by the Governor of Florida or the Joint Task Force to minimize uncertainty about the effects of preleasing activities. The curr_chunk discusses the effects of preleasing activities, leasing, exploration, production, and drilling on the marine, coastal, and human environment of Florida. It also mentions studies requested to minimize uncertainty about these effects in the South Atlantic planning area. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of a Joint Task Force. The Joint Federal-State Outer Continental Shelf Task Force is established for specific responsibilities under the Act. Membership includes representatives from various agencies and organizations, as well as professionals in relevant scientific fields. The Joint Federal-State Outer Continental Shelf Task Force includes members from various agencies and professionals in scientific fields such as physical oceanography, marine ecology, and social science.
