    "content": "In response to concerns raised by the National Security Agency's Terrorist Surveillance Program, bills were introduced in Congress to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). The FISA provides a framework for electronic surveillance to acquire foreign intelligence information. Bills introduced in the 110th Congress include H.R. 11, S. 187, and S. 139. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) allows for electronic surveillance to gather foreign intelligence information and authorize the production of tangible things for investigations related to international terrorism. The Bush Administration highlighted the limitations of FISA in dealing with terrorists and argued for its amendment. Attorney General Gonzales informed the Senate Judiciary Committee about FISC orders authorizing the targeting of international communications involving suspected al Qaeda members. The Attorney General announced that all surveillance previously conducted under the TSP will now require approval from the FISC. The President has decided not to reauthorize the TSP when the current authorization expires. The NSA program has faced legal and constitutional challenges. The NSA's surveillance program faced legal challenges, with a court ruling it unconstitutional for violating various laws and the Constitution. The decision was appealed to the Sixth Circuit Court, which stayed the judgment pending further review. The dockets for Docket Nos. 06-2140 and 06-2095 mentioned a letter from the appellants' attorneys regarding orders from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Senator William H. Frist introduced the Terrorist Tracking, Identification, and Prosecution Act of 2006, which included the National Security Surveillance Act of 2006, similar to S. 2453 introduced by Senator Arlen Specter. The Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings and considered S. 2453, the National Security Surveillance Act of 2006. The bill was reported out with an amendment and placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar. S. 2453 adds a new Title VII to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, comparing its language with existing provisions. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) gives the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) jurisdiction to review, authorize, and reauthorize electronic surveillance programs for obtaining foreign intelligence information or protecting against international terrorism. Initial authorization can be up to 90 days, with reauthorization for a reasonable period determined by the FISC. If FISC denies authorization, the Attorney General can submit new applications or appeal to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review. New Sec. 702(a) of FISA, Sec. 204 of S. 3886/Sec. 4 of S. 2453 also vests jurisdiction in the FIS Court of Review. The bills give jurisdiction to the FIS Court of Review to receive transfers of cases challenging the legality of classified communications intelligence activities related to foreign threats. The Attorney General can trigger a transfer by filing an affidavit stating that further proceedings in the originating court would harm national security. After review by the FIS Court of Review, the case is sent back to the originating court for further proceedings. The FIS Court of Review has jurisdiction to receive transfers of cases challenging classified communications intelligence activities related to foreign threats. The decision of the FIS Court of Review is subject to U.S. Supreme Court review on certiorari. New requirements for applications for electronic surveillance programs are laid out in the bills. The FISC must make necessary findings to approve an electronic surveillance program. The FISC finds approval of the electronic surveillance program consistent with the U.S. Constitution. New subsections of FISA outline factors for assessing constitutionality and contents of an approval order. Congressional oversight is addressed in new Sec. 705 of FISA. The Attorney General must submit classified reports every 180 days to congressional intelligence committees. A new Title VIII of FISA deals with Executive actions. The new Title VIII of FISA, created by S. 3886 and S. 2453, addresses \"Executive Authority.\" It clarifies that the President's constitutional authority to collect intelligence on foreign powers is not limited. Sections 111, 309, and 404 of FISA are repealed, allowing the President to authorize surveillance without a court order for up to 15 days after a declaration of war. Sec. 208(c) of S. 3886 and Sec. 8(c) of S. 2453 amend 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2511(2)(e) and (f) and Sec. 109 of FISA, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1809. Sec. 209(i) of S. 3886 and Sec. 9(i) of S. 2453 make similar amendments to Sec. 109 of FISA. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511 prohibits interception of communications, with exceptions like official duty electronic surveillance by US officers. The proposed amendments to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(e) and (f) under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 would allow US officers to conduct electronic surveillance in the course of their official duties without it being considered unlawful. This aligns with the existing provisions that permit interception of communications for foreign intelligence purposes. The exclusivity provision in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(f) states that electronic surveillance can only be conducted under the provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, chapter 119, or chapter 121. The exclusivity provision in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(f) states that electronic surveillance can only be conducted under the provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, chapter 119, or chapter 121. Amendments to FISA address criminal sanctions for unauthorized electronic surveillance and disclosure of information obtained through such surveillance. The amended legislation increases criminal liability for unauthorized electronic surveillance and disclosure of information obtained through such surveillance. Penalties under FISA would be increased to a fine of up to $100,000. The amended legislation increases penalties for unauthorized electronic surveillance and disclosure of information obtained through such surveillance under FISA. The fine would be increased to up to $100,000, and imprisonment could be up to 15 years. Amendments to 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1809 are outlined in Sec. 209(i) of S. 3886 and Sec. 9(i) of S. 2453. The legislation increases penalties for unauthorized electronic surveillance under FISA, with fines up to $100,000 and imprisonment up to 15 years. Amendments to definitions in FISA include expanding the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" and updating the definition of \"electronic surveillance.\" The legislation broadens the definition of electronic surveillance under FISA, including intentional collection of information on a person with a reasonable expectation of privacy and acquisition of communication contents requiring a warrant. It also expands the definition of \"Attorney General\" to include designated persons. The legislation broadens the definition of electronic surveillance under FISA to include designated persons by the Attorney General or Acting Attorney General. Minimization procedures are in place to protect non-publicly available information of unconsenting U.S. persons during foreign intelligence surveillance. The legislation broadens the definition of electronic surveillance under FISA to include designated persons by the Attorney General or Acting Attorney General. Procedures permit retention and dissemination of evidence of criminal activity to law enforcement. Minimization procedures also apply to electronic surveillance without a court order for foreign intelligence information. The legislation broadens the definition of electronic surveillance under FISA to include designated persons by the Attorney General or Acting Attorney General. Minimization procedures encompass restrictions on disclosing, disseminating, or retaining communication contents involving a United States person without a court order or threat determination. Amendments in Sec. 209(b) of S. 3886 and Sec. 9(b) of S. 2453 modify the definitions of \"minimization procedures\" and \"contents\" under FISA. Sec. 102 of FISA authorizes electronic surveillance without a court order for up to one year upon certification by the Attorney General. Amendments expand the application to include acquiring the contents of communications of foreign powers or their agents. The proposed amendment to Sec. 102 of FISA would authorize the Attorney General to require providers of electronic communication services to furnish information, facilities, or technical assistance for electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes. The Attorney General may direct electronic communication service providers to assist with electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes under FISA, ensuring secrecy and minimal interference with services provided to customers. The Government can require electronic communication service providers to aid in electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes under FISA, compensating them at the prevailing rate. New provisions allow for electronic surveillance of international radio communications of diplomatically immune persons in the US, with authorization from the President and procedures approved by the Attorney General. The Chief Justice of the United States is authorized to publicly designate individuals for certain purposes under FISA. The Chief Justice of the United States can designate 11 district court judges as FISC judges, with at least three residing within 20 miles of DC. Amendments to FISA include new requirements for electronic surveillance authorization applications. The certification for electronic surveillance for national security purposes is made by appointed officers with Senate approval. Amendments to FISA exclude certain information from surveillance applications for foreign powers. The proposed amendments to FISA would impact the certification process for electronic surveillance for national security purposes, including changes to the approval process and criteria for authorizing surveillance. The proposed amendments to FISA would impact the certification process for electronic surveillance for national security purposes, including changes to the approval process and criteria for authorizing surveillance. This includes redesignating subsections and specifying requirements for electronic surveillance orders. Current subsection 105(d) addresses the exclusion of certain information from applications for court orders authorizing electronic surveillance targeting a foreign power. It requires specific details such as the nature and location of facilities to be surveilled, the period of surveillance approval, and the type of electronic surveillance involved. The proposed amendment would replace the current language with a requirement for each order to specify the type of electronic surveillance. The proposed amendment to subsection 105(d) of FISA would replace current requirements for specific details in surveillance applications with a new requirement for each order to specify the type of electronic surveillance involved. This change would impact the duration and extension of orders under Section 105 of FISA, with different time limits based on the target being an agent of a foreign power or a foreign government. The proposed amendment to FISA would allow for electronic surveillance orders to be approved for up to one year, with extensions granted by the FISC. Emergency surveillance must comply with minimization procedures and can be authorized for up to 72 hours by the Attorney General. The Attorney General can authorize emergency electronic surveillance for up to 72 hours before obtaining a court order, as long as there is a factual basis for the surveillance. The surveillance must be terminated when the information is acquired, if a court order is denied, or after 72 hours. Use or disclosure of information from the surveillance is restricted if a court order is not obtained. The provision allowing emergency electronic surveillance without a court order for up to seven days, if determined necessary by an official authorized by the President, is being amended to replace the current 72-hour limit. The Attorney General must be informed of the surveillance, and notice to a FISC judge is no longer required at the time of authorization. The new provision for emergency electronic surveillance requires informing a FISC judge promptly after authorization. A court order must be sought within seven days, and surveillance ends when information is obtained, application denied, or after seven days. Restrictions on use and disclosure of acquired information remain the same. Sec. 209(f) of S. 3886, Sec. 9(f) of S. 2453, would also modify limitations in liability for those involved in FISA electronic surveillance. The amended provision under FISA limits liability for providers of electronic communication services who assist with electronic surveillance or physical searches in accordance with court orders or emergency requests. Section 106 of FISA restricts the use of information acquired from electronic surveillance on unconsenting U.S. persons and includes notification requirements. The amended provision under FISA includes notification requirements and allows an aggrieved person to move to suppress unlawfully acquired information or surveillance not in conformity with an authorization order. It also modifies the destruction of unintentionally acquired information to require destruction if the communication involves individuals with a reasonable expectation of privacy and all parties are located in the United States. The provision in subsection 106(i) of FISA may be amended to include a new clause regarding the Attorney General's determination of threats. Additionally, a conforming amendment is made to subsection 106(k) to reflect changes in Sec. 104 of FISA. Sec. 209(h) of S. 3886, Sec. 9(h) of S. 2453, amends congressional oversight provisions of FISA to require a feasibility study for a secure document management system for FISC order applications. Sec. 209(i) of S. 3886, Sec. 9(i) of S. 2453, amends FISA to criminalize unauthorized electronic surveillance and disclosure of information obtained through such surveillance. Sec. 109(a) was previously amended to criminalize unauthorized electronic surveillance and disclosure of information obtained through such surveillance. The changes include criminal liability for intentionally engaging in electronic surveillance not authorized by law or the Constitution, and knowingly disclosing or using information obtained through unauthorized surveillance. The new legislation deletes and replaces subsection 109(a) of FISA, amending it with new language. Additionally, sections 209(j) and 209(k)(3) of the bill strike Sections 111 and 309 of FISA, which permit the President to authorize electronic surveillance and physical searches without a court order for foreign intelligence purposes. The new legislation repeals provisions allowing physical searches without a court order for foreign intelligence purposes following a congressional declaration of war. It also updates the definition of \"physical search\" to include any physical intrusion into premises or property within the United States intended to seize, reproduce, inspect, or alter information. Sec. 209(k)(2) of S. 3886 and Sec. 9(k)(2) of S. 2453 propose to replace current criminal provisions in FISA with new language regarding physical searches within the United States for obtaining foreign intelligence information. The new legislation aims to require a warrant for such searches and prohibits the disclosure or use of information obtained through unauthorized physical searches. The proposed legislation aims to require a warrant for physical searches within the United States to obtain foreign intelligence information and prohibits the disclosure or use of information obtained through unauthorized searches. The new language broadens the scope by including searches authorized under the Constitution and criminalizing intentional disclosure or use of information obtained through physical searches. The proposed legislation aims to require a warrant for physical searches within the United States to obtain foreign intelligence information and prohibits the disclosure or use of information obtained through unauthorized searches. Sec. 210 of S. 3886 , Sec. 10 of S. 2453 , would amend the table of contents to FISA to strike the items related to the current Title VII of FISA, and to reflect the creation of the new Titles VII and VIII of FISA in these bills."
