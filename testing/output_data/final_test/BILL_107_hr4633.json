    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Driver's License Modernization Act of 2002\". The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 exposed flaws in the Nation's domestic security, particularly in its identification system. Drivers' licenses and identification cards issued by States are widely used for identity verification but inconsistent requirements and insufficient verification have made them vulnerable to fraud and identity theft. Different designs on these cards have led to a market for fake cards that appear real. Improving the security of State identification systems is crucial, requiring the use of new technology. Identification card technologies that can accommodate various applications will offer the best return on investment. Enhancing the security of drivers' licenses and identification cards will help eliminate multiple licensing, reduce underage purchases of alcohol and tobacco, and significantly decrease identity theft. The State driver's license and identification card programs are crucial for improving security and reducing identity theft. State driver's license and identification card programs are mandated by federal law, requiring each state to have a program in place within 5 years. The programs define driver's licenses and identification cards issued by state motor vehicle agencies. The federal law mandates state driver's license and identification card programs to include computer chips with specific requirements such as containing text data, biometric data, and encryption for security. The federal law mandates state driver's license and identification card programs to include computer chips with specific requirements for data access and biometric data. The federal law requires states to collect and maintain biometric data for driver's licenses and identification cards, which can only be accessed with the individual's cooperation. States must also participate in linking databases for electronic access to information. The federal law mandates states to collect biometric data for driver's licenses and IDs, which can be accessed electronically by other states. State motor vehicle databases must include specific information like data fields on licenses, biometric data, and drivers' histories. The federal law requires states to include tamper-resistant security features on driver's licenses and IDs, as well as document individuals' identities and residences before issuing them. The Secretary will issue guidelines within 6 months to help States comply with the requirements for computer chip technology standards on driver's licenses and IDs. The Secretary will issue guidelines within 6 months for computer chip technology standards on driver's licenses and IDs, including standards for biometric data, linking State motor vehicle databases, and security features. Standards for security features, documentation of identity and residence, and a numbering system for State drivers' licenses and identification cards will be issued by the Secretary within 6 months. The Secretary will issue guidelines for driver's licenses in consultation with relevant organizations and may issue guidelines without following certain administrative procedures. Grants may be provided to states for implementing driver's license programs and linking state motor vehicle databases. The Secretary may provide grants to states for developing computer technologies and databases to link state motor vehicle databases. States must submit applications for grants, which will be evaluated and awarded based on approval. The Federal share of funding for activities funded by the grant will be 100 percent or a lesser percentage determined by the Secretary. Technical assistance from GSA may be provided for this purpose. The Secretary may enter into agreements with States to acquire goods and services from the General Services Administration for activities funded by grants under the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949. Acquisitions must be done efficiently, including through electronic ordering. States receiving grants must submit reports as required by the Secretary. The Secretary may require States receiving grants to submit reports on activity results within 1 year. If a State fails to meet requirements within 5 years, repayment of the grant amount may be required. The Secretary may require States to repay grants if requirements are not met within 5 years of receiving the grant amount. Authorization of appropriations includes $100,000,000 for grants under paragraph (1) and $200,000,000 for grants under paragraph (2). The Secretary may require States to repay grants if requirements are not met within 5 years of receiving the grant amount. Authorization of appropriations includes $100,000,000 for grants under paragraph (1) and $200,000,000 for grants under paragraph (2). Such sums shall remain available until expended. After the 5-year period, no amounts may be appropriated for chapter 303 of title 49, transitioning to the program established under subsection (b)(3). A conforming amendment is made to the analysis for such chapter. SEC. 4. FORGERY OR FALSE USE OF DRIVER'S LICENSE OR IDENTIFICATION CARD. Amendment to Title 18, United States Code, inserting CHAPTER 125--STATE DRIVERS' LICENSES AND IDENTIFICATION CARDS. Sec. 2731 defines 'driver's license' and 'identification card'. Sec. 2732 prohibits forgery, fraudulent acquisition, or false use of driver's license or identification card. The text chunk outlines penalties for obtaining a driver's license through fraudulent means, tampering with the embedded computer chip in a license, or accessing data on the chip unlawfully. Offenders may face fines, imprisonment up to 20 years, or both. SEC. 5. INNOVATIVE USES PILOT PROGRAM. The National Science Foundation may grant funds to States for programs using computer chips in driver's licenses for innovative government services like food stamps and voter registration. The Federal share of funding shall not exceed 50%, with an authorization of $15,000,000 for grants under this section. The National Science Foundation may grant funds to States for programs using computer chips in driver's licenses for innovative government services like food stamps and voter registration. An authorization of $15,000,000 is appropriated for making grants under this section, with such sums remaining available until expended."
