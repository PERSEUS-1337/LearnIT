Congress acknowledges the increased revenues from the North American Free Trade Agreement but notes the lack of federal funding for improving transportation facilities along the US international borders. The 4 States along the US-Mexico border will require significant investments in highway infrastructure and motor carrier safety enforcement due to NAFTA. The increased revenues from NAFTA are recognized by Congress, but there is a lack of federal funding for improving transportation facilities along the US international borders. Significant investments in highway infrastructure and motor carrier safety enforcement will be needed in the 4 States along the US-Mexico border to accommodate NAFTA-generated traffic. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. Definitions include border region, border state, Fund, NAFTA, and Secretary. SEC. 4. DIRECT FEDERAL ASSISTANCE FOR BORDER CONSTRUCTION AND CONGESTION RELIEF. This Act aims to provide federal assistance for border construction and congestion relief in states along the US-Mexico border due to increased traffic from NAFTA. The Secretary will provide grants to border States for transportation projects to relieve traffic congestion and improve motor carrier safety due to increased traffic from NAFTA. Grants will also be given for connecting the National Highway System with Federal border crossing facilities and for weigh-in-motion devices in Mexico. The Secretary will provide grants to border States for the construction, operation, and maintenance of weigh-in-motion devices and commercial vehicle enforcement facilities in the border region. Grants will cover 80% of the project costs, with allocations made by the Secretary from the Fund. The Secretary will allocate remaining Fund amounts among border States based on an equitable formula considering international commercial vehicle traffic volume at ports of entry. The report under section 8 includes the growth of international commercial vehicle traffic in each border State since the enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, as well as the border transportation improvements carried out by each State during the same period. The Border Transportation Infrastructure Fund is established to provide a minimum allocation of 5 percent to each border State for projects eligible for reimbursement if construction began after January 1, 1994. The Border Transportation Infrastructure Fund is established to provide funding for grants under this section. The Secretary of the Treasury will transfer necessary amounts to the Secretary of Transportation for grants and administrative expenses. Title 23, United States Code, applies to grants made under this section. Authorization of Appropriations: $125,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated to the Fund for fiscal years 1998 through 2001. The appropriated amounts will remain available for obligation for three fiscal years. The Secretary may transfer up to $10,000,000 from the Fund to the Attorney General for constructing transportation infrastructure for law enforcement in border States. Additionally, there is a provision for innovative financing for border infrastructure. The section aims to promote State infrastructure banks and advance transportation projects supporting international trade. It authorizes a $100 million Federal line of credit for the Secretary to make available for infrastructure projects. The section authorizes the Secretary to provide lines of credit to border States and New Mexico for infrastructure projects. The amount of credit is based on the State's contributions to the Highway Trust Fund. The Secretary can provide lines of credit to border States and the New Mexico Border Authority for infrastructure projects based on their contributions to the Highway Trust Fund. The credit can be used for funding agreements with State infrastructure banks supporting international trade and commerce in the border region. The subsection allows drawing on credit enhancement from a border infrastructure bank for completed projects when the bank's cash balance is insufficient to pay a claim, and all project revenues are pledged to the bank. No third party creditor rights are permitted for eligible projects. The border infrastructure bank provides credit enhancement for completed projects with insufficient cash balance. Projects eligible for assistance do not have rights against the Federal Government for line of credit guarantees. Interest accrues at the market yield rate on US obligations with 30-year maturities for draws on the line of credit. The border infrastructure bank provides credit enhancement for completed projects with insufficient cash balance, with interest accruing at the market yield rate on US obligations with 30-year maturities. Funds available to States for this purpose are in addition to funds apportioned under section 104 of title 23, United States Code, with defined terms such as 'border State' and 'border region' referencing the Border Infrastructure Safety and Congestion Relief Act of 1996. Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Program is addressed in Section 7.
