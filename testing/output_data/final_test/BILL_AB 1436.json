    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 12300.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code defines an \"authorized representative\" as an individual designated in writing by an applicant or recipient of in-home supportive services to assist with program-related matters. The designated representative must be specified on a form developed by the department, with responsibilities and a revocation option outlined. The authorized representative designation can be revoked or changed by the applicant or recipient at any time. The representative must act in the best interest of the applicant or recipient and cannot represent them in an administrative hearing. An applicant or recipient with a legal representative having decision-making authority related to the program is exempt from completing an authorized representative form, except for a specific purpose. The legal representative can designate an authorized representative and includes a court-appointed guardian, conservator, or a parent for a minor applicant or recipient. Individuals prevented from being service providers under specific sections cannot serve as authorized representatives for applicants or recipients, except for those described in subdivision (e). An authorized representative can sign documents for in-home supportive services on behalf of the recipient if specified by the recipient on the authorized representative form. However, a provider of services cannot sign their own timesheet unless specified in subdivision (e). Legal representatives specified in subdivision (e) must complete an authorized representative form for administrative processing. The department, in consultation with relevant parties, will develop a standardized statewide form and procedures for designating an authorized representative for in-home supportive services. The form will include notification of requirements and the representative's agreement to abide by them. When an applicant or recipient designates an authorized representative, the county retains the form in the case file and provides copies to the designated individual. The department may implement and administer this section through all-county letters or similar instructions until regulations are adopted, with emergency regulations to be in place by July 1, 2016. The initial adoption of emergency regulations and one readoption shall be deemed necessary for the immediate preservation of public peace, health, safety, or general welfare. These regulations are exempt from review by the Office of Administrative Law and shall remain in effect for no more than 180 days. If the Commission on State Mandates finds that this act imposes state-mandated costs, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts will be provided according to the Government Code."
