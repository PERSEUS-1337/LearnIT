    "title": "AB 2284",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 10708 of the Elections Code states that a State Senator or Member of the Assembly who resigns before their term ends must reimburse the county for expenses related to a special election from their surplus campaign funds. If they do not have enough funds, they will be personally liable for the expenses. If a legislative district spans multiple counties, surplus campaign funds will be divided among the counties based on their percentage of the district. Candidates for state office can only accept contributions within specified limits and all funds in the campaign account are for election or office-related expenses. State Senators or Members of the Assembly who resign must use funds for campaign debts or expenses. A rebuttable presumption exists that they decided to resign six months before leaving office. The funds are subject to Section 89519 if they become surplus funds. Upon leaving office, campaign funds must be disclosed and used for specific purposes such as paying debts, expenses, or making donations to eligible organizations. Contributions to a political party committee can be used for voter registration, get-out-the-vote activities, and slate mailers. Contributions can also support or oppose candidates for federal office, out-of-state elective office, or ballot measures. The committee can use surplus campaign funds to pay for professional services, attorney's fees, litigation costs, and expenses for special elections. Any remaining funds must be used for specific purposes outlined in the subdivision. A former officeholder can only use surplus funds for specific purposes outlined in the subdivision, including professional services, attorney's fees, litigation costs, and expenses for special elections. Once certain costs are paid, surplus funds can also be used for additional purposes. The section allows for the payment or reimbursement of costs for installing and monitoring an electronic security system for a candidate or elected officer facing threats to their safety. The threats must be related to their role, reported to law enforcement, and verified by them. Expenditures made under this section must be reported to the Commission. The section allows for the payment or reimbursement of costs for installing and monitoring an electronic security system for a candidate or elected officer facing threats to their safety. The threats must be related to their role, reported to law enforcement, and verified by them. Expenditures made under this section must be reported to the Commission. No more than $5,000 in surplus campaign funds may be used for this purpose, and the candidate or elected officer must reimburse the surplus fund account for the security system within two years. The electronic security system is owned by the campaign committee of the candidate or elected officer. The bill does not require reimbursement under the California Constitution. It creates, eliminates, or changes penalties for crimes or infractions. The Legislature states that the bill aligns with the Political Reform Act of 1974."
