    "content": "In 2006, nearly 105,000 horses were slaughtered for human consumption in foreign-owned plants in Texas and Illinois. The meat was mainly exported to countries like France, Belgium, and Japan, with the United States exporting over 17,000 metric tons valued at $65 million. Despite a rise in horse slaughter since 2002, it remained below levels seen in the 1980s. Advocates continue to push for federal legislation to permanently ban horse slaughter in the U.S. Legislation is being pushed to ban horse slaughter permanently in the U.S. Concerns are raised about horses being shipped to Canada and Mexico for slaughter. Federal laws do not currently ban the use of horses for food or set on-farm care standards. U.S. horse slaughter plants were previously subject to the Federal Meat Inspection Act to ensure meat safety. The FSIS ensures the safety of products from animals through mandatory inspections. Meat inspectors enforce the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act, requiring livestock to be unconscious before slaughter. Plants can request USDA graders for official product grades, paying user fees for this voluntary service under the Agricultural Marketing Act. FSIS also provides voluntary food safety inspections under the 1946 AMA for products not covered by other inspection acts. Horses were transported long distances to U.S. plants for slaughter until 2007. In 1996, language in the farm bill authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to regulate horse transport. Guidelines were developed by USDA's APHIS and became effective in 2002. Regulations for the humane treatment of horses bound for slaughter were amended in 9 C.F.R. Part 88. The regulations for horses bound for slaughter were updated in 2011, banning the use of double-deck trailers for transportation to slaughterhouses. A federal lawsuit was filed by Texas slaughter plants seeking to overturn a state law banning the sale of horsemeat, but the U.S. Court of Appeals rejected their arguments in 2007. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld the Texas law banning horse slaughter, allowing the state attorney general to prosecute plant owners. Two plants stopped slaughtering horses for human consumption. Illinois also banned horse slaughter in 2007, with the Cavel International plant closing in 2007 after a court ruling. Some states are considering opening horse processing facilities following federal legislation, including Montana. Legislation in Montana and Nebraska allowed for equine processing facilities, while Oklahoma passed bills to permit horse slaughter but maintained a ban on horsemeat sales in the state. Amendments in 2005 prohibited funds for horse inspection under the meat inspection act, delaying the effective date by 120 days. The 2005 amendments prohibited funds for horse inspection under the meat inspection act, delaying the effective date by 120 days. The final House-Senate report clarified that the Department is obligated to provide inspection for meat intended for human consumption, but funding limitations prevent the use of appropriations for horse inspection. Subsequently, three plants petitioned USDA for voluntary ante-mortem inspection under the 1946 AMA, with funding from user fees. On February 8, 2006, USDA used AMA authority to publish an interim rule allowing post-mortem horse inspection under the FMIA. This rule applied to horses starting March 10, 2006, using similar guidelines as ante-mortem inspection. Congressional supporters of the original amendment objected, stating it circumvented their intent to halt horse slaughter. The FY2008 USDA appropriation bill included a ban on using funds for horse inspection for human food, which was continued in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 and the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009. This prohibition also extended to user fees for horse inspection. The FY2008 USDA appropriation bill banned funds for horse inspection for human food, which continued in subsequent appropriations acts. The Safeguard American Food Exports (SAFE) Act introduced in the 113th Congress aims to prohibit the sale or transport of equines for human consumption. The American Horse Slaughter Prevention Act of 2011 aimed to amend the Horse Protection Act to ban the slaughter of horses for human consumption. A provision in the FY2012 Agriculture appropriations bill also prohibited funds for inspecting horse meat. The American Horse Slaughter Prevention Act of 2011 aimed to ban horse slaughter for human consumption. The provision in the FY2012 Agriculture appropriations bill prohibited funds for inspecting horse meat. However, without this provision, FSIS can inspect horse meat again. USDA mentioned regulatory obstacles to resurrecting horse slaughter in the US, including the need for a federal grant of inspection and a Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) plan. Valley Meats, Inc. in New Mexico was granted a permit to begin horse slaughter, with plans for similar permits in Iowa. The USDA granted operating permits for horse slaughter plants in Iowa and Missouri in July 2013. The New Mexico plant sued the USDA in February 2013 for delaying approval. Legislation in 2014 aimed to prohibit FSIS from inspecting horses under the Federal Meat Inspection Act. The Administration and USDA requested the ban on horse slaughter to continue, citing a rise in horse neglect and abandoned horses since the ban in 2007. Some opponents of the horse slaughter ban argue that humane slaughter in the US is better than less regulated slaughter in Mexico or abandoning horses to starve. The New Mexico Horse Council supports a facility granted an operating permit, stating that humane slaughter is preferable to abandonment or long-distance transport. Legislation was introduced to make horse slaughter illegal under Title 18 of the US Code. Legislation was introduced as companion bills to amend Title 18 of the U.S. Code, making it illegal to possess, transport, or sell horses intended for human consumption. Violators could face fines or up to three years in prison. Another measure aimed to prohibit transporting horses in double-decker trailers, with violators facing civil penalties. The bills were referred to respective committees but saw no further action in the 111th Congress. In the 110th Congress, bills were introduced to ban the movement and slaughter of horses for human food. The Judiciary Committee held a hearing on one bill, H.R. 6598, and ordered it to be favorably reported. Companion bills introduced by Representative Schakowsky and Senator Landrieu aimed to amend the Horse Protection Act to prohibit various activities involving horses. The bills introduced in the 110th Congress aimed to ban the slaughter of horses for human consumption. They would have allowed the USDA to detain horses suspected of being slaughtered for food and increased funding for administering the act. The full House approved H.R. 503, but Senate action did not occur. Proposed bills in the 108th Congress to halt horse slaughter did not progress. In the 108th Congress, proposed bills (H.R. 857 and S. 2352) aimed to halt horse slaughter but did not amend the Horse Protection Act. These bills required officials to work with animal welfare societies and animal control departments to place confiscated horses with a nonprofit animal rescue facility, and the owner of a confiscated horse had to post a bond for care. The Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 also addressed the protection of wild horses and burros on federal lands. In the 112th and 113th Congress, bills were introduced to manage free-roaming wild horses in North Carolina, but no further action was taken. The American Horse Slaughter Prevention Act of 2011 aimed to prohibit the slaughter of horses and other equines. Wild horse and burro management details can be found in a CRS report. The cultural acceptance of certain types of meat varies globally. While horses are seen as performance animals in the US, they are consumed in countries like France, Belgium, and Italy. Horse slaughter for human consumption is opposed by many Americans due to concerns about cruelty and poor transport conditions. Horses are transported long distances in poor conditions for slaughter, but there is a push for humane care. The AVMA and AAEP opposed a bill banning horse slaughter due to concerns about care for unwanted horses. Opponents of a ban on horse slaughter argue that rescued horses may face neglect and abuse from owners who lack the resources to care for them. The existing U.S. horse infrastructure may not be able to handle the large numbers of horses that would be affected by a slaughter prohibition. The American Horse Protection Association (AHPA) is against horse slaughter for food but did not support the ban bills in the 108th Congress due to concerns about the capacity of sanctuaries to take in large numbers of horses. The National Horse Protection Coalition (NHPC) and others argue that equine rescues lack national oversight and accreditation programs, leading to concerns about the care of rescued horses. While state and local laws exist for animal welfare, there is debate over the effectiveness of these regulations in ensuring proper care standards. Equine shelters are noted to be less established compared to cat and dog shelters, with challenges such as high costs and limited resources. The American Association of Equine Practitioners estimated the annual cost of caring for a horse at $1,825, excluding veterinary and farrier care. A more recent study put the cost at $2,340. The NHPC argues for alternatives to slaughter, such as keeping horses longer, selling them to new owners, or humane euthanasia by a licensed veterinarian. Euthanasia methods are considered more humane than slaughter, which involves stunning with a captive bolt. Euthanasia is a more humane alternative to slaughter for horses, costing $50 to $150 per horse. Opponents of a slaughter ban argue that disposing of additional horses could lead to environmental issues, while supporters believe the existing system can handle the disposal of 90,000 more horses annually. In 2006, the US exported 26,000 live horses to Canada and 19,000 to Mexico. In 2010, nearly 138,000 horses were transported to Mexico and Canada for slaughter. The American Veterinary Medical Association opposes the slaughter ban legislation, stating that most of these horses would have been slaughtered for food in those countries regardless. Supporters of legislation to ban horse slaughter argue that bills like H.R. 503 and S. 727 aim to prevent horse exports for slaughter. Critics mention enforcement challenges once horses leave the country. The Government Accountability Office reported an increase in horse neglect cases and abandoned horses since 2007, with states like California, Texas, and Florida seeing more abandoned horses on private or state land. Certain animal welfare organizations questioned the impact of ending horse slaughter on enforcement challenges at borders and foreign slaughtering facilities. The GAO report highlighted the lack of resources and staff at USDA since domestic horse slaughter ceased, leading to difficulties in identifying issues with shipping paperwork and horse conditions before slaughter."
