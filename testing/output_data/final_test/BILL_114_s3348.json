    "content": "The \"Presidential Tax Transparency Act\" requires certain presidential candidates to disclose their recent tax returns. The \"Presidential Tax Transparency Act\" mandates major party presidential candidates to submit their 3 most recent tax returns to the Federal Election Commission within 15 days of nomination. If no returns are filed, a procedure is outlined for non-compliance. The \"Presidential Tax Transparency Act\" requires presidential candidates to submit their 3 most recent tax returns to the Federal Election Commission within 15 days of nomination. The Chairman of the Commission can request the Secretary of the Treasury to provide the returns if not submitted. The returns will be made publicly available, with certain information redacted by the Commission in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury. The Commission, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, determines appropriate definitions for \"major party\" and \"income tax return.\" A special rule for 2016 allows candidates to submit tax returns within 7 days of the enactment of the subsection. The subsection allows candidates nominated for the office of President in 2016 to submit tax returns within specific time frames. The Federal Election Commission may disclose tax returns of presidential candidates nominated by major parties for public viewing. If a candidate does not provide their returns, the FEC can request them from the Secretary of the Treasury. The Federal Election Commission can request income tax returns from major party presidential candidates for public viewing, as per the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. The term 'applicable returns' refers to the candidate's income tax returns for the three most recent taxable years. The code is amended to include (23) in addition to (22) in certain sections. The amendments will take effect upon the enactment of this Act."
