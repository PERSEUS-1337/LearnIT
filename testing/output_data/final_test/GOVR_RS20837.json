    "content": "The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 replaced the AFDC program with TANF and made changes to the CSE program, including how child support collections are distributed. The rules for child support arrearage payments have become more complex, with federal and state laws determining who receives them. The rules for child support arrearage payments are determined by federal and state laws, with assignment and distribution rules in place. The order of distribution depends on various factors such as when arrearages accrued, when child support was assigned to the state, and how arrearages were collected. The complexity of child support distribution rules decreased in October 2000, but confusion remains regarding the six categories of arrearages. TANF eligibility requires the assignment of current and past-due child support payments to the state. This includes permanently-assigned arrearages and pre-assistance arrearages, which are temporarily assigned while receiving TANF assistance. The 1996 welfare reform law repealed the required $50 pass through of current monthly child support payments collected on behalf of an AFDC family. States now have the choice to decide how much of the state share of child support collected to retain. The 1996 welfare reform law repealed the required $50 pass through of current monthly child support payments collected on behalf of an AFDC family. States now have the choice to decide how much of the state share of child support collected to retain. If a state elects the pass-through option, it must still pay the federal share of the collection to the federal government. The state can choose to give all, a portion, or none of its share to families, without affecting TANF eligibility or benefit amount. Some states send families two checks, one for TANF benefits and another for child support payments from the noncustodial parent. Under prior law, child support arrearage payments were divided between the state and federal governments to reimburse them for AFDC. However, under P.L.104-193, payments to families who leave TANF are more generous, with arrearages paid to the family first. If a custodial parent assigned child support rights to the state before October 1, 1997, all support rights had to be assigned for support payments.

If a custodial parent assigned child support rights to the state before October 1, 1997, all support rights had to be assigned for support payments. From October 1, 1997 to October 1, 2000, custodial parents had to assign all support rights for both current and past-due payments accrued while the family is receiving TANF benefits. Since October 1, 1997, TANF applicants or recipients temporarily assign support rights to the state until they stop receiving benefits. These arrearages become conditionally-assigned when the family leaves TANF, with collection methods determining payment recipients. States must distribute current child support to former TANF families. Since October 1, 1997, states are required to distribute current child support and child support arrearages to former TANF families before being reimbursed for TANF payments. An exception is made for arrearages collected through the federal income tax refund offset program. Child support arrearages assigned to the state may affect the family's claim on payments. If a custodial parent assigns their support rights to the state while receiving TANF benefits, all support rights must be assigned. The state must first distribute collected amounts to the former welfare family before being reimbursed for TANF payments. The collected amount for child support obligations is distributed to former welfare families. Any remaining money is used to pay off arrearages accrued after leaving welfare, pre-assistance arrearages, and reimburse the state and federal government for TANF benefits. The federal government reimburses cash assistance to families from child support collections. Any remaining funds are paid to the family, except for arrearages collected through federal income tax refunds, which are paid to the state. The state can only retain arrearages assigned to them to reimburse cash assistance. If the tax offset collection exceeds the amount retained, the excess must be distributed to the family. States are now required to pay a higher fraction of child support collections on arrearages to families that have left welfare. Custodial parents and noncustodial parents are dissatisfied with the current child support distribution system. Custodial parents argue that child support arrearages belong to them and had to rely on family and friends for financial assistance when the noncustodial parent failed to pay. Noncustodial parents want pre-welfare arrearage payments to go to them, not the state. They are frustrated that their child support payments are not directly benefiting their children. States and the federal government keep collections from the federal income tax refund offset program, which is a significant source of arrearage collection. Some observers believe the dual mission of the CSE program has made the distribution system complex since its inception in 1975. States retain only 10% of child support collections, arguing for continued retention to improve CSE programs for families on TANF. Members of the 107th Congress favored paying former welfare families all arrearages collected on their behalf. The House passed welfare reauthorization bills (H.R. 4737 and H.R. 4) to incentivize states to distribute more child support collections to ex-welfare families and simplify distribution rules. The bills aimed to pay arrearages to former welfare families before reimbursing the government."
