    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"FAIR Energy Policy Act\" and aims to phase out tax preferences for fossil fuels. The \"FAIR Energy Policy Act\" aims to phase out tax preferences for fossil fuels, including special deductions, tax rates, and credits that have been in place for over 100 years for oil and gas production and over 80 years for coal production. As renewable energy tax credits are phased out, fossil fuel tax preferences should also be phased out on the same schedule. Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 are proposed to address expensing of Intangible Drilling Costs. The \"FAIR Energy Policy Act\" proposes to phase out tax preferences for fossil fuels, including deductions for intangible drilling costs for major integrated oil companies. The deduction for such costs will be reduced by 20% for costs incurred after December 31, 2016, and before January 1, 2018, with further reductions in subsequent years leading to a 100% reduction after December 31, 2019. The \"FAIR Energy Policy Act\" proposes to phase out tax preferences for fossil fuels, including deductions for intangible drilling costs for major integrated oil companies. For crude oil or natural gas produced after December 31, 2016, and before January 1, 2018, the deduction will be reduced by 20%. The \"FAIR Energy Policy Act\" proposes to phase out tax preferences for fossil fuels, including deductions for intangible drilling costs for major integrated oil companies. For crude oil or natural gas produced after December 31, 2017, the deduction will be reduced by 40%, increasing to 60% for production after December 31, 2018, and reaching 100% for production after December 31, 2019. Additionally, a phase-out of deduction for oil-related qualified production activities income is proposed for major integrated oil companies. The deduction for oil-related qualified production activities income for major integrated oil companies will be reduced by 20% for income received or accrued after December 31, 2016, and before January 1, 2018, 40% for income received or accrued after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2019.

Additionally, there will be a phase-out of amortization of geological and geophysical expenditures for dual capacity taxpayers who are major integrated oil companies. The geophysical expenses deductible under this subsection will be reduced by specified percentages based on the timing of the expenses incurred. Additionally, there will be a new subsection added to amend the percentage depletion for oil shale in the tax code. The tax code will phase out percentage depletion for oil shale for major integrated oil companies, reducing depletion allowance by 20% for income after Dec 31, 2016, and before Jan 1, 2018, 40% for income after Dec 31, 2017, and before Jan 1, 2019, 60% for income after Dec 31, 2018, and before Jan 1, 2020. The tax code phases out expensing of exploration and development costs for oil shale for major integrated oil companies. The deduction allowed is reduced by 20% for expenditures after Dec 31, 2016, and before Jan 1, 2018, and by 40% for expenditures after Dec 31, 2017, and before Jan 1, 2019.

The tax code phases out capital gains treatment for coal royalties, with reductions in percentages for transactions after specific dates. Additionally, there is an exception to passive loss limitation for working interests in oil and natural gas properties. The tax code reduces losses from working interests in oil and gas properties for major integrated oil companies over specific time periods. The tax code reduces losses for major integrated oil companies in the form of a phase-out of the marginal wells credit over specific time periods. The tax code reduces losses for major integrated oil companies by phasing out the marginal wells credit over specific time periods. Qualified crude oil and natural gas production between December 31, 2018, and January 1, 2020, is reduced by 60%, while production after December 31, 2019, is reduced by 100%."
