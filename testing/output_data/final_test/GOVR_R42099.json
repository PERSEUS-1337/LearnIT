    "content": "Carrying a concealed firearm is primarily regulated by individual states, each with its own eligibility laws and reciprocity agreements for out-of-state permits. Congress has passed laws allowing certain individuals to carry concealed firearms across state lines and on federal lands. There are ongoing discussions in Congress about nationwide concealed carry and permitting it on additional federal lands. This report outlines state regulations on concealed carry and summarizes relevant federal laws. Carrying a concealed firearm is regulated by individual states, with \"shall-issue\" and \"may-issue\" states issuing permits to residents and non-residents. Federal laws also govern concealed carry, with ongoing discussions in Congress about nationwide concealed carry and permitting it on federal lands. This report does not cover carrying firearms on military installations by military personnel. In \"may-issue\" jurisdictions, the issuing authority has discretion to grant or deny a CCP based on statutory factors. North Carolina is a \"shall-issue\" state, while California is a \"may-issue\" state where permits are granted at the sheriff's discretion. Obtaining a permit in \"may-issue\" states is typically more difficult. In \"may-issue\" states, obtaining a permit can be more challenging due to the issuing authority's discretion. Some jurisdictions labeled as \"shall-issue\" may still require evidence of good character or proper cause for a concealed carry permit. Illinois and the District of Columbia prohibit concealed carry, while states like Alaska, Vermont, Arizona, and Wyoming do not require residents to have a permit. Some states like Alaska, Vermont, Arizona, and Wyoming do not require residents to have concealed carry permits. However, they may issue permits for reciprocity with other states. States enter into reciprocity agreements based on similar concealed carry requirements, such as age restrictions and background checks. These agreements can change periodically. The state of Florida's Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Division of Licensing monitors changing gun laws in other states and negotiates reciprocity agreements. The list was last updated on January 1, 2011, adding Iowa to the reciprocity list. Nevada ceased reciprocity with Florida effective July 1, 2009. Some states only honor out-of-state permits if the licensee holds a permit from their state of residence. Some states only honor out-of-state permits if the licensee holds a permit from their state of residence. For example, Colorado allows out-of-state permits if the holder is 21 years or older and a resident of the issuing state. Utah exempts permit holders from unlawful carrying penalties, regardless of residency. Carrying a concealed firearm requires a permit issued by the state or another jurisdiction. Michigan mandates a CCP for pistol possession, except when transporting an unloaded and disassembled firearm in a vehicle. Maryland has similar regulations. In Maryland, it is unlawful to transport a handgun without a license, except when carried unloaded in an enclosed case. New York requires a state license to transport a firearm with no exceptions, but there is a federal safe harbor under Section 926A of title 18 of the U.S. Code for interstate transportation without violating state laws. In 1986, the Firearm Owners Protection Act (FOPA) was enacted, and shortly after, a bill was introduced to amend certain provisions in title 18 of the U.S. Code, including Section 926A which allows for the transportation of firearms for lawful purposes under specific conditions. Section 926A of the U.S. Code allows for the transportation of firearms in a vehicle, with specific conditions such as keeping the firearm in a locked container. The purpose of this provision is to provide a \"safe harbor for interstate travelers\" to prevent them from violating state laws regarding firearm transportation. Section 926A of the U.S. Code provides a safe harbor for interstate travelers transporting firearms, allowing them to do so as long as they meet certain conditions. Failure to comply may result in violating state laws on firearm transportation. This provision only applies once individuals leave their home jurisdiction and does not override state or local laws at the destination. Section 926A of the U.S. Code provides a safe harbor for interstate travelers transporting firearms, allowing them to do so as long as they meet certain conditions. This provision does not preempt the transportation or possession laws of the origin or destination state, and does not act as a safe harbor at the place of origin or destination if those jurisdictions have specific requirements. The legislative history clarifies that Section 926A is intended for transporting firearms in a vehicle, not for concealed carry on one's person. Representative McCollum emphasized that the term 'carry' refers to transporting the firearm in a vehicle, and does not require a state license for concealed carry to be valid under the safe harbor provision. The decision In Re Matter of Two Seized Firearms shows a court declining to apply Section 926A due to failure to meet safe harbor requirements. The case highlights confusion between carrying and transporting firearms. The Supreme Court of New Jersey questioned allowing a motorist from Florida to carry a loaded handgun on the New Jersey Turnpike. The defendant claimed Florida laws allowed loaded guns in cars, but the prosecutor cited Florida statutes allowing firearm transportation. The defendant's belief about carrying loaded firearms in vehicles clashed with the prosecutor's interpretation of Florida law on firearm transportation. The court emphasized that to be protected under Section 926A, the gun owner must be legally qualified, transport the firearm unloaded, and ensure it is not readily accessible from the vehicle's passenger compartment. The defendant failed to meet these requirements. The court found the defendant did not comply with storage provisions of Section 926A, therefore, he had no federally protected right to transport loaded revolvers in the glove compartment. The New Jersey Supreme Court's decision in Revell v. Port Authority of New York, New Jersey also showed the challenges in applying Section 926A outside of vehicular travel. The court in Revell ruled that Section 926A did not protect an individual who had to stay overnight in a hotel after missing a connecting flight, even though he properly declared his unloaded firearm before his outgoing flight from Utah. The court suggested that a gun owner should request their firearm and ammunition to be held overnight at an airport hotel to comply with Section 926A, even though the law is unclear about this situation. This was seen as a reasonable way for responsible gun owners to maintain federal protection and avoid local gun regulations. The federal laws discussed in this section, such as the Armored Car Industry Reciprocity Act of 1993, the Arming Pilots Against Terrorism Act of 2002, and the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2003, authorize certain individuals to carry concealed firearms across state lines, bypassing state regulations. Federal agents are generally allowed to carry firearms nationwide for duty purposes, but off-duty policies vary by agency. The Armored Car Industry Reciprocity Act of 1993 allows armored car crew members with licenses to carry weapons across state lines while on duty. State reciprocity for the weapons license is managed at the state level, with specific requirements for licensing and employment by an armored car company. The Armored Car Industry Reciprocity Act of 1993 allows armored car employees to carry weapons across state lines if they meet state requirements. State agencies must ensure crew members receive proper training and pass background checks for weapon possession. State weapons licenses must be renewed every two or five years. The Arming Pilots Against Terrorism Act of 2002 established the Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO) program, allowing volunteer pilots to be deputized by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to carry firearms while on duty. The program requirements are set by the TSA Administrator. Off-duty activities and personal weapons are not covered under this permission. Pilots participating in the FFDO program can be deputized by the TSA Administrator to defend flight decks against criminal violence or air piracy. They are not compensated by the government but are considered federal employees for liability purposes. Pilots must apply and meet qualifications set by the TSA Administrator, including completing required training. Deputization lasts for five years. Deputization in the FFDO program lasts for five years if training is completed satisfactorily. FFDOs are federal law enforcement officers for specific purposes, such as carrying firearms to defend the flight deck. They are issued firearms and equipment by the Federal Air Marshal Service and can carry a private firearm if it meets program requirements. FFDOs are not authorized to exercise other law enforcement powers outside the jurisdiction of aircraft flight decks. The Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act (LEOSA) allows qualified law enforcement officers to carry concealed firearms across state lines with proper identification and meeting statutory requirements. This authority does not extend to off-duty activities. Under LEOSA, a \"qualified LEO\" is a government agency employee authorized by law to engage in law enforcement activities, carry a firearm, meet agency firearm qualification standards, not be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and not prohibited by federal law from receiving a firearm. The LEOSA Improvements Act expanded this to include LEOs from the Amtrak Police Department, Federal Reserve, and other federal executive branches with arrest powers. Qualified Law Enforcement Officers (LEOs) with statutory arrest powers can carry concealed firearms interstate if they have a photo ID from their agency. The type of firearm is not restricted as long as it meets federal definitions. The LEOSA Improvements Act broadened the definition of \"qualified retired LEO\" to include more individuals. The LEOSA Improvements Act expanded the definition of \"qualified retired LEOs\" to include those who served in specific law enforcement roles. A 2005 directive by the Attorney General complicated the process for retired federal LEOs to obtain certification, leading to challenges in meeting firearms testing requirements. The Act aimed to alleviate the burden on states by amending standards for retired LEOs. The LEOSA Improvements Act amended standards for retired LEOs to provide more options for obtaining firearms training certification. Retired LEOs must meet qualification standards set by their former agency, state of residence, or a certified firearms instructor. They must obtain certification at their own expense and carry a necessary ID card. The LEOSA Improvements Act amended standards for retired LEOs to provide more options for obtaining firearms training certification. Retired LEOs must meet qualification standards set by their former agency, state of residence, or a certified firearms instructor and carry a necessary ID card. The ID can be issued by the agency or state, indicating that the individual has met active duty standards for firearms training within one year of issuance. The LEOSA Improvements Act amended standards for retired LEOs to provide more options for obtaining firearms training certification. Unlike active officers, qualified retired LEOs may be limited in the types of firearms they can carry under the act. The act allows certain LEOs to carry concealed firearms, but it does not supersede state laws that permit private entities to restrict firearms possession on their property. The Credit Card Act of 2009 amendment prevents the Secretary of the Interior from prohibiting individuals from possessing firearms in National Parks or Wildlife Refuges. Individuals carrying firearms must follow state laws. Various concealed carry bills have been introduced in the 112th Congress, including H.R. 822. Several concealed carry bills have been introduced in the 112th Congress. H.R. 822 would require states to recognize out-of-state concealed carry permits with certain conditions. H.R. 2900 authorizes nationwide concealed carry. S. 176 would establish minimum standards for concealed carry permits. S. 1588 would allow carrying firearms on federal lands under the Army Corps of Engineers' jurisdiction. Representative Cliff Stearns introduced H.R. 822, the National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act of 2011. H.R. 822, passed by the House of Representatives on November 16, 2011, allows individuals to carry concealed handguns into other states with specific requirements. This bill does not permit carrying concealed firearms in states like Illinois and the District of Columbia due to their restrictions on concealed carry. Individuals may not be able to carry concealed in the District of Columbia under H.R. 822 as DC law does not allow for concealed carry permits. While residents are not expressly prohibited from carrying concealed, the law requires a license for carrying a pistol. Any previously issued concealed carry permits in DC would have likely expired after one year, making it unlikely for individuals to lawfully carry concealed. Individuals in the District of Columbia may argue that they can carry concealed firearms with an out-of-state permit under H.R. 822, despite DC's laws not expressly prohibiting concealed carry. However, it is uncertain if the court would consider DC's laws or the practical effect of them. The bill also prohibits individuals from obtaining out-of-state permits with less restrictive eligibility requirements to carry concealed in their state of residence. Residents from states like California, Florida, or Colorado who do not meet the age requirement cannot obtain non-resident permits from states like Idaho, Indiana, and Maine, which issue permits to individuals 18 years and older. Under H.R. 822, states would have to honor out-of-state permits, potentially preempting their own eligibility standards. For example, Oregon, a \"shall-issue\" state, would be required to recognize all out-of-state permits. Under H.R. 822, states with varying concealed carry permit regulations would be required to recognize out-of-state permits, even if the individual is not a resident of the issuing state. This includes \"may-issue\" states having to recognize permits from \"shall-issue\" jurisdictions, and states that do not currently recognize each other's permits would also be required to do so. Additionally, individuals would be prevented from obtaining an out-of-state permit to carry concealed back in their state of residence. H.R. 822 allows individuals with concealed carry permits from their state of residence to carry in other states, subject to the same conditions and limitations as residents of that state. However, they are not required to meet the eligibility requirements of the state they are traveling to. H.R. 822 allows individuals with concealed carry permits to carry in other states, subject to the same conditions as residents of that state. The Franks substitute removes the provision that requires visitors to abide by the same restrictions as residents. H.R. 2900, the Secure Access to Firearms Enhancement Act of 2011, introduced by Representative Paul Broun, allows individuals with valid concealed carry permits to carry in any state, regardless of residency, subject to state-specific restrictions on where firearms can be carried. Residents from states like Vermont, Alaska, and Arizona would not need a concealed carry permit to carry in another state under this bill. Under S. 176, introduced by Senator Barbara Boxer, states allowing concealed carry must establish a permitting process with eligibility requirements. Applicants must be US residents, 21 or older, show good cause, and prove they are trustworthy to carry concealed firearms in public. This bill would allow individuals to obtain an out-of-state CCP if not initially eligible in their state of residence. The bill S. 1588, introduced by Senator Jim Webb, aims to prohibit the Secretary of the Army from enforcing regulations that restrict individuals from possessing firearms at water resources projects managed by the Army Corps of Engineers. It may require states like Vermont and Alaska to amend their laws to mandate residents to obtain concealed carry permits. The bill does not explicitly address reciprocity for state-issued CCP holders to carry in other states. The bill S. 1588 introduced by Senator Jim Webb aims to allow individuals to possess firearms at water resources projects managed by the Army Corps of Engineers. Individuals must comply with state concealed carry laws where the project is located, similar to National Parks legislation."
