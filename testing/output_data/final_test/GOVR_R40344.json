    "content": "The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a federation of seven emirates with national authority held by a Federal Supreme Council. Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, ruler of Abu Dhabi, became UAE president in 2004 after his father's death. Abu Dhabi and Dubai are the wealthiest and most influential emirates, with the ruler of Abu Dhabi traditionally serving as president and the ruler of Dubai as vice president. The UAE is a federation of seven emirates with national authority held by a Federal Supreme Council. The Supreme Council appoints the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers, which initiates legislation for ratification by the president. The UAE has close relations with the United States, including military cooperation and arms sales. The UAE has close relations with the United States, including potential arms sales such as the Terminal High Altitude Air Defense system. Bilateral trade has increased, with the UAE being the largest U.S. export market in the Middle East. The UAE exports over 2 million barrels of oil per day and has plans to acquire nuclear energy production technology. The UAE plans to acquire nuclear energy production technology to meet national energy needs, amid global concerns about nuclear proliferation. Regional scrutiny in the Middle East focuses on motives for nuclear technology, with fears of Iran's program and Israel's nuclear weapons influencing others. Safety concerns include terrorist attacks and political instability. UAE officials are addressing proliferation and security risks with planned measures. The UAE has announced plans to address proliferation and security concerns by forgoing domestic uranium enrichment and relying on international sources for nuclear fuel. Policymakers in Abu Dhabi have set an ambitious agenda for the nuclear program, with operating and regulatory bodies already in place. The end goal is to build a nuclear energy program to meet national needs. The UAE's nuclear program aims to build a fleet of nuclear power plants to generate electricity, with the first reactor being constructed by KEPCO of South Korea. The plant will be located at Baraka near Abu Dhabi's border with Saudi Arabia, with all four plants scheduled to be online by 2020. KEPCO has secured $10 billion in financing from Kexim for the project. UAE officials estimate the need to expand power generation capacity to 40 gigawatts by 2020 to meet demand growth. Despite economic slowdown, the UAE nuclear program remains confident in their energy demand projections. Cost and energy use data for the nuclear program have not been publicly shared. The UAE government considers nuclear energy as a solution to the country's future energy needs due to insufficient natural gas reserves. They currently export gas to Japan and import from Qatar. Crude oil and diesel are seen as viable but costly options, while coal is considered more economical but with higher environmental costs. The UAE government aims to build a fleet of nuclear power plants to meet energy demands, with the first plant expected to be operational by 2017. Solar and wind energy sources are considered insufficient, and the country plans to expand nuclear capacity with the help of South Korea's Korea Electric Power. The UAE government selected South Korea's Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) as the main contractor for their nuclear power plant project in late 2009. Various U.S. and European firms have also secured advisory contracts. The UAE has not decided on the nuclear fuel source or spent fuel handling. They have no nuclear material under IAEA safeguards but have signed the NPT and completed a Small Quantities Protocol in 2003. The UAE has undertaken Technical Cooperation projects with the IAEA related to nuclear electricity generation since 1977. The UAE government established a nuclear energy administration in 1984 and approved a Technical Cooperation project in 2005 to assess the feasibility of a nuclear power and desalination plant. The country has active IAEA projects focusing on human resources development, waste management, environmental monitoring, and nuclear accident preparedness. Federal Law 6 of 2009 prohibits uranium enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing, establishes a Federal Authority for Nuclear Regulation, and implements a nuclear material licensing system. The UAE sought input on its draft nuclear law from several countries and appointed Dr. William Travers as the FANR's first Director General. A nuclear energy policy advisory board has been formed with leading international industry officials. The UAE plans to establish a separate nuclear liability regime and export control regulations are pending. In 2008, consulting and contracting between U.S. firms and the UAE for the UAE's nuclear program took place. Contracts were signed with firms like Thorium Power Ltd., CH2M Hill, Inc., and Rizzo and Associates Inc. The Bush Administration and the UAE government negotiated and signed a Memorandum of Understanding and a proposed bilateral agreement on peaceful nuclear cooperation. The United States and the UAE signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in 2008 concerning cooperation in peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The MOU is a statement of intent for future cooperation but is not legally binding. It is seen as a useful tool for soliciting specific commitments regarding safeguards and technology choices in nuclear activities. The United States signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the UAE in 2008 for cooperation in peaceful nuclear energy. This MOU aims to secure specific commitments on safeguards and technology choices. In 2009, a bilateral agreement on peaceful nuclear cooperation was signed between the two countries. The Obama Administration signed a peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement with the UAE in 2009, following the requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. Congressional approval is needed for such agreements, which set the terms of reference for cooperation. The agreement would enter into force upon the exchange of diplomatic notes between the two governments on December 17, 2009. The U.S.-UAE agreement, signed in 2009, aims to cooperate on various nuclear activities including developing grid-appropriate power reactors, promoting a reliable source of nuclear fuel, civil nuclear energy training, nuclear security, nonproliferation, radioisotopes and radiation applications, radioactive waste management, and uranium mining. The U.S.-UAE agreement signed in 2009 focuses on cooperation in nuclear activities such as managing radioactive waste, identifying uranium resources, exchanging scientific information, training personnel, organizing symposia, providing technical assistance, and transferring material. The agreement includes provisions to ensure the UAE's nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, requiring the UAE to implement its Additional Protocol to its IAEA safeguards agreement before the U.S. licenses exports of nuclear material. The UAE signed the IAEA Protocol in 2009, giving officials greater access to nuclear facilities. The agreement prohibits the UAE from possessing sensitive nuclear facilities or engaging in enrichment or reprocessing activities. President Obama described this provision as a \"legally binding obligation.\" The Nuclear Cooperation Agreement with the UAE includes a provision described as a \"legally binding obligation\" by President Obama. It allows the US to terminate cooperation and require the return of nuclear materials if the UAE engages in sensitive nuclear activities. Additionally, both parties must consider non-proliferation and physical protection aspects. The Nuclear Cooperation Agreement with the UAE requires parties to consider non-proliferation and physical protection aspects when selecting a storage facility for special fissionable material. The agreement allows the United States to require the transfer of special fissionable material to the US or a third country under exceptional nonproliferation circumstances. This provision sets minimum standards for future US agreements in the Middle East. The U.S.-UAE agreement ensures that cooperation terms are no less favorable than those with other non-nuclear-weapon States in the Middle East. If a more favorable agreement is made with another country, the U.S. will consult with the UAE to amend their agreement. This sets a higher standard for future U.S. agreements in the region. The U.S.-UAE agreement allows the UAE to transfer spent nuclear fuel to France or the United Kingdom for storage or reprocessing, with conditions such as refraining from enrichment and reprocessing. The U.S. can terminate the agreement if the UAE fails to meet these conditions. The U.S.-UAE agreement allows the UAE to transfer spent nuclear fuel to France or the United Kingdom for storage or reprocessing, with conditions such as refraining from enrichment and reprocessing. The agreement specifies that the UAE must meet nonproliferation criteria and that the U.S. can terminate the agreement if the UAE fails to meet these conditions or if exceptional circumstances of concern arise. The Department of State must provide an unclassified Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement (NPAS) to the President for submission to relevant committees along with the agreement. A classified annex to the NPAS is also required, prepared in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence. The NPAS explains how the proposed agreement meets nonproliferation criteria, and the President must determine that it will not pose an unreasonable risk to national defense and security. President Bush and Obama both issued such determinations for the U.S.-UAE agreement. President Obama submitted the unclassified Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement (NPAS) to Congress on May 21, along with the classified NPAS. The AEA allows Congress 90 days to review a 123 agreement, with the President consulting with relevant committees for at least 30 days before submitting the agreement. The President must also provide a statement of approval and determination that the agreement will not harm national security interests. This initiates a 60-day period for Congress to review the agreement. The President submitted the agreement to Congress along with the unclassified NPAS and classified annex at the start of the 90-day period. The 60-day period follows immediately after the 30-day period. If Congress does not disapprove the agreement within the 60 days, it becomes effective. Some members of Congress proposed amendments to the AEA for peaceful nuclear cooperation agreements. Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen introduced a bill in December 2008 that would have required Congress to approve peaceful nuclear cooperation agreements through a joint resolution. The bill also proposed increased communication and consultation between the President and relevant congressional committees regarding such agreements. In the 111th Congress, a similar bill was introduced by Representative Ros-Lehtinen in January 2009 as H.R. 547. The Obama Administration submitted the proposed U.S.-UAE nuclear agreement to Congress in May 2009 after reopening negotiations with the UAE. Some members of Congress supported the UAE's commitments to nuclear non-proliferation, while others raised concerns about the UAE's cooperation with efforts to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The U.S.-UAE nuclear agreement entered into force in December 2009 after completing internal procedures. The UAE has been under scrutiny for alleged involvement in military exports to Iran and terrorist activities. The UAE government is under scrutiny for alleged involvement in military exports to Iran and terrorist activities. Some members of Congress claim the UAE has not done enough to stop transfers of sensitive technology to Iran. The US government has publicly stated that UAE-based entities have been involved in Iranian weapons procurement activities. The Treasury Department has designated UAE-based entities for ties to Iranian banks involved in proliferation activities. Concerns about suspicious transfers to Iran prompted U.S. action in 2007 to encourage the UAE to improve export controls. In 2007, the U.S. proposed new export control rules targeting the UAE due to diversion risks. The UAE later implemented stronger export control laws, but enforcement remains decentralized as of 2010. The UAE implemented stronger export control laws in response to U.S. concerns about diversion risks. The national interagency Committee on Commodities Subject to Import and Export Control was established to ensure tough safeguards over the movement of sensitive materials. Implementation of the law is ongoing, with a focus on staffing the oversight office. The UAE has strengthened export control laws and established a national interagency committee to oversee the movement of sensitive materials. U.S. cooperation with UAE officials on proliferation issues is strong, with joint interdictions on Iran-bound ships and seizures of arms in compliance with UN resolutions. The UAE has enforced UN resolutions on barring sensitive materials to Iran and closed companies involved in transshipment. They participate in US security initiatives and are committed to implementing export control laws. The UAE has shown commitment to export control enforcement, with the US acknowledging their efforts in passing legislation and taking concrete actions to prevent proliferation. They have shut down companies and stopped specific shipments, demonstrating a strong dedication to nonproliferation efforts. The UAE has committed to peaceful nuclear programs by forgoing domestic enrichment and reprocessing capabilities in favor of secure external fuel supply, as stated in the 2008 MOU. This decision aims to prevent the dual-use nature of nuclear facilities from aiding nuclear weapons programs. The UAE has committed to peaceful nuclear programs by relying on external fuel supply and prohibiting domestic enrichment and reprocessing. This decision reduces the risk of proliferation, as highlighted by IAEA Director-General Mohamed ElBaradei. The UAE's nuclear regulatory law prohibits enrichment and reprocessing, and as a party to the NPT, any future nuclear facilities would be subject to IAEA safeguards. The UAE has agreed to conclude an Additional Protocol to its safeguards agreement with the IAEA, granting officials greater access to nuclear-related facilities and information. The country plans to terminate its Small Quantities Protocol and rely on light-water reactors for its nuclear program, which are considered highly proliferation-resistant. The Institute for Strategic Studies report highlights that successful nuclear-weapons programs do not rely on commercial reactors. A civilian nuclear power program could potentially mask a country's procurement of items for a nuclear weapons program, requiring covert facilities. The video showing the torture of Muhammad Shah Poor by Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al Nahayan has led to concerns in Congress about the proposed U.S.-UAE nuclear cooperation agreement. The Obama Administration is reviewing the agreement and potential concerns. The Abu Dhabi authorities launched a criminal investigation into the torture depicted on a video involving Sheikh Issa bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Sheikh Issa was acquitted in January 2010 after testifying that he was drugged by business associates. H.R. 5378 was introduced in response to the acquittal, seeking to make UAE royal family members and government employees ineligible for non-immigrant status. The bill seeks to make UAE royal family members and government employees ineligible for US visas until Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al Nahyan is tried according to international legal norms. The UAE's nuclear cooperation is seen as a model for responsible nuclear power development. The proposed U.S.-UAE agreement is seen as a model for responsible nuclear energy development in the region. Under Secretary of State Ellen Tauscher testified that the agreement demonstrates strong partnership and cooperation with states in the Middle East for peaceful nuclear power development while upholding nonproliferation, safety, and security standards. Cooperation with the UAE serves as a counterpoint to countries like Iran. Jordan debated adopting the UAE model for nuclear energy or pursuing domestic uranium enrichment. Representative Howard Berman emphasized the importance of states forswearing enrichment for regional safety. UAE's nuclear technology contracts benefit the U.S. industry. Emirati officials express a strong desire for nuclear cooperation with the United States. The UAE has strong nuclear cooperation desires with the United States and has partnerships with France, South Korea, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Contracts worth billions of dollars have been awarded to South Korea's KEPCO for engineering and construction. The agreements include commitments to refrain from enrichment and reprocessing, although not explicitly stated in all agreements. The UAE has strong nuclear cooperation desires with the United States and other countries like France, South Korea, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Contracts worth billions of dollars have been awarded for engineering and construction. The agreements include commitments to refrain from enrichment and reprocessing, although not explicitly stated in all agreements. The 123 agreement with the United States does not mention the commitment to enrichment and reprocessing, but future agreements will reflect the UAE's policy on this matter. The relationship between the United States and the UAE has been close and cooperative, with occasional differences on certain issues. There were concerns that a failure to finalize the nuclear cooperation agreement could have negative implications for the bilateral relationship. The UAE has strong nuclear cooperation desires with various countries, including the United States. Despite concerns following Dubai Ports World's failed bid in 2006, the U.S.-Emirati political and military relations were not significantly affected. Emirati authorities are moving forward with nuclear development plans, seeking technical assistance from the U.S. but partnering with South Korea for the program. The U.S. government has not shown any negative change in their view of the bilateral relationship due to this decision. South Korea is providing technical assistance for the UAE's nuclear program, with concerns raised about potential proliferation risks without U.S. involvement. Legislation introduced in Congress aimed to impose limitations on nuclear cooperation with the UAE. In the 111th Congress, legislation was introduced to limit the transfer of certain items to Iran and change procedures for nuclear cooperation agreements. Representative Markey introduced a joint resolution of disapproval, while Representative Ros-Lehtinen co-sponsored a resolution to establish conditions on U.S.-UAE nuclear cooperation. The Emirates Act of 2009 introduced a bill requiring the UAE to improve its export control system and halt transfers of technology related to Weapons of Mass Destruction programs to Iran. The bill also prohibits the transfer of certain conventional weapons and components to Iran. Additionally, the United States cannot grant an export license for nuclear material to the UAE without certification that the UAE has met these conditions. H.R. 547, introduced in 2009, requires the UAE to meet specific conditions for nuclear cooperation with the US. The agreement ensures that the terms of cooperation for peaceful nuclear energy are no less favorable than those offered to other non-nuclear-weapon states in the Middle East. The United States will provide details of improved terms agreed with a non-nuclear-weapon State in the Middle East, consulting with the UAE if requested. Cooperation terms with Egypt in peaceful nuclear energy will be as favorable as those with other non-nuclear weapon states in the region. The United States confirms its recognition of Egypt's adherence to the NPT and supports non-proliferation measures in the Middle East. Consultations will be held to address any potential risk of nuclear weapons proliferation."
