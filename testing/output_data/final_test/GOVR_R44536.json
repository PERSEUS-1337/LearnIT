    "content": "The EPA's SPCC regulations require certain facilities to prevent, prepare for, and respond to oil discharges that may reach U.S. navigable waters. Recent congressional interest has focused on the regulations' impact on farms storing oil for equipment use, leading to legislative changes in the 113th and 114th Congresses. Stakeholders argue for modifications to SPCC regulations for farms. The financial impact of SPCC regulations on farms is a key concern. Stakeholders argue that the costs of mandated infrastructure improvements and inspections are significant for farmers. However, the EPA argues that the benefits of compliance outweigh the costs, as they help prevent costly oil spills and potential civil penalties. EPA studies have found insufficient evidence to provide exemptions for farms or change regulatory thresholds. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1970 directed the President to create oil spill prevention regulations, later amended in 1972 as the Clean Water Act. This provision remains in effect today, requiring regulations to be issued in line with the National Contingency Plan. The President is required to issue regulations for preventing oil and hazardous substance discharges from vessels and facilities, in line with maritime safety laws. The EPA was established in 1970 by President Nixon, leading to changes in authority frameworks. The Coast Guard oversees vessel regulations, while the EPA has jurisdiction over non-transportation-related facilities since a 1994 agreement. The Department of Transportation has jurisdiction over transportation-related onshore facilities, deepwater ports, and facilities located landward of the coast line. The Department of the Interior has jurisdiction over offshore facilities and associated pipelines located seaward of the coast line. States can impose their own requirements for oil spill prevention and removal. EPA's SPCC regulations are in 40 C.F.R. Part 112. EPA's SPCC regulations in 40 C.F.R. Part 112 require certain facilities to prepare and implement SPCC plans, including secondary containment for oil-storage units. Plans must be certified by a licensed professional engineer unless conditions allow for self-certification. Facilities with no reportable discharge history storing 10,000 gallons or less can self-certify, with a 20,000-gallon threshold for farms. Approximately 99% of farms have storage capacity below 20,000 gallons and could self-certify if subject to SPCC requirements. EPA issued its regulations. The EPA issued SPCC regulations in 1973, with changes made in 2002. Compliance deadlines were extended multiple times, with the final deadline for most facilities being November 10, 2011. Farms had a compliance deadline of May 10, 2013, which was further extended by Congress until September 22, 2013. Despite these deadlines, the requirement for facilities, including farms, to maintain SPCC plans remained unchanged. The EPA SPCC plan requirements apply to non-transportation-related facilities that produce, store, use, or consume oil and could discharge oil into navigable waters. The definition of \"navigable waters\" has been a controversial topic. The CWA Section 311 defines oil broadly. The EPA SPCC regulations apply to facilities that handle oil, including petroleum-based and non-petroleum-based oils. The definition of oil includes fats, oils, greases of animal and vegetable origin, synthetic oils, mineral oils, and oil mixed with wastes. Facilities are subject to the rule if they meet certain capacity thresholds. Facilities subject to the EPA SPCC regulations must meet specific capacity thresholds. In 2009, approximately 640,000 facilities were estimated to be subject to these requirements, with oil and gas production facilities representing the largest percentage. Farms also make up a significant portion, with approximately 152,000 farms nationwide subject to the SPCC regulations. Recent issues have focused on program scope and applicability, especially concerning farms. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 altered the SPCC regulations for farms, raising the threshold for aboveground storage capacity to 2,500 gallons. This change aimed to reduce the number of farms subject to SPCC regulations. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 increased the threshold for farms subject to SPCC regulations to 6,000 gallons for aboveground storage capacity. Farms with less than 20,000 gallons aggregate capacity, no individual tank over 10,000 gallons, and no discharge history can self-certify their SPCC plan. EPA may consider lowering the threshold to 2,500 gallons based on oil discharge risk. The EPA released a study in June 2015 recommending a decrease in the SPCC threshold from 6,000 to 2,500 gallons due to the harm caused by small discharges. However, as of the report date, the EPA has not published a proposed rule regarding this change. The Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act signed in December 2016 includes provisions related to this issue. The Water Resources Development Act of 2016 (H.R. 5303 and S. 2848) modifies SPCC regulations for farms, exempting farm containers on separate parcels with specific storage capacities. Smaller containers are not counted towards aggregate storage capacity or subject to SPCC regulations under WIIN provisions. EPA's study recommended lowering the SPCC threshold, but no proposed rule has been published yet. The term \"separate parcels\" in SPCC regulations is unclear, as EPA has not defined it. The definition of facility includes various structures and equipment used in oil-related activities. The boundaries of a facility depend on factors like ownership and types of activities on the site. The SPCC regulations do not delegate enforcement to states, and EPA regional offices are responsible for enforcement. States may have their own oil storage regulations, but they do not replace EPA's authority. Enforcement of the SPCC program can be a concern for policymakers. According to a 2012 EPA inspector general report, EPA regional offices inspected approximately 3,700 facilities for compliance with SPCC requirements, with 55% found to be out of compliance. No recent report on enforcement activities is available."
