    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Endangered Species Consolidation Act of 2001\". The National Marine Fisheries Service was created in the Department of Commerce under Reorganization Plan Number 4 of 1970. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 delegates authority to both the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce for activities related to threatened and endangered species. The National Marine Fisheries Service is responsible for the recovery of 33 species of marine mammals and fish. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has jurisdiction over 1,800 species of plants, mammals, birds, and fish. To streamline Federal agency functions related to threatened and endangered species, one agency should have exclusive responsibility for anadromous and catadromous species to avoid duplication of efforts and focus resources on the objectives of the Endangered Species Act 1973. Transfer of functions regarding anadromous and catadromous species is addressed in Section 3. Transfer of functions regarding anadromous and catadromous species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 from the Secretary of Commerce to the Secretary of the Interior. Conforming amendments are made to the Act to reflect this transfer. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 transfers functions related to anadromous and catadromous species from the Secretary of Commerce to the Secretary of the Interior. Anadromous species spawn in fresh or estuarine waters and migrate to ocean waters, while catadromous species spawn in ocean waters and migrate to fresh waters. SEC. 4. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS. References in Federal laws, orders, and documents are deemed to refer to the Secretary of the Interior or the Department of the Interior. The Secretary may exercise authorities under the Endangered Species Act for transferred functions. Legal documents like orders and rules are saved. Savings provisions ensure that legal documents issued by the Secretary of Commerce or other government officials will remain in effect according to their terms after the transfer of functions. The Act will remain in effect until modified, terminated, superseded, set aside, or revoked by authorized officials or a court of competent jurisdiction. It does not affect pending proceedings or applications for benefits, services, licenses, permits, certificates, or financial assistance, which will continue as if the Act had not been enacted. The Act will remain in effect until modified, terminated, superseded, or revoked by authorized officials or a court of competent jurisdiction. This Act does not affect suits commenced before its enactment, and proceedings, appeals, and judgments will continue as if the Act had not been enacted. The Act will remain in effect until modified, terminated, superseded, or revoked by authorized officials or a court of competent jurisdiction. Suits, appeals, and judgments will continue unaffected by the enactment of this Act, including nonabatement of actions and continuance of suits involving Government officers.
