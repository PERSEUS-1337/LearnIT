    "content": "The fiscal health of many states has been strained by the economic slowdown post-recession. State and local tax revenues have decreased, social insurance program expenditures have risen, and federal aid from the ARRA is diminishing. State and local governments are using various measures to balance budgets, including rainy day fund withdrawals, tax hikes, spending cuts, and borrowing. Concerns have been raised in Congress about potential negative impacts on the economy and the need for additional federal assistance. The report discusses state and local government debt, its incorporation into budgets, and the federal government's role. It also touches on bond default risk and public pension underfunding. Municipal default risk is higher during economic downturns, especially for bonds secured by specific revenue streams. Despite this, municipal defaults have been rare. The level of state and local government debt has generated congressional interest, with some suggesting increased reliance on debt to finance operations. Proposed bills like H.R. 344 aim to limit federal assistance and H.R. 567/S. 347 focus on pension funding requirements. H.R. 567 and S. 347 aim to improve pension funding transparency and accountability for non-federal government entities. State and local governments maintain separate operating and capital budgets, with operating budgets covering current expenses funded by revenues like taxes and fees. Congressional hearings have addressed the fiscal health of state and local governments, focusing on budget deficits in the operating budget. State and local governments issue short-term debt like revenue anticipation notes to finance current spending, repaid with future revenue. They maintain balanced operating budgets yearly, rarely carrying short-term debt over. Capital budgets fund infrastructure investments up to 10 years ahead, with long-term debt intended for capital projects. Interest expenses on debt are included in the capital budget. The capital budget includes infrastructure investments up to 10 years ahead, with interest expenses on debt issued for it. States define capital expenditures to include construction, improvements, land acquisition, renovations, and equipment, with a minimum expenditure level of $25,000. The distinction between major and minor renovations may be ambiguous. The use of capital budgets and balanced budget rules makes it difficult for state and local governments to issue debt for operating expenses. Some states have flexibility to shift spending between budgets and use special authorities for debt issuance, creating future liabilities beyond bonds, such as borrowing from the federal government for unemployment compensation during recessions. During recessions, states often borrow from the federal government to pay unemployment compensation benefits. As of December 29, 2011, 26 states and the U.S. Virgin Islands owed a combined $36.4 billion in trust fund loans. These debts will be repaid through higher taxes on employers. Additionally, state pension funds, particularly defined benefit retirement funds, are a significant liability with estimates of underfunding reaching $1 trillion. State and local government debt issuance is constrained by financial markets, with a strong demand due to safety and tax benefits. Individuals are the primary holders of this debt. Figure 1 shows holders of outstanding municipal debt as of the third quarter of 2011. Mutual funds and money market funds make up 73% of all outstanding debt held by individuals. The rest of the world (ROW) has recently increased their holdings of tax-exempt bonds, attributed to favorable tax treatment of corporate-held tax-exempt debt and Build America Bonds (BABs). BABs offer higher interest rates, making them attractive to non-taxable entities like pension funds and international investors. Data from the Federal Reserve Board and U.S. Census Bureau is used to analyze state and local government debt levels and changes over time. The Federal Reserve Board and the United States Census Bureau provide data on state and local government debt outstanding. As of the third quarter of 2011, $2.99 trillion of state and local government debt was outstanding, with long-term debt making up 98.4% of the total. In FY2009, total state and local government outstanding debt was $2.68 trillion, with state debt at $1.05 trillion and local debt at $1.64 trillion. State long-term debt was 99.3% of state total outstanding debt, while local long-term debt was 98.3% of local total outstanding debt. This data gives an indication of the relative magnitude of state and local government debt. The level of state and local government debt outstanding provides an indication of government borrowing. Revenue bonds secure a specified revenue stream, not the full faith and credit of the issuer. Roughly one-third of debt issued is general obligation, while two-thirds are revenue-secured. Total corporate and foreign bonds held by U.S. residents was $11.4 trillion in 2010, and U.S. Treasury debt reached $14.1 trillion. Most corporate and federal debt is backed by the full faith and credit of the issuer. Capacity to service debt is crucial, with one common measure being a. The capacity to service debt is crucial for state and local governments. Own-source revenue, excluding federal transfers, is a key metric to gauge this capacity. Using tax revenue alone may paint a more precarious picture for local governments. Table A-1 in the Appendix presents ratios measuring debt to own-source revenue and debt to current tax revenue for state and local governments. The debt burden for state and local governments is measured by debt to own-source revenue (OSR) and debt to current tax revenue. States with less local government responsibility have a higher state-level debt burden. Massachusetts has the highest debt load at 211.7% of OSR, while Wyoming has minimal debt at 36.5% of OSR. The total state and local debt percentages should be viewed cautiously as they may hide underlying issues. The debt burden for state and local governments is measured by debt to own-source revenue (OSR) and debt to current tax revenue. Total state and local government debt percentages may mask differences in debt finance sharing between state and local governments. For example, New Hampshire has the third-highest state debt burden at 223.2% of OSR, while local debt is the third-lowest at 75.6% of OSR. In contrast, Tennessee has a lower state debt burden at 32.0% of OSR, but local governments have a higher debt burden at 230.3% of taxes. The recession from 2007 to 2009 caused significant fiscal strain on state and local governments, leading to one of the worst periods in state fiscal conditions since the Great Depression. This highlights the potential debt strain at the sub-state government level and the transfer of risk from local governments to state governments. The recession from 2007 to 2009 caused significant fiscal strain on state and local governments, described as \"one of the worst periods in State fiscal conditions since the great depression.\" Federal assistance from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 is set to expire, and future pension obligations have raised concerns among financial analysts and policymakers. The section analyzes changes in state and local finances from FY2002 to FY2009, encompassing two economic troughs corresponding to recent recessions. The recession from 2007 to 2009 caused fiscal strain on state and local governments. State and local general revenue, tax revenue, total state debt outstanding, and interest expense are analyzed from FY2002 to FY2009. Debt outstanding grew at 6.9% annually, while total revenue grew at 5.3%. The rise and drop in state general revenues and taxes in FY2009 contributed to stress on government budgets. Operating budgets must be balanced yearly and include interest payments on debt outstanding and contributions to retirement funds. Interest payments on debt outstanding and retirement fund contributions have been analyzed from FY2002 to FY2009. Interest payments declined from 4.5% to 3.9% of debt outstanding, while retirement contributions grew at an average rate of 11.8%. Lower interest payments may be due to falling interest rates, with the average municipal bond rate decreasing from 6.41% in 1992 to 4.16% in 2010. Some policymakers suggest that state and local government debt may increase to address current budget deficits. State and local government debt may grow faster to close current budget gaps, with states successfully closing a $91 billion gap for FY2012. States are starting work on FY2013 budgets without needing to address current fiscal year gaps. Some states may use debt to maintain financial flexibility in their budgets. Despite economic slowdown, state capital spending increased in FY2009 and FY2010, financed with additional debt and federal funds. NASBO reports show 32.5% of spending on state capital projects in FY2009 was financed with bonds, while other sources like fees and fund surpluses made up 35.1%. General fund financing decreased by 35.9%, while federal fund financing and bond-financed spending increased. States may have relied more on debt financing for capital projects in recent years. Many states have increasingly used debt financing for capital projects, which some researchers argue creates a \"fiscal illusion\" that makes debt appear cheaper than using general fund revenues. This leads to higher spending when debt is used, especially during budget stress. The choice between selling bonds or using current tax revenues is crucial in financing expenditures. Fiscal illusion in state and local government debt refers to the perception that public goods financed with debt are cheaper than using current taxes. Debt financing for public goods creates a \"fiscal illusion\" that makes debt appear cheaper than using current taxes. This leads to higher spending when debt is used, especially during budget stress. Debt finance accomplishes two main objectives: \"pay-as-you-use\" financing for capital projects and smoothing spending on large infrastructure projects. According to a study, a mix of pay-as-you-go and debt financing mechanisms can maximize efficiency in infrastructure funding. Paygo is preferred during economic growth and budget surpluses, while debt financing is more efficient during economic downturns. This reflects the idea that using current revenue for capital spending is better in times of surplus, while debt financing is more efficient during economic stress. The illusion theory suggests that governments will borrow and spend \"too much\" based on the assumption that the current generation will save more to repay future debt. This theory relies on the idea that current generation saves and transfers wealth to the next generation to retire debt. However, the Ricardian Equivalence Model (REM) has been questioned due to restrictive assumptions. Another response is the debt capitalization model, where future debt payments are \"capitalized\" into property values at the state and local government level. The debt capitalization model suggests that higher debt leads to lower property values as future debt payments are incorporated into property values at the state and local government level. The level of aggregate debt outstanding has increased from 127.0% of own-source revenue in FY2002 to 130.2% in FY2009, with potential further increases due to economic recovery lagging behind. State tax revenue declined in FY2009, and the lag between economic decline and revenue drop suggests a similar trend for FY2010. The FY2010 data may show a decline in revenues. State tax revenue has improved, easing fiscal strain in FY2012. Debt growth slowed but still exceeded revenue growth in the past three years. State debt positions vary and can be measured against personal income or general fund revenue. Tax structure determines how state capacity is accessed. Interest expenditures as a share of total expenditures indicate a state's debt servicing capacity. In FY2009, state and local government debt as a share of personal income increased to 22.5% from 18.6% in FY2002, reflecting more debt and a decline in personal income. Some states had over 30% debt to income ratio, while others were below 14%. Seven states reduced debt as a share of personal income from FY2002 to FY2009. Overall, state and local debt outstanding has increased. Overall, state and local debt outstanding has increased from FY2002 to FY2009. The affordability of the debt load has improved as interest expense relative to state expenditures has decreased. Most states use a separate capital budget for debt incurred for large projects. Aggregate state and local interest expense declined from 4.2% to 3.5% of general fund expenditures during this period. Some suggest that underfunded post-employment pensions for government workers are compelling states to allocate more resources. Post-employment pensions for government workers are underfunded, with reports suggesting a $1 trillion gap between funds set aside and promised benefits. The underfunding grew to $1.26 trillion in 2009. Future pension obligations impact current deficits as annual contributions will need to rise. Government pension expenditures in FY2009 accounted for just under 4% of total expenditures or $86 billion for all state and local governments. Government pension contributions account for just under 4% of total expenditures, totaling $86 billion for state and local government pensions. Payments for retired workers are a larger expense at $191 billion in FY2009, typically funded by employee retirement trust funds. Some governments issue taxable pension obligation bonds (POBs) to finance annual pension payments, investing the proceeds in the pension fund. Despite their small portion in pension assets, POBs aim to generate returns exceeding interest costs. The potential usefulness of Pension Obligation Bonds (POBs) in government finance is debated. While they may allow governments to gamble on interest rate costs and asset returns or avoid tax increases during recessions, most POBs are issued by financially stressed governments ill-equipped to handle the investment risk. Federal assistance to state and local governments has been significant, but as funding from programs like the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act decreases, governments may face challenges in funding their expenditures. As the Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) expires, states are preparing for FY2012 budgets, anticipating the need to increase revenue and reduce expenditures to replace lost federal aid. State and local governments had over $2.7 trillion in debt by the end of FY2009, with debt ranging from $2.4 billion in Wyoming to $373.7 billion in California. Total pension liabilities were $2.94 trillion by the end of FY2009. Total pension liabilities at the end of FY2009 were $2.94 trillion, with unfunded pension liabilities estimated at $660 billion. Post-employment health benefits liabilities were $637.8 billion, with unfunded health benefits at $607 billion. Some states, like Alaska, Ohio, and New Jersey, had debt and unfunded pension obligations exceeding the national average, while others, like North Dakota, Wyoming, and Nebraska, had lower levels of debt and unfunded obligations. Local governments in Tennessee carry a significant share of the debt burden in that state. Economists analyze the broader impact of government debt on financial markets and the economy, including how it affects domestic investment and net exports. There are concerns about using tax-exempt debt to subsidize public capital formation. Greater oversight of state and local government debt may be warranted, but any federal oversight role must consider constitutional issues. When governments borrow, it reduces savings available for private investment, leading to higher interest rates. The impact of state and local government debt on the macroeconomy is significant, affecting private domestic investment and net exports. Higher interest rates due to government borrowing can lead to a stronger dollar, reducing net exports. Some economists warn that excessive state government borrowing could hinder private investment and exports. Congressional interest lies in the role of the federal government in promoting or impeding state debt issuance, with a current tax preference for state and local government debt. The federal government currently provides a tax preference for tax-exempt state and local government debt, costing $177.6 billion over 2011-2015. However, tax-exempt bonds are criticized as an inefficient way to transfer resources. Congress may explore alternatives due to economic inefficiency. A 35% marginal tax rate investor purchases a 5% tax-exempt bond with a $1 million principal amount to be repaid over 20 years. Each year, the taxpayer receives $50,000 in tax-exempt interest income, resulting in a revenue loss of $24,500 for the federal government. This highlights the economic inefficiency of tax-exempt bonds compared to taxable bonds. The federal government provides an additional $4,500 to investors purchasing tax-exempt bonds. Issuers receive a subsidy through lower interest costs, with the government potentially providing a direct subsidy of up to $24,500. The federal subsidy for state and local government debt issuance has varied over time, influenced by macroeconomic factors and marginal income tax rates. The historical average interest rate on high-grade corporate bonds from 1939 to 2010 was 6.26%. The historical average interest rate on high-grade corporate bonds from 1939 to 2010 was 6.26% and for high-grade municipal debt, 4.89%. In 2010, the average was 4.94% for corporate debt and 4.16% for municipal debt. The relatively high municipal bond rate in 2010, 0.84 of the taxable rate, confers a significant tax preference to higher tax rate investors. Congress has recently held hearings examining the fiscal health of state and local governments and has offered legislation in two areas related to state and local fiscal health analyzed in this report: government debt and government pensions. State and local debt, although growing, has not reached the point where widespread default seems likely. Interest costs for debt outstanding represented 3.5% of total state and local government expenditures. Recent data shows rising interest costs for some local government issuers, increasing the risk of default. Concerns about excessive debt issuance may lead to increased oversight by Congress, although historically, federal regulation of state and local government financing has been limited. The Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 prohibits the federal government from requiring municipal securities issuers to file documents with the Commission or the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board before selling securities. Congress could modify tax preferences for bond issuers to change disclosure requirements. The IRS audits tax-exempt bond issues to ensure compliance with tax laws. Expanding audits may help justify tax-exemption and federal revenue loss. Congress may explore alternatives to tax-exempt bonds for state subsidies. In the 112th Congress, bills have been introduced to extend and expand Build America Bonds (BABs) as an alternative to tax-exempt bonds for state and local government capital investment. Legislation has also been proposed for greater transparency in state and local government pension systems, with Moody's considering pension liabilities in state bond ratings. Annual pension contributions currently represent about 4% of state and local government operating expenditures. State and local government pension contributions make up roughly 4% of operating expenditures, totaling $86.1 billion in FY2009. While underfunded pension systems are a long-term concern, they have a marginal impact on short-term operating deficits for most states."
