    "content": "On November 19, 2012, FARC declared a two-month ceasefire during peace talks in Havana, Cuba. Colombian government initiated peace talks with FARC in Oslo, Norway a month earlier. Colombian drug kingpin Daniel Barrera was captured in Venezuela with U.S. and British intelligence assistance, signaling increased counternarcotics cooperation between Venezuela and Colombia. President Santos and FARC leader Timochenko announced official discussions on September 4, 2012. On July 30, 2012, the U.S. Office of National Drug Control Policy announced that Colombia's potential cocaine production had decreased, falling below Peru's. Colombia's 2011 potential cocaine production fell to 195 metric tons, 25% below the prior year estimate. On June 27-28, 2012, the Colombian Congress voted to annul judicial reform legislation due to \"surprise\" amendments. The legislation would have restricted the Supreme Court from investigating crimes by legislators. President Santos refused to sign the final bill. The U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement went into force on May 15, 2012, after being approved by the U.S. Congress in October 2011. Colombia also hosted democratic leaders from 30 Latin American countries in April 2012. Colombia hosted democratic leaders from 30 Latin American countries, the United States, and Canada at the sixth Summit of the Americas in April 2012. The FARC released its last 10 military and police hostages in April 2012, showing willingness to engage in a peace process. Colombia is a diverse nation with a population of roughly 47 million people. Colombia has a diverse population, with indigenous people and Afro-Colombians estimated to make up 25% or higher. The country has a long history of democracy but has been plagued by violence and conflict for nearly five decades. Despite high rates of poverty, Colombia's economy has been steadily improving, with a decrease in poverty rates from 50% in 2002 to 34% in 2011. Economic growth rates have been strong, reaching 5.9% in 2011, and foreign direct investment has more than doubled in five years. Foreign direct investment (FDI) in Colombia more than doubled from $6.5 billion in 2006 to over $14 billion in 2011, mainly in oil, manufacturing, and mining sectors. Income inequality and land ownership concentration remain significant issues. Unemployment rate has been around 11% for the past five years but is expected to drop below 10% in 2012. The large informal sector employs 50% to 60% of Colombian workers. Drug trafficking fuels conflict by funding both left- and right-wing armed groups like FARC and ELN. Rightist paramilitary groups, led by AUC, disbanded in 2006. The AUC, FARC, and ELN were designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations by the U.S. government. AUC members were involved in human rights abuses and collusion with the Colombian Armed Forces. New armed groups, including re-armed paramilitaries, pose a challenge in Colombian cities. Drug production and trafficking continue to fund illicit groups. Colombia has a large population of internally displaced persons due to conflict and drug-related violence. In recent years, the dominant Liberal and Conservative parties in Colombian politics have been weakened by their inability to address the root causes of violence. In 2002, \u00c1lvaro Uribe, an independent candidate, was elected president for his aggressive plan to reduce violence. The major political parties in the Colombian Congress include Liberal, Conservative, Alternative Democratic Pole, National Unity, Green, and Radical Change parties. The leftist Alternative Democratic Pole is the main opposition to the Santos government. President Uribe began fulfilling his campaign promises during his first term. During his first term (2002-2006), President Uribe addressed the paramilitary problem, defeated leftist guerrilla insurgents, and combated narcotics trafficking with a hard-line approach. Negotiations with paramilitary groups led to an agreement for demobilization by the end of 2005. Uribe endorsed a controversial Justice and Peace Law and strengthened the Colombian military and police to combat FARC activities. His actions resulted in high public approval ratings due to reduced violence. President Uribe's security policies led to high public approval ratings and a constitutional amendment in 2005 allowing him to run for reelection. He was sworn in for a second term in 2006 with a strong mandate from pro-Uribe parties. His \"Democratic Security\" policy improved Colombia's security situation, leading to significant reductions in kidnappings, homicides, and terrorist attacks. The government demobilized the AUC and made progress against the FARC and ELN, with police regaining control in all municipalities. Over 31,000 AUC paramilitaries were demobilized and disarmed under Uribe's leadership. The demobilization and disarmament of 31,000 AUC paramilitaries under Uribe's leadership faced criticism for lack of punishment and reparations. Colombian military raided a FARC camp in Ecuador, killing a top leader and rescuing hostages in 2008. Despite progress, Colombia still faces challenges with FARC's reduced but active fighters and paramilitaries returning to criminal activities. The demobilization program in Colombia has faced challenges in reintegrating former paramilitaries into civilian life. A new generation of paramilitaries has emerged, engaging in criminal activities like drug trafficking and kidnapping. There are investigations into suspected links between Colombian politicians and paramilitary groups. Scandals involving extrajudicial killings by security forces have also surfaced. In October 2008, 27 soldiers and military officers, including three generals, were fired due to the \"false positives\" scandal where 13 murdered civilians were dressed as guerilla fighters. General Mario Montoya resigned as the commander of the Colombian army. President Uribe's supporters urged him to seek a third term, but the Constitutional Court denied a referendum for his reelection on February 26, 2010. President Uribe accepted the court's decision. President Uribe accepted the court's decision to remove himself as a candidate in the 2010 race. Legislative elections were held on March 14, 2010, with a high turnout and a strong victory for pro-Uribe parties. The National Unity Party and the Conservative Party won the most seats, securing a majority in both the Senate and the Chamber of Representatives. This outcome was seen as favorable for presidential candidate Juan Manuel Santos. In the 2010 presidential election in Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos emerged as the leading candidate, receiving more than twice as many votes as his closest competitor, Antanas Mockus. Santos had to compete in a runoff on June 20, where he ultimately won the majority of votes. Other candidates in the race included Naomi San\u00edn, Gustavo Petro, Germ\u00e1n Vargas Lleras, and Rafael Pardo. Santos won the Colombian presidency in 2010 with 69% of the vote, forming a unity coalition in Congress. He continued the security strategies of his predecessor and had a stronger mandate than Uribe. In 2010, President Santos pledged to continue successful security strategies while pursuing democratic, economic, and social reforms. He promoted rigorous human rights protection, reached out to the judiciary, secured anti-corruption and labor formalization laws, and led executive branch reforms including fiscal reforms and redistribution of royalties. The Santos Administration proposed legislation to compensate victims of the internal conflict. The Colombian Congress approved the Victims' and Land Restitution Law in 2011 to compensate victims of the internal conflict and restore land to those forcibly displaced. The legislation aims to return property to those forced off their land by armed groups. International organizations have praised the law, but concerns remain about the safety of displaced victims. President Santos has promised increased protection for land return advocates amidst ongoing assassinations. The Victims' Law in Colombia aims to provide protection and economic reparations to land rights leaders and activists affected by the conflict. The initiative includes returning stolen land to victims since 1991 and is estimated to cost $30.5 billion over 10 years. Implementation began in 2012 with land handovers in C\u00f3rdoba, but faces resistance from local officials involved in illegal land seizures. Some NGOs have criticized the law's scope. U.S. and Colombian NGOs criticized the scope of the Victims' Law, citing narrow victim definition and gaps. The U.S. government pledged $50 million for implementation. Establishing institutions for reparations and land restitution involves 37 national agencies. Colombia created a Victims Unit for compensation and a Land Restitution Unit for returning land. A new court system will handle land claims, requiring coordination at municipal and state levels. The Colombian government implemented the Victims' Law to compensate victims of violence, with 113,000 Colombians receiving $360 million by late October 2012. Regional Transitional Justice Committees were formed to aid in the law's local implementation, but some victims faced threats for their participation. Over 26,000 claims for land restitution were filed, with the first judgments being issued. President Santos reorganized the executive branch, splitting three ministries into six in April 2011. President Santos reorganized the executive branch by splitting three ministries into six, including the formation of an independent Labor Ministry to institutionalize labor protections. The discredited Department of Administrative Security (DAS) was dissolved as part of the government reorganization. The Santos Administration reformed the intelligence agency, dissolved the discredited Department of Administrative Security (DAS), and passed a peace framework law in 2012. The law recognizes leftist rebels as combatants in an internal conflict and offers reduced sentences for demobilization. Despite criticism, the measure received strong political support for a future peace process. The Santos government faced political controversy over a failed reform effort to the justice system, leading to strained relations with Congress and a decrease in popularity. President Santos called for the annulment of the law, causing tension within the national unity coalition. The justice minister was pressured to resign, and another constitutional reform bill is expected to be voted on by Colombian Congress in 2012. The bill, set to be voted on by Colombian Congress in 2012, aims to expand military court jurisdiction, criticized for potentially increasing impunity for human rights crimes by shifting cases from civilian to military courts. Former President Uribe has become a vocal critic of President Santos, particularly regarding his approach to security and dealings with FARC. Former President Uribe criticizes President Santos for his conciliatory approach to FARC and Venezuela, as well as his stance on judicial reform and peace laws. President Santos' popularity dropped to 47% in mid-2012 due to security concerns and failed judicial reform. He reshuffled his cabinet to boost his approval ratings. Observers suggest that divisions within the national unity coalition may limit President Santos' actions. President Santos' approval ratings improved after announcing new peace talks with FARC in 2012. He emphasized three principles in the peace negotiations, including not repeating past mistakes and not ceding territory to rebels. There were also discussions with the ELN, another rebel group. The smaller rebel group, the National Liberation Army (ELN), may also join the peace process. ELN leader welcomed joining peace talks but stated they would not end their military campaign before negotiations. Former President Uribe criticized the peace initiative as a concession to terrorists. The initiative received praise from the U.S. State Department, OAS Secretary General, and U.N. Secretary General. Formal talks between the government and FARC's leader, Rodrigo Londo\u00f1o, were announced to begin in October in Oslo, Norway, and then move to Cuba. The FARC and the government's negotiating teams, with a 5-member lead negotiators representing a 30-member team, did not agree to a ceasefire. A framework agreement outlined key themes for the talks, including rural development, political participation, drug trafficking, ending the armed conflict, and supporting victims' rights. Norway and Cuba were designated as \"guarantors\" of the talks, with Venezuela and Chile to \"accompany\" them. President Santos aimed for a peace process lasting months, not years. In mid-October 2012, peace negotiations formally began in Oslo between the FARC and the Colombian government. The FARC spokesperson expressed grievances beyond the negotiation framework, dampening optimism. Talks then moved to Cuba after an interlude, with civil society groups pushing for representation. A minor delay in Cuba was due to arranging civil society participation. On November 19, 2012, peace talks continued. The FARC announced a two-month ceasefire as peace talks resumed in Cuba in November 2012. The Santos peace initiative is viewed as a political gamble, with majority of Colombians cautiously optimistic about the negotiations. Public support for the talks has fluctuated, with polls showing varying levels of approval. The closed-door meetings in Cuba are set to address contentious issues related to providing rural populations with access to land. The Santos Administration has improved relations with neighboring countries like Ecuador and Venezuela, leading to greater cooperation on trade, counternarcotics, and security. Colombia has also expanded its relations with other countries in the region, providing counternarcotics and security training to several Latin American nations. Colombia's leadership in regional affairs was highlighted when it hosted the sixth Summit of the Americas in Cartagena in 2012. The sixth Summit of the Americas in Cartagena in 2012 showcased Colombia's leadership in regional affairs. President Obama and President Santos announced the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement entering into force on May 15, 2012, dropping tariffs and barriers to bilateral trade. Colombia has diversified regional relations, opening an integrated stock market with Peru and Chile, and forming the Pacific Alliance with Mexico. Trade between Colombia and Venezuela has significantly recovered as tensions eased. Trade between Colombia and Venezuela has significantly recovered as tensions eased, following an embargo imposed by President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in 2009. Colombia has actively pursued and concluded free trade agreements with various countries, including the European Union, Canada, South Korea, and pending with Japan. The country has a history of violence rooted in a lack of state control, poverty, and inequality, leading to civil wars in the past. The War of a Thousand Days and The Violence in Colombia killed hundreds of thousands. A power sharing agreement between Liberal and Conservative parties ended the civil war in 1957. Leftist guerrilla groups formed in the 1960s in response to neglect and poverty. Right-wing paramilitaries formed in the 1980s to protect landowners. Cocaine production shift to Colombia in the 1980s increased drug violence. The AUC paramilitary organization demobilized in 2003. Uribe took aggressive measures against guerrilla insurgency. The Uribe Administration took aggressive measures against guerrilla insurgency, targeting groups like FARC, ELN, and paramilitary groups. President Santos initiated peace talks with FARC in 2012, marking the fourth attempt in 30 years to negotiate with insurgents. Talks began in Norway and moved to Cuba, with some observers optimistic about the new effort. The FARC, the oldest and largest guerrilla organization in Latin America, emerged from armed peasant self-defense groups in the 1960s. With military superiority of the government and relative weakness of the FARC, conditions are seen as more promising for new negotiation efforts compared to past failures. The FARC operates mainly in rural areas but has shown capability for urban attacks. The FARC conducts various attacks in urban areas, including Bogot\u00e1, through bombings, murders, kidnappings, and extortion. They are heavily involved in the drug trade, reaping significant profits. The group has increased activities along Colombia's borders with Ecuador and Venezuela. Previous peace negotiations with the FARC granted them control of a demilitarized zone, which was perceived as a way for them to re-arm and regroup. President Pastrana halted negotiations in 2002 due to continued FARC military activity. In early 2002, negotiations with the FARC were halted, and the military was ordered to retake control of the designated territory. The FARC launched a mortar attack during President Uribe's inauguration in August 2002, killing 21 people. The Colombian military's Plan Patriota campaign in mid-2003 successfully secured Bogot\u00e1. Military operations in 2004 aimed to regain FARC-held territory in southern and eastern regions. The FARC launched a counter-offensive in February 2005, but the conflict has since remained mostly in the countryside. Plan Patriota reduced FARC ranks and recaptured territory, leading to the FARC controlling 30% of Colombian territory in 2006. In March 2008, Colombian military bombed a FARC camp in Ecuador, killing key members including Ra\u00fal Reyes. This marked the first time the military killed a FARC secretariat member. Subsequent deaths of Ivan Rios and Manuel Marulanda dealt a significant blow to the FARC. Information from captured laptops suggested Venezuelan support for the FARC. In 2007-2008, prisoner escapes, hostage deaths, and releases drew international attention to the plight of FARC hostages. President Correa of Ecuador was accused of receiving campaign donations from the FARC in 2006, which he denied. Venezuelan officials dismissed the claims as fabricated, despite Interpol verifying the authenticity of seized files. Hostages were released in early 2008, including Fernando Araujo, a former minister who escaped after six years in captivity. In early 2008, the FARC released hostages including three U.S. defense contractors and former Colombian presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt. The Colombian military successfully tricked the FARC into releasing 15 hostages, showcasing their professionalism and intelligence capabilities. This was attributed to years of U.S. training and assistance through Plan Colombia. Today, FARC forces have decreased to 8,000-9,000 fighters, roughly half of its peak in the early 2000s. The FARC, once at its peak with 16,000 to 20,000 members in the early 2000s, has now decreased to 8,000-9,000 fighters. Despite government victories in taking out top leadership, the FARC continues to pose a serious security threat. The State Department's Country Reports on Terrorism 2011 noted increased attacks by the FARC in 2011 and a decrease in demobilized troops. The Santos Administration has maintained pressure on the FARC, but concerns about security persist. In September 2010, Colombian military bombed FARC camp, killing top military strategist Jorge Brice\u00f1o. In November 2011, FARC's leader Alfonso Cano was killed. New leader Rodrigo Londo\u00f1o Echeverri announced, seeking political dialogue with government. FARC released hostages to gain support, including high-value captives in March 2010. In November 2011, the FARC killed four hostages who were members of Colombia's security forces. A fifth hostage, Luis Alberto Erazo, survived and escaped. Public outrage led to demonstrations across Colombia in December 2011. In early April 2012, the FARC released its remaining police and military hostages, expressing interest in opening a dialogue with the government. The FARC had diversified into illegal activities like mining and extortion to supplement its income. Despite this, FARC's leader Timochenko was not ready to meet government demands such as releasing all hostages or implementing a ceasefire. The FARC and ELN increased attacks in 2011 and 2012, with the FARC responsible for 377 attacks in 2011. Infrastructure attacks, including pipeline attacks, have sharply increased, threatening the energy sector, a key source of the country's economy. Peace talks between the FARC and the Santos government began in 2012. The ELN, inspired by Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, has less than 2,000 fighters and targets infrastructure, especially oil and electricity sectors. Operating mainly in rural areas, they fund themselves through illegal activities like extortion and kidnapping. Their military strength has decreased since the late 1990s. The ELN's military strength has significantly decreased since the late 1990s, with a notable reduction in sabotage attacks on the Ca\u00f1o-Lim\u00f3n pipeline. Despite periodic peace discussions with the Colombian government, the ELN leader expressed interest in joining the FARC-government peace talks. The ELN leader expressed interest in joining the FARC-government peace talks without preconditions, despite their previous stance on ceasefire and kidnapping. There are concerns about the ELN's increased violence and alliances with criminal groups. Paramilitary groups in Colombia, including the AUC, originated in the 1980s to protect against threats from FARC and ELN. The AUC disbanded in 2006 after engaging in violent activities. The Armed Forces of Colombia have been accused of collaborating with these groups. The AUC, like the FARC, funded itself through drug trafficking. In 2006, paramilitaries controlled 40% of Colombian cocaine exports. The AUC agreed to demobilize in 2003, with estimates of 8,000 to 11,000 members. Demobilization ended in 2006, with over 31,000 members surrendering. Some former members have re-joined or re-organized into new groups. The AUC, a paramilitary group in Colombia, demobilized in 2006 with over 31,000 members surrendering. Some former members have re-joined or formed new illegal groups involved in drug trafficking and other criminal activities. These groups, known as \"emerging criminal gangs\" or \"Bacrim,\" pose a significant security threat to Colombian civilians, committing murders, massacres, extortion, and other crimes. The Bacrim, considered an emerging criminal gang in Colombia, commit various crimes such as murders, massacres, threats, extortion, and sexual violence. They are known to control illegally seized land and pose a threat to the government's land restitution program. Concerns have been raised about their tolerance by Colombian security forces and local authorities due to corruption and intimidation. The Bacrim, an emerging criminal gang in Colombia, have targeted leaders of land restitution efforts and others involved in the process. One group, the \"Anti-Land Restitution Army,\" has threatened activists in northern Colombia. In early 2012, Los Urabe\u00f1os staged an armed strike in response to the killing of their leader, costing millions of dollars in damages. The government suspects collaboration between the FARC and criminal bands like the Rastrojos in terror attacks. There are about half a dozen dominant Bacrim groups, including Los Urabe\u00f1os and Los Rastrojos. The Bacrim groups in Colombia, such as Los Urabe\u00f1os, Los Rastrojos, ERPAC, Los Machos, Los Paisas, and the Aguilas Negras, compete and cooperate with the FARC and ELN. The government's efforts to dismantle these groups have had limited success, with violence and massacres on the rise. Bacrim groups are present in over a third of Colombia's municipalities. A scandal linking paramilitary ties to politicians, including members of Congress, has affected Colombian politics since November 2006. Since November 2006, Colombian politics have been rocked by the \"para-political\" scandal, with numerous politicians charged for ties to paramilitary groups. Mario Uribe, a former senator and close ally of the ex-President, was arrested in April 2008 for colluding with paramilitaries. He was later convicted in February 2011 and sentenced to seven and a half years in prison. The State Department reported that out of the 2006-2010 Congress, 128 former representatives were accused of paramilitary ties. In the 2010-2014 Congress, 13 re-elected representatives were under investigation by the Supreme Court. The para-political scandal in Colombian politics involved politicians with paramilitary ties, leading to tensions between President Uribe and the Supreme Court. Despite meetings between the branches, Senator Carlos Garcia was arrested in July 2008. Critics questioned Uribe's decision to extradite paramilitary figures to the US and his judicial reform package aimed at removing Supreme Court powers. The judicial reform bill proposed by Uribe aimed to limit the Supreme Court's power to investigate legislators but was withdrawn due to criticism. Human Rights Watch reported harassment of the Supreme Court by the Uribe Administration. The Santos Administration worked to improve relations between the executive and judiciary, leading to the election of a new Prosecutor General in December 2010. In February 2012, the Council of State removed the prosecutor general due to irregularities. In March 2012, Luis Eduardo Montealegre Lynett was elected as the new prosecutor general by the Colombian Supreme Court. Jorge Noguera, former head of Colombia's DAS, was convicted in 2011 for collaborating with paramilitaries and illegal activities, receiving a 25-year prison sentence. Noguera was involved in the DAS scandal, which led to further investigations and convictions. The \"DAS scandal\" resulted in investigations, convictions, and the dismantling of the DAS by the Santos Administration. General Mauricio Santoyo, former chief of security for President Uribe, pleaded guilty to collaborating with illegal paramilitaries but denied drug trafficking charges. He is the highest-ranking Colombian official extradited to the US for criminal charges and is assisting in an ongoing investigation. The para-political scandal and paramilitary influence continue to impact Colombian politics. President Uribe proposed the Justice and Peace Law for conditional amnesties to combatants, including FARC and ELN fighters. The Justice and Peace Law in Colombia, approved in 2005, requires demobilized fighters to confess their crimes and forfeit assets in exchange for up to eight years in prison. Critics argue the penalties are too lenient, while the Uribe Administration believes it incentivizes demobilization. The law also applies to FARC and ELN fighters. In 2006, the Constitutional Court upheld the law's constitutionality. In July 2006, Colombia's Constitutional Court upheld the constitutionality of the Justice and Peace Law, limiting benefits for demobilizing paramilitaries who fail to comply with the law. Paramilitary leaders resisted, but President Uribe ordered them to surrender. By October 2006, most had complied. The law requires confession of crimes, reparations to victims, and has been debated for its effectiveness in ending paramilitary activities. The Justice and Peace Law in Colombia, supported by the George W. Bush Administration, facilitated the demobilization of paramilitary members. However, concerns have been raised about the institutional frailty of the process and the government's efforts to provide reparations to victims. Human rights organizations are worried about the lack of accountability for paramilitaries' crimes. Concerns have been raised about the lack of accountability for paramilitaries' crimes in Colombia. Only a small number of demobilized paramilitary members have been found eligible for benefits under the Justice and Peace Law. The U.S. and Colombian governments are collaborating to ensure the continued participation of extradited individuals in the Justice and Peace process through telecommunications links. Several extradited former paramilitaries have provided their confessions via teleconferencing. The Justice and Peace Law in Colombia has faced challenges in achieving transitional justice for paramilitary crimes. Despite efforts to reform the law in 2012 to expedite judicial processes, only a small number of demobilized paramilitaries have been convicted under the law. The U.N. Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Executions noted the law's shortcomings in achieving its intended goals. The Colombian military was involved in extrajudicial executions, including the \"false positives\" scandal where civilians were murdered and disguised as guerillas to inflate military body counts. This led to the firing of 27 soldiers and officers, including three generals, and the resignation of General Mario Montoya in November 2008. The Colombian military faced a scandal involving extrajudicial executions known as the \"false positives\" scandal. In January 2010, over 20 soldiers accused in the Soacha murder cases were released due to lengthy pre-trial procedures, causing concern about the backlog of cases of extrajudicial killings. The State Department's report highlighted political and unlawful killings as a serious ongoing issue in Colombia. Amnesty International reported that Colombian security forces committed extrajudicial killings, with at least 296 civilians killed between June 2007 and June 2008. The killings were disguised as guerillas killed in combat. The U.N. Special Rapporteur found that the killings were not government policy but were carried out systematically by various military units. The slow pace of bringing the Soacha murder cases to trial suggests the Prosecutor General's office may be overwhelmed. The first convictions in the Soacha trials came in June 2011, with soldiers convicted of murders receiving sentences ranging from 28 to 54 years in prison. In 2012, six soldiers were sentenced for another false positive case involving the murder of a young man from Soacha. Several cases involving victims from Soacha are still pending as of August 2012, with over 1,700 cases assigned to the extrajudicial killings Sub-Unit of the Prosecutor General's office. Colombia has a history of extrajudicial killings by the Armed Forces, with over 3,500 victims between 1985 and June 2012. Impunity remains a concern, but there has been progress in reducing new cases. Colombia also has a large population of internally displaced persons, with estimates ranging from 4 to 5 million, disproportionately affecting indigenous and Afro-Colombians. Some IDPs do not register due to fear and procedural barriers, leading to disagreements over displacement rates. The Colombian government and NGOs have differing estimates on new displacements, with the government reporting 143,116 in 2011 while CODHES reported 259,146. Disagreements also exist on the total number of displaced people, with the government registering 3.9 million IDPs since 1997 and CODHES estimating over 5 million since 1985. The UNHCR notes that Colombia has one of the largest internally displaced populations globally, driven by various factors. Internally displaced populations in Colombia are driven by factors like armed conflict, child recruitment, violence, and threats by organized crime groups. Other contributing factors include counternarcotics measures, illegal mining, and large-scale economic projects. Landmine use by guerrilla groups is a serious ongoing issue in the country. The International Campaign to Ban Landmines reported that Colombia had the highest number of landmine casualties in the world in 2006, with 1,106 casualties. The majority of landmines in Colombia are laid by the FARC and ELN guerrilla groups. Landmine casualties in Colombia have been declining since 2007, attributed to setbacks suffered by the FARC. The Colombian Minister of Agriculture highlighted the challenge of demining land under FARC control, stating it will be slow and costly. Colombia's prominence in global cocaine and heroin production has been a focus of U.S. counternarcotics efforts. The U.S. Office of National Drug Control Policy reported a decrease in Colombia's potential cocaine production, with the country producing 195 metric tons in 2011. The U.S. strategy includes drug crop eradication, interdiction, and alternative development programs to reduce the drug supply at its source. Peru, Bolivia, and Colombia are the main producers of cocaine globally. Colombia's prominence in global cocaine production increased significantly in the 1990s, surpassing Peru and Bolivia. However, by 2010, coca cultivation had decreased in Colombia, leading to a shift back to Peru and Bolivia. This phenomenon, known as the \"balloon effect,\" occurs when enforcement efforts in one area push production to another. The accuracy of estimates on coca cultivation and cocaine production relies on limited data. Estimates of pure cocaine production vary between the UNODC and the U.S. government, with discrepancies in reported figures. The UNODC adjusted its 2008 calculation for Colombia's cocaine production upward, while the U.S. government revised its estimate downward. In 2011, the UNODC reported a slight increase in coca cultivation in Colombia compared to the previous year. In 2011, Colombia's potential cocaine production decreased by 1% to 345 metric tons, while coca cultivation in the country declined by 17% to 83,000 hectares. The U.S. government estimated cocaine production in Colombia at 195 metric tons, a 72% reduction from 2001. Colombia produces about 95% of the cocaine seized in the United States. In recent years, Colombia, with U.S. assistance, has increased efforts to eradicate coca cultivation. The State Department noted declines in cocaine productivity due to aerial spraying and manual eradication programs. In 2010, manual eradication fell short of its goal, citing budget delays and security concerns. However, aerial spraying exceeded its target. In 2011, Colombia manually eradicated 34,592 hectares and sprayed over 102,000. The latest INCSR report shows that Colombia manually eradicated 34,592 hectares and sprayed over 102,000 hectares. The price of cocaine in the United States significantly rose between January 2007 and September 2010, with a decrease in purity. The NDIC report in 2011 found a sharp decline in cocaine availability in the United States since 2006. The NDIC report in August 2011 noted a sharp decline in cocaine availability in the United States since 2006, leading to price increases and purity declines. Various factors such as intercartel fighting in Mexico, decreased production in Colombia, and cocaine flowing to non-U.S. markets contributed to the decrease in smuggling. Analysts caution that short-term fluctuations in price, purity, and availability may not be sustainable, despite the significant increase in price for a pure gram of cocaine between 2007 and 2010. The price of a pure gram of cocaine increased significantly between 2007 and 2010 but has not surpassed the 2001 level. Most heroin in the United States comes from Mexico and a smaller amount from Colombia. Opium poppy cultivation and heroin production in Colombia decreased by about 50% between 2000 and 2006. The U.N. reported a drop in opium production to 394 hectares in Colombia in 2008, the lowest in 14 years. The number of hectares under cultivation continued to decline, reaching 346 hectares in 2010. US policy in the Andean region focuses on helping Colombia combat armed insurgencies involved in drug trafficking. Colombia's border regions, plagued by conflict and drug trafficking, have had spillover effects on neighboring countries like Venezuela and Ecuador. Colombia has sought assistance from Venezuela and Ecuador in patrolling border areas where insurgent groups like FARC and ELN operate, leading to increased cooperation despite previous tensions. Relations between Colombia and Ecuador, strained during the Uribe Administration, improved under President Santos. Diplomatic ties were restored after a 33-month rift caused by a 2008 bombing raid on a FARC camp in Ecuador. Venezuela also cut off relations but later restored them. Tensions between Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and President Uribe escalated, leading to trade embargoes and decreased bilateral trade. In October 2009, a U.S.-Colombia base agreement allowed U.S. troops to use military facilities in Colombia, angering President Ch\u00e1vez. The Uribe government accused Venezuela of harboring FARC and ELN fighters, leading to strained relations. After President Santos took office, diplomatic ties were restored between Venezuela and Colombia in August 2010, and Ecuador renewed full diplomatic relations in December 2010. Since restoring full diplomatic relations with Colombia in December 2010, bilateral cooperation on trade, cross-border crime, and counternarcotics has been strengthened. Several FARC operatives have been captured and extradited to Colombia, while alleged drug kingpins like Maximiliano Bonilla and Daniel Barrera have been arrested in Venezuela. Barrera's arrest involved a joint operation with support from U.S. and British intelligence agencies, as he was deeply involved in drug trafficking for over two decades. The Country Reports on Terrorism 2011 highlights the increasing bilateral cooperation between Venezuela and Colombia on security. President Ch\u00e1vez stated that illegal armed groups will not be tolerated in Venezuela, but four Venezuelan officials are sanctioned by the U.S. for links to FARC activities. Venezuela is believed to be used by FARC for rest, resupply, and drug transit. Ecuador faces challenges with Colombian terrorist groups along its border due to limited resources. Relations between Colombia and Ecuador have improved under the Santos Administration, with efforts to build a more balanced approach to neighboring countries. Future relations with Venezuela are uncertain due to concerns about President Ch\u00e1vez's unpredictability and health. Venezuela's supportive role in peace negotiations with the FARC is criticized by former President Uribe. The Colombian government's relationship with Venezuela has raised concerns, especially regarding the extradition of drug kingpin Walid Makled Garcia. Plan Colombia, initiated by President Pastrana, aimed to end the country's armed conflict and drug trafficking with significant funding from the U.S. Congress. The Military Construction Appropriations Act of 2001 provided $1.3 billion for counternarcotics efforts in Colombia and neighboring countries. Plan Colombia, not authorized by Congress, received subsequent funding annually. President Bush supported the plan under the Andean Counterdrug Program, funding counternarcotics programs in various countries. The U.S.-Colombian partnership shifted focus in 2002 to combat drug trafficking and terrorist organizations using counterdrug funds. Formerly, the ACP and FMF accounts supported crop eradication efforts. Military Financing (FMF) accounts in Colombia support eradication of coca and opium poppy crops, interdiction of narcotics shipments, and infrastructure protection through training and material support for security forces. US assistance includes alternative crop development, infrastructure development, and institution building programs to strengthen democracy. Human rights training programs are provided for security personnel in response to concerns about abuses. Congress has set limits on the number of US personnel stationed in Colombia in support of Plan Colombia. The United States supports Plan Colombia with contractor personnel stationed in Colombia, with a cap of 1,400 personnel. The Air Bridge Denial Program aims to interdict drug shipments by identifying and forcing down suspect aircraft. The program was suspended in 2001 but renewed in Colombia in 2003 with new safeguards. In 2008, operational and financial responsibility for Plan Colombia programs began to be transferred to the Colombians. The United States has been supporting Plan Colombia with contractor personnel stationed in the country. Over the past four years, U.S. funding for the program has decreased, leading to the successful nationalization of several programs. President Uribe emphasized aerial eradication and alternative crop development to reduce cocaine production. The eradication spraying program began in 2000, but spraying alone does not prevent the replanting of illicit crops. According to the 2012 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, manual eradication in Colombia fell to 45,000 hectares in 2010 and just over 34,000 hectares in 2011 due to security concerns, budget issues, and coca dispersion to smaller fields. The report also mentions attacks on eradicators by traffickers and armed groups, with 9 killed and 32 injured in 2011. The United Nations and United States use different methodologies to estimate coca cultivation levels in Colombia, with varying results and trends. The UNODC suggests that Colombia's coca cultivation declined from 73,000 hectares in 2009 to 62,000 hectares in 2010 when adjusting for small fields. In 2010, Colombia's coca cultivation decreased from 116,000 hectares to 100,000 hectares, a 14% decline. The U.S. government estimated a further decrease to 83,000 hectares in 2011, while the UNODC reported a slight increase to 64,000 hectares. Aerial eradication has been controversial due to environmental and health concerns, with critics arguing it harms farmers' livelihoods. Glyphosate, the herbicide used, was deemed safe by the Secretary of State until FY2012. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has confirmed that the aerial spray program in Colombia meets safety standards. Many Colombians believe aerial fumigation has serious health consequences, and international NGOs criticized the certification process. USAID funds programs to help farmers switch from illicit to licit crops, creating jobs and infrastructure in coca-growing areas. In September 2009, the United States completed 1,290 social and productive infrastructure projects in Colombia with communities that agreed to stay free of illicit crops. USAID Mission in Colombia reported progress in alternative development through Plan Colombia, benefiting 479,221 families and supporting 476,215 hectares of licit crops by FY2010. However, the success of alternative development has been limited by security concerns and program scope, as highlighted in the 2008 GAO report. In 2006, USAID proposed withdrawing assistance from areas with increasing coca production due to security concerns. UNODC reported that only 9% of Colombian coca growers were reached by alternative development programs, calling for increased international donor support. USAID redesigned its strategy to relocate coca growers to zones with economic opportunities, implementing projects like MIDAS and ADAM between 2006 and 2011. USAID projects like MIDAS and ADAM have helped rural families produce thousands of hectares of licit crops and create jobs. However, criticisms include not reaching the most vulnerable to coca cultivation and lacking adequate income substitution. The \"zero coca\" policy in Colombia is seen as a barrier to assisting impoverished farmers at risk of coca cultivation. Proponents of U.S. policy argue that eradication and alternative development programs in Colombia need time to work and that alternative development alone does not reduce drug crops. The National Consolidation Plan in 2008 aimed to integrate alternative development with eradication efforts. The Colombian Ministry of Defense introduced a new security policy in 2007 to consolidate gains in reducing violence and increase state presence in areas with insurgent activity. The National Consolidation Plan (PNC) in Colombia aims to consolidate state presence in marginal areas with insurgent activity, drug trafficking, and violence. The strategy combines security, counternarcotics, and development to establish a positive state presence in contested zones. Led by civilian and defense officials, this approach focuses on the interdependence of military and social actions for success. The National Consolidation Plan in Colombia aims to consolidate state presence in areas with insurgent activity, drug trafficking, and violence. Regional consolidation centers staffed by civilian, police, and military personnel are key to this strategy. Pilot projects in the Macarena and Montes de Mar\u00eda regions have shown success in reducing coca cultivation. Critics have raised concerns about the blending of military and civilian activities. The blurring of lines between military and civilian activities in Colombia poses dangers, leading to a need for increased civilian leadership and representation of community interests. USAID and the U.S. Department of Defense have supported consolidation programs since 2007. The Colombia Strategic Development Initiative aligns U.S. assistance with the new strategy, collaborating with Colombia since 2008 on integrated counternarcotics initiatives. President Santos relaunched the National Consolidation Plan in 2010 to target zones for new economic growth. The Plan now focuses on 51 priority municipalities out of 1,100 nationwide. The U.S. government provides alternative development assistance in 51 priority municipalities in Colombia, focusing on immediate needs like infrastructure projects and long-term support for licit crop production. The 2012 INCSR highlights the success of counternarcotics efforts in Colombia but warns that gains are not irreversible. U.S. funding for Plan Colombia and follow-on strategies totaled over $8 billion from FY2000 to FY2012. Funding supported eradication and interdiction programs through the Andean Counterdrug Program account, with alternative development and institution building programs funded through the Economic Support Fund account in FY2008. The Obama Administration shifted ACP funds to the INCLE account in the FY2010 request. Aerial eradication programs are supported from the State Department's Air Wing account. The Defense Department requests a lump sum for counternarcotics programs worldwide under Sections 1004 and 1033, and Section 124 of the National Defense Authorization Act. DOD can reallocate funds as needed. Additional funding for training and equipment has been provided to Colombia by the Defense Department for years. GAO reported in October 2008 that Plan Colombia had only partially met its drug reduction goals. In the years 2000-2006, coca cultivation and cocaine production increased despite efforts to reduce drug activity. The Colombian government, with U.S. assistance, made security gains, but coca farmers countered eradication efforts. Alternative development programs were lacking in key coca-growing areas. Debate in Congress focused on balancing security assistance with traditional development and rule of law programs in Colombia. Since FY2008, Congress has adjusted assistance for Colombia, reducing security-related programs and increasing economic and social aid. There is a desire for a quicker transfer of military responsibility from the U.S. to Colombia. In FY2012, the balance between traditional development and security assistance was close to 50/50, with significant DOD support. Total assistance for Plan Colombia in FY2012 was $490 million. In FY2012, assistance to Colombia from State Department and DOD was $490 million. In FY2013, State Department's budget request decreased to $332 million, 13% lower than the previous year. The Obama Administration's budget request for Colombian foreign assistance has broad support. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed additional funding for economic support and counternarcotics, while the House Appropriations Committee also suggested additional funding. The House Appropriations Committee version of the bill, H.R. 5857, would provide additional funding for Foreign Military Financing and International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement accounts to support security and counternarcotics training by the Colombian government. Congress passed a Continuing Appropriations Resolution in September 2012, maintaining aid levels from FY2012. The United States and Colombia signed a Defense Cooperation Agreement in 2009 for joint counternarcotics and anti-terrorism operations. The U.S. Congress authorized $46 million for construction at the Palanquero air base in Central Colombia in 2009 for joint counternarcotics and anti-terrorism operations. However, the agreement was declared unconstitutional by the Colombian Constitutional Court in 2010. The agreement had caused hostility from neighboring countries like Venezuela and Ecuador, but not moving forward with it has helped lower regional tensions. The cap on the number of U.S. personnel deployed in Colombia remains at 800 military personnel and 600 contractors. The U.S. Congress authorized $46 million for construction at the Palanquero air base in Central Colombia in 2009 for joint counternarcotics and anti-terrorism operations. The cap on the number of U.S. personnel deployed in Colombia remains at 800 military personnel and 600 contractors. U.S. personnel presence has declined below half of the authorized cap, with ongoing focus on human rights abuses by various groups and slow progress in investigating extrajudicial killings. Since 2002, Congress has required annual certification from the Secretary of State that Colombian military and police are severing ties to paramilitaries, investigating human rights abuses, and prosecuting offenders. Funding to Colombian military is contingent on these certifications. Despite declining extrajudicial execution allegations, reports suggest the practice continues, leading to criticism from NGOs disputing U.S. findings. Some human rights groups have presented evidence contradicting U.S. findings to the State Department. The human rights certification process involves consultation with Colombian and international groups, aiming to improve compliance. The Leahy Amendment prohibits assistance to foreign security forces involved in gross human rights violations. The Leahy Amendment prohibits assistance to foreign security forces involved in gross human rights violations, with the most recent restriction on DOD funding appearing in Section 8058 of P.L. 112-74. Despite measures in place, human rights organizations argue that the U.S. government often overlooks questionable activities of Colombian security forces. The George W. Bush Administration announced negotiations for a free trade agreement with Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia in 2003. After talks broke down, the US pursued separate agreements with Colombia and Peru. The US-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement was signed in 2006 and approved by Congress in 2011 after controversy. The implementation of the FTA with Colombia was delayed due to controversy. Proponents believed it would benefit U.S. businesses and strengthen bilateral trade, while critics raised concerns about Colombia's labor rights record and high levels of violence. Human rights considerations were a key point in congressional debates, with opponents highlighting the victimization of labor activists. Proponents argued that Colombia had made progress in reducing violence and enhancing security. The Obama Administration aimed to finalize free trade agreements with South Korea, Panama, and Colombia in 2011. Congress approved the U.S.-Colombia agreement in October 2011, with a focus on labor issues and violence against trade unionists. The Andean Trade Preference Act was renewed for Colombia and Ecuador through July 2013 as part of the legislation. The ATPA renewal allowed Colombian imports to enter the U.S. duty-free, giving time for transition before the CFTA. An Action Plan on labor rights was agreed upon by Presidents Santos and Obama to address concerns about protection of labor rights and violence against labor leaders in Colombia. The Colombian government must implement measures in the Action Plan for the President to declare the CFTA's entry into force. The plan aims to address labor issues in Colombia, with mixed reactions to its potential impact. President Obama and President Santos announced the CFTA would enter into force on May 15, 2012, after affirming that commitments related to labor rights had been met. The trade agreement between the U.S. and Colombia eliminated duties on 80% of U.S. exports immediately and will remove most tariffs within 10 years. U.S. investment and trade with Colombia have increased since the agreement. The Action Plan addressed violence against labor unionists, with a decline in killings from 2002-2005 but a rise in 2006. Data on labor unionist murders vary, with reports of 28 to 47 killings in 2009. In 2011, there was a decrease in labor unionist homicides in Colombia. The ENS reported 29 homicides in the year the Action Plan was signed, along with ongoing threats and violence against trade union representatives. Violence against labor union members occurs within a high overall societal violence context. Colombia has reduced its homicide rate over the past decade. Colombia has significantly reduced its homicide rate over the past decade, with more than 15,400 homicides in 2010. Critics question the government's protection of labor unionists, noting that labor murders have a politically intimidating effect. The Colombian government has defended its record by highlighting the overall drop in violence, with total homicides decreasing by 46% from 2001 to 2010. The reduction in labor union homicides in Colombia from 2001 to 2010 is significant, with a 70-80% decrease according to different sources. Critics raise concerns about ongoing violence against labor leaders and other vulnerable groups, as well as impunity for past acts of violence. Only a few investigations have been completed, despite over 2,000 alleged incidents of violence. The Colombian Prosecutor General's office, established in 2006, has 25 prosecutors and 150 investigators working on 1,465 labor-related cases. The Labor Sub-Unit has achieved 499 convictions against individuals who committed violent acts against trade unionists, but more needs to be done to end impunity. Human Rights Watch reports that out of 195 trade unionist killings since 2007, the unit has only achieved convictions in six cases. Measures in the April 2011 Action Plan aim to strengthen the Colombian judicial system. The April 2011 Action Plan aims to strengthen the Colombian judicial system regarding labor violence prosecutions and urges the government to resolve labor cases that have been unresolved. It includes measures to prevent violence against labor activists, restrict exploitative labor cooperatives, and impose sanctions on businesses violating Colombian laws. The U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement's Action Plan aims to strengthen the Colombian judicial system regarding labor violence prosecutions and imposes sanctions on businesses violating Colombian laws. President Obama announced that most requirements of the Action Plan had been met, with ongoing compliance ensured through technical meetings and discussions between senior labor officials from both countries. With the approval of the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement in 2011 and its implementation in May 2012, the U.S.-Colombia partnership reached a significant milestone. Congress is overseeing the continued implementation of the Labor Action Plan and overall U.S. policy towards Colombia. Supporters highlight Colombia's role as a regional partner in counternarcotics efforts and its leadership in providing training to other nations. Progress has been made in improving security and weakening FARC guerrillas, leading to calls for maintaining security assistance to Colombia. Critics of current U.S. policy in Colombia argue for halting aerial spraying of drug crops and limiting aid to the Colombian military due to concerns about the negative popular reaction in rural areas. They emphasize the need to reduce illicit drug demand and interdiction efforts. Critics of U.S. policy in Colombia advocate for reducing aid to the Colombian military and focusing on interdiction and reducing drug demand in the United States. They also support providing economic and social aid to address root causes of the conflict, curbing human rights abuses, and promoting a negotiated end to the fighting. Members of Congress express concerns about labor activist killings, extrajudicial killings by the Colombian military, and the para-political scandal involving Colombian politicians and illegal paramilitaries. These human rights issues were central in the debate over the CFTA in 2011. The debate over the CFTA in 2011 remains part of Congress's oversight agenda."
