    "content": "Article II of the Constitution establishes the office of President of the United States, creates an executive branch of government, and forms the textual basis for much of the President's authority and power. Key clauses in Article II include the \"Vesting Clause\" and the Appointments Clause, which outline the President's executive powers and ability to appoint officials with Senate approval. The President, with Senate approval, appoints Ambassadors, Judges, and other Officers of the United States as outlined in the Constitution. The \"Take Care Clause\" requires the President to ensure laws are faithfully executed. Supreme Court decisions like Youngstown Sheet & Tube v. Sawyer and cases on presidential appointment authority further define separation of powers and presidential authority. The Constitution vests legal authority in the President, but each branch must stay within its own sphere of influence. The President cannot encroach on other branches' powers, and vice versa. This principle was highlighted in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, where the Court addressed President Truman's attempt to usurp Congress's legislative power. In Youngstown, the Court invalidated President Truman's executive order to seize steel mills during the Korean War, stating that the President's power must come from Congress or the Constitution. The Court determined that the seizure order was a legislative act as it was not authorized by any statute or constitutional provision. The Court in Youngstown invalidated President Truman's executive order to seize steel mills during the Korean War, citing it as an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers doctrine. Justice Jackson's concurrence introduced a three-part framework for assessing presidential actions in relation to congressional authority. Justice Jackson introduced a three-part framework for assessing presidential actions in relation to congressional authority. The framework categorizes presidential authority based on whether it is supported by Congress, relies on the President's independent powers, or goes against the will of Congress. In situations where presidential action is incompatible with Congress, the President's power is at its minimum. Justice Jackson introduced a three-part framework for assessing presidential actions in relation to congressional authority, categorizing presidential authority based on Congress's support, the President's independent powers, or opposition to Congress. President Truman's seizure of the steel mills was deemed unauthorized by Congress, conflicting with statutory policies, and beyond congressional control. Justice Jackson established that the seizure of the steel mills by President Truman was beyond congressional control, endangering the constitutional system's equilibrium. The appointment and removal of executive branch officials have been subjects of intense debate, with the Constitution silent on removal authority since the creation of the Department of Foreign Affairs. The House of Representatives, led by James Madison, supported the President's power to remove appointees during the creation of the Department of State. The Senate, however, was divided on the issue, with Vice President John Adams breaking the tie in favor of granting the President unfettered removal powers. The Supreme Court did not address the extent and location of the removal power until the 1926 case of Myers v. United States, which questioned the constitutionality of a Postmaster General's removal order. In 1926, Chief Justice William H. Taft declared a statutory provision on postmaster removal unconstitutional, granting the President executive power over appointment and removal of officers. The President's power of appointment and removal of executive officers is confirmed by his obligation to faithfully execute laws. Article II limits Congress's power to provide for appointments and removals, only allowing for inferior officers with Senate consent. The blending of legislative and executive actions in Article II is to be strictly construed, with the President's power of removal being established as an incident to his appointment function. Myers case established the President's power to remove officers he appointed, except federal judges. This raised questions about the constitutionality of independent agencies with statutory protection from removal. The President's removal authority was questioned in Humphrey's Executor v. United States, involving President Roosevelt's decision to remove FTC member Humphrey based on policy differences. The Court limited Myers' holding to only executive department units, stating the President couldn't remove Humphrey due to the FTC's quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial functions. Independent agencies, designed to be free from executive control, were distinguished from executive departments. The Congress has the authority to create entities that are independent from executive control, with fixed terms and removal only for cause. The tension between the President's removal power over executive departments and independent agencies was highlighted in cases like Myers and Humphrey's Executor. This conflict culminated in the 1988 case Morrison v. Olson, questioning the constitutionality of the Independent Counsel Act. In adopting the statute, Congress declared that an independent counsel appointed by a special court may only be removed by the Attorney General for specific reasons. The Court faced a dilemma regarding the independent counsel's duties and the President's removal power, as seen in previous cases like Myers and Humphrey's Executor. The validity of the statute was questioned, with arguments based on conflicting interpretations of executive functions and removal powers. The Court analyzed the Independent Counsel Act's removal restrictions in relation to the President's constitutional duties. It found that the Act did not impede the President's ability to perform his duties, as the counsel's authority was limited and the President had adequate removal power through the Attorney General. After Morrison, it is affirmed that Congress cannot interfere in the removal of officials handling purely executive functions. Congress has discretion in limiting the President's power to remove officials in the executive branch and independent agencies. However, there are essential offices crucial to the President's duties where limits on removal would be unconstitutional. Bright lines distinguishing types of offices no longer exist post-Morrison. After Morrison, there are no longer clear distinctions between different types of offices, requiring a case-by-case analysis. Prior to Professor Kagan's 2001 article, the analysis of separation of powers and presidential authority was divided into the \"traditional view\" and the \"unitary theory of the executive.\" Adherents of the traditional view believe that Congress has the authority to delegate decision-making power to department heads, while the unitary theory emphasizes the President's control over executive departments and agencies. Traditionalists argue that the President cannot override agency heads' decision-making authority when Congress has specifically vested it in them by law. They base their argument on constitutional text and principles of statutory construction. The Necessary and Proper Clause is often cited as granting Congress the power to delegate duties and powers to officers other than the President. Traditionalists argue that the President cannot override agency heads' decision-making authority when Congress has specifically vested it in them by law. They base their argument on constitutional text and principles of statutory construction, focusing on the plain language of statutory delegations employed by Congress. Congress typically delegates decision-making authority directly and unequivocally to agency heads, as seen in examples like the regulation of air pollution. Traditionalists argue that Congress vests decision-making authority directly with agency heads, not the President. They point to examples where Congress specifically grants the President authority to overturn agency decisions in emergency situations, such as in the Clean Air Act. Advocates of the \"unitary theory of the executive\" believe in the President's constitutional duty to provide policy direction, the power to remove non-compliant officers, and that Congress cannot assign executive powers to independent entities. Supporters of the \"unitary theory of the executive\" argue that the \"Vesting Clause\" in Article II grants exclusive power to the President, as seen in the language \"shall be vested.\" They also point to the \"Take Care Clause\" as further evidence of the President's constitutional obligation to execute laws faithfully. According to supporters of the unitary theory of the executive, the Vesting Clause in Article II grants all executive powers to the President, with the Take Care Clause reinforcing this power. They argue that the President's ability to appoint and remove officers of the United States further supports this theory. Historical examples and legal opinions are cited to bolster their argument. Supporters of the unitary theory of the executive believe that Presidents should have the power to remove all executive authority figures at will for increased political accountability. Professor Kagan argues that this theory does not fully explain President Clinton's success in controlling the executive branch. President Clinton increased his participation in administrative decision-making by adopting Reagan Administration policies. Professor Kagan's article highlights Clinton's use of directive authority and assertion of personal ownership over regulatory products, leading to a new form of administrative control. This control includes directive authority commands and Presidential ownership, such as public announcements of regulatory decisions by the White House. Professor Kagan's theory of \"presidential administration\" raises legal questions regarding the White House's direct announcement of regulatory decisions, challenging existing models of separation of powers. She reinterprets congressional delegations to executive branch officials under this framework. Professor Kagan's theory of \"presidential administration\" challenges existing models of separation of powers by asserting that ultimate decision-making authority lies with the President, not executive branch officials. This theory faces criticism for potentially conflicting with Justice Black's opinion in Youngstown Sheet & Tube. Kagan distinguishes her concept from past presidential actions by highlighting Congress's role in decision-making regarding seizures. According to Professor Kagan, President Clinton's directives were issued when Congress delegated authority to another entity. Youngstown did not address the President's authority in such situations. Kagan argues for broad presidential authority over agency decision-making based on delegation statutes. Professor Kagan argues for broad presidential authority over agency decision-making based on delegation statutes, assuming that the delegation runs to the specified agency official subject to the President's ultimate control. This includes the presumption that the President can participate by issuing directives to the designated official, as seen in the implementation of the Medicare statute by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Professor Kagan distinguishes between delegations to independent agencies and executive branch agencies regarding appointment and removal authority. For independent agencies, Congress limits the President's authority to insulate decision-making. In contrast, for executive branch agencies, Congress delegates knowing the official is subordinate to the President and subject to oversight, establishing a norm of deference to presidential options. In her theory of \"presidential administration,\" Professor Kagan challenges traditional and unitarian views on congressional delegations to executive officials, arguing that delegations to officials also imply delegation to the President. She responds to arguments against her concept, including the idea that Congress's silence on the President's role denies him authority. Professor Kagan challenges traditional views on congressional delegations to executive officials by arguing that delegations to officials also imply delegation to the President. She refutes the argument that Congress's silence on the President's role denies him authority, emphasizing the superior-subordinate relationship between the President and his cabinet officials. This relationship should be considered when interpreting delegation statutes that are silent on the President's role, allowing for the use of the President's directive powers. Professor Kagan argues that delegations to the President differ from delegations to other officials, as they allow for further delegation by the President and express Congress's preference for presidential involvement in the decision-making process. Professor Kagan argues that congressional delegations to the President indicate a preference for presidential involvement in decision-making, giving notice that Congress intends to hold him accountable. Traditionalists argue that this conflicts with Congress's preference for decision-making by administrative agencies. Professor Kagan's theory of \"presidential administration\" suggests that Congress has delegated authority to officials within the executive branch, rather than to agencies. This contrasts with the traditional preference for decision-making by administrative agencies. Kagan does not fully adopt the \"unitary theory of the executive\" due to concerns about establishing plenary control as a matter of constitutional law. Unitarians have failed to establish plenary control as a constitutional mandate due to lack of precision and relevance in Article II. Constitutional values defending this claim are too diverse and easily manipulated. Removing decisions about the President-administration relationship from the democratic process would overturn established law and government institutions. Restrictions on the President's removal authority are likely to remain, making any attempt to change the practice challenging. Professor Kagan rejects the \"unitary theory of the executive\" by differentiating between delegations to executive branch agencies and independent agencies. She accepts Congress's power to create agencies insulated from Presidential control. Professor Kagan's concept of \"presidential administration\" involves creating agencies separate from Presidential control, positioning it closer to the right end of the spectrum between traditional views and the \"unitary theory of the executive.\" Despite generating academic debate and over 300 citations, her views on congressional delegation and executive control are not expected to lead to legal disputes. The limited instances of judicial review in Presidential Administration show courts have been reluctant to address the constitutionality of presidential involvement in rulemaking. For example, in Public Citizen Health Research Group v. Tyson, a challenge was made regarding a rule on ethylene oxide, where a critical portion was deleted based on a command from the Office of Management and Budget. The court in Public Citizen Health Research Group v. Tyson addressed the Office of Management and Budget's involvement in rulemaking, raising constitutional questions but ultimately focusing on the lack of support for the agency's decision to delete material. Judicial review in Presidential Administration is limited, with constitutional issues often resolved during the lawmaking process through collaboration between the President, administration, and Congress. In a case involving administrative structures and presidential activities, Professor Kagan explores the application of \"presidential administration\" in administrative law, focusing on the non-delegation doctrine and judicial review of agency action. The non-delegation doctrine prohibits Congress from delegating legislative authority to another branch of government to maintain the constitutional system. This concept could potentially be recognized judicially in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has rarely invalidated congressionally delegated grants of authority, only doing so twice for improper delegation of legislative power to the executive branch. Despite the concept of non-delegation, the Court has granted Congress broad power to delegate legislative authority to coordinate branches since 1935, as long as an intelligible principle is established. Legal concern over legislative grants of authority focuses on congressional abdication rather than the act of delegation. The non-delegation doctrine focuses on congressional abdication of core legislative functions, requiring Congress to make policy decisions and set legal standards to avoid separation of powers conflicts. It has been applied when Congress delegates power directly to the President, emphasizing government accountability. Professor Kagan argues that the non-delegation doctrine should welcome presidential involvement in administration to ensure accountability and transparency. She suggests that delegations of congressional authority to the President enhance democratic values and should not be presumed as violations of the doctrine. Professor Kagan argues that the non-delegation principle should not apply to delegations involving the President's active decision-making role. She suggests that judicial review should consider the extent of presidential involvement in agency actions, proposing improvements to doctrines like Chevron and the \"hard look\" doctrine. In Chevron, the Supreme Court established a two-part test for judicial review of agency statutory interpretations. If Congress has directly spoken to the issue, the court must follow Congress's intent. If not, the court must defer to the agency's interpretation if it is permissible. This allows agencies to fill gaps in statutes with regulations. The Supreme Court established a two-part test in Chevron for judicial review of agency statutory interpretations. If Congress has spoken directly, the court follows Congress's intent; otherwise, it defers to the agency's permissible interpretation to fill statutory gaps with regulations. Courts may not substitute their interpretation for that of an agency, as agencies resolve policy choices left by Congress based on expertise and everyday realities, not for the judiciary to assess wisdom. The judiciary's role in assessing policy choices and resolving competing views of the public interest, along with agency expertise in regulations, is highlighted by Professor Kagan. She criticizes courts for granting deference to agency regulations without considering the President's role in the process, which she believes undermines Chevron's rationale. Kagan argues that Chevron deference should promote actual presidential control over administrative actions. Professor Kagan argues for promoting actual presidential control over administrative actions, suggesting that Chevron deference should only apply when presidential involvement reaches a substantial level. This would weaken deference to independent agencies, which are designed to be insulated from presidential control. Review of agency decision-making processes should be done under the \"hard look doctrine,\" not Chevron. The \"hard look doctrine\" is used for reviewing agency decisions, not Chevron deference. In State Farm, the Court reviewed a decision by the Secretary of Transportation to rescind a rule on automatic seatbelts or airbags due to ineffectiveness. The Court emphasized that arbitrary and capricious review is narrow and does not involve substituting the court's judgment for the agency's. The Court rejected the agency's action for failing to consider key aspects of the problem and offering implausible explanations. It criticized the agency for not considering the possibility of inertia causing people to leave seatbelts attached and for not explaining why a mandatory airbag option was not considered. The Court found the agency's decision to lack a rational connection between facts and judgment, failing the arbitrary and capricious standard. The Court remanded the matter to the agency for further consideration, emphasizing the need for a reasoned analysis when changing course. The \"hard look doctrine\" developed in State Farm may overlook presidential involvement in agency decisions, with a proposed revision by Professor Kagan focusing on the President's leadership and accountability. This revision would reduce the scrutiny of the \"hard look\" analysis if evidence shows the President's active role in the administrative decision. Professor Kagan proposes a standard for evidence of presidential involvement and responsibility in administrative decisions. This could potentially change administrative law doctrines and provide insight into her approach to future Supreme Court cases. Professor Kagan's proposed standard for evidence of presidential involvement in administrative decisions could lead to fewer actions entitled to deference from the courts. This may increase reliance on the President for guidance and ensure deferential treatment of decisions challenged in court. Adoption of Kagan's \"hard look doctrine\" could reduce the number of administrative decisions rejected by the judiciary, raising concerns about decreased judicial review and increased presidential influence in decision-making. Professor Kagan's Presidential Administration discusses the potential impact of increased executive influence and reduced judicial scrutiny on administrative agencies. The article does not address the President's authority in foreign affairs and national security, focusing instead on the Clinton Administration's domestic policy successes. Kagan's views on national security and foreign affairs, including detention, surveillance, interrogation, and rendition, are not fully addressed in her work on Presidential Administration. Speculation on her executive power views has drawn criticism from both progressive and conservative perspectives. Professor Kagan's views on executive power, particularly regarding the \"unitary theory of the executive,\" have sparked debate. Some argue that her partial acceptance of this theory could align with George W. Bush's administration's positions. However, critics, including some conservatives, point out her rejection of the theory that the Constitution mandates a unitary executive. This has raised questions about her stance on presidential powers. Overall, her work on Presidential Administration offers a complex perspective on executive-congressional relations in domestic policy. Professor Kagan's theory on executive power emphasizes strong presidential involvement in policy decisions and actions of administrative agencies. While favorable to the executive branch, it allows Congress to delegate functions to independent agencies beyond the President's control. This theory has real-world legal consequences, particularly in administrative law, that may be reviewed by the Supreme Court. The academic paper \"Presidential Administration\" influences potential decision making on foreign affairs and national security for a Supreme Court Justice, but the impact remains uncertain."
