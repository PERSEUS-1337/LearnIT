    "content": "The Nuclear Waste Protection and Responsible Compensation Act may be cited as the Act. Its purpose is outlined in Section 2. The Act aims to ensure the permanent program for disposal of nuclear waste continues with political support and funding, enhance safety of on-site storage, meet federal obligations without taxpayer funds, and prioritize removal of waste from shutdown reactors. Radioactive waste from shutdown nuclear reactors is prioritized for removal once the permanent disposition program is licensed. The bill prohibits the transport of commercial spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste for offsite storage until a final license for permanent disposition is issued. State and local governments have the authority to negotiate additional safety measures for on-site storage, and compensation is provided for continued on-site storage. Each nuclear power utility must deposit the amount they would pay into the Nuclear Waste Fund into a Nuclear Waste Escrow Account starting in fiscal year 2000. The Secretary of Energy will collect the balance of these accounts in 2004 and 2009, depositing the funds into the Nuclear Waste Fund. The Secretary retains rights to these accounts beyond 2009 to ensure funding for the long-term disposal of nuclear waste. Each nuclear power utility must establish a Nuclear Waste Escrow Account to ensure funds for long-term disposal of nuclear waste. The account must be invested to earn market rates of return, with excess interest placed into a Utility On-site Compensation Fund. Utilities must manage the account according to regulations for decommissioning assurances. The Utility On-site Compensation Fund is established for the storage of nuclear waste and high-level radioactive waste. Any remaining funds will be paid to the Secretary for the Shutdown Reactor Fund. The Secretary will establish the Federal Shutdown Reactor Fund for deposits from the Utility On-site Compensation Fund. The Secretary shall pay to each Utility Shutdown Reactor Fund an amount from the Federal Shutdown Reactor Fund to cover on-site storage costs of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste at shut down reactors. SEC. 6. PRIORITY FOR SHUTDOWN REACTOR WASTE. The spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste queue will prioritize materials from shutdown nuclear reactors. SEC. 7. DEFINITION. Spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste are classified as non-defense wastes."
