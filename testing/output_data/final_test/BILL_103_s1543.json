    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Cancer Screening Incentive Act of 1993\". The Congress finds that early detection and screening for cancer can significantly reduce cancer morbidity. Concerns about the costs of these procedures hinder physicians from ordering them, especially for low-income Americans without adequate insurance coverage. Socioeconomically disadvantaged Americans are disproportionately affected by cancer in terms of incidence and mortality. Demographic forecasts predict a doubling of the elderly population by 2020, making cancer prevention in this group increasingly important. A new section, SEC. 35, is added to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, providing a Cancer Screening Test Credit. This credit aims to address the impact of cancer on socioeconomically disadvantaged Americans and the growing elderly population. A new section, SEC. 35, is added to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, providing a Cancer Screening Test Credit. The credit allows for a maximum of $250 for eligible individuals and $200 for taxpayers with taxable income exceeding a certain threshold, for qualified cancer screening tests not covered by insurance. The Cancer Screening Test Credit allows a qualified provider to claim a credit for the cost of screening tests provided to low-income individuals. Eligible individuals can receive up to $250 for tests not covered by insurance. A qualified cancer screening provider is defined as a medical practitioner, facility, hospital, laboratory, or similar institution licensed to provide cancer screening tests. A qualifying low-income individual is someone whose income does not exceed 150 percent of the official poverty line. The Secretary will publish a list of cancer screening tests that qualify for a tax credit, including physical breast examination and mammogram. The tax credit for cancer screening includes physical breast examination, mammogram, digital rectal examination, proctosigmoidoscopy, blood stool test, rectal examination for prostate cancer, Pap test for uterine cancer, and pelvic examination for ovarian cancer. Adequate records must be maintained for each qualifying low-income individual. Coordination with deductions for medical expenses is required. The tax credit for cancer screening is amended to include coordination with health insurance credit and the amount of the cancer screening test credit allowable to the taxpayer. Additionally, a clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart C of the tax code. The tax credit for cancer screening is amended to include coordination with health insurance credit and the amount of the cancer screening test credit allowable to the taxpayer. Effective Date: The amendments apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1993."
