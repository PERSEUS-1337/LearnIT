    "content": "Congress has established numerous advisory bodies over the past two decades to assist in legislative, oversight, and investigative tasks. These bodies vary in purpose, membership, and appointment mechanisms, with some being commissions, boards, or advisory committees. They are collectively referred to as \"congressional advisory bodies\" and are created to address specific policy issues or administrative tasks. Congress has established numerous advisory bodies over the past two decades to assist in legislative, oversight, and investigative tasks. These bodies, known as \"congressional advisory bodies,\" have a well-defined mandate and often submit final reports to Congress with detailed findings and recommendations. Some have a specific lifespan, while others provide ongoing support and advice. The membership of these bodies may include, be chosen by, or be recommended by Members of Congress. This report focuses on statutory groups with congressional participation in their membership selection process. This report provides background information on congressional advisory bodies and the role of Members of Congress in the appointment process. It aims to inform legislators of their appointment responsibilities and opportunities to serve on advisory bodies. The report also offers alternatives for membership language in future statutes based on existing appointment schemes. It identifies current advisory bodies where Members of Congress serve directly or make appointments. The curr_chunk discusses advisory entities created by Congress that involve Members of Congress in the appointment process. It excludes entities without congressional involvement and those requiring Senate \"advise and consent.\" Additionally, ad-hoc commissions and advisory groups formed by individual congressional committees are omitted. Advisory entities created by Congress involve Members of Congress in the appointment process, excluding those without congressional involvement or requiring Senate \"advise and consent.\" These bodies are generally short-term and may not always have clear termination dates. When appointing members to congressional advisory bodies, Members of Congress may act independently or in concert with others. The authority of appointment officials varies in common patterns, with some bodies requiring specific designated Members of Congress to be part of the membership. Leadership roles are typically limited to bodies handling internal administrative functions. For example, the Commission to Recommend Individuals for Appointment to the Office of Architect of the Capitol includes key congressional leaders. Members of Congress, along with selected leaders, appoint members to congressional advisory bodies with a balance between parties. Appointments are mandated to be made by leaders of both parties, with some bodies having equal numbers of majority and minority party appointees. Leadership roles are limited to bodies handling internal administrative functions. The ratio of appointments to a commission varies based on the President's party affiliation with the majority in Congress. Statutory appointment schemes for congressional advisory bodies often require Members of Congress to serve on these panels. The involvement of the majority and minority leaders of the Senate is specified for appointments made by the President pro tempore of the Senate. Leaders may recommend members, who may or may not be Members of Congress, for appointment to a congressional advisory body. The appointment process for congressional advisory bodies involves recommendations to congressional leaders, the President, or cabinet officials. Statutory provisions may limit the autonomy of appointing officials by requiring specific qualifications for members. Appointments may be restricted to individuals in certain government positions or representing specific organizations. The appointment process for congressional advisory bodies involves recommendations to congressional leaders, the President, or cabinet officials. The authority to appoint members is shared by the executive and legislative branches, sometimes prompting the President to comment on separation-of-powers issues. Some statutes instruct the President to appoint members from a list provided by congressional leadership. The Appointment Clause of the Constitution allows for appointment by the President with Senate consent or by the President alone, not from a list of nominees provided by congressional leadership. President George W. Bush made it clear that he would not be bound by membership recommendations from House and Senate leadership for advisory bodies. Legislators have various options for selecting members for advisory bodies, including having legislators serve on the panels to maintain control. However, this may contradict the purpose of delegating functions to reduce Congress's workload. Even without direct membership, legislators can influence the autonomy of the entity through appointment schemes. The legislation creating the 9-11 Commission did not require Members of Congress to be included in the commission's membership, but called for 9 out of 10 members to be selected by congressional leaders. The balance between members appointed by congressional leaders and others, as well as the qualifications of appointees, are crucial for advisory bodies to fulfill their congressional mandate. Each currently functioning congressional advisory body is profiled with a summary of its purpose and statutory duration provided. The termination dates of advisory bodies are provided, along with information on FACA applicability. Advisory bodies in the executive branch reporting to the President are governed by FACA, while those appointed by Congress and reporting only to Congress may not be bound by FACA. Some entities may be governed by FACA if they involve both congressional and presidential participation. The curr_chunk discusses the membership appointment structure of advisory bodies, detailing the various appointment schemes and the roles of key individuals in the legislative branch. The statutory language exempts advisory bodies from FACA requirements, and the appointment process varies among different boards. The curr_chunk discusses the appointment structure of congressional advisory bodies, highlighting the roles of Members of Congress and noncongressional officials. It also outlines the fixed terms of appointment for these bodies, categorizing them into temporary and permanent entities. The entries on the following pages showcase the diverse range of topics Congress has deemed worthy of examination. The curr_chunk provides information on the organization of congressional commissions, including details on appointment processes and the roles of congressional leaders. Tables outline the appointment responsibilities of major leaders and other committee members who may have authority in the process. The internet address of the entity's website is also included when available."
