    "content": "The \"Solar Fuels Innovation Act\" is also known as the Solar Fuels Basic Research Initiative, amending Section 973 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Solar Fuels Basic Research Initiative aims to expand knowledge in photochemistry, electrochemistry, biochemistry, and materials science for converting solar energy to chemical energy. It leverages expertise and resources from various programs within the Department of Energy and organizes multidisciplinary teams for research activities. The Secretary will organize multidisciplinary teams for aggressive basic research goals, providing sufficient resources over a determined period. Additional activities can be organized through various structures. As part of the Solar Fuels Basic Research Initiative, a program will support research to overcome scientific barriers in artificial photosynthesis. The Secretary will support research to bridge scientific barriers in artificial photosynthesis, including hydrogen and oxygen production from water, and carbon dioxide reduction to fuel products. The Assistant Secretary will oversee translational research and development of concepts. The program activities will be reviewed for technical milestones achievement. The Secretary will support research in artificial photosynthesis, including hydrogen and oxygen production from water, and carbon dioxide reduction to fuel products. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2017 through 2020 is specified, with funds allocated from specific accounts. No funds authorized can be used for commercial energy technology applications. The Secretary will support research in artificial photosynthesis to replicate natural photosynthetic processes using artificial components and materials. This includes activities such as photoinduced reduction of dinitrogen to ammonia, absorption of carbon dioxide, charge separation and storage, electron transfer, and catalysis in biological systems. The Director of the Office of Basic Energy Sciences and the Associate Director of Biological and Environmental Research will oversee these research efforts. The Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy will support research in systems biology and genomics to understand genetic and physiological pathways related to photosynthetic mechanisms. The Secretary will review program activities to assess technical milestones achievement. Authorization of appropriations is set for fiscal years 2017 through 2020 for carrying out activities under this subsection. The Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy program will receive $25,000,000 in funds, with a prohibition on using the funds for commercial energy technology applications. No additional funds are authorized for this section, and existing funds will be used for implementation. The Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy program will receive $25,000,000 in funds, with a prohibition on using the funds for commercial energy technology applications. No additional funds are authorized for this section, and existing funds will be used for implementation. Sec. 973. Solar Fuels Basic Research Initiative was passed by the House of Representatives on July 11, 2016."
