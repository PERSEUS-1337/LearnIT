The risks of implementing carbon control policies without global alignment have been central to discussions on U.S. greenhouse gas legislation. The debate on reducing greenhouse gases has raised concerns about how U.S. reduction programs would interact with those of other countries. Emissions may make industries less competitive globally, leading to potential carbon leakage. Proposed solutions include assisting greenhouse gas-intensive industries and imposing tariffs on certain imports from countries without comparable carbon policies. The issue of differentiated global carbon policies with respect to trade involves the lack of an international agreement on reducing greenhouse gases, carbon leakage, and economic effects. The U.S. climate change strategy debate focuses on the cost of compliance and its impact on the country's economy. The debate in Congress revolves around the cost of compliance, impact on competitiveness, and comprehensiveness of a reduction scheme for greenhouse gas emissions. The lack of an international agreement addressing these issues has led to discussions on unilateral trade provisions and subsidies. A comprehensive global agreement is seen as the most effective solution to address climate change. A comprehensive global agreement is necessary to address climate change, as unilateral solutions may only be temporary. The Australian Government suggests that binding carbon constraints for major emitters and sectoral agreements for emissions-intensive industries are the best solutions. In the absence of a global agreement, assisting industries affected by carbon reduction schemes may be necessary for environmental reasons and to ease the transition of the economy. The timing and acceptability of such a global agreement remain uncertain. International working groups under the Bali \"Action Plan\" are working on a \"Post-Kyoto\" agreement to be presented at the COP-15 meeting in Copenhagen. The complexity of carbon leakage involves differences in countries' economies and trade flows, making it a multifaceted issue. The focus is on minimizing carbon leakage resulting from differentiated carbon policies. It involves the risk of countries with carbon controls losing global market share to competitors without controls, counteracting emission reductions and benefiting non-compliant countries. The potential risk of carbon leakage from countries with carbon controls to those without, undermining emission reduction efforts and benefiting non-compliant nations. Studies show varying estimates of this phenomenon, with the EPA's analysis of the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act of 2008 providing insights into potential leakage impacts. The EPA found that international actions and U.S. reduction strategies are crucial for achieving emission reduction targets by 2050. A long-term agreement involving developing countries is seen as the most effective solution to prevent emission leakage. Sensitivity analysis showed potential leakage of U.S. reductions, with estimates of 11% in 2030 and 8%-9% in 2050 if non-Annex I countries do not reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The modest leakage rates estimated by the model are due to Annex I countries' demand for international credits from non-Annex I countries, reducing their emissions. Leakage has been studied by the EU through its Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), with little indication of leakage in phase 1. Various factors like strong demand for commodities and free allowance allocations have contributed to this. However, studies suggest that leakage may become a longer-term issue with more stringent reduction targets. The EU's climate change package aims for a 20% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2020. Analysis shows that aggressive reduction targets make it difficult to assess carbon leakage effects. The IPCC notes that model-based estimates suggest 5%-20% of domestic reductions may be offset by displacement. The IPCC suggests that 5%-20% of domestic reductions in greenhouse gases may be offset by displacement abroad. Empirical studies on energy-intensive industries under the EU-ETS indicate that carbon leakage is unlikely to be substantial due to various factors. Quantifying the benefits of international transfer of low carbon technologies is challenging. Competitiveness is a complex and ongoing phenomenon influenced by multiple factors. The Australian Government acknowledges that changes in cost structures of entities and industries are common in a market-based economy. High occupational health and safety standards have impacted the profitability of labor-intensive industries, making it harder for them to compete with foreign producers. Assistance is not typically provided to offset the effects of domestic policies on traded industries. Most industries face competition from both domestic and international producers of similar or substitute products. Most industries are price sensitive, and any increase in manufacturing costs, such as carbon emission reduction requirements, can harm a firm's competitiveness. Energy-intensive industries face additional challenges as competitors may experience different energy price increases based on their individual energy needs and power arrangements. This can impact the competitive balance of domestic facilities and influence investment decisions by industries. The emergence of new technology in industries could be influenced by volatile energy market signals and potential carbon policies. This new technology, if commercialized, could reduce the impact of carbon policies and improve competitiveness. Analysis on industry technology over the next 40 years is not covered in this report. A company's ability to compete under a carbon policy depends on the greenhouse gas intensity of its products, the ability to pass on increased costs to consumers, and product profitability. The company's ability to compete under a carbon policy depends on its greenhouse gas intensity, cost pass-on to consumers, and carbon emissions mitigation efforts. Greenhouse gas intensity factors play a crucial role in direct and indirect emissions from manufacturing processes. Energy-intensive industries are often discussed in relation to greenhouse gas intensity, but different plants may have varying energy sources and emissions. The impact of a carbon policy on industries depends on their greenhouse gas intensity, which can be measured using metrics like employment per unit of emissions or revenue generated per unit of emissions. Choosing the right indicator that represents industries fairly is challenging due to differences in transparency, variability, and emphasis on capital structure and labor needs. The impact of carbon policy on industries is influenced by their greenhouse gas intensity, which can be measured by factors like energy costs per product value and energy costs per employee. Determining carbon intensiveness is complex and varies based on the level of sector aggregation chosen to focus on. The energy costs of different industry categories vary significantly, with some subcategories having energy costs approaching or exceeding 20% of value. The emissions of a single product can also vary depending on the manufacturing process used, as shown by data on carbon dioxide emissions per ton of steel. The process used to manufacture steel has a significant impact on emissions. The production of raw steel is the most CO2-intensive step in steel production, with significant indirect emissions from electricity sources. Semi-finished steel production, which is the most carbon-intensive and electricity-intensive step, has a low product value compared to emissions. The product value at stake (VAS) ratio indicates high CO2 cost increases relative to product value in the semi-finish step of raw steel production. Downstream processes have a smaller impact on cost compared to semi-finished steel production due to CO2-induced cost increases. Site-specific considerations can lead to substantial differences in emissions. The emissions vary due to site-specific factors like plant age and maintenance, impacting cost effects of a carbon policy. Steel mills integrating production steps reduce overall costs. Relocation challenges may arise if linked processes like BOF and hot rolling are separated. Electric arc furnaces face constraints in scrap steel availability, affecting substitution possibilities. The ability of companies to pass through costs from carbon policies depends on demand price-responsiveness, market structure, and international competition. For example, the electricity sector can pass on costs due to price-inelastic demand and limited international competition. Chlorine production, being electricity-intensive, may face transport issues affecting substitution possibilities. The elasticity of demand in different sectors varies, affecting their ability to pass on costs from carbon policies. Sectors like raw steel, with high international trade exposure, may face challenges in raising prices. Elastic demand means consumers are sensitive to price changes and will seek alternatives, making it harder for companies to pass on cost increases. Sato and Neuhoff estimated the effects of price changes on demand for various commodities in Europe. Electricity and some other commodities have inelastic demand, while cement and steel products may have elastic demand. The estimates are indicative of pricing importance, not predictive. The concentration of firms in a market and government regulation influence cost pass-through ability. Market concentration indicators in the U.S. manufacturing sector are provided in Table 3. The market concentration in the U.S. manufacturing sector is measured by the market share of the Top 4 companies and the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) for the Top 50 companies. An HHI between 1000 and 1800 is moderately concentrated, while over 1800 is considered concentrated. Increases in HHI by more than 100 points in concentrated markets raise anti-trust concerns. Disaggregating sectors can reveal a more complex market concentration situation. Disaggregating sectors can reveal pockets of concentration in industries, impacting companies' ability to pass through costs. Government assistance should target categories unable to raise prices to avoid supporting unnecessary companies. International competition can also affect companies' cost pass-through abilities. International competition can impact cost pass-through abilities under a carbon reduction policy. Sectors that are price-takers on world markets may struggle to raise prices, leading to potential production cuts and factory relocations overseas. Import share of demand can indicate the availability of foreign substitutes. This information can help identify sectors that may have difficulty passing on cost increases. Several greenhouse gas-intensive sectors, including primary metals, basic chemicals, electronics, machinery, and transportation, have significant import penetration. Sectors like cement, lime, and paper have less import penetration. The average tariff rate on these sectors' products by the 15 largest World Trade Organization members indicates the perceived threat of international competition on domestic production viability. The average tariff rate on labor-intensive industries like apparel, textiles, and furniture, as well as greenhouse gas-intensive sectors such as nonmetallic mineral products and nonferrous metals, has been determined by the 15 largest members of the World Trade Organization. A recent report by McKinsey & Company highlights cost-effective ways for industries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. The report by McKinsey & Company highlights cost-effective ways for industries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. It notes the problem of fragmentation in achieving significant reductions, with abatement potential spread over various options dependent on favorable economics or regulatory support. Without supportive regulatory structures, some improvements may not be made, leading to emissions being \"off-shored\" to other economies. The timing of carbon policy affects industry response and options availability. In the short term, firms have limited ability to improve efficiency or switch to alternative energy sources. Over the medium to long term, firms can seek lower-carbon fuel sources and develop energy-efficient technology. Three approaches to assist greenhouse-gas-intensive industries are: assist domestic industry, penalize foreign competitors, and develop alternative sectoral approaches. The three approaches to assist greenhouse-gas-intensive industries are: assist domestic industry, penalize foreign competitors, and develop alternative sectoral approaches. Assistance could be in the form of free allocation of allowances, tax credits, or cash payments depending on the carbon scheme approach. Federal support for research and development could also encourage a smooth transition to a less-carbon-intensive industry. A cap-and-trade program aims to limit total greenhouse gas emissions by allowing polluters to trade pollution licenses. These licenses can be traded, banked for future use, or sold. Allowances can be allocated for free or auctioned by the government. The allowance system under a cap-and-trade scheme or carbon tax regime involves distributing value to affected parties. Instead of free allowances, a tax credit program can provide tax credits to industries based on their emissions. This approach is more straightforward for industries with direct emissions. The process of assisting greenhouse gas-intensive, trade-exposed industries can involve estimating eligible emissions for credit, phasing out systems over time, or transferring funds from the government to companies for various purposes like research and development. The potential means of addressing climate change trade issues include penalizing foreign competitors for not meeting carbon policies, implementing border adjustments to raise costs for competing goods, and encouraging negotiation of binding agreements. This process aims to expand regulations to foreign countries and could involve funding from various sources like general revenues or carbon taxes. The discussion revolves around border adjustments as a means to level the playing field in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Two main forms being considered are countervailing duties and International Reserve Allowances, with challenges in implementation highlighted by the Australian Government. The discussion focuses on using countervailing duties as a way to address embedded emissions in imported goods. Countervailing duties can help prevent subsidized imported products from undercutting domestic prices. This approach considers the lack of comparable carbon policies in foreign countries as a subsidy. The United States may impose countervailing duties on imported goods based on embedded carbon, seen as a subsidy by foreign countries. An alternative approach is an International Reserve Allowance (IRA) requirement, similar to a cap-and-trade system, focusing on imports of greenhouse gas-intensive products. Each IRA would equal one metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent, ensuring products from countries with insufficient carbon policies meet certain standards to enter the US. The proposed legislation would require products from countries with insufficient carbon policies to be accompanied by \"international reserve allowances\" based on greenhouse gas emissions. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would calculate an annual IRA requirement for each category of covered goods, with a method established for determining the required number of IRAs for each category of covered goods from a covered foreign country. The proposed legislation would require products from countries with insufficient carbon policies to be accompanied by \"international reserve allowances\" based on greenhouse gas emissions. EPA would establish procedures for determining IRA requirements for goods manufactured in multiple covered countries, revising them annually. Covered goods must be primary products or manufactured items generating significant greenhouse gas emissions and closely related to goods affected by the legislation. The proposed legislation aims to regulate products that generate significant greenhouse gas emissions, such as iron, steel, aluminum, cement, and others. It includes indirect emissions from electricity used in manufacturing and compares actions to limit emissions to those taken by the U.S. through various regulatory programs. Sectoral approaches are diverse options to address emissions from industrial sectors, ranging from domestic to international, voluntary to mandatory, and integrated into cap-and-trade schemes or standalone programs. The focus here is on mandatory and voluntary schemes that consider trade impacts of carbon policies. For instance, the International Iron and Steel Institute proposed a carbon intensity cap on steel at the COP in Bali in 2007, calculated on a per-ton basis. This approach involves collecting carbon dioxide data from steel plants. The International Iron and Steel Institute proposed a sectoral approach for carbon dioxide data collection from steel plants to develop intensity-based benchmarks for the industry. This approach aims to enable CO2 emission comparisons between regions and promote fair competition in the global steel market. The American Iron and Steel Institute and the China Iron and Steel Association support this carbon intensity mechanism. A carbon intensity mechanism supported by the China Iron and Steel Association could address concerns of foreign competition and emissions leakage in various industries. Negotiations would be needed to determine its effectiveness. Different sectoral approaches could have voluntary or mandatory participation, impacting direct emissions and cost responses to indirect emissions. The current Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) reflects approaches to encouraging participation by developing countries. A sectoral approach could help incorporate developing countries into global climate change efforts by focusing on transparency and performance metrics. The Centre for European Policy Studies (CEPS) Task Force emphasizes the importance of verified data collected by industry for sectoral approaches to lead to real and measurable reductions. This includes sharing best practices, technology transfer, and mechanisms to encourage developing countries' participation in global climate efforts. The design of an assistance program for industries facing cost increases from carbon policies presents challenges in defining goals, eligible participants, and enforcement. The government may struggle to pick winners and losers without access to proprietary data, leading to difficulties in crafting an acceptable program. Proposals to assist trade-exposed, greenhouse gas-intensive industries aim to promote international agreements, prevent emissions leakage, remove barriers to domestic legislation, aid industry transition, level the competitive playing field, and prevent job losses from carbon policies. The need for a global agreement to regulate greenhouse gas emissions raises questions about fairness and comparable obligations among countries. The need for a global agreement to regulate greenhouse gas emissions raises questions about fairness and comparable obligations among countries, particularly in relation to sectoral approaches and domestic assistance options. International agreements must also consider the strictures of the WTO, especially regarding border adjustments that may violate the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Measures challenged on GATT grounds would need to be justified under a GATT exception, such as those relating to the conservation of exhaustible resources. The WTO Appellate Body would likely examine if the United States made efforts to negotiate agreements before imposing import barriers, to determine if discrimination is unjustifiable. Seeking a sectoral agreement or imposing trade restrictions aims to prevent carbon leakage, which is an environmental goal. This could increase compliance costs with carbon reduction programs. The Government's Green Paper discusses the potential for carbon leakage and the use of policy to influence emissions-intensive industries. It highlights the challenges in quantifying the effects of carbon policies and the risk of production migration. Trade complexities and the difficulty in preventing carbon leakage are also emphasized. Greenhouse gas-intensive industries account for a small percentage of U.S. employment and GDP. A carbon policy may create jobs in renewable energy sectors, offsetting potential job losses in these industries. The potential job loss from differentiated carbon policy is a concern for communities dependent on factories and companies, such as Indiana where manufacturing sector is a significant employer. However, the WTO does not recognize job loss as a valid reason for GATT-inconsistent measures, and providing assistance to industry may not prevent job loss or relocation due to multi-faceted company decisions. The effects of carbon policies on competitiveness in trade-exposed industries are a key economic argument. It is unclear how much assistance would be needed to level the playing field without harming other parts of the economy. Some argue that government intervention may be necessary to prevent carbon leakage and maintain profitability. The Government may need to provide assistance to emissions-intensive and trade-exposed (EITE) industries to level the playing field without a carbon constraint. The level of assistance must be balanced against the impact on non-assisted sectors and may need to be adjusted over time to ensure sustainability. The need for balance in providing assistance to emissions-intensive and trade-exposed industries is emphasized by various studies. The Peterson Institute for International Economics and the World Resources Institute argue that focusing solely on the competitiveness of carbon-intensive industries is a narrow approach. They suggest caution in designing assistance for these industries due to the fundamental shift required towards a carbon-constrained economy, the overall cost to the economy, and the potential delay in emissions reductions. Assistance to greenhouse gas-intensive, trade-exposed industries can help transition to a less carbon-intensive future with less economic pain. Government should prioritize providing transitional assistance to industries most affected by a carbon price scheme. The introduction of a carbon price scheme aims to assist industries with significant capital investments and limited capacity to reduce emissions, balancing the need to level the playing field with achieving environmental goals. The United States has historically been reluctant to commit to mandatory emission targets due to concerns about costs, as seen in the negotiation of the UNFCCC. The Senate debated the ratification of a treaty that calls for voluntary control measures, raising concerns about compliance costs, competitiveness, and comprehensiveness. Assistance to greenhouse gas-intensive, trade-exposed industries aims to address these concerns. Eligibility for assistance is a key question, as these industries may be most affected by carbon policies increasing costs. Assistance to greenhouse gas-intensive, trade-exposed industries aims to address concerns about compliance costs and competitiveness. Eligibility for assistance is determined by criteria such as the sector's greenhouse gas intensity, viability tied to such processes, ability to pass on costs, and exposure to international competition. The steel industry, along with other greenhouse gas-intensive sectors like cement, lime, basic chemicals, and primary metals, may face challenges in reducing emissions and complying with regulations. These industries, which produce low-value, high greenhouse gas-intensive products, could be at risk of significant cost increases and limited ability to pass on carbon-related costs to consumers. This could result in economic downsides such as lost production and jobs, as well as environmental concerns like carbon leakage. The discussion highlights the complexity of defining \"greenhouse gas-intensive, trade-exposed\" industries, such as steel, cement, lime, basic chemicals, and primary metals. Determining industry eligibility for assistance would involve challenges like picking winners and losers, making fine distinctions, and resolving issues related to disaggregation levels, eligibility metrics, and determining entities. The proposed assistance for greenhouse gas-intensive, trade-exposed industries raises implementation questions regarding the allocation and form of assistance, tailored to individual sectors, subsectors, or facilities. Determining the appropriate amount of assistance is controversial and contentious, with a tradeoff between providing assistance and increasing the burden of carbon policy compliance on other parts of the economy. The proposed assistance for greenhouse gas-intensive, trade-exposed industries raises questions about tailoring assistance to different sectors and determining metrics for decision-making. The timing and adjustments of assistance, as well as termination conditions, are key issues to consider for long-term greenhouse gas reduction goals. The assistance for greenhouse gas-intensive, trade-exposed industries raises implementation and enforcement challenges due to the fragmentation of these industries. Data and methodologies must be robust to justify determinations and enforce requirements on producers, with a need for defining success or failure. Issues include data collection, quality assurance, international cooperation, negotiation of agreements, tariff implementation, metrics, and methodologies testing for rigor. The data needs for implementing trade or sectoral approaches to greenhouse gas-intensive, trade-exposed industries are substantial, with challenges in data collection, methodology, and international cooperation. Developing countries may face difficulties in collecting data, potentially resorting to methodological approaches that could lead to WTO challenges. Assistance from other countries may be sought for sectoral approaches if perceived as fair and beneficial for efficiency and technology improvement. The trade schemes may not encourage cooperation from countries if they do not perceive the approach as fair or beneficial for their economic situation. Unilateral attempts to address international issues like the lack of a comprehensive climate change treaty can be uncertain. Crafting a coherent program to achieve multiple goals in trade and economics faces daunting challenges with a high probability of unintended consequences. Trade sanctions on primary goods could negatively impact domestic downstream industries by driving up costs. Trade sanctions on steel or aluminum could increase costs for domestically manufactured products like automobiles and lead to more foreign exports to the US. Countries may shift exports from raw materials to finished goods to avoid sanctions. This could harm downstream companies using greenhouse gas-intensive goods. Foreign countries with stricter carbon policies could retaliate. The EU has already agreed to more stringent policies. The EU has agreed to stricter carbon reduction policies than the US. There is a risk of trade retaliation if the US implements a less stringent program. Domestic subsidies could lead to unintended outcomes, such as companies not using the money for modernization. Free allocations of allowances to greenhouse gas-intensive industries are popular under the Kyoto Protocol. The EU and other countries have implemented free allocation systems for greenhouse gas-intensive industries under cap-and-trade programs. This approach helps industries make cost-effective reductions and lowers the overall program cost compared to exempting them completely. Incorporating emissions in the cap from the start helps industries understand the carbon market and develop cost-effective compliance strategies. Putting exempted industries under the cap initially clarifies greenhouse gas emission policy for industry. Designing a free allocation system is complex, with key points of contention being the percentage of allowances allocated to greenhouse gas-intensive industries and the methodology. The allocation of free allowances to greenhouse gas-intensive, trade-exposed industries is a key point of contention in cap-and-trade programs. The resolution of this tradeoff determines the relief these industries would receive, with suggestions like allocating up to 30% of available allowances to them. The allocation of free allowances in cap-and-trade programs is a contentious issue, with suggestions for heavily greenhouse gas-intensive industries to receive 90% coverage and somewhat lesser industries to receive 60%. Various metrics can be used to resolve this, such as emissions per unit of revenue, to encourage domestic production and protect shareholder value. From an economic perspective, free allocation of allowances in cap-and-trade programs has drawbacks as it limits government auction proceeds. Studies suggest that auctioning allowances and using the revenues efficiently can significantly reduce program costs. Economists propose using auction revenues to offset taxes on beneficial activities or support public policies like research and development or aid for low-income families. The drawbacks of free allocation in cap-and-trade programs include the exclusion of other options, the possibility of windfall profits for some industries, varying compensation needs by industry, fluctuating allowance prices, and the risk of over-compensation. Additionally, free allocation may not achieve its intended purposes if allowances are based on historic production, leading to companies potentially pocketing allowances and reducing production or moving offshore. The primary advantage of a carbon tax credit option is that it allows for real-time emissions monitoring, reducing the chance for \"windfall\" profits. However, the primary disadvantage is that it may not effectively address the needs of greenhouse gas-intensive, trade-exposed industries. The primary advantage of cash payments for carbon emissions is transparency, as it allows for clear allocation of funds to specific sectors or companies. This can enhance public and congressional oversight compared to free allowance allocations under a cap-and-trade program. However, a potential drawback is that greenhouse gas-intensive, trade-exposed industries receiving credits may lack incentive to reduce emissions on their own. Tailoring a phase-out schedule to encourage adoption of more carbon-efficient technology could be complex and contentious. The disadvantage of cash payments for carbon emissions is the possible imprecision in allocations, as estimates of allowance prices may be off, leading to either a short-term loan or added expense for affected facilities. A carbon tax regime may offer more precision, making a cash payment program redundant. Border adjustments, such as countervailing duties and an international reserve allowance scheme, are considered economically efficient for implementing domestic carbon programs without distorting effects of domestic assistance. These adjustments aim to protect greenhouse gas-intensive industries from unfair competition and potentially level the international trade playing field. The debate on using trade approaches to address carbon leakage and influence major developing countries like China and India is complex. The American Enterprise Institute (AEI) Center for Regulatory and Market Studies suggests that coercing China through trade sanctions would face challenges, as only a small percentage of their exports to America would be affected. This raises questions about the effectiveness of using trade measures to encourage countries to adopt carbon policies. The debate on using trade approaches to address carbon leakage and influence major developing countries like China and India is complex. One country adopting trade sanctions will change trade flows without much impact on total demand for Chinese energy-intensive goods. U.S. sanctions on China would lead to other countries increasing exports to the U.S. and imports from China, but unlikely to compel China to adopt GHG controls similar to America's. Designing a border adjustment program is challenging due to the international scope and trade complexities. Terms like \"comparable action\" and \"embedded carbon\" must be defined to avoid discrimination between exporting countries to comply with WTO requirements. The complexities of implementing a border adjustment program under a cap-and-trade scheme involve determining a price per ton of embedded carbon and linking it to prevailing allowance prices. Definitions and methodologies for border adjustments raise questions about what constitutes \"comparable action\" and how to address countries with more stringent reduction levels. The United States must determine the right for other states to impose a border adjustment, including how to determine country of origin, \"similar product,\" and the scope of the program. Questions arise about collecting international trade and carbon data, complying with WTO requirements, determining \"embedded carbon,\" and handling products manufactured in multiple countries with varying policies. The implementation of an International Reserve Allowance (IRA) requirement in a cap-and-trade program raises various issues, including the need for a separate system, pricing mechanisms, and compensating mechanisms for domestic producers. Sectoral approaches, like the steel industry's proposal, have been suggested to address these challenges. The Bali conference of parties focused on \"cooperative sectoral approaches and sector-specific actions\" to address climate change. Different metrics, such as output-based performance standards, are being considered to measure success in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in various industries. This approach is seen as more acceptable to developing countries compared to emissions caps. A performance standard requires an agreed-upon benchmark for companies to achieve, allowing them to compare their performance against industry standards or best practices. Precise benchmarks based on technical assessments of best available technologies or practices at a micro level help plants identify needed improvements. Benchmarking can help determine best practices and target technical assistance in a voluntary scheme. However, achieving best practice may not be cost-effective if other factors like low energy prices are present. Technical benchmarks provide insight into current industry practices but may not predict future technological advancements. In a mandatory system, incentives can encourage industry progress. In a mandatory system, carrots and sticks can be used to incentivize industry to meet carbon intensity benchmarks. Companies above the average would be penalized, while those below would receive rewards. Additional incentives could be given for adopting innovative processes to achieve long-term goals. The effectiveness of these measures would depend on how they are integrated into the overall program. Benchmarking under \"crediting mechanisms\" has drawbacks due to its time-consuming and data-intensive nature. Operators may argue for special treatment, leading to an inflation in the number of benchmarks. Disclosure of proprietary data is a concern, but careful selection of performance indicators can address this issue. While useful for describing the current industry status, benchmarking may not provide guidance on future mitigation levels due to evolving technologies. The use of industry benchmarks to allocate effort and define winners and losers based on performance relative to the benchmark target. There is asymmetry of information between industries and governments regarding mitigation potential and cost, leading to proposed alternative performance standards. A proposed alternative performance standard suggests creating a trading program based on carbon intensity rates, where companies with higher intensities buy allowances from those with lower intensities. This system aims to encourage carbon policies in developing countries and includes a financing mechanism for technology transfer. The transfer of technology and expertise is typically included in proposals, especially in voluntary approaches. Mechanisms may assist inefficient domestic companies to improve performance standards. For example, the Dutch sectoral approach for industrial energy efficiency includes incentives funded by allowance auctions or carbon tax revenues. Most proposals for sectoral crediting are linked to cap-and-trade programs, where allowances act as currency. A voluntary sectoral scheme with crediting mechanisms already exists under the Kyoto Protocol. A sectoral scheme with crediting mechanisms, like the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the Kyoto Protocol, exists for financing emission reduction technology. However, a more structured approach is needed with country-specific baselines and emission reduction targets. This approach would cover the entire sector, penalizing poorly performing facilities and potentially implementing a \"no-lose\" provision for voluntary participation. The difficulties in setting baselines and reduction targets for emission reduction technology were noted. Table 5 summarizes approaches to trade-related issues, focusing on different objectives. Support for domestic industries aims to preserve competitiveness and jobs. Trade measures for foreign competitors may aid in international negotiation. The proposals focus on protecting greenhouse gas-intensive industries from unfair competition while awaiting an international agreement. The sectoral approach aims to integrate developing countries' industrial bases into a fair international framework. Various options include subsidies for affected industries and border adjustments through an international reserve allowance program to address trade-related issues in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Bali Action Plan includes sectoral approaches for the next phase of the Kyoto Protocol, with options such as free allocation of allowances to greenhouse-gas intensive industries. This approach aims to help domestic industries maintain competitiveness in the face of greenhouse gas reduction programs, but may not guarantee success. Metrics like carbon intensity and output-based metrics could be used to allocate free allowances, but this introduces complexity in data needs. The International Reserve Allowance scheme aims to level the playing field for domestic producers against competitors by implementing greenhouse gas reductions. However, defining terms like \"comparable action\" and \"embedded carbon\" to comply with WTO requirements poses challenges in program design and implementation. Annual assessments and setting new baselines would be necessary, along with determining a price per ton of embedded carbon. The International Reserve Allowance scheme aims to level the playing field for domestic producers by implementing greenhouse gas reductions. Challenges in program design include defining terms like \"comparable action\" and \"embedded carbon,\" setting new baselines, and determining a price per ton of embedded carbon. The use of allowances instead of money complicates tracking the scheme's impact on the economy. It is uncertain how affected trading partners would respond economically, environmentally, or politically, leading to consideration of a sectoral approach. The goal is to achieve an international agreement that is acceptable to all parties, but there is currently no agreed blueprint for such an approach. The details of these options and potential contingencies remain unclear. The potential options for achieving greenhouse gas reductions are vast, including domestic assistance approaches with various allocation and duration options, as well as different data collection methods. The details of these options will ultimately determine their effectiveness in meeting objectives. Designing an assistance program for greenhouse gas reductions would be challenging due to the complexity of defining goals, eligible participants, and enforcement. Industries may seek special considerations to offset cost increases, leading to the government having to choose winners and losers without access to all necessary data."
