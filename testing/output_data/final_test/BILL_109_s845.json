FINDINGS.\" Congress finds that disabled military retirees were required to fund their own veterans' disability compensation before 1999 by forfeiting $1 of retired pay for each $1 received in disability compensation. Since 1999, legislation has been enacted annually to expand eligibility criteria for relief of the retired pay disability offset. Priority has been given to easing financial inequities for severely disabled and combat-disabled retirees. Congress has authorized full eligibility within cost constraints. Congress has authorized full concurrent receipt for qualifying retirees with 100 percent disability ratings and combat-related disability ratings. The disability offset to retired pay is being phased out over 10 years for retired members with noncombat-related, service-connected disability ratings of 50 percent to 90 percent. Congress acknowledges the need for new eligibility thresholds, which may disappoint some disabled retirees. Congress is actively working to improve the current situation. Congress acknowledges the importance of protecting military retired pay earned through service and sacrifice, stating that it should not be reduced for retirees receiving veterans' disability compensation. Additionally, certain military retirees with service-connected disabilities are now eligible to receive both retired pay and veterans' disability compensation. The amendment extends Concurrent Receipt Authority to retirees with service-connected disabilities rated less than 50 percent, allowing them to receive both retired pay and veterans' disability compensation without reduction. Qualified retirees are members or former members of the uniformed services entitled to retired pay. The amendment allows retirees with service-connected disabilities rated less than 50 percent to receive both retired pay and veterans' disability compensation without reduction. Qualified retirees are entitled to retired pay with less than 20 years of service creditable and computed under specific sections of the title. The amendment allows retirees with service-connected disabilities rated less than 50 percent to receive both retired pay and veterans' disability compensation without reduction. Members eligible for retired pay can also receive veterans' disability compensation concurrently. This allows retirees with service-connected disabilities rated less than 50 percent to receive both benefits without reduction. Amendments are made to eligibility criteria for Tera Retirees under title 10, United States Code. The changes specify that retirees must be entitled to retired pay and have a combat-related disability. Additionally, standardization amendments are made to align provisions with CRSC rules for chapter 61 retirees. Amendments to eligibility criteria for Tera Retirees under title 10, United States Code include a special rule for Chapter 61 Disability Retirees, where retired pay is subject to certain conditions. The amendments made by this Act will be effective as of January 1, 2006, and will apply to payments for months starting on or after that date."
