The Congress finds that electronic data exchanges are crucial for federal agencies and small manufacturers, and must be made Year 2000 compliant to avoid malfunctions and inaccuracies in computer systems. Coordination with exchange partners is essential for effective testing and implementation of new data exchanges. Small manufacturers play a significant role in the country's manufacturing sector, but many have not started Year 2000 remediation projects. It is crucial for their computer systems to be Year 2000 compliant to avoid disruptions. The global scale of addressing the Year 2000 computer problem is essential to prevent economic disruption in the United States. The global scale of addressing the Year 2000 computer problem is crucial to prevent economic disruption. Currently, there is little guidance for consumers in purchasing Year 2000 compliant goods. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" is a section that likely provides definitions for terms related to the Year 2000 computer problem. The Act defines \"data exchange testing\" as testing software for exchanging data, \"small and medium-sized businesses\" as those with less than 500 employees, and \"Year 2000 compliant\" as accurately processing date and time data for the transition between the 20th and 21st centuries. The term \"Year 2000 computer problem\" refers to potential issues in computer hardware and software related to correctly interpreting year date data represented in 2-digit-year format. SEC. 4. FEDERAL AGENCY ACTIONS. To ensure uninterrupted computer operations by Federal agencies after December 31, 1999, each agency must ensure Year 2000 compliance of systems and hardware. This includes establishing testing schedules for new data exchange formats and notifying data exchange partners. To ensure uninterrupted computer operations post-December 31, 1999, agencies must prioritize notifying data exchange partners about the implications of not making timely date conversion corrections, installing filters to prevent system corruption, and developing contingency plans for potential data exchange failures. After December 31, 1999, agencies must notify data exchange partners about timely date conversion corrections. Quarterly meetings with partners are required to assess progress, followed by reports to Congress summarizing meeting results and status of key data exchange corrections. SEC. 5. ASSISTANCE FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES.\n\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology, along with the Small Business Administration, will create a Year 2000 compliance outreach program for small and medium-sized businesses. This program will include a self-assessment checklist, information on the Year 2000 computer problem, Federal Government resources, and compliant products from the General Services Administration. SEC. 6. INTERNATIONAL ASSESSMENT.\n\nWithin 3 months of this Act's enactment, the Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology, with other Federal agencies, will submit a report to Congress on the global impact of the Year 2000 computer problem. The report will cover Year 2000 compliance of US trading partners, sharing best practices, economic effects on world trade and the US economy, and Federal agencies' involvement in international efforts.\n\nSEC. 7. CONSUMER AWARENESS. The Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology will develop a Year 2000 consumer awareness program to help the public understand the implications of the Year 2000 computer problem. This program will include a self-assessment checklist, a list of government resources, information on compliant products, and public awareness announcements on the impact of the issue on consumer products and services. The Year 2000 computer problem could impact Federal Government services to the public. Progress is being made by Federal agencies to resolve the issue. SEC. 8. ASSISTANCE TO HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. The Food and Drug Administration, in collaboration with the Veterans' Administration, will develop a Year 2000 compliance outreach program for health care providers. This program will include a self-assessment checklist, explanation of the Year 2000 computer problem, list of best practices, federal resources, and information on Year 2000 compliant biomedical devices and equipment. The FDA and Veterans' Administration will create a Year 2000 compliance outreach program for healthcare providers, including a checklist, best practices, federal resources, and information on compliant devices. The program will also involve listing computer problems and ensuring independent verification. SEC. 9. Assistance for the water utility sector. The Environmental Protection Agency will develop a Year 2000 compliance outreach program for drinking water suppliers and wastewater treatment processors. This program will include a self-assessment checklist, explanation of the Year 2000 computer problem, list of resources, and compliant products for the water utility sector. The Year 2000 compliance of products or equipment may need independent verification."
