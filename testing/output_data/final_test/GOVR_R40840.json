    "content": "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) conducts scientific research in marine and coastal ecosystems, climate, and weather. It was created in 1970 to unify environmental activities and has five line offices reflecting its diverse mission. The FY2010 NOAA budget request of $4.474 billion represented nearly 33% of the Department of Commerce's total request. It included funding for Operations, Research, and Facilities (ORF), Procurement, Acquisition, and Construction (PAC), and other accounts. ORF and PAC typically make up over 98% of NOAA's budget request. The FY2010 NOAA budget request of $4.474 billion included funding for Operations, Research, and Facilities (ORF), Procurement, Acquisition, and Construction (PAC), which provide over 98% of NOAA's budget. ORF funds NOAA line offices, while PAC funds other accounts like the Coastal Zone Management Fund and the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund. The Administration proposed $60 million for a species recovery grant program instead of funding the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund. NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco emphasized supporting NOAA's core mission in her FY2010 budget priorities, including satellite operations, fisheries management, climate change, coastal management, and weather forecasting. The Administration's NOS budget request for ORF and PAC totaled $487.1 million, a decrease of $56.1 million from the FY2009 level. ORF funding is cut by $34.3 million with decreases in various programs. NOS PAC construction funding would also decrease by $21.8 million. Highlights of requested NOS program funding increases included implementation of ocean research priorities plan, national vertical datum improvement, support for Coastal Zone Management Act, forecasts of harmful algal blooms, response and restoration, energy licensing, Gulf of Mexico alliance, and others. The Administration's NMFS total request was $890.6 million, with highlights including funding for Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation Act requirements, Pacific Salmon Treaty provisions, Endangered Species Act consultations, and other programs. The Administration requested $5.6 million for Endangered Species Act consultations, $47.4 million for conservation and recovery actions, $2.0 million for aquaculture development, and $2.7 million for climate research. The Oceanic and Atmospheric Research budget decreased to $404.6 million, with increases for drought information, ocean acidification monitoring, severe weather forecasts, climate predictions, and weather research. The Administration requested funding for various climate and weather-related projects, including $2.5 million for the national climate model portal, $2.0 million for weather research and forecasting, $1.3 million for the U.S. climate reference network, and $1.0 million for multi-function phased array radar. The National Weather Service received a net increase of $5.0 million, with highlights including funding for hurricane forecast system improvements, weather radar coverage in western Washington, and advancements in weather warning systems. The NOAA Administrator identified satellite operations as a major challenge, with most of the agency's funding increase supporting NESDIS satellite programs. NESDIS manages environmental satellites for weather forecasts, climate investigations, and search and rescue. The Administration requested $1,428.6 million for NESDIS programs, including $873.2 million for satellite procurement, an increase of $256.3 million from FY2009 funding. The FY2009 funding level increased by $256.3 million for spacecraft, instruments, launch services, and ground systems equipment for Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES). An increase of $94.2 million from FY2009 funding level was allocated for instrument and spacecraft development of the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS). Additionally, $20 million was designated for NOAA's portion of the Jason-3 satellite mission for sea surface height measurements. Other increases include $7.0 million for climate data records, $0.9 million for ice satellite imagery, and $2.0 million for NPOESS data exploration. Program Support funding decreased by $108.0 million from the FY2009 budget. In FY2009, the Program Support budget decreased due to completed projects and cuts in the NOAA education program. Key highlights of the requested funding included increases for Corporate Services, facilities management, NOAA Corps officers, and a fisheries survey vessel design. The House recommended a funding of $4.603 billion for NOAA, a 5.5% increase from FY2009 levels and a 2.9% increase over the Administration's request. Of this amount, $3.202 billion was allocated for Operations, Research, and Facilities. The House recommended $4.603 billion for NOAA, with $3.202 billion for ORF and $1.409 billion for PAC. The Senate proposed $4.773 billion, with $3.304 billion for ORF and $1.398 billion for PAC. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 provided $4.737 billion for NOAA, representing an 8.5% increase from FY2009 levels. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 (P.L. 111-117) increased funding for all five of NOAA's line offices, but decreased funding for PS. The greatest increases in the enacted bill were provided for NESDIS and NMFS. The FY2010 enacted funding level for NESDIS is $1.399 billion, an increase of $220.5 million (18.7%) over the FY2009 enacted level, supporting satellite engineering development and production activities for the next generation geostationary satellite (GOES-R) and contributing to developing sensors and spacecraft for the tri-agency polar-orbiting satellite system (NPOESS). The Administration requested $890.6 million for NMFS, a 17.5% increase over the FY2009 appropriation. The FY2010 enacted funding level for NMFS is $904.5 million, with increases for fisheries management and endangered species recovery. The Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund was not funded initially but later clarified to be included in the budget at $50 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended restoring funding for the PCSRF under Other Accounts at the FY2009 funding level of $80 million while reducing the Species Recovery Grant Program by $50 million from the President's request of $61 million. President Obama requested $568 million in R&D funding for NOAA for FY2010, a 7% decrease from the FY2009 appropriation level of $611 million. R&D funding would consist of approximately 93% research funding and 7% development funding, with 73% allocated to intramural programs and 27% to extramural programs. The FY2010 R&D funding request for NOAA included $305.9 million for OAR, $60.4 million for NOS, $27.6 million for NESDIS, $14.3 million for NWS, and $104.0 million for OMAO. NMFS saw an increase to $55.4 million. R&D funding was divided into ecosystems (32%), climate (31%), weather and water (14%), commerce and transportation (1%), and mission support (22%). NOAA highlighted upgrades to their prediction system as a key accomplishment. NOAA's key activities funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 included upgrading prediction systems, developing bycatch reduction devices, predicting harmful algal blooms, integrating radar data for weather forecasts, and implementing a soil moisture network. ARRA provided $830 million to NOAA for FY2009 and FY2010, with $500,000 allocated to R&D. The ORF account received $230.0 million for activities like reducing survey backlogs and restoring marine habitats. The PAC account received $600.0 million for constructing facilities, ships, and equipment, and improving weather forecasts. NOAA's activities funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 include constructing and maintaining facilities, ships, and equipment; improving weather forecasts; developing and deploying satellites; and enhancing climate models."
