    "content": "The \"Supersymmetric Artificial Neural Network\" in deep learning emphasizes incorporating biological constraints to enhance backward propagation. The Supersymmetric Artificial Neural Network explores SU(m|n) representation, encoding more information than typical deep learning models, with supercharge compatible special unitary notation. This enhances hypotheses generation in weight space for richer representations. The \"Supersymmetric Artificial Neural Network\" introduces a new way to represent richer values in the weights of the model, allowing for more information to be captured about the input space, such as potential-partner signals beyond typical neural networks. An optimal weight space for neural network architectures can be produced by deep and high-dimension-absorbing real valued artificial neural nets, with good weights lying in disentangleable manifolds per class/target group convolved by the operator * , instead of simpler regions per class/target group. This approach introduces supersymmetric directions that can encode more information than typical deep learning models. Supersymmetric values can encode more information than typical deep learning models, highlighting empirical evidence of how such models could exceed the state of the art. Optimal weight space in complex valued artificial neural nets may have good weights in multiple sectors per class, guaranteeing more variation in the weight space. An optimal weight space produced by deep or high dimension-absorbing complex valued artificial neural nets may have good weights that lie in chi distribution bound, rayleigh space per class/target group convolved by the operator, instead of simpler sectors/regions per class/target group. This guarantees more variation in the weight space by learning phase space representations and strengthening these representations via convolutional residual blocks. The \"Supersymmetric Artificial Neural Network\" operable on high dimensional data may generate good weights that lie in disentangleable supermanifolds. The progression of \"solution geometries\" in artificial neural networks ranges from ancient Perceptron models to complex valued neural nets, grassmann manifold networks, and unitaryRNNs. These models are parameterized by geometrical groups like orthogonal and special unitary groups, leading to a clear way to view the reasoning behind subsequent pseudocode sequences. The curr_chunk discusses the representation of input data by learning models using various groups such as orthogonal and special unitary groups. It also delves into the concept of \"solution geometry\" in algorithms and how biological brains can be measured in terms of supersymmetric operations. The representation of supersymmetric biological brain representations is highlighted, showing how they can encode more information than prior classes. The curr_chunk discusses the potential signals for partner selection in machine learning models, including supersymmetric solution geometries that may be observed in biological brains. It suggests the feasibility of a supersymmetric artificial neural network architecture and a C \u221e bound atlas-based learning model derived from supermanifolds. The model includes grassmann manifold networks and stiefel manifolds, enabling differentiable grassmann manifolds. The \"Edward Witten/String theory powered supersymmetric artificial neural network\" seeks supersymmetric weights in a manifold where (x,y) \u2260 0. Despite Deep Neural Network algorithms not being biologically plausible, they work in practice. Borrowing formal methods from physics, constructing a model that learns supersymmetric weights is feasible."
