Congress finds that certain species of salmon and steelhead in the Columbia and Snake River Basin are facing extinction due to various factors, including hydroelectric projects, habitat degradation, and unsound hatchery practices. These species hold significant economic, ecological, and cultural importance, with over $6 billion already spent on recovery efforts. Thirteen salmon and steelhead species in the region are listed for protections under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 highlights the economic importance of salmon and steelhead in the Pacific Northwest, particularly in the Snake River region. Restoring these populations to healthy levels is crucial for the communities in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California. This restoration effort will have significant economic benefits and is essential for setting public policy on salmon conservation in the Northwest. The original range of Snake River salmon included existing habitat in central Idaho, northeast Oregon, southeast Washington, the lower Columbia River, and coastal waters of Alaska, California, Oregon, and Washington. The United States Government has treaties with Indian tribes and Canada to restore salmon populations. Construction of Federal dams on the lower Snake River has led to a significant decline in salmon and steelhead populations. The Snake River's salmon and steelhead populations have greatly decreased, with many already extinct or endangered. Scientists warn that without changes, these species may become extinct in our lifetime. Removing the lower Snake River dams is seen as the best way to protect and recover these fish, although it would impact communities relying on the dams. The Federal court found that the lower Snake River dams violate water quality standards. Energy production in the Northwest depends heavily on hydropower, linking salmon recovery and hydropower management. The Act aims to protect and recover Columbia and Snake River salmon to self-sustaining levels while ensuring reliable energy and economically sustainable salmon recovery. It also aims to maximize economic benefits from potential dam removal while mitigating impacts. The Act aims to ensure efficient management of salmon recovery in the Columbia and Snake River Basin, implementing effective measures and responding rapidly to protect and recover salmon and steelhead. Scientific analysis of federal salmon recovery efforts is mandated by the Act to ensure efficient management in the Columbia and Snake River Basin. The Secretary of Commerce must arrange for scientific analysis of Federal salmon protection actions within 3 months of the Act's enactment. The analysis will focus on the effectiveness of current and anticipated recovery actions for Columbia and Snake River Basin salmon populations. The Secretary of Commerce must analyze the effectiveness of current and proposed recovery actions for Columbia and Snake River Basin salmon populations. This includes comparing the actions to a Federal salmon recovery strategy that may involve partial dam removal, with the goal of achieving self-sustaining, harvestable levels of wild salmon and steelhead populations. The analysis for Columbia and Snake River Basin salmon populations includes identifying limiting factors to recovery such as habitat degradation, harvest, hatcheries, and dams. It also examines the effects of global climate change on ocean and hydrological conditions in the rivers and their tributaries, and how these effects may impact Federal recovery actions. The National Academy of Sciences will submit a final report on the scientific analysis of factors affecting the recovery of salmon and steelhead populations to the Secretary of Commerce and Congress within 8 months of the Act's enactment. SEC. 4. STUDIES REGARDING REMOVAL OF LOWER SNAKE RIVER DAMS. The Comptroller General of the United States will review assessments on the effects and costs of removing the 4 lower Snake River dams, focusing on economic impacts and salmon populations for various communities. The analysis will assess the impacts of removing the lower Snake River dams on fishing, recreation, employment, and freight transportation. It will consider economic benefits and costs of alternative transportation methods and environmental impacts. The analysis will evaluate the environmental impact, means of mitigating harm, and development of alternatives for transporting cargo currently on the lower Snake River. It will also assess the effects of dam removal on irrigation and energy production, including identifying alternative renewable energy sources. The Comptroller General of the United States will review the engineering costs associated with dam removal as determined by the Army Corps of Engineers. Final reports on the studies required under this section must be submitted to Congress within 12 months of the enactment of this Act. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions include Federal salmon recovery actions for protecting salmon in the Columbia and Snake River basin, lower Snake River dams, and populations of salmon and steelhead in the region. Partial removal of the lower Snake River dams involves removing only the earthen portions while leaving the powerhouse and turbines in place."
