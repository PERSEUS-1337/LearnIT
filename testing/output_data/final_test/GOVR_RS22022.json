    "content": "DUA benefits are funded through the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) administered by FEMA on a no-year basis. When the DRF balance is low, additional funding is provided through appropriations. DOL administers the DUA program and coordinates with FEMA to provide funds to state UC agencies for DUA benefits and administrative costs. Individual eligibility requirements for DUA differ from UC program requirements. Individuals who have been unemployed for fewer than 26 weeks due to a disaster and exhaust their UC entitlement may be eligible for Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA). DUA benefits are available for up to 26 weeks and have different eligibility criteria compared to regular UC benefits, including coverage for self-employed individuals and those unable to work due to the disaster. Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) benefits are available for individuals affected by a major disaster who are unable to work, including those who have become the breadwinner due to a household member's death or have injuries from the disaster. Noncitizens must have a Social Security number and alien registration card to apply. Applications must be filed within 30 days of the state announcing DUA benefits, with possible extensions for good cause. Initial applications filed after 26 weeks from the disaster declaration date will not be considered. On November 13, 2001, DOL issued a new interpretive rule clarifying the definition of \"unemployment as a direct result of the major disaster\" in response to the September 11, 2001, disasters. The rule amended 20 C.F.R. \u00a7625.5 by adding a new paragraph (c) specifying that unemployment is considered a direct result of the major disaster if it is an immediate result of the disaster itself, not a longer chain of events. The DOL issued a new rule defining \"unemployment as a direct result of a major disaster\" in response to the September 11, 2001, disasters. The rule specifies that unemployment must be a direct result of the disaster itself, not a longer chain of events. The DUA benefits are calculated by state UC agencies based on state law, with a maximum weekly benefit amount determined by the state law. Workers will receive at least half of the average UC benefit for the state and cannot receive more than the maximum UC benefit. DUA beneficiaries are not eligible for Extended Benefits (EB) and their benefits are determined similarly to regular state UC rules. Self-employed individuals must provide tax records for earnings verification. Injured workers receive DUA benefits equivalent to UC benefits if they were available to work. DUA benefits are available to workers who do not qualify for UC benefits, providing half of the average UC benefit. Eligible individuals can also receive reemployment services during a major disaster, with assistance lasting up to 26 weeks after the disaster declaration. The duration of DUA benefits has been extended in the past for specific disasters. The duration of Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) benefits was extended from 26 to 39 weeks for victims of specific major disasters, such as the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) benefits were extended to 52 weeks for individuals in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands affected by Hurricane Irma or Hurricane Maria. Retroactive payments will cover the remaining weeks beyond 52 weeks. Those who exhausted regular unemployment benefits may also qualify for DUA for the remaining uncompensated weeks. DUA benefits may be reduced by other income received. The Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) benefits can be reduced by other income sources such as benefits, insurance, worker's compensation, retirement income, earnings, and subsidies. DUA funds are requested by the state's UC agency from the Department of Labor (DOL) after a major disaster declaration by the President, with funds coming from the Disaster Relief Fund managed by FEMA. The DOL administers DUA funds requested by the state from FEMA. Table 1 shows benefit payments from FY2002 to April 2018. Figure 1 illustrates the number of individuals applying for and receiving DUA benefits from January 2001 to April 2018, with a seasonal trend during the hurricane season. The September 11, 2001, attacks led to continued benefit applications and payments until March 2002. The extension of DUA benefits for an additional 13 weeks in March 2002 allowed workers to file for benefits after exhausting UC benefits. Disaster victims must check if the event is declared a major disaster to determine DUA availability. FEMA maintains a list of disasters by year on their website. Individuals can access disaster assistance information and determine eligibility for individual disaster assistance and DUA benefits by visiting http://disasterassistance.gov. If counties are designated to receive DUA after a major disaster declaration, contact the state's unemployment agency for application details. The DOL website provides links to each state's unemployment agency for assistance with DUA benefits at https://www.careeronestop.org/localhelp/unemploymentbenefits/unemployment-benefits.aspx."
