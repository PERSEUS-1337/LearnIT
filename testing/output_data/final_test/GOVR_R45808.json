    "content": "The Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (ATSSA) was enacted into law on September 22, 2001, in response to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. It provided relief to the American airline industry and established the Victim Compensation Fund (VCF) to compensate those affected by the attacks. The VCF was reopened in 2011 to include responders and others affected by health issues related to the attacks. If not reauthorized, the VCF will sunset on December 18, 2020. The VCF, created by the ATSSA, provided cash benefits to those affected by the 9/11 attacks based on economic and noneconomic losses. Benefits were determined by a Special Master and did not include punitive damages. Collateral source payments were deducted from benefits. The VCF, established by the ATSSA, provided compensation for 9/11 attack victims, deducting collateral source payments from benefits. Filing a VCF claim waived the right to sue for damages in federal or state court, offering an expedited route for compensation while protecting against lawsuits. Funding was provided by Congress for benefit payments and administration. The VCF was established to provide compensation for 9/11 attack victims, with funding provided by Congress. The original VCF closed in 2003 after awarding $7.049 billion to 5,560 claimants. It was reopened in 2010 to extend eligibility for cash benefits to those who suffered injuries or illnesses from rescue, recovery, or debris removal work at the September 11th crash sites. The Victim Compensation Fund (VCF) was reopened in 2010 to provide compensation for 9/11 attack victims who suffered injuries or illnesses from rescue, recovery, or debris removal work. The reopened VCF had a cap of $2.775 billion for total benefits and administrative costs, with attorneys' fees limited to 10% of the award. It was scheduled to stop taking claims on October 3, 2016, but was reauthorized on December 18, 2015. The Zadroga Reauthorization Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-113) reauthorized the Victim Compensation Fund (VCF) with Group A and Group B claims. Group A claims are subject to the $2.775 billion cap and same rules as the reopened VCF. Group B claims have additional rules and funding caps. To be eligible for VCF benefits, a person must have died as a result of the 9/11 attacks or been present at a crash site in the aftermath. The VCF eligibility criteria include being present at a September 11th crash site in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks from September 11, 2001, to May 30, 2002. Crash sites include the World Trade Center, Pentagon, Shanksville, PA, and related areas in Manhattan and Staten Island. The VCF eligibility criteria require individuals to have suffered physical harm as a result of the September 11th terrorist attacks, demonstrated by a WTC-related physical health condition covered by the WTCHP. To be covered by the WTCHP and compensable under the VCF, a condition must be on the list of covered WTCHP conditions and exposure after 9/11 must be a significant factor. Certification by the WTCHP is usually required for compensation, with evaluation based on time spent at a site and specific activities engaged in. The WTCHP evaluates conditions based on time spent at a site and specific activities engaged in. Mental health conditions covered by WTCHP cannot establish VCF eligibility. VCF does not provide benefits for mental health conditions. The WTCHP statute does not cover cancer as a WTC-related health condition but periodically reviews scientific evidence for potential inclusion. The administrator must act on requests to add conditions within specific timeframes. In 2011, a group of representatives and senators requested a review of new medical evidence showing increased cancer rates among firefighters who served at ground zero. In 2012, based on recommendations, the WTCHP administrator added over 60 types of cancer to the coverage under the Zadroga Act. The WTCHP administrator added over 60 types of cancer to the list of WTC-related health conditions, making them compensable under the VCF. The Government Accountability Office found that a hazards-based approach was used to evaluate these cancers, which was deemed reasonable given data constraints. The WTCHP administrator added prostate cancer to the list of WTC-related health conditions, along with establishing minimum latency periods for certain types of cancer and maximum onset periods for aerodigestive disorders. The VCF, administered by the Civil Division of the Department of Justice, determines eligibility with Rupa Bhattacharyya as the current Special Master. The VCF, overseen by Special Master Rupa Bhattacharyya, decides on eligibility and benefits. Claimants can appeal decisions and request a hearing before a VCF hearing officer. There is no further right of appeal or judicial review. Claims must be filed by December 18, 2020, with registration deadlines based on knowledge of eligibility for VCF benefits. The VCF determines eligibility and benefits for individuals affected by the September 11th attacks. Claimants must file by December 18, 2020, and meet specific criteria to receive benefits. There is a cap of $2.775 billion for total benefits, with no individual benefit caps. The VCF benefits for Group B claims are subject to caps on noneconomic losses and total benefits. For noneconomic losses, there is a cap of $250,000 for claims based on cancer and $90,000 for all other claims. The Special Master determines benefits based on economic and noneconomic losses, with a total cap of $4.6 billion for VCF Group B awards. The VCF Group B awards have a total cap of $4.6 billion. Benefits are reduced by collateral source payments like life insurance, workers' compensation, and government benefits. Costs for Group B benefits and administration are financed by a one-time appropriation of $4.6 billion. Total funding available for the VCF since its reopening is $7.375 billion. Funding was made exempt from budget sequestration by the Zadroga Reauthorization Act of 2015. The VCF benefits and administrative costs are capped at $7.375 billion by the Zadroga Act. The Special Master reassesses VCF policies annually to prioritize claims for the most debilitating conditions and ensure that total expenditures for Group B claims do not exceed $4.6 billion. Public comments were sought in 2018 for possible policy changes to ensure future funding for VCF claims. The Special Master received 28 comments in response to the Notice of Inquiry regarding future VCF funding. Two projections of future VCF costs were made based on historical data and recent trends, showing costs exceeding the $7.375 billion cap. The Special Master projects that total VCF program costs will surpass the $7.375 billion funding, citing increases in death claims, cancer claims, and claims from non-responders. As of May 31, 2019, 1,057 death claims are eligible for the reopened VCF, with award decisions made in 856 cases. Since the VCF's reauthorization in 2015, there has been a significant increase in eligible and awarded death cases, with a nearly 5,000% increase in death awards. From April 2018 to May 2019, 517 death awards were granted, with an average of more than 35 new eligibility decisions and 48 new awards in death claims per month. Since the VCF's reauthorization in 2015, there has been a significant increase in eligible and awarded death cases, with a nearly 5,000% increase in death awards. Cancers were first added to the VCF as compensable conditions in September 2012, leading to a growth in cancer claims shortly after and in recent years. Eligible claims with at least one type of cancer made up 37% of all eligible VCF claims as of April 2019. Since the VCF's reauthorization in 2015, there has been a significant increase in eligible and awarded death cases, with a nearly 5,000% increase in death awards. Cancers were first added to the VCF as compensable conditions in September 2012, leading to a growth in cancer claims shortly after. Between September 30, 2014, and December 31, 2015, eligible claims with cancer as the only compensable condition increased 194% from 472 claims to 1,387 claims. The recent increase in eligible cancer-only claims has driven projected program costs over the funding cap in the 2019 assessment. Eligible cancer-only claims made up 18% of all eligible claims at the end of 2018. The increase in eligible cancer claims is significant as cancers were added to the list of covered conditions by the WTCHP administrator in 2012 and 2013, resulting in over 60 types of cancer being compensable under the VCF. There are no specific provisions for continuous review of scientific evidence to support or refute including these types of cancers in the list of WTC-related health conditions compensable under the VCF. The GAO cited limitations on data available in 2012. The GAO found the WTCHP administrator's use of a hazards-based model for adding cancers to the list of covered conditions reasonable. With the increase in cancer cases since 2012 and 2013, there is a need to reevaluate the list of covered cancers and assess the likelihood of developing cancer after different types of exposures post-9/11. The VCF covers a wide range of individuals affected by the attacks. The VCF covers individuals affected by the 9/11 attacks, including those in lower Manhattan with varying exposure to toxic substances. The program provides presumptive eligibility for covered conditions, such as all cancers except childhood cancer, without considering individual exposure experiences or other factors like genetics or age. The Special Master does not determine the probability of a person's exposure causing their cancer. The WTCHP does not require a direct link between exposure after 9/11 and cancer, only that exposure is likely to have contributed to the illness. Unlike other programs, the WTCHP does not consider the probability of a cancer being caused by exposure. The VCF's presumptive eligibility model for cancer claims contrasts with the probability of causation model recommended by the National Research Council Board on Radiation Effects Research. Cancer claims have the potential for higher benefits compared to non-cancer claims, with a cap of $250,000 for noneconomic loss awards. The VCF has paid increasing awards to non-responders since its reauthorization in 2015. The VCF has seen a rise in awards to non-responders since its reauthorization in 2015, with non-responder claims making up 19% of total initial compensation awards by the end of 2018. The increase in non-responder claims has contributed to the rise in VCF benefit costs, leading to concerns about program funding. The data reported by the VCF makes analyzing this cost driver difficult. The Special Master noted a significant increase in claims filed by non-responders since the VCF's reauthorization in 2015. This has led to concerns about program funding as award costs are projected to exceed available funding. The data reported by the VCF on claimant categories, including cases listed as \"no response,\" further complicates the analysis of cost drivers. In February 2019, the Special Master announced reductions in future VCF awards for cases pending as of February 25, 2019. Awards for cases filed on or before February 1, 2019, will be reduced by 50%, cases with expedited processing will be reduced by 50%, and cases filed after February 1, 2019, will be reduced by 70%. Offsets for collateral source payments will still apply. Award reductions do not apply to appeals decisions issued before February 25, 2019, but scheduling adjustments will be made for future appeals. The Victim Compensation Fund (VCF) will schedule appeals hearings only for severe cases like cancer, lung disease, and sarcoidosis. For other cases, hearings will be scheduled after December 18, 2020, to ensure funding for increased noneconomic loss determinations. The VCF is set to expire on December 18, 2020, and reauthorization legislation is pending in Congress. The reauthorization legislation for the Victim Compensation Fund (VCF) includes authorization through FY2090, removal of funding cap, appropriations as necessary, payment adjustments for reduced awards, authority for Special Master to exceed limits on noneconomic loss, and cost of living adjustments every five years. No changes to basic eligibility for VCF awards are proposed. The reauthorization legislation for the Victim Compensation Fund (VCF) includes full funding without annual appropriations, estimated direct spending of $6.785 billion between FY2019 and FY2024, and $10.180 billion between FY2019 and FY2029. H.R. 1327 was passed by the House of Representatives on July 12, 2019 with amendments renaming it the \"Never Forget the Heroes: James Zadroga, Ray Pfeifer, and Luis Alvarez Permanent Authorization of the VCF.\" The reauthorization legislation for the Victim Compensation Fund (VCF) includes full funding without annual appropriations, with changes such as extending the deadline for filing claims to October 1, 2090, and allowing the Special Master to exceed the limit on noneconomic loss under special circumstances. Additionally, the requirement for cost-of-living adjustments to the maximum annual income considered for economic loss was changed to periodic adjustments. The reauthorization legislation for the Victim Compensation Fund includes full funding without annual appropriations, extending the deadline for filing claims to October 1, 2090, allowing the Special Master to exceed the limit on noneconomic loss under special circumstances, and making adjustments for inflation periodically. Additionally, the Attorney General can appoint up to two Deputy Special Masters, and the legislation's budgetary effects are exempt from PAYGO requirements."
