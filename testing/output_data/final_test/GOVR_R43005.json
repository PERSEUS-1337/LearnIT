    "content": "The Supreme Court focused on Fifth Amendment Takings Clause jurisprudence from the late 1970s to 2005, with a prolific output of decisions. After a hiatus, the Court resumed addressing takings cases in 2010, showing an increased interest in property rights-related issues. The Supreme Court has shown renewed interest in property rights, ruling in favor of property owners in recent cases. In 2010, the Court addressed a taking case in Stop the Beach Renourishment, Inc. v. Florida Dep't of Environmental Protection. In the 2011-2012 term, the Court decided cases like PPL Montana LLC v. Montana, clarifying the test for \"title navigability\" in rivers. The Supreme Court has made property rights a focal point in recent cases. In the 2012-2013 term, the Court made significant decisions regarding property rights, including Sackett v. EPA, which allows property owners to challenge EPA orders before enforcement, and Arkansas Game & Fish Comm'n v. United States, which changed the rule on government-induced flooding of private property. In recent cases, the Supreme Court has focused on property rights. The Court ruled that temporary flooding can lead to takings liability, and property owners can raise takings defense in federal district court. The decision in Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Management District clarified when exaction conditions on land development approvals constitute takings. The Supreme Court has addressed property rights issues, ruling that temporary flooding can result in takings liability. The decision in Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Management District clarified when exaction conditions on land development approvals constitute takings, even if a permit is denied due to the landowner's refusal to comply with conditions. This report discusses various cases involving property owners and their claims, with a focus on the Stop the Beach Renourishment, Inc. case involving beachfront property owners in Florida objecting to a state beach renourishment project. The property owners in Florida objected to a state beach renourishment project, claiming a Fifth Amendment taking of their common law rights as littoral property owners. The state statute froze the property line at the mean high water mark, negating the right of accretion and infringing on the owners' right to have their land in direct contact with the water. The Florida Supreme Court found that the beach renourishment project did not constitute a taking of the property owners' littoral rights. The right to receive accretions and the right to have land in direct contact with the water were not considered sufficient grounds for a taking. The U.S. Supreme Court was presented with a new argument after the state high court ruling. The plaintiff argued in the U.S. Supreme Court that the state supreme court had caused a \"judicial taking\" by changing Florida common law to prioritize a renourishment project over property rights. Justices split 4-4 on whether courts can bring about takings, with Justice Scalia stating that courts can take property by changing established rights. The Florida Supreme Court's decision was affirmed as it was based on precedent. The concept of judicial takings was first mentioned in a 1967 opinion by Justice Stewart and later in a 1994 dissent. The idea of judicial takings presents challenges as the common law evolves in the courts, potentially narrowing property rights. The question of whether a court articulating a new common law principle is clarifying existing law is also complex. The State of Montana argued that 10 hydroelectric dams owned by PPL Montana, LLC sit on riverbeds owned by the state, invoking the constitutional \"equal footing doctrine.\" The possibility of a judicial taking in the future remains, should a court announce an abrupt change in a common law principle affecting property rights. The State of Montana claimed ownership of riverbeds under PPL's dams based on the \"equal footing doctrine.\" Montana sought rent from PPL, leading to a legal battle. The Montana trial court and Supreme Court ruled in favor of the state, ordering PPL to pay $41 million. However, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously reversed the decision, stating that the state court erred in finding the riverbeds navigable. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned the state court's ruling on riverbed ownership, stating that the state court erred in determining navigability based on short interruptions and present-day recreational use as evidence of commercial navigability. The U.S. Supreme Court corrected the Montana high court's view on the title navigability test, leading to potential reduction in state demands for streambed rent from hydroelectric power suppliers. The federal government also has an interest in the case due to licensing of hydroelectric dams under the Federal Power Act. The United States has claimed ownership of riverbeds by issuing permits. Michael and Chantelle Sackett faced an EPA compliance order for filling a wetland without a permit, leading to potential civil penalties. The Sacketts faced a dilemma when the EPA denied their request for a hearing to challenge a compliance order, leading them to either comply at a high cost or risk large civil penalties by waiting to challenge the order in court. The district court agreed with the EPA that the Clean Water Act does not allow for judicial review of compliance orders before enforcement actions are taken, resulting in the case being dismissed. The EPA denied the Sacketts' request for a hearing to challenge a compliance order, leading to a court case that was initially dismissed. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the dismissal, stating that the Clean Water Act prohibits pre-enforcement review of Administrative Compliance Orders (ACOs). However, the Supreme Court reversed this decision, ruling in favor of the Sacketts and allowing pre-enforcement review of CWA ACOs in district courts under the Administrative Procedure Act. This decision did not directly address property rights but had a significant impact on EPA jurisdictional determinations. The Sacketts can now seek judicial review of EPA's jurisdictional determination without waiting for enforcement, potentially reducing opportunities for negotiation and leading to increased civil enforcement actions. EPA may use noncompliance letters more frequently in response to the Sackett decision. EPA has embraced a third option in response to the Sackett decision, which includes adding language to compliance orders informing recipients of their right to seek pre-enforcement review. This approach may lead to increased civil enforcement actions. The EPA instructed regional staff to add language to various agency orders, informing recipients of their right to judicial review. This directive applies to orders under different environmental acts, indicating a presumption in favor of inserting the review clause. Staff are advised to analyze each order individually. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) is not affected by Sackett and does not allow pre-enforcement judicial review of agency orders. Corps of Engineers formal jurisdictional determinations, separate from permit applications, may also not be subject to judicial review. The Commission owns a wildlife management area downstream from a Corps of Engineers flood control dam. The Corps of Engineers adopted interim deviations from its water release plan for a flood control dam downstream from a wildlife management area. This led to longer flooding periods during the growing season, causing the death of numerous hardwood trees and a loss of timber. The Commission sued, claiming the deviations took a temporary flowage easement for six years. The court agreed, citing government-caused flooding as \"inevitably recurring.\" The Federal Circuit reversed the court's decision on government-caused flooding, stating that intermittent flooding not inevitably recurring is a non-taking. However, the Supreme Court unanimously reversed this ruling on December 4, 2012, stating that takings can occur even if the flooding is not continually or inevitably recurring. The Supreme Court's 1924 decision on flooding was considered dictum and came before the establishment of temporary physical invasions as takings. The ruling that flooding was exempt from takings liability when temporary was inconsistent with modern takings jurisprudence. Temporary flooding is now assessed under a multifactor balancing test for possible takings. The Supreme Court sent a case back to the Federal Circuit to address factors relevant to determining a temporary government-caused flood as a taking. The Flood Control Act of 1928 and the discretionary function exemption in the Federal Tort Claims Act shield the federal Treasury from liability for flooding. The rule that temporary flooding cannot be a taking has been challenged in modern takings jurisprudence. The Arkansas Game & Fish Comm'n has overturned the rule that temporary flooding cannot be considered a taking, potentially exposing federal dams and water facilities to new liability. The extent of this liability remains uncertain, as it will depend on how lower courts interpret the ruling and whether single floods are exempt from takings claims. The Arkansas Game & Fish Comm'n has overturned the old automatic non-taking rule regarding temporary flooding, leading to uncertainty in how lower courts will interpret takings factors. Justice Ginsburg suggested that very few temporary government-induced floods may result in payments from the Treasury. The multifactor analysis under the Penn Central test may play a crucial role in determining liability for temporary flooding claims. The Penn Central test is typically used for regulatory interferences with property, especially physical invasions like floods. The United States has defenses in flooding-taking cases, such as arguing for noncompensable damages or that the flooding would have occurred regardless of the dam. The decision in Arkansas Game & Fish Comm'n could impact water-project agencies' costs in accommodating special circumstances. The raisin marketing order under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 aims to help farmers maintain price parity and control prices by establishing annual reserve pools. Handlers like Marvin and Laura Horne are subject to this order, which requires them to contribute surplus raisins to the reserve pool without payment. This could increase costs for water-project agencies dealing with extreme weather events linked to climate change. The Hornes reorganized their operations in 2000 to avoid placing raisins into the reserve pool as required by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act. The Department of Agriculture disagreed, assessing them $484,000 for not setting aside the prescribed percentage of reserve raisins. The Hornes challenged the penalty order in federal court, arguing that transferring title to reserve raisins was a physical taking. The Ninth Circuit ruled that the district court lacked jurisdiction, as takings claims against the US fall under the Tucker Act. The Supreme Court later unanimously reversed this decision on June 10, 2013. The Supreme Court unanimously reversed the Ninth Circuit's decision on June 10, 2013. The overall ruling stated that the Hornes' takings claim was properly before the district court due to the comprehensive remedial scheme of the AMAA. The case was remanded to the Ninth Circuit for further adjudication. The Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit's decision on the Hornes' takings claim under the AMAA. The case was remanded for further adjudication, with potential implications beyond the statute. The taking claim evolved from raisins to civil penalties, raising uncertainties in its legal basis. The Horne decision's lasting legacy may be seen in the use of a takings defense to enforcement, allowing property owners to refuse government commands they view as takings and assert a defense in subsequent actions. This defense is limited to cases where the Tucker Act compensation remedy is withdrawn. The Horne decision allows property owners to use a takings defense to enforcement actions when they believe a government action constitutes a taking. This defense is only applicable when Congress withdraws the Tucker Act compensation remedy, emphasizing that compensation is the primary remedy under the Takings Clause. Additionally, the decision may lower the threshold for inferring Congress's intent to withdraw the Tucker Act remedy in future cases. The Horne decision potentially relaxes the standard for withdrawing the Tucker Act remedy, leading to more federal takings law being made in district courts. The case involves Coy Koontz's proposal to develop wetlands on his Florida property. The issue in the case involves the \"exaction conditions\" imposed by the water management district on Coy Koontz's Florida property for granting necessary permits. The District asked Koontz to deed his land into a conservation area and perform offsite wetlands mitigation, which he viewed as excessive. The District denied permits for Koontz's development proposal due to environmental impacts. Koontz sued, claiming excessive exaction conditions. Exaction conditions are used to offset development impacts, such as land dedication or monetary exactions. The District requested Koontz to offset wetlands loss by paying for off-site mitigation. The Supreme Court has a two-part test for when exaction conditions on land development approvals violate the Takings Clause. The test requires that the exaction condition must further the same purpose as the permit and impose a burden on the landowner no greater than \"roughly proportional\" to the proposed development's impact on the community. This Nollan/Dolan test is considered more favorable to takings plaintiffs than the multifactor balancing test for regulatory takings. The Florida Supreme Court reversed lower court decisions regarding exaction conditions imposed by the District, denying the property owner's attempt to expand Nollan/Dolan. They ruled that no Nollan/Dolan taking occurred when the property owner refused the conditions and the permit was denied. The court also declined to broaden Nollan/Dolan beyond cases involving land-dedication exactions, stating that requiring the property owner to spend money did not qualify. On June 25, 2013, the Supreme Court reversed the Florida Supreme Court's decision, ruling 5-4 for Mr. Koontz. The Court concluded that Nollan/Dolan covers permit denials based on landowner refusal to accept offered conditions, violating the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions. Permit denials based on refused conditions do not escape Nollan/Dolan review, making this portion of the Koontz decision unanimous. The Supreme Court's ruling in the Koontz case unanimously concluded that Nollan/Dolan applies to permit denials based on landowner refusal of offered conditions. The Court acknowledged the issue of remedy since no exaction was transferred, stating that compensation is only required when there is a taking. The decision left the determination of remedy to the Florida courts if a taking is found, as Mr. Koontz brought his claim under state law. The Court also equated monetary exactions with land-dedication exaction conditions under Nollan/Dolan to prevent land-use agencies from bypassing the requirements. The Supreme Court's ruling in the Koontz case unanimously concluded that Nollan/Dolan applies to permit denials based on landowner refusal of offered conditions. The Court also rejected the argument that putting monetary exactions under Nollan/Dolan leaves no principled way to distinguish impermissible land-use exactions from property taxes and user fees. The majority concluded that Nollan/Dolan coverage of monetary exactions will not deprive local government of the ability to charge reasonable permitting fees. Numerous lower courts have previously applied Nollan/Dolan to monetary exactions. The Supreme Court's ruling in the Koontz case extended Nollan/Dolan to permit denials based on landowner refusal of offered conditions. Property rights advocates see the decision as reining in government's use of exaction conditions, while government-side spokespersons view it as unnecessary federal intervention in local fee conditions for land-use development. The Supreme Court's ruling in the Koontz case extends Nollan/Dolan to permit denials based on landowner refusal of offered conditions. The majority opinion shows ambivalence towards exaction conditions on development approvals, acknowledging the government's need to offset public costs but also expressing suspicion towards land-use regulators using terms like \"extortion\" to describe exactions lacking nexus and proportionality. The majority opinion in the Koontz case discusses the District's belief in circumventing Nollan/Dolan and the government's power in land-use permitting. It will prompt local governments to consider conforming to Nollan/Dolan or avoiding its application through various strategies. The Koontz case prompts local governments to consider conforming to Nollan/Dolan or avoiding its application through various strategies, such as proffers based on government goals, better explanations by the government during negotiations, and more use of development agreements. These options will likely be examined by the courts to ensure Nollan/Dolan is not undermined by technical distinctions and procedural ruses. The Nollan/Dolan scrutiny is not triggered by legislatively imposed exactions, only by adjudicatively imposed ones. The question of what constitutes \"rough proportionality\" under Dolan remains unanswered. How should governments consider societal values like protection of endangered species or climate change mitigation in demonstrating \"rough proportionality\"? Can a landowner claim a Nollan/Dolan violation for the profit difference between their ideal development plan and the one they are allowed to build? Koontz leaves open the remedy question for property owners showing a violation of Nollan/Dolan. The importance of Koontz lies largely at the local government level, but could also impact federal programs with similar mitigation conditions. Examples include off-site mitigation conditions and in-lieu fee requirements for wetlands fill permits under Clean Water Act. The Takings Clause can constrain government action even without a taking, as seen in Horne and Koontz. This includes conditions attached to wetlands fill permits, mitigation requirements in habitat conservation plans, and Clean Air Act preconditions for emission-source construction permits. Both Horne and Koontz recognize the impact of Nollan/Dolan on government actions. The Supreme Court's decisions in Horne and Koontz raise questions about government-compelled payments of money implicating the Takings Clause. Speculation surrounds why the Court takes certain cases, with the process of deciding which cases to hear being opaque. Few cases involve a split in circuit courts, which traditionally increases the likelihood of the Court taking a case. The period of no property-rights-related decisions coincided with Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice's tenure. The period of no property-rights-related decisions began in 2005 with the departure of Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice O'Connor, who were known for their interest in property rights. Speculation exists about why their replacements, Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito, have not championed the issue. However, the Court has shown a trend of ruling in favor of property owners in cases where their rights are unfairly burdened. The Supreme Court has ruled unanimously in favor of property owners in four cases, with one decision going against the property owner. Specific clues indicate the Court's intentions in three of the six cases, with a focus on resolving splits in lower-court decisions. The decision with the potential to significantly impact how government interacts with property owners is Koontz, which could broaden the Court's test for when exactions imposed on development approvals constitute takings. The Supreme Court has ruled unanimously in favor of property owners in four cases, with one decision going against the property owner. Koontz could broaden the Court's test for when exactions imposed on development approvals constitute takings, potentially impacting how government interacts with property owners. The significance of these decisions will likely be easier to evaluate in the future with lower-court interpretation."
