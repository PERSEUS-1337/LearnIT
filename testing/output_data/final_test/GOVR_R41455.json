    "content": "The U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to define and punish piracy and felonies on the high seas. Congress has enacted legislation addressing piracy for over 200 years, including the 1790 act for the punishment of crimes against the United States related to piracy. In 1790, the punishment for piracy included death for offenders who hindered their commander in defending the ship or committed revolt. The U.S. Supreme Court in 1818 examined the offense of piracy under this Act, questioning what actions constituted piracy. The U.S. Supreme Court in 1818 clarified that robbery committed on the high seas constitutes piracy and is punishable by death, based on statutory interpretation. The Court also addressed whether robbery by a non-U.S. citizen on the high seas is considered piracy. The U.S. Supreme Court clarified in 1818 that robbery on the high seas is considered piracy and punishable by death. The Court discussed the legality of robbery by a non-U.S. citizen on a foreign vessel, stating that laws punishing pirates, even if foreigners, must be enacted by Congress. The Court emphasized that foreign offenses should not be construed as unlawful under U.S. law. The U.S. Supreme Court clarified in 1818 that robbery on the high seas is considered piracy and punishable by death. However, the crime of robbery by a non-U.S. citizen committed on the high seas on board a vessel owned by subjects of a foreign state was not considered piracy under the Act of 1790, and as such, was not punishable in the courts of the United States. In 1819, Congress passed an act to protect U.S. commerce and punish piracy, expanding the definition of piracy to include robbery on the high seas. The Act of 1819 expanded the definition of piracy to include crimes committed on the high seas as defined by the law of nations. Offenders brought into or found in the United States could be punished with death, regardless of their citizenship. The Act of 1819 expanded the definition of piracy in the United States to include crimes on the high seas, punishable by death. The Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of the statute in United States v. Smith, where the question was whether \"plunder and robbery\" constituted piracy under the Act of 1819. The Act of 1819 expanded the definition of piracy in the United States to include crimes on the high seas, punishable by death. The Supreme Court held that piracy is an offense against the law of nations, defined as robbery upon the sea, and not dependent on any specific municipal code for its definition and punishment. The Supreme Court ruled that Congress had the authority to define and punish piracy under international law. The punishment for piracy on the high seas was changed to life imprisonment in 1909, as stated in Title 18, Section 1651 of the United States Code. The United States Code, Title 18, Section 1651, defines piracy as a crime punishable by life imprisonment. International efforts to regulate piracy include the Convention on the High Seas, the SUA Convention, and UNCLOS, although the US is not a signatory to UNCLOS. UNCLOS addresses various aspects of the sea, such as territorial seas and natural resources. The United States is not a signatory to UNCLOS but is viewed as a codification of customary international law. Both the Convention on the High Seas and UNCLOS address piracy and state that all states should cooperate in repressing piracy on the high seas or in any place outside a state's jurisdiction. UNCLOS defines piracy as illegal acts of violence, detention, or depredation committed for private ends by the crew or passengers of a private ship or aircraft. Article 110 of UNCLOS and the Convention on the High Seas authorize warships to visit and inspect ships suspected of piracy. States can seize pirate ships and arrest pirates, with penalties decided by the seizing state's courts. The SUA Convention further addresses acts of piracy and their facilitation. The SUA Convention expands on the judicial treatment of pirates, ensuring appropriate action is taken against those committing unlawful acts against ships. These acts include ship seizure, violence against persons on board, and placing destructive devices. Parties to the agreement must punish these offenses with penalties reflecting their seriousness. The United States criminalizes piracy, with offenders facing imprisonment for life. The international community combats piracy off the Horn of Africa with naval patrols, diplomatic coordination, and increased private security measures. The international community combats piracy off the Horn of Africa with multinational naval patrols, diplomatic coordination efforts, and enhanced private security measures. Legal jurisdiction, due process for detained pirate suspects, and the role of foreign military forces in anti-piracy law enforcement activities may complicate current operations. Multiple governments may assert legal jurisdiction based on the specifics of the incident, but many lack the laws and judicial capacity to prosecute suspected pirates effectively. The legal challenges in prosecuting suspected pirates include issues with property disposition, insurance claims, and the prosecution of juvenile pirates. Bilateral agreements have been established by various countries to address these challenges, particularly with governments in the Horn of Africa region. Some agreements with Kenya define procedures for the detention and prosecution of captured pirate suspects. Suspected pirates captured by U.S. military forces may be transferred to Kenyan custody for prosecution. The U.S. military has sometimes released suspected pirates after confiscating their weapons. The United States Navy has transferred suspected pirates to Norfolk, VA, for criminal trials on charges of piracy. One trial ended with the defendants found guilty, while another case is on appeal. In United States v. Said, the government is prosecuting individuals for piracy in the Horn of Africa region. The case involves an attack on the USS Ashland, where defendants shot at the ship and were taken into custody after their skiff was destroyed. The defendants in United States v. Said were charged with piracy for attacking the USS Ashland. The government argued that any unauthorized armed assault on the high seas constitutes piracy, while the defendants claimed they did not take control of the vessel. The court found that the statutory language on piracy was unclear. The court in United States v. Said found that the definition of piracy under the law of nations was \"robbery or forcible depredations on the high seas.\" Despite examining international sources, the court concluded that the only clear precedent on the issue was the case of Smith. Ultimately, the defendants' motion to dismiss the piracy charge was granted. The court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the charge of piracy, but other offenses including the use of firearms during a crime, assault with a dangerous weapon on federal officers, and acts of violence against persons on a vessel remain valid. In United States v. Hasan, five Somalis were successfully prosecuted for piracy and other offenses for attacking the USS Nicholas with a rocket-propelled grenade and assault rifles on the high seas. In United States v. Hasan, defendants argued that the charge of piracy should be dismissed due to lack of actual property taking. The court considered the definition of piracy under the law of nations and denied the motion to dismiss, citing guidance from previous cases. In United States v. Hasan, the court defined piracy under the law of nations and cited foreign case law to support its decision. The court referenced a case before the Privy Council of England in 1934, which concluded that an actual robbery is not essential for piracy. Additionally, a 2009 case in Kenya convicted individuals of piracy without requiring a successful robbery, emphasizing that acts of violence and detention also constitute piracy. The court in Kenya affirmed the interpretation of piracy under international law, including provisions from the LOS Convention. It emphasized that even without ratification, international norms must be applied. The court also compared the definitions of piracy in the Convention on the High Seas and UNCLOS. The court in Kenya affirmed that UNCLOS defines piracy in the same terms as the 1958 High Seas Convention. It concluded that the definition of piracy in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651 must be assessed according to the international consensus definition at the time of the alleged offense. The court adopted the definition of piracy in Article 101 of UNCLOS and denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the charge of piracy. The trial proceeded, and the defendants were found guilty on 14 counts each of piracy. The trial proceeded despite a motion to dismiss, and the defendants were found guilty on 14 counts each of piracy, attack to plunder a vessel, assault, and related charges. Recent federal court rulings have created uncertainty around the definition of piracy under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651, with conflicting outcomes in similar cases. The decision in the Hasan case is considered stronger due to international treaties addressing piracy. The definition of piracy as robbery at sea may limit the government's ability to charge individuals under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651, as shown in the Said case. Various other offenses in Title 18 may be applicable to acts of violence at sea. The definition of piracy under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651 is uncertain due to conflicting court rulings. Other offenses in Title 18, such as Attack to Plunder a Vessel and Acts of Violence Against Persons on a Vessel, may be more viable options. Congress may need to clarify the definition of piracy to provide guidance to the courts. The definition of piracy under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651 is uncertain, leading to differing court interpretations."
