    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Holocaust Insurance Accountability Act of 2011\". Congress finds that the Holocaust was one of the most heinous crimes in human history, resulting in the murder of 6,000,000 Jews and millions of others. Many Holocaust survivors and heirs were denied insurance claims after World War II due to lack of documentation. The International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims (ICHEIC) was established in 1998 to address unpaid insurance policies of Holocaust victims, as survivors and heirs have been struggling for decades to settle these claims. Insurance company records and government archives are often the only proof of these policies, which were either confiscated by the Nazis or lost during the Holocaust. The ICHEIC was established in 1998 to resolve unpaid insurance policies of Holocaust victims. In 2000 and 2001, executive agreements were signed with Germany and Austria designating ICHEIC to address Holocaust-era insurance policies. The process ended in 2007, but companies continue to withhold names of owners and beneficiaries of insurance policies sold to Jewish customers before World War II. In American Insurance Association, Inc., v. Garamendi, the Supreme Court ruled that executive agreements and foreign policy regarding insurance claims against German and Austrian companies during the Holocaust preempted State laws. Congress was noted to have the power to regulate international matters. Congress has not addressed disclosure and restitution of Holocaust victims' insurance policies. Court decisions have dismissed claims against an Italian insurance company without a US-Italy executive agreement. Congress supports Holocaust survivors and heirs to obtain information and recover unpaid funds from entities involved in the theft of insurance assets. This Act aims to establish Federal jurisdiction for these matters. Congress intends to establish a Federal private right of action for Holocaust survivors and heirs to recover under their insurance policies. State laws protecting their rights to information and recovery of unpaid funds from entities involved in theft should be valid. Insurance payments to victims should be expedited. Insurance payments should be expedited to Holocaust survivors and heirs to ensure justice is served by providing compensation for their losses without time limitations. Private right of action is granted in Section 3. (a) Civil Actions To Recover Under Covered Policies.--Any person who purchased a covered policy, or a beneficiary or heir of such person, may bring a civil action in the appropriate United States district court against the insurer for the covered policy to recover proceeds due or enforce any rights. Nationwide Service of Process allows process serving in any U.S. judicial district where the defendant can be found. Remedies include awarding the beneficiary the proceeds due under the policy and prejudgment interest. The civil action allows individuals to sue insurers for covered policy proceeds, including prejudgment interest at 6% per year and any necessary relief for enforcement. SEC. 4. VALIDITY OF STATE LAWS. Validity of State Laws: State laws creating a cause of action against insurers or related companies based on covered policies are not invalidated or preempted by executive foreign policies or agreements. Laws requiring disclosure of information by insurers are also protected from invalidation or preemption. Executive agreements and executive foreign policies of the Federal Government, established before or after the enactment of this Act, are covered. No funds can be used by the Department of State or any other US department to issue a statement of interest encouraging a court to dismiss claims related to covered policies. SEC. 5. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. A court may not dismiss a claim brought under section 3 or section 4 within 10 years of the enactment of this Act based on statute of limitations or laches. SEC. 6. APPLICABILITY. This Act applies to claims brought under section 3 or State laws described in section 4, including those dismissed on executive preemption grounds or released due to class action settlements. It is not a defense that a claim was precluded or barred. The curr_chunk states that a defense can be made based on the doctrine of res judicata or collateral estoppel. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to legal defense. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to insurance policies issued in Nazi Germany between 1933 and 1945. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to insurance policies issued in Nazi Germany between 1933 and 1945, including the definitions of \"Nazi Germany,\" \"insurer,\" \"legislative days,\" and \"related company.\""
