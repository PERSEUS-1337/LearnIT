    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Domestic Violence Enhanced Penalty Act of 2014\" or \"Candace's Law\". The Congress finds that domestic violence affects women, children, and future generations, with alarming statistics on the prevalence of abuse and its long-term impact. Domestic violence incidents often go unreported, leading to a lack of support for victims. This issue not only affects the victims but also has a significant economic impact, costing the national economy over $37 billion annually. Incentive for states to enhance sentencing for domestic violence committed in front of a minor child. States must provide enhanced sentencing provisions for domestic violence committed in front of minor children, within 2 years of the enactment of the Act. Failure to comply will result in a 20 percent reduction in funding. States failing to implement certain provisions of the Violence Against Women Act may lose 20 percent of their allocated funds. The Attorney General will assess if a State's inability to implement is due to constitutional constraints, and both parties must make efforts to comply in good faith. The State must make good faith efforts to implement the section of the Violence Against Women Act and resolve any conflicts with the State's constitution. If compliance with the Act conflicts with the State's constitution, the Attorney General will consult with state officials. If the State cannot fully implement the Act due to constitutional limitations, alternative procedures may be considered. The Attorney General may determine State compliance with the Violence Against Women Act despite constitutional limitations. Non-compliance results in funding reduction, and reallocation of funds to compliant States. Funds may be reallocated to compliant States for implementing the Violence Against Women Act. The term \"State\" is defined as per the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968."
