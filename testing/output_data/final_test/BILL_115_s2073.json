    "content": "The Act titled \"National Forest System Vegetation Management Pilot Program Act of 2017\" establishes a pilot program for utility infrastructure rights-of-way vegetation management. The term \"National Forest System land\" is defined as land within the National Forest System, excluding National Grasslands and land utilization projects on designated National Grasslands. The term \"passing wildfire\" is also defined. The curr_chunk defines terms related to wildfire management on National Forest System land, including \"passing wildfire,\" \"pilot program,\" \"right-of-way,\" \"Secretary,\" and \"utility infrastructure.\" These terms are crucial for understanding a pilot program established by the Secretary to encourage vegetation management projects on rights-of-way. The Secretary will establish a voluntary pilot program for vegetation management projects on National Forest System land near rights-of-way. Participants must be owners or operators of a right-of-way, with priority given to those who have worked with Forest Service fire scientists and used advanced technologies for infrastructure protection. Vegetation management projects under the pilot program involve limited activities to protect utility infrastructure from wildfires on National Forest System land near rights-of-way. Activities include thinning, fuel reduction, creating shaded fuel breaks, and other appropriate measures. Vegetation management projects in the pilot program involve limited activities near rights-of-way on National Forest System land. Activities include thinning, fuel reduction, creating shaded fuel breaks, and other measures. Projects must be approved by the Forest Service and participants are responsible for project costs. Participants in the pilot program are responsible for all costs incurred, as determined by the Secretary. Federal funding may be provided for vegetation management projects if deemed in the public interest. Participation in the program does not affect legal obligations or liability standards related to activities in the right-of-way or fires not caused by approved project work. Participants in the pilot program are not liable for damage caused by approved vegetation management projects unless the activity was grossly negligent, violated criminal law, or failed to comply with safety requirements. The Secretary will use existing authority to implement the program. The Secretary may waive or modify regulations to efficiently implement the pilot program. Proceeds from participants can be retained and used for the program. A report to Congress is required every two years until 2027. The Secretary will submit a report every 2 years until December 31, 2027, to update Congress on the pilot program and vegetation management projects. The authority for the pilot program expires on December 31, 2027."
