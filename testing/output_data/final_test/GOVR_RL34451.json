The FY2008 supplemental appropriations bill, H.R. 2642, included increased educational benefits for military personnel serving abroad for thirty-six months or more. The bill faced debate on how to offset the estimated $52 billion cost through FY2018, with a 0.5% surcharge on high income taxpayers added to cover expenses. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates warned of a possible shutdown of nonessential operations in July until the bill was enacted. The Senate did not agree to a 0.5% surcharge on high income taxpayers to offset the cost of the program. \"Blue Dog\" Democrats in the House threatened to vote against the bill if costs were not offset. The White House warned of a veto if a tax increase was included. The House ultimately passed expanded veterans educational benefits without the offset. There were objections to specific aspects of the GI bill proposal, with Defense Department officials and Senate Republicans opposing key elements.

The Senate approved extra domestic spending, leading to negotiations with the White House to avoid a veto. The final bill, passed by the House and Senate, included minimal unrequested domestic funding and was signed by the President. Tables provide an overview of funding by title and a comparison of House, Senate, and requested funding for selected programs. The House-passed version of H.R. 2642 included Iraq-related policy provisions for redeployment of U.S. forces. The House-passed Iraq policy amendment included provisions for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq, authorization by Congress for any agreement on the status of U.S. forces, matching of U.S. reconstruction aid by Iraq, subsidizing fuel costs for U.S. forces, and readiness guidelines for deployed troops.

The Administration requested $189.3 billion in emergency FY2008 supplemental appropriations for the Department of Defense, with $86.8 billion approved by Congress. $102.5 billion remained pending when the 110th Congress reconvened in January. In March 2008, the Defense Department revised the allocation of remaining funds, reducing funding for \"Other Procurement Army\" and adding money for Navy, Army National Guard, and Air Force operations. Additionally, about $1 billion in military construction funds were added to cover base realignment and closure costs. In response to escalating base realignment and closure costs, House and Senate appropriators planned to add a \"bridge fund\" of $65-70 billion for FY2009. This fund would mainly cover personnel and operating accounts to sustain military operations until mid-2008, avoiding a contentious Iraq policy debate during the fall election season. The White House later requested $70 billion in emergency war-related FY2009 supplemental funding, with $66 billion designated for military purposes.

The ESF funding for Iraq supports reconstruction programs, ministerial capacity development, agriculture, private sector reform, and democratization efforts. A proposed $25 million would establish a new Iraq enterprise fund based on successful models from east Europe and the former Soviet Union. Enterprise funds provide loans or equity investments to small and medium businesses, encouraging private sector growth. Successful examples include the Polish Fund, which made profitable investments post-communism. Some funds for post-communism reconstruction have faced challenges in investment risks and finding promising businesses. Questions arise about conflicting development goals and economic profit pressures. The INCLE account focuses on rule of law and corrections programs, while the MRA request aims to address the refugee crisis in Iraq. The CERP provides support for economic activities at the local level, including infrastructure projects and salaries for security forces.

Exceptions are made for democracy, human rights programs, demining, and assistance to refugees. Afghanistan's political transition was completed in 2005, but insurgent threats escalated in 2006. In January 2004, Afghanistan adopted a new constitution. Successful presidential elections were held in October 2004, followed by parliamentary elections in September 2005. The parliament has become a platform for factions to peacefully resolve differences. Afghan citizens have gained new personal freedoms, especially in the northern and western regions, previously forbidden under the Taliban. Women are increasingly participating in economic and political roles. The insurgency, led by remnants of the Taliban, escalated in 2006 despite recent successes in counter-insurgency operations. The Taliban remains a significant threat to peace and security. The Taliban poses a significant threat to peace and security in parts of Afghanistan due to slow reconstruction, corruption, and the failure to extend government authority into rural areas. Concerns have been raised about the distribution of reconstruction funding in the stable northern region. Narcotics trafficking, independent militias, and Taliban commanders operating from Pakistan continue to challenge efforts to stabilize the country. The Reconstruction Opportunity Zones initiative was introduced in 2007 to stimulate economic growth. The United States and partners focus on strengthening central government and security forces in Afghanistan, combating insurgent challenges, and promoting reconstruction through PRTs.

Senator Webb argued for S. 22, comparing it to the post-World War II GI bill and highlighting its potential economic growth, impact on military recruitment, and benefits for veterans. The Department of Veterans' Affairs opposed S. 22, citing concerns about complexity, cost, and potential impact on reenlistment rates. An alternative bill, S. 2938, proposed by Senator Graham, offered more limited increases in GI Bill educational benefits for servicemembers and veterans. The proposed bill offers increased educational benefits for servicemembers with 12 or more years of active duty service, including $1,650 per month for 36 months, a $500 annual stipend for books and supplies, and provisions for tutorial assistance and licensing tests. It also allows up to $6,000 per year to repay federal student loans and extends eligibility to certain individuals not covered by the current GI Bill. The bill proposed increased educational benefits for servicemembers with 12 or more years of service, including a matching grants program and transferability of benefits provision. The College Patriots Grant Program could provide up to an additional $3,000 per year, and servicemembers could transfer up to half of their education benefits to dependents after six years of service. President Bush proposed expanding the transferability of veterans' educational benefits to dependents in his State of the Union address and repeated it in his May 8 address commemorating Military Spouse Day. The GI bill enhancements became a major issue in congressional consideration of the FY2008 supplemental, holding up action on the entire measure for some time. In the House, members of the Democratic \"Blue Dog\" caucus initially warned that they would not support a rule on the bill because the cost was not offset as the rules of the House required. At the beginning of the 110th Congress, the new Democratic majority agreed to changes in House rules to require that increases in mandatory spending or cuts in revenues be paid for either by cuts in other mandatory programs or by increases in revenues. The House leadership agreed to support an income tax surcharge as an offset to the costs of the bill, but the Senate did not concur. The Defense Department criticized the Webb and Mitchell bill for potentially weakening military personnel retention due to concerns that it would encourage personnel to leave for college rather than reenlist. Secretary of Defense Gates and Admiral Michael Mullen raised these issues in letters and press conferences. President Bush announced legislation to Congress on May 6 to allow servicemembers to transfer educational benefits to family members. The House and Senate passed versions of the FY2008/FY2009 supplemental bill with expanded GI bill benefits, including a surcharge on high earners to raise revenue. The Defense Department expressed concerns about the bill potentially affecting military personnel retention. The House passed H.R. 2642 on June 19 and the Senate on June 26, including an expansion of veterans educational benefits with a provision for transferring benefits to spouses or dependents. The cost increased by $11.6 billion to $63.8 billion from FY2008 through FY2018. Additionally, the Administration requested $5.761 billion in emergency funds for hurricane protection programs on the Gulf Coast. The Corps of Engineers is responsible for repairing and fortifying the hurricane protection system in coastal Louisiana, especially in the New Orleans area. Since Hurricane Katrina, most funding for this work has come from emergency appropriations, totaling about $7 billion. However, the Administration believes this amount is insufficient due to increased costs and other factors. The Corps expected to use up the funds by the end of FY2008 but more work is needed to reduce the risk of hurricane flooding to a 100-year level of protection. The House and Senate differed on emergency funding for hurricane-related programs, with the Senate providing additional funding for various disaster-related programs. This included more funding for the Corps of Engineers, wildland fire fighting, emergency Medicare and Medicaid services, and housing programs. After the Senate approved its version of the supplemental on May 22, large rain storms caused extensive flooding in the Midwest. The White House urged Congress to add $1.8 billion to replenish emergency accounts depleted by flood-related expenses. The final bill, signed on June 30, provided $8.4 billion for disaster relief, excluding the $4.6 billion added by the Senate. Other domestic programs also received funding in the supplemental. The Census Bureau faced funding shortfalls for FY2008 due to equipment difficulties. The Secretary of Commerce estimated a shortfall of $160-$230 million, which was addressed through internal transfers. Both House and Senate supplemental bills provided $210 million for the Census Bureau. Other agencies also reported funding shortfalls, with additional funds allocated for the federal prison system, Federal Marshals Service, and FDA enforcement activities. The final, enacted bill includes $178 million for prisons and $150 million for FDA enforcement activities. Excluding costs of extended unemployment compensation and GI Bill benefits, the bill allocated $10.3 billion for domestic programs, with $4.6 billion for disaster recovery. Additionally, there was funding for a science initiative, NASA, National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, National Institutes of Health, and the Low-Income Heating Emergency Assistance Program. The final bill included $2.7 billion more than the initial request for disaster recovery, with additional funding for science programs and the Food and Drug Administration. The Senate bill had more funding for unrequested domestic programs. The Administration requested $196.5 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for FY 2008, with $102.5 billion for defense and $5.4 billion for international affairs still outstanding. The remaining funding for defense was for repairing and upgrading equipment used in the war, while for foreign operations, it included reconstruction assistance for Iraq and Afghanistan, and a new counter-narcotics initiative in Mexico and Central America. The Administration requested $141.7 billion in emergency supplemental funding for the Defense Department, $3.3 billion for the State Department and international affairs, and $325 million for other agencies between February and October 2007. This was part of the FY2008 emergency supplemental appropriations, which included requests for Diplomatic and Consular Program security upgrades and Contributions to International Peacekeeping Activities. The Administration complied with Section 1008 of the FY2007 national defense authorization act by including estimated full year costs of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in the President's budget. The Defense Department estimated the costs of continuing operations at the same pace as in 2006, but acknowledged it was a rough projection. An additional $5.3 billion was requested for the Department of Defense to procure Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles. The Department of Defense is set to acquire and deploy 1,520 Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles for the Army and Marine Corps. In October 2007, the President proposed an amendment to the FY2008 budget requesting $45.9 billion in emergency funding for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other areas. Congressional action on the FY2008 emergency supplemental funding began in September 2007 and was finalized shortly before Christmas. In September 2007, Congress approved $5.2 billion in emergency funding for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles. The FY2008 defense appropriations bill provided $460 billion for Defense Department activities, including $27.4 billion for Army and $4.8 billion for Marine Corps operations. Additional $11.6 billion was allocated for MRAP vehicles. The House approved $50 billion for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, with provisions for troop withdrawal and limited mission for remaining forces. The Senate refused to close debate on a motion to proceed to consideration of H.R. 4156, effectively killing the measure. They also rejected a substitute offered by Senator McConnell to provide $70 billion for the Defense Department without requiring withdrawal from Iraq. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates warned that without additional funding, the Army and Marine Corps would have to limit operations, potentially leading to furloughs of government employees and contractors. The Defense Department transferred $4.5 billion to extend Army operations until February 23, 2008. Congress needed to approve additional funding to avoid halting essential operations. On December 17, 2007, the House approved amendments to the foreign operations appropriations bill, H.R. 2764, providing $485 billion in regular and emergency appropriations for various programs. Another amendment allocated $31 billion in emergency defense appropriations, mainly for Operation Enduring Freedom. On December 18, 2007, the Senate approved $70 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for the Department of Defense for overseas operations, without restrictions on where the funds could be used. This replaced the House-passed $31 billion for Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). The House later approved the Senate amendment, clearing the bill for the President to sign into law as P.L. 110-161. The President signed the bill into law, P.L. 110-161, on December 26, clearing the measure for the President. The Administration requested $189.3 billion in emergency FY2008 supplemental appropriations for the Department of Defense. Congress had approved $86.8 billion, leaving $102.5 billion pending. The Defense Department made adjustments in its budget request, with remaining amounts proposed by the end of March 2008. Congressional appropriations committees prepared a bill to provide remaining FY2008 defense funds. The congressional appropriations committees added a \"bridge fund\" for FY2009 to sustain day-to-day activities and war-related operations until mid-2009. The Defense Department discussed fund allocation to support critical operations. The Administration requested $70 billion in FY2009 supplemental funding, with $66 billion for defense and intelligence. The Administration requested a $66 billion defense bridge fund to sustain operations until the end of July 2009, as calculated by CRS."
