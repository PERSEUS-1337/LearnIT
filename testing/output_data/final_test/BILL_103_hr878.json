FINDINGS.\" The Congress recognizes the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians as the descendants and political successors of various treaties from 1795 to 1833, including the Treaty of Chicago 1833 where they negotiated specific rights. The Potawatomi Indians negotiated rights to remain in Michigan, while other bands had to move to Kansas or Iowa. Some bands later returned to the Great Lakes area. Several Potawatomi tribes, including the Hannahville Indian Community of Michigan and the Forest County Potawatomi Community of Wisconsin, have been recognized by the Federal Government as eligible to receive services. The Pokagon Band of Potawatomi has a historical treaty lineage dating back to 1795. Beginning in 1935, the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians petitioned for reorganization and assistance under the Indian Reorganization Act. Federal agents in 1939 decided not to extend benefits of the Act to any Indian tribes in Michigan's lower peninsula. Other Potawatomi bands, like the Forest County Potawatomi and Hannahville Indian Community, received services under the Act. The Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians, with at least 1,500 members, resides near their ancestral homeland in Michigan and Indiana. Despite being denied the right to organize under the Indian Reorganization Act, they have maintained their governmental functions through a Business Committee and Tribal Council. They have had continuous dealings with the US Government, the State of Michigan, and local governments. The Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians has had continuous dealings with recognized political leaders from 1795 until the present. Federal recognition of the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians is affirmed, allowing them access to all Federal services and benefits for federally recognized Indian tribes. Tribal membership eligibility is granted without the need for a reservation or specific location. The Band must submit membership rolls to the Secretary within 18 months of the Act's enactment, based on Band's governing documents. The Secretary will publish notice in the Federal Register. The Band is responsible for maintaining and updating the rolls. (a) Constitution.--Within 24 months of the Act's enactment, the Band must hold a secret ballot election to adopt a new constitution and bylaws. Until then, the current governing documents will serve as interim governing documents.\n(b) Officials.--Within 6 months of adopting a constitution, the Secretary will conduct secret ballot elections to elect Band officials. The Band must hold a secret ballot election to adopt a new constitution and bylaws within 24 months of the Act's enactment. Until then, the current governing body will remain in place. If new officials are not elected within this time frame, the current governing body will continue to serve. The Band's tribal land includes all real property held by the Band, to be acquired by the Secretary in trust for the Band. The Band's service area covers specific counties in Michigan and Indiana. The Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians has jurisdiction over lands taken into trust by the Secretary and its members within the service area. Definitions include the Band, members, and Secretary."
