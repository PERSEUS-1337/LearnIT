However, its production lags behind the United States due to geological, regulatory, and technical challenges. Despite this, natural gas is overshadowed by coal as the primary energy source in China, where the coal industry holds significant influence over energy policy. The coal industry's influence on Chinese energy policy is significant at all levels of government. China ranks third in global LNG imports, with Central Asia being a key source of pipeline imports. China has increased its LNG import capacity and is well-positioned to benefit from upcoming export projects. Increasing natural gas production, especially from unconventional resources, may pose a challenge for foreign export projects targeting China's market. China's natural gas consumption is growing rapidly, but it only makes up 6% of the country's primary energy consumption. This has implications for U.S. energy exports, investments in China, manufacturing competitiveness, and China's ability to meet global energy demands. China's ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, combat climate change, and manage political and economic relationships with regions like Central Asia and the Middle East. Additionally, China's plans for disputed waters in the South China Sea and management of the Xinjiang region are key areas of focus. In the context of Chinese government concerns about separatism, terrorism, and religious extremism, Congress oversees U.S. dialogues and cooperation with China on natural gas issues. Various agencies are involved in these efforts, including the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Department of State, and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency. China's environmental challenges due to coal reliance are being addressed to meet global commitments on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. China is prioritizing cleaner energy sources like natural gas to reduce air pollution and meet global commitments on greenhouse gas emissions. The country aims for natural gas to make up at least 10% of energy consumption by 2020, with coal's percentage dropping to 62%. Previous targets were not met, but by 2025, natural gas consumption in China is projected to double to almost 400 billion cubic meters. This growth will require investment in infrastructure for transporting and consuming greater volumes of natural gas. China aims to increase natural gas consumption to reduce pollution and meet emission goals. The National Development and Reform Commission oversees energy policy, with other agencies like the Ministry of Commerce handling international trade negotiations. The Ministry of Land and Resources controls land-access rights and has held auctions for shale gas exploration. The Ministry of Finance subsidizes shale gas field development, with a five-year renewal announced in April 2015. The Ministry of Environmental Protection may see an expanded mandate in the energy sector. Provincial and local governments regulate end-user gas prices. China's gas industry is dominated by three large state-owned enterprises. China's gas industry is dominated by three large state-owned enterprises known as national oil companies (NOCs). The biggest are China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec), with CNPC ranked fourth globally and Sinopec ranked 19th. China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) is a smaller SOE focused on offshore extraction and is China's leading LNG importer. The Chinese gas industry is dominated by three large state-owned enterprises, including CNPC and Sinopec. Natural gas is less of a contributor compared to oil for these companies. Other players in the industry include Sinochem Corporation, CITIC Group Corporation, and Shaanxi Yanchang Petroleum (Group) Corporation. Private sector involvement is limited due to policies favoring national oil companies. Industry groups are discussing a transition towards a new supply-chain model. Observers of China's energy sector have identified challenges for the gas industry, including the ongoing anti-corruption campaign, monopoly power among state-owned enterprises, the country's complex gas pricing system, and limited access for private investors. The anti-corruption drive has targeted top CNPC and Sinopec managers, with former Politburo Standing Committee member Zhou Yongkang sentenced to life in prison for corruption in June 2015. Committee member Zhou Yongkang, sentenced to life in prison for corruption in June 2015, had a career in the oil and gas industry. Former associates like Jiang Jiemin and Su Shulin also faced corruption charges. Executives like Wang Tianpu from Sinopec were investigated. Overseas operations of CNPC and Sinopec were also under scrutiny, with executives from Turkmenistan and Iran detained. Sinopec's investments in Angola were a focus of the investigation. Sinopec executives focused on unprofitable investments in Angola, possibly to crack down on corruption, target Zhou Yongkang's associates, and weaken vested interests. CNPC dominates China's gas industry with a market concentration ratio of 99.7%. The natural gas industry in China is dominated by state-owned enterprises (SOEs), with CNPC holding a market concentration ratio of 99.7%. PetroChina initially planned to open up to private investment but later decided to retain control with Chinese financial firms. In 2015, PetroChina sold a 50% stake in its western Chinese pipeline infrastructure to a state-owned asset management firm. Analysts believe that the monopoly control over the gas pipeline industry has led to inefficiencies. The gas pipeline industry in China has significant inefficiencies due to monopoly control by state-owned enterprises. An analysis in 2015 found that construction costs exceeded market value, possibly worsened by government regulation of gas prices. The pricing system shifted in 2013 to focus on import prices of fuel oil for determining city-gate prices. The pricing system for natural gas in China is determined by global market prices, with a focus on import prices of fuel oil and liquefied petroleum gas. The government allows prices to be set by market mechanisms, aiming for closer convergence between residential and industrial prices. Despite recent policy changes, local prices are still influenced by the economic sector of the end-user. Industrial gas prices are kept high to subsidize lower prices for other users, according to the OECD. The government in China keeps industrial gas prices high to subsidize lower prices for residential consumers, which can distort the market's reaction to fuel prices. Studies have shown a significant price differential between transportation industry end-users and residential end-users. Efforts are being made to reduce this gap, with plans to unify non-residential natural gas prices and liberalize prices for industry. In November 2015, the NDRC announced significant price reductions for industrial and transport gas users in China. This move aimed to cut businesses' gas expenditures by 28% and increase gas's role in the country's energy mix as part of the 2014-2020 Energy Development Strategy Action Plan. Despite efforts to promote shale gas auctions, low demand from the private sector has led to delays in holding auctions. Land Resources has delayed the third auction due to low demand in China's shale gas industry. Observers suggest providing tax incentives and easier access to infrastructure to attract investors. The lack of private investment is linked to overestimation of gas reserves. China's complex geology and geography, with gas reserves in remote areas and scarcity of water resources, deter private investors. China's 13th Five-Year Plan (FYP) outlines economic agenda for 2016-2020, emphasizing increase in oil and gas extraction, liberalization of extraction rights, and development of coalbed methane and shale gas. Plan also aims to speed up liberalization of electricity and natural gas industries, reducing government intervention in price formation mechanisms. China's 13th Five-Year Plan emphasizes the liberalization of electricity and natural gas industries by reducing government intervention in price formation mechanisms. Premier Li outlined plans to relax restrictions on entry, remove barriers, and encourage private investment in natural gas. Private companies will receive equal treatment to SOEs in project approvals, financing, tax policies, and land availability. China aims to increase natural gas supply and substitute coal with electricity and natural gas. Cooperation with Russia in natural gas projects was also mentioned. The NDRC report to the NPC highlighted commitments to accelerate structural reform, advance commodity distribution system reform, and expand rural gas networks. City-gate gas prices for non-residential consumers significantly decreased in 2015. U.S. agencies are collaborating with Chinese counterparts on natural gas projects, with Congress overseeing and funding these activities. Examples of U.S.-China cooperation include participation in an annual U.S.-China Oil and Natural Gas Forum. The U.S. Department of Energy and State are collaborating with Chinese counterparts on natural gas projects through various activities such as workshops, training programs, and technology exchanges. The U.S. Trade and Development Agency funds programs for U.S. and Chinese gas industry experts to share best practices. The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) funds workshops and training programs in China for the gas industry. International oil and gas firms are cautious in their involvement in China's shale gas projects, with partnerships like FTSI and Sinopec in the Sichuan basin, and Chevron with CNPC in gas extraction in the same shale basin. Royal Dutch Shell and CNPC are partners in a joint venture to tap China's shale gas reserves, facing hurdles due to high hydrogen sulfide levels. ConocoPhillips and PetroChina's talks for shale gas development in Sichuan ended in 2015. Hess Corporation signed a contract with PetroChina in 2013 for exploration in the Santanghu Basin. Anadarko Petroleum's subsidiary in China was sold in late 2014. Noble Energy had a stake in a joint venture with Sinopec until 2014. ExxonMobil sold its Chinese assets for $186 million in 2014, holding a 57% stake in a gas and oil extraction joint venture with Sinopec. The company has long-term LNG agreements with PetroChina and Sinopec and conducted a joint study on shale gas extraction in Sichuan. China's \"Belt and Road\" initiative aims to invest in infrastructure across 70 countries, with a Silk Road Economic Belt and a 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. President Xi Jinping introduced the initiative in 2013 as part of China's foreign policy. The Belt and Road Initiative, introduced by President Xi Jinping in 2013, focuses on commercial foreign policy. The initiative emphasizes adherence to market rules, regional cooperation, and the role of enterprises in resource allocation. China's gas industry, including infrastructure development for trade with Central Asia, is a key aspect of the initiative. CNPC proposed a natural gas and LNG trading center in Shanghai under the Belt and Road Initiative, modeled after Singapore's oil trading hub. The natural gas trading center in Shanghai, launched in July 2015, takes advantage of the city's financial sector and international firms. China has increased domestic gas production by 164% in the last decade, reaching 135 BCM in 2014. Imports have also grown significantly, with 46% from LNG and 54% from pipelines in 2014. Turkmenistan is the largest supplier, providing 44% of imports. China faces infrastructure constraints in some regions, like Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, where gas deposits lack pipelines for transportation. China's natural gas production has been rising, but government policies have limited its potential. China now imports 31% of its consumption, ranking in the top 15 countries for proved reserves. It has the most shale gas resources globally, but its production forecast for 2016 is only slightly higher than in 2014. Primary onshore gas-producing regions include Sichuan Province, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, and Qinghai Province. China has explored natural gas fields in various regions such as the Sichuan Basin, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, Qinghai Province, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and Shaanxi Province. Offshore exploration includes the Bohai Basin and the Panyu complex in the South China Sea. China's shale gas efforts have focused on the Sichuan Basin, with limited progress due to technical challenges and complex geology. China's slow shale gas development in Xinjiang is hindered by technical skills, lack of infrastructure, and reduced subsidies. The 2020 production target was lowered to 30 BCM from an initial 100 BCM goal. Xinjiang, a key region for oil and gas production, faces challenges due to religious and ethnic violence. Xinjiang is a major producer of oil and gas, with significant reserves. Despite concerns about security, analysis suggests its energy infrastructure may be more secure than previously thought. China is a significant importer of natural gas, with imports rising in early 2015. China's LNG imports rose significantly in early 2015, but fell by the end of the year, casting doubt on future demand. Chinese import terminals operated at less than 50% capacity in 2015, impacting the international market's ability to absorb global LNG exports. Despite China's slowing economy, it has invested in developing its own natural gas resources while relying on increased imports. In 2014, imports accounted for 31% of total Chinese natural gas consumption, with almost half being LNG, making China the world's third largest importer after Japan and South Korea. China was the world's third largest importer of LNG in 2014, with a 10% increase in imports over 2013. China's National Energy Administration aimed to boost construction of LNG terminals and storage facilities in 2014. However, the country's natural gas pipeline network is controlled by three major companies, limiting access for new entrants. Currently, China has around 55 BCM of LNG import capacity, with CNOOC controlling most of the terminals. China's LNG import terminals are mainly controlled by CNOOC, accounting for 63% of capacity. Over half of China's natural gas imports in 2014 came from Central Asia and Burma via pipelines. The volume of natural gas imports through pipelines is expected to rise. China's move into Central Asian energy resources is driven by the need to meet energy demands, reduce air pollution, and lower carbon emissions. China is increasing natural gas consumption and decreasing coal usage. China's entry into the Central Asian energy market challenges Russian dominance. Turkmenistan is a major supplier of natural gas to China, with CNPC investing in gas fields. Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan also supply natural gas to China. The Central Asia-China Gas Pipelines transport natural gas to China through multiple lines. Line A and B started operations in 2009 and 2010, while Line C began in 2014. Line D, running from Turkmenistan to China through Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan, is set to increase Turkmen gas shipments to China to 65 BCM per year. Construction began in 2014 and is expected to be completed by the end of 2020. The overall delivery capacity for lines A, B, and C is now 55 BCM per year. The Central Asia-China Gas Pipelines connect with West-East pipelines at the Kazakhstan-China border, making up the longest natural gas pipelines in the world. China and Russia signed a 30-year deal for Russia to supply China with natural gas through a new pipeline. The agreement, valued at $400 billion, is expected to provide China with 38 BCM of Russian natural gas annually starting in 2018. Another deal for an additional 30 BCM was signed in November 2014, but there are concerns about the plans due to low energy prices and uncertainty about China's economic future. China and Russia signed a 30-year deal for Russia to supply China with natural gas through a new pipeline, valued at $400 billion. Plans for the project commissioning may be postponed to the late 2020s due to uncertainty about China's economic future. The Russia-China pipeline deal could give China more leverage in LNG pricing negotiations, potentially affecting LNG exporters like Australia. China aims to increase its natural gas supply to 65 BCM annually by 2016, with the Burma pipeline delivering 10 BCM annually. Asia, the largest LNG importing region, may see lower LNG prices as a result. China is the world's third-largest importer of LNG, behind Japan and South Korea. It imports LNG from various suppliers, giving it negotiating leverage. China has not imported LNG from the United States but has shown interest in doing so in the future. After a U.S.-China dialogue in July 2013, China was informed about the process required for LNG export applications. In November 2013, an analyst expressed doubts about the prospects of U.S. LNG exports to China due to concerns about energy dependence on the U.S. Factors that may deter China from significant imports of U.S. LNG include wariness of U.S. strategic rebalance to Asia, tensions over actions in the East and South China Sea, and allegations between the two countries. The cancellation of CNOOC's bid to buy California-based energy company Unocal in 2005 remains an issue. Greater energy interdependence may broaden cooperation. LNG exports to China were discussed during a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing in January 2015. Concerns were raised about China's high price for imported natural gas and its impact on U.S. manufacturing jobs. China's oil and gas firms have acquired several U.S. assets in recent years, including shale oil and gas assets from companies like Chesapeake Energy. Analysts suggest that these acquisitions were motivated by a desire for advanced technologies and access to resources. Despite a slowdown in China's natural gas demand, the country continues to invest in U.S. energy assets. China's natural gas consumption growth has slowed in recent years, with annual consumption reaching 191 BCM in 2015, up 3.7% from 2014. This is the lowest growth rate in a decade. The government expects energy consumption to increase in 2016, with natural gas accounting for 6.2% of primary energy needs. The sluggish economy has contributed to the slowdown, prompting China to cut natural gas prices to boost demand. Projections for future growth vary, with estimates ranging from 4.5% to 7.3% for 2016. Difficulty in obtaining accurate data on Chinese natural gas consumption is reflected in the wide range of projections. The study on residential gas price and income elasticities in Chinese urban centers revealed that the price elasticity of natural gas was more negative in northern China than in southern China, leading to larger consumption declines in northern cities. The availability of coal in the north allows for easy substitution for gas. Natural gas vehicles (NGVs) have driven gas usage growth in China due to cost competitiveness, but users face challenges at filling stations during winter gas shortages. China had 3,000 LNG and CNG refilling stations by the end of 2013, supporting 80,000 LNG vehicles, with a significant portion located in the north and northwest. China aims to have 1.2 million natural gas-fueled vehicles by 2020, requiring 12,000 filling stations by 2015. In 2015, there were 3,800 CNG stations and 3,100 LNG stations. Natural gas emissions accounted for 3% of China's total fuel emissions in 2013. Chinese policymakers are under pressure to clean up the coal industry due to high emissions and public health concerns. A study suggested coal emissions cause 670,000 premature deaths annually. The future of natural gas in China depends on addressing air pollution issues. Analysts believe that increasing natural gas imports to China could help reduce greenhouse gas emissions by substituting natural gas for coal in the electric power sector. China currently imports 55 BCM of natural gas through the Central Asia-China Gas Pipelines, allowing for a reduction of 73 million tons of coal use annually and cutting carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide emissions by 78 million tons and 1.21 million tons each year."
