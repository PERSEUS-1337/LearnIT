    "content": "The Act titled \"Federal Employees Electronic Personal Health Records Act of 2006\" mandates electronic personal health records for federal employee health benefits plans. The Act mandates electronic personal health records for federal employee health benefits plans, requiring carriers to establish and maintain electronic personal health records in a standard electronic format. The Act requires electronic health information technology to use open standards, collect specific clinical data, promote interoperability, support clinical decision-making, be useful for diagnosis and treatment, and adhere to federal messaging and health vocabulary standards. Each carrier must establish and maintain electronic personal health records for individuals and family members enrolled in a health benefits plan under section 8915. The Office of Personnel Management ensures timely notice of this requirement. The Office of Personnel Management requires carriers to establish and maintain electronic personal health records for individuals and family members enrolled in a health benefits plan. The records must be based on standard electronic formats and accessible through the Internet for the individual or family. Individuals have the option to not participate or terminate the electronic personal health record at any time. The electronic personal health record allows individuals and family members to share, copy, print, and add supplementary health information in standard electronic format. The electronic personal health record includes laboratory tests, social history, health conditions, allergies, dental services, immunizations, prescriptions, family health history, alternative treatments, appointments, and any additional information as needed. Claims data from healthcare providers participating in health services are also included. The electronic personal health record includes various health information such as clinical care, pharmaceutical, and laboratory records, along with the source for each item. It also requires authentication of the individual's identity when accessing the record. The electronic personal health record must have an audit trail of individuals accessing it, allow designation of others to access and control sharing, and require compliance with privacy and security regulations. The laws require carriers to facilitate electronic transfer of personal health records between different health plans, provide education on electronic health records, and ensure compliance with privacy and security regulations. The laws mandate carriers to offer electronic personal health records for individuals and families enrolled in health plans, allowing electronic access upon request. The amendments made by this Act, including the requirement for electronic personal health records, will take effect 30 days after enactment. The establishment and maintenance of electronic personal health records under specific sections of the United States Code will apply to health benefits plans starting in January of the first calendar year following 2 years after enactment or as determined by the Office of Personnel Management."
