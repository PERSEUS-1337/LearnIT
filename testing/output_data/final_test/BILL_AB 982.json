    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 8263 of the Education Code is amended to set rules for eligibility for subsidized child development services, including being a current aid recipient, income eligible, homeless, or having children at risk of abuse or neglect. Priority for federal and state subsidized child development services is given to families needing child care services due to various reasons such as child protection concerns, homelessness, parental vocational training, employment, housing stability, or incapacitation. Priority for child care services is given to neglected or abused children or those at risk, referred by legal, medical, or social services agencies. Families receiving child care due to abuse or neglect can receive services for up to three months. A family may receive child care services for up to 12 months based on certification by the county child welfare agency, with the option for recertification if necessary. Priority for admission to child care services is based on income eligibility, with families with the lowest income admitted first. If multiple families have the same income priority, those with a child with exceptional needs are given preference. If no exceptional needs are present, the family on the waiting list the longest is admitted first. Public assistance grants are counted as income for admission purposes. The Superintendent may grant waivers for agencies serving specific populations, such as children with exceptional needs or children of prisoners. Waivers cannot be used to avoid fees or admit ineligible families, but can allow special populations to be accepted out of income order if appropriate fees are paid. In order to ensure continuity of services, families enrolled in state or federally funded child care programs can transfer their enrollment to another eligible program if they no longer meet the income or eligibility criteria. This transfer can be within the same agency or to another agency administering similar programs. The Superintendent may extend the 60-working-day period for families facing diminished employment opportunities by an additional 60 working days if in the public interest. Extensions aim to improve services in areas with high unemployment rates and seasonal agricultural jobs. A physical examination and evaluation, including age-appropriate immunization, are required for enrollment in a child care program. Parents can exempt their child based on religious beliefs, but if there are concerns about contagious diseases, temporary exclusion may be necessary. Regulations under this section include health care screening recommendations from the State Department of Health Care Services. The Superintendent will consult health authorities for children with special needs. Employer-sponsored child care benefit payments guidelines will be established for parents of subsidized child care recipients."
