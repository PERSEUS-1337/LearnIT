The \"Fair Arbitration Act of 2007\" allows for the election of arbitration. Chapter 1 of title 9, United States Code, is amended to include requirements for a binding arbitration contract, including fair disclosure and mandatory or optional participation.

Each party has a vote in selecting the arbitrator, who must be a member in good standing of the state's highest court, comply with ethical codes, and have no personal or financial conflicts of interest. The \"Fair Arbitration Act of 2007\" mandates that arbitrators must disclose any personal or financial interests, relations to the parties, or biases that may affect neutrality before accepting appointment. The \"Fair Arbitration Act of 2007\" requires arbitration to be administered by a neutral organization to ensure fairness and prevent communication between parties and the arbitrator. The arbitrator must follow the same substantive law as would apply in a court of the state where the non-drafter party resided when the contract was signed. The \"Fair Arbitration Act of 2007\" mandates fair arbitration hearings with representation by attorneys, granting relief available in court, and allowing electronic or telephonic hearings to reduce costs. Each party has the right to be represented and to a face-to-face meeting if needed. The \"Fair Arbitration Act of 2007\" allows for face-to-face hearings if requested, with the location determined by the arbitrator for fairness.

Extensions may be granted in complex cases, and the arbitrator must issue a decision within 30 days after the hearing. The arbitrator must issue a written decision within 30 days after the hearing, providing a detailed explanation of the decision based on contract terms, statutes, or legal precedents. The decision can only be reviewed as specified in subsection (c)(2) and sections 10, 11, and 16 of this title. The arbitrator or arbitration organization may reimburse arbitration fees to the claimant as part of the remedy. The small claims opt-out provision allows parties to choose to proceed in a small claims court instead of binding arbitration if the court has jurisdiction over the claim. However, if a complaint in small claims court is amended to exceed the jurisdictional amount or a claim for $50,000 in total damages, the small claims court exemption does not apply. The parties can proceed by arbitration if the exemption does not apply. During arbitration, a party can file a motion if they believe another party has deprived them of a right granted by this section. The arbitrator may award the deprived party a monetary amount for expenses incurred, including attorneys' fees.

A losing party in arbitration can petition the district court if their rights were denied. The arbitrator may award attorneys' fees if the opposing party's actions were not justified or if the circumstances make an award unjust. A losing party in arbitration can petition the district court if their rights were denied, seeking relief and a rehearing before a new arbitrator if clear evidence of deprivation of rights is found. In this section, limitations on claims are outlined, and definitions for 'contract' and 'State' are provided. Additionally, a technical and conforming amendment is made to the table of sections in title 9 of the United States Code. The amendments made by this section regarding the election of arbitration apply to contracts entered into after 6 months from the enactment of the Act."
