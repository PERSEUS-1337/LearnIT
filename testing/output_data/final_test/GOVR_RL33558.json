    "content": "The Energy Secretary signed agreements for $6.5 billion in federal loan guarantees for two reactors at the Vogtle nuclear plant in Georgia. Southern Company's share of the loan guarantee is $3.46 billion, reducing financing costs by up to $250 million. The loans will be issued by the U.S. Treasury's Federal Financing Bank, with no upfront fee charged to the plant owners. The Department of Energy requested $863.4 million for nuclear energy research and development in FY2015. The FY2015 funding for nuclear energy programs is below the FY2014 level, with the House approving $826.7 million and the Senate recommending $777.0 million. Construction of new U.S. nuclear power reactors began in 2013 in South Carolina and Georgia. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued permits for reactor construction. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued combined construction permits and operating licenses for new reactors in Georgia and South Carolina. The new Westinghouse AP1000 reactors are expected to cost between $5 billion and $7 billion each and are scheduled for completion between 2017 and 2019. The NRC also approved a design certification for GE-Hitachi's ESBWR, which includes passive safety features. Currently, the NRC is reviewing COLs for Fermi 3 in Michigan and North Anna 3 in Virginia. Several nuclear power plants in the United States were shut down in 2013 due to various reasons such as structural issues, economic factors, and faulty equipment. These closures raised concerns about the future of aging reactors and prompted discussions about the continued operation of at-risk nuclear generating capacity. The EPA proposed regulations in 2014 to reduce carbon emissions at existing power plants, which could encourage the preservation of nuclear generating capacity. States would need to reduce carbon intensity by 2030 and prevent premature retirement of up to 6% of existing nuclear capacity. NRC issued safety requirements in 2012 based on lessons from the Fukushima disaster, ordering U.S. nuclear plant operators to implement safety enhancements. The NRC ordered U.S. nuclear plant operators to implement safety enhancements after the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster in Japan, which was caused by an earthquake and tsunami leading to overheating of reactor cores and hydrogen explosions. Congressional oversight has been ongoing regarding NRC's response to the accident. Additionally, the DOE issued a Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Used Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Waste in 2013 after halting work on the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository. The DOE strategy in January 2013 called for a new nuclear waste management entity to develop consent-based storage and disposal sites. A pilot interim spent fuel storage facility would open by 2021, with a larger-scale facility receiving waste by 2025. A geologic disposal facility was planned to open by 2048. Legislation introduced by Senator Wyden in June 2013 aimed to redirect the nuclear waste program. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in August 2013 that NRC must continue work on the Yucca Mountain license application. The House voted to provide DOE $150.0 in FY2015 Energy and Water Development appropriations. In FY2015, the House approved $150.0 million for DOE and $55.0 million for NRC for Yucca Mountain licensing activities. DOE stopped collecting nuclear waste fees in 2014, losing $750 million in annual revenue. NRC issued a final rule in 2014 on spent nuclear fuel storage in response to a court ruling. The NRC responded to a court ruling by approving a storage rule for nuclear waste, ending a suspension on licensing decisions for new reactors and spent fuel storage facilities. This decision came after a period of renewed interest in nuclear power in the United States. The renewed interest in nuclear power in the United States was driven by improved reactor performance, federal incentives in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the potential for carbon dioxide controls, and fluctuating natural gas prices. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved licenses for new reactors at the Vogtle and V.C. Summer nuclear power plants in 2012, marking the start of construction for these projects. The construction of new reactors at Vogtle and V.C. Summer nuclear power plants was completed in 2013, but the future of other proposed U.S. reactors is uncertain due to high construction costs and competition from natural gas. Several reactors were permanently closed in 2013, with concerns about nuclear power economics and the development of domestic natural gas reserves impacting the industry. Several nuclear power plants in the U.S. were closed in 2013 due to various reasons such as structural issues, economic factors, and faulty equipment. The closures raised concerns about the future of aging reactors and the impact of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster on new reactor plans. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster affected plans for new U.S. reactors, with preconstruction work suspended on two planned reactors at the South Texas Project. Tokyo Electric Power Company's financial troubles post-accident impacted its investment in the project. New safety requirements post-Fukushima could raise investor concerns about higher costs, but the Obama Administration reiterated support for nuclear power expansion. Prior to the Vogtle and Summer projects, no new nuclear power plants had been ordered in the U.S. since 1978. The U.S. nuclear power industry has faced challenges with no new plants ordered since 1978. Despite cancellations and closures, there are currently 100 licensed reactors generating 19% of the nation's electricity. The completion of the Watts Bar 1 reactor in 1996 led to a 20% increase in nuclear generation due to better operation and capacity expansion. The construction of Watts Bar 2 was resumed in 2007 but faced delays, with completion expected in 2013. The completion of Bellefonte 1 nuclear plant was approved by TVA in 2011, projected to cost $4.9 billion with operation starting by 2020. However, due to lower electricity sales, TVA announced cutbacks at the Bellefonte site in 2013. Nuclear generation in the U.S. surpasses oil, hydropower, and other renewables but lags behind natural gas and coal in electricity generation. Nuclear power generation in the United States remains behind coal, accounting for about 39% of electricity generation in 2013. Despite generating more than half the electricity in four states and 25%-50% in 12 states, high construction costs have hindered nuclear power expansion. The 30-year halt in U.S. nuclear plant orders was due to capital costs, safety concerns, waste disposal, and regulatory issues. Construction costs for reactors completed since the mid-1980s averaged over $3,900 per kilowatt of electric generating capacity. The cost of building new nuclear reactors in the US ranges from $2 billion to $6 billion, averaging over $3,900 per kilowatt of electric generating capacity. Despite predictions of cost reduction with new plant designs, current estimates show little change. However, operating costs for existing nuclear plants have decreased since 1990, with improved efficiency and reduced downtime. The Energy Information Administration reported that licensed US commercial reactors operated at 90% capacity in 2013. Many reactors have received 20-year license renewals, allowing for up to 60 years of operation. Additional renewals are under review, indicating a potential for extended operation. Several reactors are under review by the NRC, with plans for more in the future. However, three reactors have been permanently closed for economic reasons. Construction is ongoing for four new reactors, while COLs are being pursued for 14 additional reactors. The success of the initial reactors will determine the future of the nuclear industry. The nuclear industry is awaiting the completion of new reactors, with construction costs estimated at around $5,335 per kilowatt of capacity. The Vogtle and Summer units are expected to cost billions of dollars, with potential delays in their startup dates. Duke Energy's Levy County project is also in progress, with a final decision on its COL expected in mid-2015. Duke Energy's Levy County project may not need a new plant as soon as planned, but still considers the site viable for future nuclear generation. COLs for reactors at other sites are scheduled to be issued by 2016. NINA is focusing on COL and a DOE loan guarantee for the proposed South Texas Plant reactors. Design certification for GE-Hitachi's ESBWR was approved for new reactors at Fermi and North Anna sites. COLs under review for these units would use the ESBWR design with passive safety features. Several nuclear projects have suspended their COLs, delaying completion until the early 2020s. Some projects may need additional partners to proceed to construction. Entergy and AmerenUE have suspended license reviews for proposed reactors, while Exelon withdrew its COL application for a two-unit plant. Duke Energy's Levy County project is considering future nuclear generation at the site. Several nuclear projects have suspended their COLs, delaying completion until the early 2020s. Duke Energy, Luminant, and TVA have all suspended their applications for new reactors, while Constellation Energy abandoned negotiations for a loan guarantee for the Calvert Cliffs 3 reactor. The NRC anticipates more COL and license applications in the future, including TVA's plan for small modular reactors at its Clinch River site. Concerns about nuclear safety increased after the Fukushima accident, which was worse than Three Mile Island but not as severe as Chernobyl. Total radioactive releases from Fukushima were estimated at 25 million curies. The Fukushima disaster resulted in similar levels of radioactive contamination per square meter as Chernobyl, but it was less widespread and affected fewer people. Timely evacuation within 30 kilometers of the Fukushima Daiichi plant reduced radiation exposure. A health survey estimated the total dose to the prefecture's population at less than 617 sieverts, averaging about 1.4 millisieverts per person for the first 28 months after the accident. The Fukushima nuclear disaster raised policy questions for the United States due to similarities with U.S. reactor designs. The accident highlighted the risks of a station blackout, emphasizing the need for backup power standards and safety measures. Hydrogen explosions at Fukushima reactors also raised safety concerns at U.S. plants. The Fukushima nuclear disaster raised safety concerns at U.S. plants due to similarities in reactor designs. The NRC established a task force to analyze lessons learned and issued recommendations for safety improvements. The NRC Commissioners agreed on recommendations for regulatory actions post-Fukushima, aiming to implement lessons learned by 2016. Tier 1 actions include seismic and flood hazard reevaluations, walkdowns, and station blackout measures for U.S. nuclear plants. The NRC ordered nuclear plants to install reliable, hardened vents for Mark I containments to reduce containment pressure before damage occurred to the reactor core. This is part of the strategies to cope without permanent electrical power sources for an indefinite amount of time. The NRC ordered nuclear plants to install reliable, hardened vents for Mark I containments to reduce pressure before damage occurred to the reactor core. Additionally, the NRC modified the order in June 2013 to require vents to function after core damage to prevent hydrogen leaks. They are also considering filters for vents to reduce radioactive emissions. Spent fuel pool instrumentation was ordered in 2012 to monitor conditions from the control room. The NRC issued a notice in 2012 to require integrated emergency procedures for accidents. The NRC issued a notice in April 2012 for integrated emergency procedures, clear command-and-control strategies, and training qualifications for decisionmakers. Nuclear plants were asked to assess staffing needs for large accidents, ensure operability of emergency communications systems, and address lower-tier actions such as emergency water supply systems, secure power for communications, seismic and flooding hazards confirmation, and regulatory process modifications. Following the Three Mile Island accident, Congress mandated emergency plans for all licensed power reactors. NRC developed standards for emergency plans within a 10-mile EPZ, focusing on responses like evacuation and sheltering. Additionally, a 50-mile EPZ was established to protect food supplies from radioactive releases. The 50-mile EPZ is designed to protect food supplies from radioactive releases. Nuclear plants conduct emergency preparedness exercises every two years, evaluated by FEMA and NRC, involving local, state, and federal responders. Controversy over the size of the plume exposure EPZ heightened after 9/11 and the Fukushima accident, leading to NRC recommending the evacuation of U.S. citizens within 50 miles of the Fukushima plant in 2011. The NRC made changes to nuclear plant emergency planning requirements after the 9/11 attacks, with new regulations taking effect in 2011. These changes include updates to evacuation time estimates, backups for public alert systems, and protection for emergency responders during terrorist attacks. The NRC staff recommended approval of these changes before implementing lessons learned from the Fukushima accident. Safety-related shortcomings in the nuclear power industry, including construction quality, plant operation, maintenance, and emergency planning, have been a longstanding issue in the United States. One serious case involved a reactor vessel at Ohio's Davis-Besse nuclear plant being corroded by leaking boric acid, leading to safety improvements and repairs before restarting in 2004. The NRC's oversight of the industry is also a subject of contention, with nuclear utilities often feeling regulations are overly rigorous and inflexible. The U.S. nuclear power industry has a good safety record compared to other energy technologies. The Three Mile Island accident was the only incident that could have caused public harm, with no significant increase in cancer rates found in a study of residents living nearby. The U.S. nuclear power industry has a good safety record compared to other energy technologies. The Three Mile Island accident was the only incident that could have caused public harm, with no significant increase in cancer rates found in a study of residents living nearby. The relatively small amounts of radioactivity released by nuclear plants during normal operation are not generally believed to pose significant hazards, although some groups contend that routine emissions are unacceptably risky. There is substantial scientific uncertainty about the level of risk posed by low levels of radiation exposure, with health effects only clearly measurable at high exposure levels. The assumed risk of low-level exposure has been extrapolated from health effects documented among persons exposed to high levels of radiation. NRC announced in 2010 that it had asked the National Academy of Sciences to perform a study on cancer risk for populations surrounding nuclear power facilities. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) is conducting a study on cancer risk for populations living near nuclear power facilities. The study focuses on cancer diagnosis rates and uses smaller geographic units to determine the correlation between cancer cases and distance from reactors. NAS began planning a pilot study at seven nuclear facilities in 2013. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has set safety goals to limit the risk of accidental or cancer deaths from nuclear power plants. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has set safety goals to limit the risk of accidents at nuclear power plants. The benchmark probability of a major release from containment failure during a core melt accident should average less than one in 100,000 per reactor per year. Some groups challenge these calculations, suggesting accidents with serious public health consequences may be more frequent. The Chernobyl accident remains the worst nuclear power plant accident in history, resulting in at least 31 deaths from acute radiation exposure. The Chernobyl accident resulted in at least 31 deaths from acute radiation exposure, with thousands more at risk of cancer-related deaths in the future. A 2006 report by the Chernobyl Forum highlighted a significant increase in childhood thyroid cancer cases, with an estimated 4,000 cases linked to contaminated milk consumption. Additionally, an estimated 4,000 cancer deaths may have occurred among those with the highest radiation exposures, along with a 1% increase in cancer deaths among those with less exposure. The Chernobyl accident resulted in at least 31 deaths from acute radiation exposure, with thousands more at risk of cancer-related deaths in the future. A 2006 report by the Chernobyl Forum highlighted a significant increase in childhood thyroid cancer cases, with an estimated 4,000 cases linked to contaminated milk consumption. Greenpeace estimated 200,000 deaths in Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine from the accident between 1990 and 2004. The U.S. nuclear industry aimed to streamline licensing for new plants, leading to changes in the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 streamlined the nuclear licensing process by allowing the NRC to issue combined construction permits and operating licenses (COLs) for new plants. This one-step process eliminated the need for separate construction and operating licenses, reducing delays in plant operation. The NRC would conduct preoperational hearings on plant construction adequacy only in specific circumstances. The Nuclear Power 2010 program funded up to half the cost of several COLs and early site permits to test the revised licensing process. The nuclear industry has requested changes in the licensing process, including using informal procedures to determine compliance, eliminating mandatory hearings on uncontested issues, and addressing regulatory delays. Concerns about NRC's performance in issuing and enforcing safety regulations are central to the nuclear regulatory debate. The nuclear industry has raised concerns about the strict enforcement of safety regulations by the NRC, while environmentalists and other groups criticize the NRC for being too close to the industry, leading to lax oversight and exemptions from safety requirements. Plant owners are responsible for safety compliance and report any issues to the NRC, which monitors compliance through resident inspectors at each nuclear power plant. The NRC enforces safety regulations through regular inspections and dispatches special teams for serious violations. Their reactor safety program is based on risk-informed regulation, using performance indicators to determine scrutiny levels. Nuclear power plants have security measures against terrorist attacks, including physical barriers and trained security forces. The NRC enforces safety regulations through regular inspections and dispatches special teams for serious violations. Nuclear power plants have security measures against terrorist attacks, including simulated attacks monitored by NRC to test the operator's defense ability. The \"design basis threat\" specifies the severity of attacks that plant security must prepare for. EPACT05 required NRC to revise the DBT based on terrorist threats assessment. The revised DBT approved on January 29, 2007, does not require defense against deliberate aircraft attacks. NRC stated that mitigation of large fires and explosions is already required, and active protection against airborne threats is handled by U.S. military and other agencies. NRC voted on February 17, 2009, to require all new nuclear facilities to defend against potential threats. The NRC voted on February 17, 2009, to require new nuclear power plants to incorporate design features for protection against aircraft crashes. Existing reactors were not mandated to have the same level of protection, but additional requirements were imposed after the 9/11 attacks. All reactors, new and existing, were ordered in 2002 to develop strategies to mitigate the effects of large fires and explosions from aircraft crashes or other causes. The NRC approved regulations on fire mitigation strategies and aircraft threat response for nuclear reactors in December 2008 and published the rules in March 2009. Other security issues include spent fuel pool vulnerability, standards for security personnel, and emergency planning. EPACT05 required security exercises every three years, authorized firearms use by security personnel, and established federal security coordinators. The NRC approved regulations for nuclear reactor security, including fire mitigation and aircraft threat response. Decommissioning of nuclear power plants involves safely removing them from service and ensuring funds for cleanup. The Trojan and Maine Yankee plants were the first to be decommissioned in the US. The decommissioning costs of various nuclear power plants in the US ranged from $429 million to $4.1 billion. NRC approval was granted for the cleanup of several decommissioned reactor sites, with specific cost estimates provided. Owners must notify NRC within 30 days of permanent shutdown, and certification is required for spent fuel removal. After nuclear reactors are shut down, the licensee must submit a Post Shutdown Decommissioning Activities Report (PSDAR) within two years. The report specifies either DECON, where plant and equipment are dismantled or decontaminated, or SAFSTOR, where the plant is placed in a safe condition for future dismantlement. Currently, nine reactors are in SAFSTOR and four are in DECON. Spent nuclear fuel remains stored at plant sites after decommissioning. The DOE noted that until spent nuclear fuel is removed from closed nuclear power plants and Vermont Yankee, the sites cannot be fully decommissioned. Concerns have increased due to the termination of the Yucca Mountain repository project. The Price-Anderson Act addresses liability for damages from nuclear incidents, with EPACT05 extending coverage for new reactors and DOE contracts until 2025. The Price-Anderson Act requires owners of commercial reactors to assume liability for nuclear damages, with a maximum insurance coverage of $375 million per reactor. Damages exceeding this amount are shared among all reactors, with retrospective premiums capped at $121.3 million per reactor. The Price-Anderson Act requires reactor owners to pay annual premiums of up to $19.0 million per reactor to limit financial burden after a major accident. Currently, 104 commercial reactors are covered by this requirement, with a total compensation of up to $13.6 billion for each nuclear incident. This includes retrospective premiums totaling $12.6 billion, insurance coverage of $375 million per reactor, and a possible 5% surcharge. The nuclear industry's liability for an incident is capped at $13.6 billion under Price-Anderson. EPACT05 increased the per-reactor annual payment limit to $15 million from $10 million, with adjustments for inflation every five years. A nuclear plant with multiple small reactors would be treated as a single reactor for payment limits. In the event of a severe release, a power plant with six 120-megawatt small modular reactors could be liable for retrospective premiums of up to $121.3 billion. The Price-Anderson Act covers liability for small modular reactors, with retrospective premiums capped at $121.3 million. EPACT05 increased the liability limit for DOE contractors to $11.961 billion per accident. DOE can indemnify contractors for their liability, with payments ultimately coming from the Treasury. The Price-Anderson Act limits liability for nuclear accidents, with DOE able to fine contractors for safety violations. Supporters argue it ensures compensation for victims at little cost to taxpayers, while opponents claim it subsidizes the nuclear power industry. Extension of the act is seen as necessary for new nuclear reactor construction in the US. The Price-Anderson Act limits liability for nuclear accidents, with DOE able to fine contractors for safety violations. Projections of damages exceeding liability limits have prompted calls for reexamination of the law. The U.S. government supports an international liability system for nuclear equipment suppliers. The Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage requires implementing legislation from at least five countries with specified nuclear capacity levels. Canada signed the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage on December 3, 2013, and is set to ratify it, which would put the convention into force 90 days later. The CSC would not change the liability and payment levels established by the Price-Anderson Act. Each party must establish a nuclear damage compensation system within its borders, with a supplemental tier for damages not covered by national systems. The CSC requires a supplemental tier of damage compensation to be paid by all parties, with the U.S. contribution to be paid by suppliers of nuclear equipment and services. Supporters believe it will benefit U.S. exporters of nuclear technology by establishing a predictable liability system. Incentives for building new nuclear power plants were included in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 includes incentives for building new nuclear power plants, such as production tax credits, loan guarantees, and insurance against regulatory delays. However, low natural gas prices and high nuclear plant construction costs have reduced the likelihood of new reactors being built without federal support. Critics argue that federal support for nuclear power is a bailout and should instead focus on renewable energy and energy efficiency. Numerous bills have been introduced to strengthen or add to the EPACT05 incentives. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 offers tax credits for new nuclear capacity, but critics argue federal support should prioritize renewable energy and energy efficiency. The Treasury Department's guidance allocates the tax credit among reactors with license applications by 2008, with a cap of 6,000 megawatts. License applications for over 34,000 megawatts were submitted by 2008. The Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) has urged Congress to remove the 6,000 megawatt capacity limit for the production tax credit, index it for inflation, and extend the deadline for plants to begin operation to the start of 2025. NEI also proposed a 30% investment tax credit for new nuclear construction. Licensing delays have been a significant issue for past nuclear reactor construction. EPACT05 authorizes the Secretary of Energy to provide \"standby support\" to help pay for regulatory delays at new commercial nuclear reactors. DOE payments could cover delay-related costs up to $500 million for the first two reactors and $250 million for the next four reactors. Project sponsors must pay the \"subsidy cost\" of the program. Delays due to non-compliance with laws or regulations are not covered. DOE published final regulations for the program on August 11, 2006. The program established under EPACT05 provides federal loan guarantees for advanced energy projects, including new nuclear power plants, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These loan guarantees cover up to 80% of construction costs and reduce lenders' risk, enabling financing at low interest rates. Title XVII loan guarantees are crucial for the nuclear industry to secure funding for new reactors. The federal loan guarantees under EPACT05 are essential for the nuclear industry to secure financing for new reactors. The authorized ceiling for nuclear power plant loan guarantees is $18.5 billion, with agreements signed for the Vogtle nuclear plant in Georgia totaling $6.5 billion. Southern Company and Oglethorpe Power Corporation received $3.46 billion and $3.06 billion, respectively, with an additional $1.8 billion pending for the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia. Southern Company estimates that the Vogtle loan guarantees could reduce its financing costs by up to $250 million. The Title XVII program requires subsidy cost payments for loan guarantees to cover future government costs from defaults. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that these payments will be too low by at least 1%. The Title XVII program requires subsidy cost payments for loan guarantees to cover future government costs from defaults. Appropriations bills adjust loan guarantee authorizations by 1% of the loan guarantee ceiling. Guaranteed loans for the new Vogtle reactors will be issued by the U.S. Treasury's Federal Financing Bank, with no subsidy cost charged despite concerns about project risk. Methodology for estimating credit subsidy costs includes loan value, term, credit risk, interest rates, and Treasury rates. The credit subsidy cost calculations for the Vogtle project loans have not been disclosed, but factors such as default rates and recovery rates likely led to the zero subsidy fee assessment. The default subsidy accounts for expected government losses from defaults, while strong financial conditions of borrowers and cost pass-through to Georgia Power may have contributed to low default rates and high recovery rates. The Vogtle project loans have low default risk due to strong financial conditions of borrowers and cost pass-through to Georgia Power. Interest rates range from 3.5% to 3.9%, potentially offsetting any default-related losses to the government. The nuclear industry argues that historical data shows minimal defaults. The nuclear industry argues that historical data shows minimal defaults, but critics warn of potential delays and cost overruns leading to higher subsidy costs. Constellation Energy withdrew from loan guarantee negotiations for Calvert Cliffs 3 due to concerns over the Office of Management and Budget's methodology estimating a high subsidy cost of 11.6%. Constellation Energy withdrew from loan guarantee negotiations for Calvert Cliffs 3 due to concerns over the Office of Management and Budget's methodology estimating a high subsidy cost of 11.6%, or about $880 million. The subsidy cost was deemed excessive and not in line with industry assessments, with the default risk for a merchant plant like Calvert Cliffs considered higher than a rate-regulated plant like Vogtle. Merchant plants charge market rates for power, potentially earning higher profits but facing the risk of being unable to cover debt payments if costs are higher than expected or market rates drop. DOE issued a solicitation for up to $20.5 billion. DOE issued a solicitation for up to $20.5 billion in nuclear power and uranium enrichment plant loan guarantees in 2008. 10 nuclear power projects and two uranium enrichment projects applied for loan guarantees totaling $93.2 billion and $4.8 billion respectively, exceeding the available amount. DOE informed USEC Inc. in 2009 that further testing was needed for its technology before a loan guarantee could be issued. In 2010, DOE reprogrammed $2 billion towards uranium enrichment, increasing the total to $4 billion, potentially allowing guarantees for both USEC and Areva. The French firm Areva received a $2 billion conditional loan guarantee from DOE for a proposed uranium enrichment plant in Idaho. DOE offered up to $300 million to help build a demonstration of centrifuge technology for USEC's new enrichment plant. Additional funding was provided through appropriations acts for the USEC demonstration program. DOE also provided assistance to USEC by supplying depleted uranium stockpiles for reenrichment at their plant in Paducah, KY. DOE assisted USEC by acquiring low-enriched uranium in exchange for taking responsibility for depleted uranium tails, freeing up funds for USEC's centrifuge project. Despite DOE's help, USEC filed for bankruptcy in 2014. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved USEC's reorganization plan, renaming the company Centrus Energy Corporation. DOE's Oak Ridge National Laboratory took over management of USEC's centrifuge demonstration project in 2014. The Department of Energy (DOE) took over management of USEC's centrifuge demonstration project in April 2014, with USEC becoming a subcontractor. DOE issued a draft solicitation for $12.6 billion in nuclear loan guarantees in September 2014 for new nuclear reactors, upgrades, and nuclear fuel facilities. Nuclear power supporters cite global climate change as a reason to develop new reactors due to low carbon dioxide emissions. This \"green\" nuclear power argument is gaining attention in think tanks and academia. The Obama Administration includes nuclear power in its clean energy strategy due to climate change concerns from greenhouse gas emissions. However, some environmental groups argue that nuclear power's greenhouse gas benefits are modest compared to safety risks, proliferation potential, and radioactive waste hazards. They suggest investing in energy efficiency and renewable energy instead. Proposals to reduce carbon dioxide emissions could increase nuclear power's competitiveness. A federal Clean Energy Standard proposed by President Obama in 2011 could boost nuclear energy expansion. Utilities pursuing new reactors often cite federal greenhouse gas controls as a reason. The EPA's proposed rule in 2014 addresses CO2 emissions from power plants, impacting nuclear power. States may receive incentives to keep existing nuclear plants operating under the proposed rule. The EPA's proposed rule allows states to create their own plans to meet CO2 emission goals, potentially affecting nuclear energy. State-specific emission goals for 2030 aim to reduce CO2 emissions from power plants by 30% compared to 2005 levels. EPA used 2012 CO2 emissions data to establish baseline rates, with Ohio's fossil plant rate at 1,897 lbs./MWh in 2012. The EPA's 2030 standard aims to reduce CO2 emissions from power plants by 30% compared to 2005 levels. States can achieve this through four building blocks: increasing efficiency of coal-fired units, replacing coal generation with natural gas, preserving nuclear capacity, and implementing energy efficiency measures. The nuclear adjustment involves calculating projected electricity generation from reactors under construction and existing nuclear capacity at risk of shutdown. The EPA's 2030 standard aims to reduce CO2 emissions from power plants by 30% compared to 2005 levels. States can achieve this through four building blocks: increasing efficiency of coal-fired units, replacing coal generation with natural gas, preserving nuclear capacity, and implementing energy efficiency measures. In the Ohio example, the state has two operating nuclear reactors with a total generating capacity of 2,150 megawatts. EPA added the projected electricity generation from these reactors to the total generation from fossil fuel sources, renewable energy sources, and electricity generation avoided through efficiency measures. This results in a proposed 2030 standard for Ohio of 1,338 lbs. of CO2 per MWh\u2014a 29.5% reduction from the unadjusted baseline. The EPA's proposal allows states flexibility in meeting CO2 emission standards, with options such as efficiency, renewable energy, nuclear power, and new gas generation. States are not required to use the same methods as EPA's building blocks. The impact on nuclear power is uncertain, but the methodology may encourage completion of existing nuclear plants and the construction of additional reactors. The EPA's proposal allows states flexibility in meeting CO2 emission standards, with options such as efficiency, renewable energy, nuclear power, and new gas generation. States are not required to use the same methods as EPA's building blocks. The Nuclear Energy Institute praised the EPA proposal for recognizing the need to maintain and expand nuclear energy. However, industry officials are concerned that only 6% of existing nuclear capacity is included in the \"building block,\" potentially leaving out at-risk plants. The industry is concerned that including only 6% of existing nuclear capacity in state goal calculations may not prevent nuclear plants from being replaced by cheaper gas plants. If all of Ohio's nuclear electricity were included in the calculation, a significant amount of carbon-free generation would need to be replaced if the reactors shut down. The Obama Administration's FY2015 funding request for nuclear energy research and development totaled $863.4 million, with goals to improve safety, reliability, and economics of nuclear power plants, develop waste management technologies, and minimize proliferation risks. The FY2015 budget request for nuclear energy research includes a major initiative called Supercritical Transformational Electric Power Generation (STEP) to commercialize the Brayton cycle for power plants. This initiative aims to improve efficiency by using supercritical gas to drive electric generators, reaching up to 50% efficiency compared to 33% for steam-cycle plants. The program plans to develop a 10 megawatt Brayton cycle pilot plant with a 50-50 cost-sharing agreement with the private sector. Funding for STEP totals $27.5 million within the nuclear energy budget. Funding for the STEP initiative in the nuclear energy budget would total $27.5 million in FY2015. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $899.0 million for nuclear energy, $35.6 million above the Administration request. An amendment on the House floor reduced the nuclear total by $73.3 million to provide more funding for the Corps of Engineers. The Senate subcommittee draft report recommended $777.0 million for nuclear energy programs, $86.4 million below the request. The draft rejected the Administration's request for small modular reactor licensing support and cut reactor concepts R&D funding by 45%. The House Appropriations Committee report agreed with the Administration's $27.5 million request for the STEP initiative. The DOE was authorized to modify the cost-sharing goal for pilot plants under the STEP initiative. The Reactor Concepts program area focuses on advanced reactors, including small modular reactors, and enhancing the sustainability of existing light water reactors. The FY2015 funding request for this program was $100.5 million, with a proposed consolidation of the Small Modular Reactor R&D and Advanced Reactor Concepts subprograms into the Advanced Reactor Technologies subprogram. Funding for the combined subprogram would be $70.2 million, classified as \"Generation IV\" reactors. The Advanced Reactor Technology subprogram, classified as \"Generation IV\" reactors, focuses on fast reactors, fluoride salt-cooled high-temperature reactors, and high temperature gas-cooled reactors. International collaboration continues under the Generation IV International Forum (GIF). The House Appropriations Committee recommended $138.0 million for Reactor Concepts, $37.5 million more than the request and $25.0 million above FY2014. The committee agreed to consolidate Advanced SMR research with Advanced Reactor Concepts, boosting funding for the Advanced Reactor Concepts subprogram to $101.0 million, including funding for high temperature gas reactor research. The House panel recommended $35.0 million for the Light Water Reactor Sustainability subprogram, which conducts research on extending the life of existing commercial light water reactors beyond 60 years. The program also studies the aging of reactor materials, analyzes safety margins of aging plants, and researches prevention and mitigation measures related to the Fukushima disaster. The draft Senate bill would cut reactor concepts funding to $55.0 million. The draft Senate bill would cut reactor concepts funding to $55.0 million, focusing on Advanced Reactor Technologies and Light Water Reactor Sustainability. Interest in small modular reactors (SMRs) is growing due to rising costs of large conventional nuclear reactors. SMRs range from 40 to 300 megawatts and would be installed together to form a power block with a single control room. DOE requested $97.0 million for FY2015 to provide technical support for licensing small modular reactors, using various technologies including high-temperature gas and light water technology. A consortium led by Babcock & Wilcox (B&W) was the first award recipient under the program, but B&W announced a reduction in spending and delay in design certification application to NRC due to a lack of investors and customer contracts. The DOE selected NuScale Power's SMR with a 45-megawatt capacity for assistance in December 2013. The NuScale SMR aims to have up to 12 reactors in a single water pool for emergency cooling, targeting commercial operation by 2025. Funding uncertainty led to the House Appropriations Committee allocating $54.5 million to the SMR program, prioritizing NuScale over B&W's project. The Senate draft report recommended no new funding for SMR licensing support, citing the availability of $85.0 million in prior-year funds that could be reprogrammed for the NuScale project. Small modular reactors would go against the trend in nuclear power technology towards larger reactors, with proponents arguing for their economic viability due to factory assembly and simpler safety systems. The Fuel Cycle Research and Development Program conducts research on technologies for managing spent nuclear fuel, with a funding request of $189.1 million for FY2015. The program aims to separate radioactive constituents of spent fuel for re-use or stable waste forms. The Administration requested a $79.0 million budget for the Used Nuclear Fuel R&D subprogram in FY2015, focusing on establishing a new spent fuel management system. The DOE proposed to terminate the waste repository program at Yucca Mountain, NV and implement a consent-based siting process for nuclear storage. They also requested mandatory appropriations for spent fuel management starting in FY2018. Other research areas include accident-tolerant fuels, fuel cycle options, and technologies to prevent nuclear material diversion. The House Appropriations Committee recommended funding for fuel cycle R&D, accident-tolerant fuels research, and used nuclear fuel disposition. The Senate draft report suggested funding for fuel cycle R&D, including used nuclear fuel disposition and developing a consolidated spent fuel storage facility through a consent-based siting process. The draft report recommended $60.1 million for accident-tolerant fuels and addressed the disposal of radioactive waste from nuclear power plants. Each reactor produces 20 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel annually, totaling 2,000 metric tons nationwide. Additionally, reactors generate 75,000 cubic meters of low-level radioactive waste per year. The federal government is responsible for permanent disposal of commercial spent fuel and federally generated radioactive waste. States have the authority to develop disposal facilities for most commercial low-level waste. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act designates Yucca Mountain in Nevada as the national repository for highly radioactive waste. The DOE missed the 1998 deadline to begin taking waste from nuclear plant sites, and the Obama Administration has decided that developing the Yucca Mountain repository is not feasible. The DOE FY2011 budget justification states that the nation needs a new solution for nuclear waste disposal. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended a \"consent based\" approach for developing nuclear waste facilities, with a new organization having access to the Nuclear Waste Fund. DOE released a strategy in January 2013 in response to the Commission's report. The DOE released a strategy in January 2013 in response to the Blue Ribbon Commission report, calling for a pilot interim storage facility for spent fuel by 2021, a larger storage facility by 2025, and a permanent waste repository by 2048. The new waste management organization will select storage and disposal sites through a consent-based process. The DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy is responsible for civilian waste management activities and has funding for the Used Nuclear Fuel Disposition subprogram to implement the strategy. In FY2015, the House Appropriations Committee criticized the termination of the Yucca Mountain project by the Obama Administration. The House passed a bill with funding for DOE and NRC for Yucca Mountain licensing activities, but no funding for DOE's alternative nuclear waste management strategy. The Senate Appropriations subcommittee recommended funding for Used Fuel in FY2015 without mentioning Yucca Mountain, proposing a pilot program for high-level radioactive waste storage facilities with consent from state, local, and tribal governments. Senator Wyden, along with other senators, introduced legislation to redirect the nuclear waste program and establish an independent Nuclear Waste Administration for developing storage and disposal facilities with consent from state, local, and tribal governments. Fee collection would stop after 2025 if no waste facility is opened. The Energy and Natural Resources Committee held a hearing on the bill in July 2013. The DOE filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain repository application in 2010, but the NRC rejected it citing NWPA requirements. The NRC Commission deadlocked on the issue in 2011, preventing the withdrawal. Funding for Yucca Mountain licensing was not provided in FY2012-FY2015, but a court ruling in 2013 mandated NRC to continue work on the application if funding is available. The Court determined that NRC had $11.1 million in previously appropriated funds for waste disposal. NWPA required DOE to start taking waste by January 31, 1998. Utilities have won court decisions upholding DOE's obligation to meet deadlines and compensate for damages. DOE estimates liability payments could exceed $20 billion if waste removal begins by 2020. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) of 1982 led to a court ruling that stopped DOE from collecting nuclear waste fees, resulting in a loss of $750 million in revenues for the waste disposal program. The U.S. Court of Appeals found DOE's waste plans too vague to estimate costs, leading to the fee collection halt. NRC issued a final rule on storage of spent nuclear fuel in response to a court decision that struck down NRC's Waste Confidence Decision. The court ruled that the Waste Confidence Decision required an environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act and that NRC needed to consider the possibility that a permanent waste repository would never be built. NRC ended its licensing suspension after approving the continued storage rule to replace the Waste Confidence Decision. The interest in nuclear power worldwide has raised concerns about nuclear weapons proliferation, as the technology for nuclear fuel can also be used for weapons. The IAEA safeguards program aims to prevent civilian nuclear facilities from being used for weapons, but not all potential proliferators are part of the system. Proposals have been made to provide nations without fuel cycle facilities with nuclear fuel in exchange for commitments to forgo enrichment and reprocessing. The Bush Administration's Global Nuclear Energy Partnership, now known as the International Framework for Nuclear Energy Cooperation, aimed to prevent the misuse of commercial uranium enrichment and reprocessing technologies for military purposes. Pakistani scientist A.Q. Khan sold sensitive technology related to uranium enrichment to countries like Libya, Iran, and North Korea. Pakistan, outside the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, denies involvement in Khan's activities. Iran received Pakistani enrichment technology, leading to IAEA's declaration of Iran's noncompliance with safeguards agreements in 2005. Iran's noncompliance with safeguards agreements led to referral to the U.N. Security Council in 2006. Despite calls to halt enrichment, Iran continues developing capabilities at Natanz and Qom. International talks are ongoing regarding Iran's nuclear program and the challenge of restricting access to sensitive fuel cycle activities. Leaders of the international nuclear nonproliferation regime are proposing ways to control the spread of dual-use technology, such as incentives to discourage uranium enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing. The international community is evaluating these proposals while also discussing improvements to the IAEA safeguards system to detect nuclear material diversion for weapons programs. Funding for DOE nuclear energy programs and NRC is summarized in the following tables based on Administration budget requests and committee reports. The House and Senate have passed bills for FY2015 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Acts, funding DOE and NRC. A continuing resolution is providing funding until full-year appropriations are enacted. The Energy Freedom and Economic Prosperity Act terminates nuclear energy production tax credit. The Nuclear Disaster Preparedness Act requires the President to issue guidance for federal response to nuclear disasters. The No More Excuses Energy Act of 2013 prohibits NRC from considering nuclear waste storage when licensing new nuclear facilities and establishes a tax credit for obtaining nuclear component manufacturing certification. The Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2014 provides funding for DOE nuclear programs and NRC. House and Senate bills for FY2015 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Acts have been passed, funding DOE and NRC. The Nuclear Power Licensing Reform Act of 2013 introduced evacuation planning requirements within 50 miles of U.S. nuclear power plants and subjected reactor license renewals to the same standards as new reactors. The Dry Cask Storage Act mandated the transfer of spent fuel from pools to dry casks at nuclear power plants, with costs offset by a reduction in nuclear waste fees owed to the government. The curr_chunk discusses bills introduced in 2013 and 2014 related to nuclear energy, including congressional approval for nuclear cooperation agreements, repealing nuclear production tax credit, establishing a Green Bank for clean energy financing, and setting guidelines for licensing advanced nuclear plants. The curr_chunk discusses bills introduced in 2014 related to nuclear energy, including authorizing DOE research programs, providing appropriations for DOE nuclear programs, and establishing a Carbon Free Technology and Nuclear Energy Reserve. The curr_chunk discusses bills introduced in 2014 related to nuclear energy, including consolidating nuclear energy programs under a new Department of Energy and the Environment, establishing an independent Nuclear Waste Administration for developing storage and disposal facilities, and halting fee collection after 2025 if a waste facility had not been opened. The curr_chunk discusses bills introduced in 2014 related to nuclear energy, including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Reorganization Plan Codification and Complements Act, the Safe and Secure Decommissioning Act of 2014, and the Dry Cask Storage Act of 2014. These bills address various aspects of nuclear reactor decommissioning, emergency preparedness, and storage of spent nuclear fuel. The Dry Cask Storage Act of 2104 requires nuclear reactors to transfer spent fuel from pools to dry casks within seven years. Emergency planning zones must be expanded to 50 miles for reactors not complying. The Nuclear Plant Decommissioning Act of 2014 involves consultation with state and local governments during decommissioning. Introduced in May 2014. Senate bill introduced on May 13, 2014, referred to Committee on Environment and Public Works. House bill introduced on May 15, 2014, referred to Committee on Energy and Commerce."
