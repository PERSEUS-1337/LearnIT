He adopted militant Islamist views while studying at King Abdul Aziz University in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia under key ideologues of the Muslim Brotherhood. Bin Laden joined the jihad against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in 1979, ultimately leading to the formation of Al Qaeda. Osama bin Laden joined the Afghan mujahedin after the Soviet invasion in 1979, using personal funds to support and recruit volunteers for the war. He, along with Azzam, established the Maktab al-Khidamat network for fundraising and recruitment, considered the precursor to Al Qaeda. Bin Laden also participated in battles against the Soviets, including a notable assault in 1987. During the Afghan-Soviet war, Osama bin Laden was exposed to a chemical attack and injured in a 1987 battle. U.S. officials did not intervene in the recruitment of foreign volunteers, who were seen as positive contributors. The U.S. covertly financed and armed Afghan mujahedin factions, leading to the Soviet Union's withdrawal from Afghanistan. Bin Laden, Azzam, and Abd were not directly supported by the United States. During the Afghan-Soviet war, bin Laden, Azzam, and Abd al-Rahman did not openly plan attacks against the U.S. They organized an Islamist volunteer network, with bin Laden envisioning Al Qaeda as a rapid reaction force. Azzam wanted it to intervene where Muslims were threatened. The network had 10,000-20,000 members, not all involved in terrorism. Bin Laden disagreed with Azzam's approach and wanted to send Al Qaeda activists back to their home countries to overthrow secular Arab leaders. This difference in strategy was influenced by Egyptians in bin Laden's inner circle, like Abd al-Rahman and Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri. Azzam was later assassinated in 1989, leading to speculation that bin Laden may have been involved in the killing to resolve a power struggle. After Azzam's death, bin Laden gained control of the Maktab's funds and organizational mechanisms. Abd al-Rahman was convicted in 1995 for terrorist plots related to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Zawahiri remains bin Laden's main strategist. Bin Laden turned against the U.S. after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. He lobbied against U.S. combat troops in Saudi Arabia, proposing a \"mujahedin\" army to oust Iraq from Kuwait. After Azzam's death, bin Laden gained control of the Maktab's funds and organizational mechanisms. He turned against the U.S. after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, proposing a \"mujahedin\" army to oust Iraq from Kuwait. His idea was rejected by the Saudi leadership, leading to a falling out with the royal family. Bin Laden then relocated to Sudan in 1991, where he hosted and trained Al Qaeda militants for operations against the United States and its interests. Bin Laden funded Islamist dissidents in London and helped the Taliban gain control of Afghanistan. He believed in ousting the United States to bring Islamic regimes to power. Al Qaeda became a global threat, leading to the September 11, 2001 attacks. Al Qaeda, a coalition of radical Islamic groups, operated globally and was responsible for various attacks against the United States. This included bombings in Yemen and the World Trade Center, as well as arming factions in Somalia. Al Qaeda was linked to attacks in Somalia, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia, and the Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia. The group was implicated in the arming of factions in Somalia and the bombing of a U.S. military facility in Riyadh, resulting in American casualties. In August 1998, Al Qaeda was allegedly responsible for bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing about 300 people. The United States launched a cruise missile strike against bin Laden's training camps in Afghanistan, narrowly missing him. In December 1999, thwarted Al Qaeda plots against religious sites in Jordan and Los Angeles airport were prevented. In October 2000, the U.S.S. Cole was attacked by Al Qaeda activists in Yemen, resulting in 17 sailor deaths. The Clinton Administration began pressuring the Taliban regime in Afghanistan after the 1998 embassy bombings. In response to Al Qaeda attacks, the United States launched missile strikes against a camp in an attempt to hit bin Laden. President Clinton imposed a trade ban with Taliban-controlled Afghanistan and froze Taliban assets. U.N. Resolution 1333 banned arms shipments to the Taliban. Covert operations against bin Laden were pursued in 1999-2000. The Bush Administration considered arming anti-Taliban groups. The September 11 attacks intensified the U.S. effort against Al Qaeda, utilizing all aspects of national power. The U.S. military effort in Afghanistan post-September 11 led to the ousting of the Taliban regime and the installation of a pro-U.S. government. Despite 18,000 U.S. troops remaining in the region, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri are believed to have escaped to Pakistan. The CIA and U.S. personnel are dedicated to locating them in remote areas of Pakistan. In March 2004, Pakistan deployed 70,000 troops against suspected Al Qaeda hiding places in South Waziristan but failed to find major figures. Current military operations focus on North Waziristan. Bin Laden's whereabouts are uncertain, with some experts speculating he may be in settled areas or a large Pakistani city. The CIA believes they have an \"excellent idea\" of where bin Laden is, but exact location remains unknown. Many top Al Qaeda operatives captured or killed since September 11 have been found in urban areas, including key leaders like Mohammad Atef, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, Abu Zubaydah, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, and Abu Faraj al-Libbi. Al Libbi's importance to recent Al Qaeda plotting is questioned, while other senior leaders have been located outside Pakistan or Afghanistan. Hanbali, a key operative of Al Qaeda-affiliate Jemaah Islamiyah, was arrested in Thailand. Abdul Ali al-Harithi, a key plotter, was killed by a U.S. Predator strike in Yemen. Since September 11, about 3,000 suspected Al Qaeda members have been detained or arrested by 90 countries, with 650 under U.S. control. Some senior figures like Al Qaeda spokesman Suleiman Abu Ghaith, operations planner Sayf al-Adl, and bin Laden's son Saad are believed to be in Iran. Iran has acknowledged holding senior Al Qaeda figures but has refused to transfer them for interrogation and trial. The three senior figures are suspected of planning the 2003 suicide attacks in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, indicating possible contact with Al Qaeda outside Iran. There are differing views on the importance of capturing bin Laden and Zawahiri, with some believing their capture would greatly weaken Al Qaeda, while others argue that the organization is less central to the current terrorist threat faced by the United States. The State Department report on terrorism for 2004 highlights that while the core of al-Qa'ida has been damaged, its ideology has spread to other groups globally. This evolution has led to affiliated or independent groups posing the greatest threat of terrorist attacks against the US and its allies. The weakening central direction of Al Qaeda makes it less capable of orchestrating catastrophic attacks like 9/11 within the US. The Bush Administration believes that the absence of attacks in the US since 9/11 shows their policy success. However, autonomous Al Qaeda affiliates could pose a significant threat due to their ability to adapt attacks locally. Younger Al Qaeda members are emerging as key planners, viewing the group as inspiration rather than a structured organization. Experts suggest countering Al Qaeda's ideology through enhanced public diplomacy efforts. Some experts suggest countering Al Qaeda's tactics by engaging moderate Islamic clerics and enhancing U.S. public diplomacy. Al Qaeda's global reach is attributed to its diverse coalition of groups, making it difficult to predict threats. The involvement of known leaders like bin Laden and Zawahiri in these groups' operations is often unclear. Major groups associated with Al Qaeda before and after September 11 include the Islamic Group. Some groups still associated with Al Qaeda today include the Islamic Group and Al Jihad (Egypt), the Armed Islamic Group and the Salafist Group for Call and Combat (Algeria), the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, Jemaah Islamiyah (Indonesia), the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, Kashmiri militant groups based in Pakistan, and Asbat al-Ansar (Lebanon). Other Al Qaeda affiliates have been established or identified since the September 11 attacks. One notable Al Qaeda affiliate is the Al Qaeda Jihad Organization in Mesopotamia, led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. The group consists of foreign volunteers fighting alongside Iraqi insurgents against U.S.-led and Iraqi forces. Zarqawi swore fealty to bin Laden in 2004. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, leader of the Al Qaeda Jihad Organization in Mesopotamia, formally pledged allegiance to bin Laden in 2004. He is believed to be recruiting Muslim fighters in Iraq for combat and potential terrorist operations in Western and Middle Eastern countries. The CIA assessment suggests that U.S. involvement in Iraq has strengthened groups linked to Al Qaeda, with Iraq serving as a training ground for militants to spread after the conflict. Zarqawi's connection to bin Laden indicates a possible effort to rebuild Al Qaeda. The remaining Al Qaeda leaders may be rebuilding the organizational structure before being ousted from Afghanistan in 2001. Various terrorist groups associated with Al Qaeda are trying to destabilize regimes in the region, such as the Islamic Army of Aden and Hizb-e-Islam/Gulbuddin. The Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group was responsible for a suicide bomb attack in Casablanca in 2003. The Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group carried out attacks in Casablanca in 2003, killing about 40 people. Another group, \"Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula,\" targeted the ruling Al Saud family in Saudi Arabia with attacks in 2004. Saudi security forces successfully captured or killed most of the group's leaders, including Abd al-Aziz al-Muqrin. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is not named as an FTO and is not analyzed separately in the 2004 State Department report on international terrorism. Some of the bombings in London in July 2005 might indicate a growing Al Qaeda presence in East Africa, with suspects of East African origin being arrested. Western intelligence agencies have long feared Al Qaeda recruiting or controlling cells of East Africans for operations in Europe or elsewhere. Al Qaeda was allegedly responsible for the bombing of an Israeli-owned hotel and firing shoulder-fired missiles at an Israeli target. The U.S. military is training African nations to prevent terrorist infiltration, particularly by Al Qaeda. There are possible links between the July 7 London bombers and those involved in the July 21 attacks in Mombasa, Kenya. The July 7 attacks were claimed by a group called \"The Secret.\" The responsibility for the July 7 attacks was claimed by a group called \"The Secret Organization of Al Qaeda in Europe,\" suggesting a possible link to Al Qaeda. Following the failed July 21 London attacks, suicide bombers in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt killed 88 people. An investigation is ongoing to determine any connections to Al Qaeda, radical Islamist groups in Egypt, or previous bombings in Taba, Egypt. Assessing the threat posed by Al Qaeda could inform strategies to combat it, with a focus on addressing regional conflicts, promoting democracy in the Arab world, and preventing terrorism financing and infiltration. Some recommend policies to focus on finding and combating Al Qaeda leaders, while others believe stabilizing Iraq is crucial to reducing militant recruitment. Assessing the Al Qaeda threat is challenging, and efforts abroad may only have partial success. Some suggest focusing on homeland security measures instead. Some suggest U.S. counter-efforts should prioritize homeland security, including improving airline and passenger train security, and enhancing security at U.S. ports. There are debates over granting additional powers to law enforcement to investigate potential Islamist cells, with concerns raised about civil liberties and profiling of Arab and Muslim Americans."
