    "content": "The 108th Congress established the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (FLREA) for federal land management agencies to charge fees at recreational lands and waters. The act allows for different types of fees, sets criteria for fees, and prohibits fees for certain activities. Revenue collected can be spent without further appropriation, with most funds staying at the collection site for specified purposes. An interagency pass is also authorized for use at federal recreation sites nationwide. The Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act established a new recreation fee program to charge fees at federal recreation sites. The program supersedes the Recreational Fee Demonstration Program and allows agencies to set fee levels, retain revenue collected, and spend it on site improvements. The program is set to terminate 10 years after enactment in 2014. The Fee Demo program generated revenue and had supporters and critics. Supporters believed it provided flexibility in setting fees, deterred criminal activity, and benefited direct beneficiaries. Critics argued it doubly taxed the public, resulted in unfair fees, promoted damaging commercial development, and discriminated against certain groups. Criticisms also included high fee collection costs and inconsistent implementation. The current recreation fee program is expected to continue. The current recreation fee program incentivizes agency managers to charge fees for onsite improvements. FLREA monies supplement agency appropriations, with an anticipated $265 million in fees collected in FY2011. While fees are a small portion of agency funding, they are crucial for making improvements at federal recreation sites. The Fee Demo program incentivizes agency managers to charge fees for improvements at federal recreation sites. Congress created the FLREA to address concerns with Fee Demo by simplifying fee structures, authorizing an interagency recreation pass, and allowing public input on fee locations and amounts. Key provisions include types of fees, use of fee receipts, public input on fees, and the authority for a national recreation pass. The FLREA aims to standardize recreation fees, reduce duplication, and involve the public in fee determination. It outlines where fees can be charged, differentiates fee types, and limits multiple fees. The law also specifies the level of services required for fee collection and enhances public participation in fee decisions. The FLREA aims to standardize recreation fees, reduce duplication, and involve the public in fee determination. It provides guidance on establishing entrance, standard amenity, expanded amenity, and special recreation permit fees. Entrance fees are charged for units managed by the NPS and FWS, while BLM, Reclamation, and FS may charge standard amenity fees in certain areas with specific services or facilities available. The FLREA allows for a variety of interpretive services, programs, and recreational opportunities in areas with federal investments. Fees can be efficiently collected for amenities like parking, toilets, trash receptacles, interpretive signs, picnic tables, and security services. Agencies can also charge an \"expanded amenity fee\" for specialized services. NPS and FWS may charge this fee for specific facilities or services, while BLM, Reclamation, and FS may charge it for developed campgrounds or swimming sites with specified services. The FLREA prohibits certain federal agencies from charging standard or expanded amenity fees for activities like parking, picnicking, and accessing dispersed areas without facilities. It also specifies places where entrance and standard fees may not be charged and exempts certain individuals and purposes from fees. The FLREA allows DOI and USDA Secretaries to charge special recreation permit fees for group activities, events, and motorized vehicles. Criteria are provided for establishing fair fees based on benefits and services, considering fees charged elsewhere. The Secretaries must minimize confusion and overlap by establishing a minimum number of fees and avoiding multiple fees for similar purposes. The FLREA allows DOI and USDA Secretaries to charge special recreation permit fees for various activities. The law mandates input from Recreation RACs for new fees and fee sites. Agencies can retain and spend revenue collected without further appropriation, with at least 80% to be used at the site of generation. Flexibility is provided to reduce this amount to 60% if collections exceed needs. Remaining funds can be used agency-wide as needed. The FLREA gives agencies discretion in using revenues for visitor benefits, including facility maintenance, interpretation services, habitat restoration, and law enforcement. Collections cannot be used for employee bonuses or certain monitoring activities. A maximum of 15% can be used for program administration. The Fee Demo program showed fees were mainly spent on maintenance and visitor services. The FLREA requires enforcement of fees, with penalties for nonpayment capped at $100 for first offense. Public participation is mandated in establishing fees, with Recreation RACs appointed to make recommendations. The Secretary must notify Congress of reasons for rejecting fee recommendations at least 30 days before implementing a decision. The FLREA mandates public participation in fee establishment through Recreation RACs, composed of 11 members representing various recreation user groups. The Secretaries may appoint members from nominations by governors and designated county officials, ensuring a balance of views. Recreation RACs may be established under other authorities if interest is insufficient. The Secretaries are required to notify Congress of fee decisions at least 30 days in advance. The Secretaries are mandated to post notices of fees in areas where fees are charged and in publications distributed in the area. Communication on fee spending aims to enhance public acceptance. Collaboration with federal and nonfederal entities is encouraged for greater convenience and efficiency. Contracts can be entered into for fee collection and emergency services. States entering agreements may share in revenue collected. A national pass for recreation at various sites managed by different agencies is authorized to facilitate recreation. The Secretaries are mandated to establish a national pass, \"America the Beautiful \u2013 the National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass,\" to cover entrance and amenity fees at various sites managed by different agencies. The pass will be valid for one year and may offer free or reduced-cost passes to certain individuals. Guidelines will be issued on administering the pass, including cost-sharing among agencies. Additionally, cooperative agreements can be made with governmental and nongovernmental entities for greater convenience and efficiency. The law allows for cooperative agreements with governmental and nongovernmental entities to develop and implement the pass program, including site-specific and regional multi-entity passes. These passes cover entrance or amenity fees for specific sites and are accepted by multiple agencies or entities. The Secretary establishes agreements on pass pricing, cost-sharing, and revenue sharing. Supporters believe the recreation fee program enhances visitor services and is necessary to supplement funding, retaining benefits from the former Fee Demo program. The current recreation fee program aims to keep fees on-site for visitor improvements and establish fair fees among agencies. Criteria ensure fees benefit the public, with more public involvement in fee site decisions. A national pass increases consistency, but concerns remain about fee simplification and experimentation. The current recreation fee program aims to simplify fees and ensure they benefit the public, but concerns exist about fee experimentation, maintenance backlog funding, overdevelopment of federal lands, and the difficulty of implementing a national pass. Critics also worry about the authority to reduce site funds, opposition to recreation fees in general, and resolutions passed by some counties and states against such fees. Some counties and states oppose recreation fees and seek to repeal the FLREA. A pending Senate bill, S. 868, would repeal the FLREA and establish entrance and use fees at national park units. Interagency policy guidance on FLREA is in a handbook issued in June 2006, with common definitions and policy guidelines. DOI and the FS issued guidelines for public involvement in establishing new fee areas and informing the public on fee revenue use. The BLM and FS use Recreation RACs to recommend changes to recreation fees on their lands. The agencies collaborate by utilizing existing BLM Resource Advisory Councils and new FS-chartered Recreation RACs. Forest Service Recreation RACs have 11 members representing various groups, while BLM Recreation RACs have 15 members representing commercial land uses. The BLM Recreation RACs have 15 members representing various interests, including commercial land uses, environmental organizations, elected officials, and the general public. RAC members provide perspectives on fee issues and can make fee recommendations to the Secretary if supported by a majority of members and documented public support. Agencies often reconsider fee proposals based on RAC input and seek additional public views on fee initiatives. The America the Beautiful pass was developed with input from RACs and a pricing analysis from a university. It was made available to the public in January 2007 for $80, with versions for volunteers, seniors, and persons with disabilities. The pass covers entrance fees and standard amenities for a 12-month period. The America the Beautiful Pass, available since January 2007 for $80, includes versions for volunteers, seniors (aged 62 or older), and persons with permanent disabilities. These passes cover entrance fees, standard amenity fees, and some discounts on expanded amenity fees. The pass allows admission for pass holders and passengers in a non-commercial vehicle, as well as up to four adults at sites with per person fees. Legislation has been proposed to offer the pass to veterans for $10 annually. The NPS administers the pass program for participating agencies. The participating agencies have developed standard procedures for selling and accepting America the Beautiful Passes, which cover identification requirements, pass validation, and use of third-party vendors. Passes can be obtained from various sources including recreation sites, the USGS online or by phone, and other associations. Revenue distribution from pass sales is currently managed by the collecting agency, with central revenues used for administrative costs and repaying startup costs, and additional revenue shared among the agencies in the future. The agencies have developed procedures for selling America the Beautiful Passes, with revenue split among them. Tracking pass use at remote sites is a challenge. Analysis was done on fee charging sites to comply with FLREA. NPS and FWS charge entrance fees, with some units also charging amenity fees. The agencies charge entrance and amenity fees at various sites to comply with FLREA. BLM and FWS manage multiple recreation sites, with some adding amenities like picnic tables. The FS made significant changes, dropping fees at some sites initially but now collecting fees at over 4,000 developed recreation sites, mostly campgrounds. The NPS, FWS, and BLM charge entrance and amenity fees at recreation sites under FLREA. NPS uses a standardized fee structure based on park designation. FWS charges daily entrance fees and seeks fee consistency within regions. BLM sets fees based on activities and market analysis. The BLM and FS set fees for recreation sites based on amenities and market rates. FS fees average $6 for day use and $9 for overnight use. The FS defines High-Impact Recreation Areas (HIRAs) as concentrated recreational areas with developed sites. Users find it more convenient to pay fees for HIRAs. The FS manages High-Impact Recreation Areas (HIRAs) where users pay fees for access. The agency is considering fee changes and developing new directives for these areas, with potential fee adjustments expected. Reclamation, on the other hand, charges fees under FLREA at only one site out of its 289 developed recreation sites. The majority of Reclamation's sites are managed by partner organizations and are not subject to FLREA fees. Reclamation manages 33 developed recreation sites, with only six meeting criteria to charge amenity fees under FLREA. The agency determined that it would not be cost-effective for five qualifying sites to participate in the program. In FY2009, the NPS and FS collected a total of $258.4 million in recreation receipts under the FLREA, with NPS generating the most revenue at $171.0 million. The average cost of collecting fees for the agencies decreased from 21% in FY2002 to 15% in FY2009 due to technological improvements and increased revenue. The cost to each agency varied considerably during FY2009, with the BLM at 2%, FS at 9%, FWS at 15%, and NPS at 19%. BLM's lower cost is due to technology use for fee collection. NPS has the highest cost due to smaller park units with complex logistics. Agencies have different project selection procedures funded by FLREA revenues, with NPS having a longer approval process involving local units, regions, and headquarters. The agencies have identified total recreation fees available for obligation in FY2009, with $222.6 million obligated for various purposes including operation, maintenance, and capital improvement projects. Of the obligations, $119.7 million (54% of total obligations) was for asset repairs and maintenance, which includes capital improvements, routine/annual maintenance, and deferred maintenance. Deferred maintenance, also known as the maintenance backlog, is maintenance that has been postponed for a future period. Congress and the Administration have focused on quantifying and reducing agency maintenance backlogs. In FY2009, $28.6 million was available for obligation by the BLM, with $16.7 million being obligated. The funds were allocated towards activities such as interpretation and visitor services, asset repairs and maintenance, law enforcement, and recreation. In FY2009, $10.1 million was available for obligation by the FWS, with $4.3 million being obligated. Of those obligations, $1.6 million was spent on asset repairs and maintenance. The FS had $94.8 million available for obligation, with $61.2 million in total expenditures. $23.6 million was used for facilities maintenance, $14.1 million for visitor services, and $11.4 million for fee management agreement and reservation services. In FY2009, a total of $574.4 million in recreation fees was available for obligation by four agencies. Of that amount, $304.8 million was obligated, with $149.3 million (49%) allocated for asset repairs and maintenance. This activity received the largest portion of total agency obligations in FY2009. The Triennial Report to Congress on the FLREA program provides data for FY2006-FY2008 for participating agencies. NPS and FWS projected spending on maintenance and visitor services from FY2009 to FY2013. NPS plans to allocate $1.04 billion over five years, with $425.0 million (41%) for deferred maintenance. DOI estimates NPS deferred maintenance for FY2009 between $8.23 billion and $12.11 billion. The NPS projects spending $1.04 billion over five years, with $425.0 million for deferred maintenance. Fifty-five percent of the total deferred maintenance is for roads, bridges, and trails, 19% for buildings, and 26% for other structures. The FWS anticipates spending $28.4 million over five years, with $12.1 million for visitor services and $5.4 million for deferred maintenance. DOI estimates NPS deferred maintenance for FY2009 at between $8.23 billion and $12.11 billion. The FWS plans to spend $28.4 million over five years, allocating funds for direct costs, non-deferred maintenance, administrative costs, and other purposes. There have been questions about the slow use of available funds, attributed to the need to carry over funds for future operations, insufficient staff, and time required for project implementation. In FY2009, over half of recreation revenues were obligated by the four agencies, marking a significant increase from previous years. Total funds available for obligation rose from $55.3 million in FY1997 to $574.4 million in FY2009, with $304.8 million being obligated. This left an unobligated balance of $269.6 million in FY2009, representing 47% of all available revenue. In FY2009, the four agencies obligated over half of recreation revenues, increasing from 46% in FY2008 to 53% in FY2009. NPS aimed to reduce its unobligated balance from $218.4 million in FY2009 to $150 million by September 30, 2010, and $80 million by January 1, 2011 through a comprehensive plan for fee projects. The NPS aims to reduce its unobligated balance to $150 million by September 30, 2010, and $80 million by January 1, 2011. Park units failing to meet the carryover standard will be penalized if their unobligated balance exceeds 35% of annual revenues. The agency is also expediting the use of 20% of recreation revenues, with funds to be allocated by December 31 each year. If not fully obligated by the following year, funds will be reallocated. The FWS has issued guidance to increase obligations to at least 50% for FY2010 and FY2011. The BLM obligated 58% of available FY2009 funds, while the FS had the highest obligation rate at 65%. The FWS aims to increase obligations to at least 50% for FY2010 and FY2011."
