    "content": "The \"Skills Connection Act\" is the short title of the Act. It establishes a searchable database. The \"Skills Connection Act\" mandates the creation of a database by the Secretary of Labor within 120 days. This database will include a registry of credentials, a skills database, and a jobs bank to prioritize programs leading to credentials. The registry will list credentials required by Federal or State law for specific occupations. The \"Skills Connection Act\" requires the Secretary of Labor to create a skills database listing required manufacturing sector skills and a registry of industry-recognized credentials aligned with these skills. The credentials must be nationally portable and regularly updated to reflect industry competencies. The Secretary must consult with the Manufacturing Institute or similar organization to list identifiable skills developed through service in the Armed Forces and align them with industry credentials in the registry. In creating a jobs bank, the Secretary must enable job seekers to enter basic information. The Secretary must consult with organizations to list skills from Armed Forces and align them with industry credentials in the registry. Job seekers can enter information in the jobs bank to match qualifications with available jobs and address skills shortages. The Workforce Investment Board of 1998 informs decisions on allocating resources for workforce development. The Act clarifies that selecting programs with specific credentials is not mandatory and does not endorse skills listed in the database. Funds are available annually from the Workforce Innovation Fund. The Workforce Innovation Fund, established under Public Law 112-10, covers provisions related to workforce development. Definitions include the Armed Forces and industry-recognized credentials sought by companies. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of nationally portable credentials endorsed by trade associations and accepted by companies across states. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Labor. Workforce investment activities are defined as per their meaning in the context. The curr_chunk defines \"investment activities\" as per the Workforce Investment Act of 1998."
