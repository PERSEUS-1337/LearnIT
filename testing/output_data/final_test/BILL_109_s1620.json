    "content": "The Act is titled the \"September 11 Family Humanitarian Relief and Patriotism Act\" and includes provisions for adjusting the status of certain nonimmigrant victims of terrorism. The \"September 11 Family Humanitarian Relief and Patriotism Act\" allows for the adjustment of status for eligible aliens to lawful permanent residence, provided they apply within 2 years of final regulations being implemented by the Secretary of Homeland Security. Certain grounds for inadmissibility do not apply in this process. The \"September 11 Family Humanitarian Relief and Patriotism Act\" allows eligible aliens to apply for adjustment of status to lawful permanent residence within 2 years of final regulations. Certain provisions exempt aliens from specific grounds of inadmissibility, and the Secretary of Homeland Security may grant waivers based on specified criteria. An alien present in the United States under an order of exclusion, deportation, removal, or voluntary departure may apply for adjustment of status under certain conditions without needing to file a separate motion to reopen, reconsider, or vacate the order. Aliens present in the US under an order of exclusion, deportation, removal, or voluntary departure may apply for adjustment of status without needing a separate motion. If the Secretary of Homeland Security grants the request, the order is canceled; if denied, the order remains effective. This applies to aliens lawfully present in the US as nonimmigrants on September 10, 2001. Aliens who were spouses, children, dependent sons, or dependent daughters of nonimmigrant aliens present in the US on September 11th, 2001, and who died as a result of a specified terrorist activity, are eligible for benefits from the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund. The Secretary of Homeland Security will establish a process for aliens with a final removal order to seek a stay based on filing an application. The Secretary of Homeland Security will not order the removal of an alien in removal proceedings if they have applied for adjustment of status, except if the application is denied. The alien can work in the US while the application is pending, and administrative review is available. The Secretary of Homeland Security provides applicants for adjustment of status with the right to administrative review, similar to applicants under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act or aliens in removal proceedings under section 240 of the same Act. SEC. 3. CANCELLATION OF REMOVAL FOR CERTAIN IMMIGRANT VICTIMS OF TERRORISM. Cancellation of removal for certain immigrant victims of terrorism is provided under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Secretary of Homeland Security can cancel removal and adjust the status of eligible aliens to lawful permanent residents if they apply for relief. Eligible aliens include spouses, children, dependent sons, or dependent daughters of individuals who died as a result of specified terrorist activities on September 10, 2001, and were beneficiaries of the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund of 2001. The Secretary of Homeland Security can provide a stay of removal and work authorization for aliens with a final removal order. Aliens applying for cancellation of removal can work in the US during the application process. Additionally, aliens can file motions to reopen removal proceedings, except for limitations based on aggravated felony convictions. Aliens eligible for cancellation of removal can file a motion to reopen removal proceedings within a designated time period set by the Secretary of Homeland Security. The filing period starts no later than 60 days after the enactment of the Act and lasts for up to 240 days. Exceptions to relief under the Act include aliens who are inadmissible or deportable under specific sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act, including those involved in terrorist activities or family members of such individuals. The Secretary of Homeland Security will use established standards to determine if death resulted from a specified terrorist activity. Definitions are provided in the Act. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. The term \"specified terrorist activity\" in this Act refers to any terrorist activity against the Government or people of the United States on September 11, 2001, as defined in the Immigration and Nationality Act."
