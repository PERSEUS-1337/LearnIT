    "content": "The U.S.-Japan alliance, established after World War II, allows for U.S. military presence in Asia with 50,000 troops stationed in Japan. The alliance has evolved from an asymmetric arrangement to a more equal partnership, with Japan having its own defense assets. The U.S.-Japan alliance has evolved from an asymmetric arrangement to a more equal partnership, with Japan having its own defense assets. The partnership faced challenges after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the terrorist attacks on the United States in September 2001, leading to adjustments in the alliance. The U.S.-Japan alliance faced political struggles in the late 2000s due to changes in U.S. policy towards North Korea and issues with base relocation in Okinawa. The Democratic Party of Japan hinted at a shift towards an Asia-centric policy, causing tension. Despite political turmoil in Tokyo from 2007 to 2012, Japan's commitment to the alliance was reinforced. The U.S.-Japan alliance reaffirmed its centrality, with a focus on defense cooperation through the revision of bilateral defense guidelines in 2015. Both countries face challenges such as fiscal constraints and community strain from hosting U.S. troops. Prime Minister Abe's efforts to enhance Japan's security capabilities face public opposition, as seen in massive protests against security legislation in 2015. The depth of opposition to Japan's security legislation in 2015 highlighted constraints on its military activities. Japan still imposes tighter restrictions on military force compared to other U.S. allies. Meanwhile, China's defense budget and military modernization have increased, challenging Japan's territorial rights. The U.S. shifted focus to the Asia-Pacific region as it withdrew from Middle East wars. The United States is focusing more on the Asia-Pacific region through trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The \"rebalance\" to the Pacific is seen as a response to China's rise, with the U.S.-Japan alliance playing a key role in shaping the environment for China. Congress is interested in the alliance due to strategic issues, including China's military expansion. The FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act expressed Congress's support for Japan's security reforms, reaffirming the U.S. commitment to defend territories under Japan's administration. Concerns from Members of Congress focus on the costs of the alliance, particularly the realignment of marines from Okinawa to Guam. Prime Minister Abe's defense reform efforts align with the Obama Administration's goal of upgrading bilateral alliances in the Asia-Pacific region. Abe has shown a willingness to make changes to Japan's security posture, sometimes at political risk. Prime Minister Abe has pushed for changes to Japan's security posture, with the support of the U.S. government. Despite facing political risks, Abe has been able to advance his agenda of strengthening the Japanese military. He has made incremental progress in adopting more robust security practices, such as allowing for collective self-defense and increasing the defense budget. Abe's efforts align with the Obama Administration's goal of enhancing bilateral alliances in the Asia-Pacific region. Prime Minister Abe has made significant changes to Japan's security posture, including increasing the defense budget, relaxing restrictions on arms exports, and establishing a National Security Council. These initiatives have energized the U.S.-Japan alliance, leading to the revision of bilateral defense guidelines in 2015. Abe's efforts align with the Obama Administration's goal of strengthening alliances in the Asia-Pacific region. The U.S.-Japan alliance has evolved towards a more balanced security partnership in the 21st century, with Japan's Self-Defense Forces actively participating in overseas missions. Japanese military contributions, such as counter-piracy patrols, complement U.S. forces and relieve some of their security burdens. The co-location of U.S. and Japanese command facilities further enhances their cooperation. The U.S. and Japan have enhanced bilateral cooperation in various aspects of their alliance, including ballistic missile defense, cybersecurity, and military use of space. Japan is gradually lifting restrictions on military force usage, allowing for increased joint operations with the U.S. The two countries also agreed to maintain Japan's financial support for hosting U.S. forces at around $2 billion per year. Japan's potential participation in collective self-defense under the Abe Administration has been a significant and controversial security reform. Prime Minister Abe has been determined to adjust legal barriers preventing Japan from defending U.S. forces or territory under attack. In 2014, a new interpretation on collective self-defense was announced by the Abe Cabinet. In July 2014, the Abe Cabinet announced a new interpretation allowing Japan to engage in collective self-defense under certain conditions. This decision permits Japan to defend a closely related foreign country under attack if it threatens Japan's survival and there are no other means available, with force limited to the minimum necessary. These conditions, developed in consultation with the LDP's coalition partner Komeito, are restrictive and could limit Japan's military response to crises abroad. The security legislation package passed in September 2015 allows Japan to engage in more cooperative security activities, such as defending U.S. Navy vessels and conducting logistical support operations for U.S. troops. Prime Minister Abe ruled out Japan's participation in a military campaign against the Islamic State in January 2016. The United States and Japan are adjusting their war plans to account for collective self-defense and expanding the scope for SDF operations. Future military exercises will refine new types of cooperation enabled by security reforms. Both countries face challenges in deepening their defense partnership, including addressing threats from North Korea and China, and strengthening ties with South Korea, Australia, and India. The United States and Japan are adjusting their war plans to include collective self-defense and expanding SDF operations. Challenges include addressing threats from North Korea and China, and strengthening ties with South Korea, Australia, and India. Divergences exist in views of China, with Japanese media portraying Chinese military activities near Japanese territory in hostile terms, while U.S. officials are cautious not to provoke Beijing. The Obama Administration aims to cooperate with China on global issues like climate change and nuclear. Despite legal restrictions, Japan cooperates with the United States on global issues like climate change and nuclear non-proliferation. Japan's constitution, influenced by American officials, limits its military capabilities but allows for self-defense and participation in noncombat roles in U.N. peacekeeping operations. The new security legislation allows Japan's Self-Defense Forces (SDF) to participate in noncombat roles overseas in U.N. peacekeeping operations and the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq. The SDF's rules of engagement have been adjusted to allow more proactive missions in conflict zones, but direct participation in combat operations is still considered unconstitutional without a threat to Japan's existence. Prime Minister Abe aims to amend Japan's constitution for increased security provisions, but faces political and fiscal challenges. Fiscal constraints limit defense budget increases for new alliance initiatives. Concerns over costs of troop realignment plans have led to restrictions on U.S. funding. Japan's defense budget decreased by 5% from 2004-2013, while China's grew by 270%. Prime Minister Abe has increased defense spending, with a 0.8% growth in FY2013 and an average of 1.7% annually from FY2014-FY2016. Japan's defense budget is tied to economic growth and fiscal constraints, with concerns over increasing costs and political challenges. The United States has implemented defense budget cuts since FY2013, but reassures allies of continued military presence in the Asia-Pacific region. Japan's defense budget is linked to economic growth and fiscal constraints. U.S. allies are worried about the impact of budget cuts, with PACOM Commander Samuel Locklear warning that sequestration cuts could undermine the rebalance. Japanese voters support Prime Minister Abe for his economic efforts rather than security issues. The public's acceptance of a more assertive defense posture has been gradual since World War II, but there is still reluctance to move away from the \"peace constitution.\" The Japanese people are hesitant about fundamental changes to the \"peace constitution,\" as shown by resistance to amending Article 9 and opposition to security legislation in 2015. The LDP's efforts faced intense public protest, with over 100,000 people demonstrating outside the Diet buildings. After the introduction of controversial security bills, 100,000 people protested outside the Diet buildings, criticizing the laws as unconstitutional and expressing concerns about Japan being drawn into U.S.-led wars overseas. The Abe Administration has been slow in implementing defense reforms, reflecting the complexity of changes to the SDF's roles and missions. Changes in the East Asian security landscape have influenced Japan's defense approach, with heightened threats from North Korea's missile tests and China's military advancements. Japan has also strengthened defense partnerships, particularly through the U.S.-Japan alliance. The U.S.-Japan alliance has enhanced security ties with Southeast Asian countries, particularly amid maritime territorial disputes in the East and South China Seas. Trilateral and multilateral cooperation with allies like Australia, the Republic of Korea, and ASEAN countries has been praised for benefiting U.S. security interests by bolstering deterrence and reducing direct rivalry with potential adversaries. High-level dialogues and military exercises are key mechanisms for regional security cooperation. Trilateral dialogues and military exercises play a crucial role in regional security cooperation in the Asia-Pacific. The lack of a comprehensive multilateral institution for managing security issues has led to the importance of established trilateral dialogues between U.S. allies. Training exercises involving various Asia-Pacific nations aim to enhance trust and transparency. The U.S. and Japan have engaged in multilateral exercises with several countries, showcasing the breadth of these activities. Dissonance between Tokyo and Seoul poses a challenge for U.S. defense officials. The dissonance between Tokyo and Seoul hinders trilateral defense cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. Japan and South Korea have improved relations but lack formal security agreements for effective defense collaboration. Without cooperation among allies, the US may struggle to address North Korean threats and influence China's behavior. The US strategic rebalancing to the region may lead to new defense partnerships that could diminish Japan's strategic importance. New basing arrangements with countries in Southeast Asia, like Singapore, the Philippines, and Australia, could host rotations of troops or assets. Japan's security policy is heavily influenced by North Korea, leading to a more forward-leaning defense posture. The shared threat from North Korea has strengthened Japan's military alliance with the United States since the late 1990s. Other countries in the region, such as Singapore, the Philippines, Australia, and Malaysia, have also shown willingness to provide expanded access to the United States for military assets. In 1998, North Korea's test of a Taepodong missile over Japan led to increased support for ballistic missile defense with the United States. The sinking of a North Korean spy ship by the Japanese Coast Guard in 2001 raised concerns about the threat from Pyongyang. Kim Jong-il's admission in 2002 of abducting Japanese citizens in the past shocked the public and fueled a hard-line stance on North Korea. Japan launched its first spy satellite in 2003 to track North Korean threats independently. North Korea's provocative behavior, including missile launches and nuclear tests, has escalated tensions in recent years. North Korea's aggressive actions, including missile launches, nuclear tests, and attacks on South Korea, have prompted Japan to enhance missile defense cooperation with the United States. Japanese territory is at risk from North Korean ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads. This has led to closer defense cooperation between Seoul, Tokyo, and Washington, including joint military exercises. Despite historical tensions, China and Japan have maintained wary relations. Since 2010, China and Japan have been in muted hostility over the Senkaku/Diaoyu islets in the East China Sea. The islets are claimed by Japan, China, and Taiwan, and are rich in energy deposits. Japan is concerned about China's intentions and capabilities, leading to a need for Japan to adjust its defense posture. China has deployed maritime law enforcement vessels near the islets and increased patrols to assert jurisdiction. This has caused Japan to consider countering China's actions. Chinese military surveillance planes entered airspace Japan claims as its own, leading to heightened tensions. In response, Japan scrambled fighter jets and drafted plans to shoot down unmanned aerial vehicles. China's announcement of a new air defense identification zone (ADIZ) that includes the disputed islets was condemned by Japan and the United States. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee expressed deep concerns about the Chinese ADIZ and its enforcement procedures. China's ADIZ has not been fully enforced as feared, but overlapping zones with Japan could lead to a crisis. The situation is crowded and potentially combustible due to fishing vessels, military assets, and law-enforcement patrols. Without effective crisis management tools, China and Japan risk escalating into conflict, involving the U.S. commitment to defend Japan. The U.S. has maintained neutrality on sovereignty but recognizes the islets under Article 5 of the U.S.-Japan treaty. The U.S. maintains neutrality on sovereignty over the Senkaku Islands but recognizes them under Article 5 of the U.S.-Japan security treaty. Congress passed a resolution in 2013 to support this commitment, and President Obama reiterated this stance in 2014. Chinese officials have criticized the U.S.-Japan alliance as a relic of the Cold War and accused Japan of remilitarizing. U.S. and Japanese defense planners are concerned about China's military acquisitions, particularly missile capabilities that could degrade combat strength in the region. U.S. diplomats have warned Beijing about the justification for improving ballistic missile defense capabilities in response to North Korea's tests. South Korea and Japan share similar security challenges, including North Korea and China. Both countries rely on shipping lanes for their economies and desire strong international trade standards. Despite being top trade partners, historical issues from Japan's annexation of Korea in the early 20th century continue to strain relations. The strained relationship between South Korea and Japan due to historical issues from Japan's annexation of Korea in the early 20th century derailed attempts to cooperate in the security realm, specifically in signing two landmark agreements in 2012 for more military cooperation. The agreements, GSOMIA and ACSA, would have allowed for sharing classified information and logistical cooperation, but fell apart at the last moment amid public outcry in South Korea. These pacts would have also enabled more effective cooperation with the United States. The strained relationship between Japan and South Korea hinders trilateral defense cooperation with the United States. Public sentiment in South Korea views Japan's defense upgrades as a return to militarism, while Japanese officials feel South Korea lacks appreciation for past apologies. Mutual distrust between the two countries prompts Washington to urge them to overcome discord for trilateral security cooperation. Abe and Park Administrations made efforts to improve relations in late 2014 and 2015. In late 2014 and 2015, Japan, South Korea, and the United States signed a trilateral intelligence-sharing agreement to exchange information on North Korea's threats. Japan's closest security partner is Australia, with whom they have deepened military cooperation through various agreements. Australia and Japan had an agreement on defense equipment transfer, focusing on submarine propulsion technologies. However, the cooperation for Australia's next-gen submarines faced challenges due to political and bureaucratic issues on the Japanese side. Despite this, Australia has consistently supported Japan's expanded regional security role. The two countries have collaborated in various military operations and humanitarian efforts. The Trilateral Strategic Dialogue between the United States, Australia, and Japan allows for cooperation on security priorities, including joint military exercises and relief operations. This arrangement supports the US rebalance strategy in the region and provides strategic flexibility for Australia and Japan. Military exercises involving the RAAF, Japanese ASDF, and US Air Force are conducted regularly to enhance regional security. Japan's security relations with India have strengthened since 2013, focusing on maritime security in the Indo-Pacific region. Abe and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have close political ties, signing agreements on defense technology transfer and intelligence sharing. Japan joined the U.S.-India Malabar naval exercises in 2015, showing interest in new security networks with nations like Australia and the United States to counter China's rising power. Different combinations of Japan, Australia, India, and the United States are being considered for a regional security group. Japan, Australia, and India have engaged in trilateral talks at the vice-ministerial level, with Prime Minister Abe proposing a security \"diamond\" involving these countries. Concerns have been raised about this potentially being seen as containment of China. Previous attempts at a quadrilateral security dialogue faced criticism from China and lapsed due to Australia's reluctance to upset Beijing. The disputes in the South China Sea have further fueled discussions on security cooperation in the region. During the 2000s and 2010s, the South China Sea tensions increased, prompting the United States and Japan to enhance security efforts in Southeast Asia. The alliance between the two countries could serve as a platform for future security engagement. Japan has donated patrol boats to Southeast Asian coast guards, and there is potential for multilateral maritime patrols involving the US, Japan, and Southeast Asian nations. Cooperation varies among Southeast Asian countries, with a focus on the Philippines, Singapore, and building maritime domain awareness. In February 2016, Japan signed an agreement with the Philippines for military cooperation, including selling new hardware and providing training. Japan and the United States have experience in disaster relief operations in Southeast Asia. Japan co-chaired the military medicine working group of the ASEAN Defense Ministers Meeting Plus from 2010 to 2013. The U.S.-Japan alliance is based on bilateral agreements, including the 1960 Mutual Defense Treaty and the Status of Forces Agreement. The bilateral defense guidelines outline cooperation between the two militaries in peacetime and war, with a focus on roles, missions, and capabilities. The U.S.-Japan alliance is guided by bilateral agreements, including the 1960 Mutual Defense Treaty and the Status of Forces Agreement. The roles, missions, and capabilities (RMC) of the two militaries are outlined in policy guidelines, with concrete directives provided at regular meetings of the Cabinet-level Security Consultative Committee (SCC), known as the \"2+2\". The SCC issues joint statements reflecting alliance concerns and providing guidance for cooperation. The 2002 SCC meeting established the Defense Policy Review Initiative (DPRI) to review force posture and develop a common security view. Meetings in 2005-2007 provided high-level guidance for alliance priorities and strategic objectives. The 2005-2007 SCC meetings guided significant changes in the U.S.-Japan alliance, focusing on Taiwan Strait and Korean Peninsula stability, military modernization transparency in China, and greater military integration. The May 2010 SCC meeting reaffirmed the alliance's importance to Japan's foreign policy and committed to implementing the 2006 Realignment Roadmap for relocating the Futenma air base in Okinawa. The 2011 SCC meeting discussed the relocation of the Futenma air base in Okinawa after the earthquake and tsunami. The 2012 meeting focused on the Okinawa-Guam realignment of U.S. forces, aiming to resolve issues. The 2013 meeting under the LDP outlined an agenda for enhanced U.S.-Japan cooperation. In December 2012, the 2013 SCC joint statement outlined enhanced U.S.-Japan defense cooperation, including revising bilateral guidelines to adjust the alliance to changing threats, emerging technologies, and Japan's defense reforms. The United States supported Japan's initiatives for a National Security Council and collective self-defense. In April 2015, a major revision to bilateral defense guidelines was released, addressing military technology, interoperability, and security threats in the 21st century, including cybersecurity, space use for defense, and ballistic missile defense. The 2015 revision of bilateral defense guidelines expanded U.S.-Japan security cooperation to include defense of sea lanes and potential Japanese contributions to U.S. military operations outside East Asia. Implementation has been slow, with new defense cooperation activities like \"mutual asset protection\" being introduced. The alliance is also expanding institutional infrastructure for cooperation in areas such as logistical support and military use of outer space. The new bilateral defense guidelines aim to improve alliance coordination by establishing a standing Alliance Coordination Mechanism (ACM) for quicker inter-agency communication between U.S. and Japanese officials. Development of \"flexible deterrent options\" is still in progress, and Japan's slow pace in implementing new military operational practices has delayed the process. The previous Bilateral Coordination Mechanism only convened in a state of war, potentially escalating crises without formal coordination. The relocation of Futenma Marine Corps Air Station is part of a broader overhaul of U.S. force posture in Japan. The Defense Policy Review Initiative (DPRI) has improved political sustainability, interoperability, and scope of the alliance. Training relocation programs aim to reduce noise pollution for local residents. U.S. Carrier Air Wing Five is being relocated to Iwakuni to reduce safety risks and noise. The Japanese government built a new offshore runway at Iwakuni. The Japanese government built a new offshore runway at the Iwakuni base to handle civilian flights. In Okinawa, the U.S. military has turned over land to Japan, with more areas approved for return. Co-location of service headquarters has improved coordination between U.S. and Japanese militaries. The SDF Air Defense Command constructed a new facility at Yokota Air Base for data-sharing and coordination. U.S. Army Japan established a forward operational headquarters at Camp Zama for theater operations command. The Japanese Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF) Central Readiness Force moved its headquarters to Camp Zama in early 2013, while the MSDF headquarters and the Commander of U.S. Naval Forces, Japan, have shared the naval base at Yokosuka for decades. Joint training activities and shared facilities have improved U.S.-Japan alliance interoperability. In June 2013, the SDF conducted its first joint drill overseas with the U.S. military in California. Japan will have access to new training facilities on Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands as per a 2009 bilateral agreement. Discussions continue on increasing shared-use military facilities to potentially change the image of American troops as foreign occupiers. The 1997 guidelines allowed Japanese forces to support U.S. operations in surrounding areas. Special legislation since 2001 enabled Japanese troops to participate in international peace activities in Iraq, the Indian Ocean, Indonesia, Haiti, and U.N. missions. Japanese defense specialists believe noncombat missions are key for development. Japan's security cooperation in Southeast Asia focuses on technical assistance and training for military personnel in ASEAN countries. The MSDF has been involved in counter-piracy activities in the Gulf of Aden since 2009, escorting commercial ships and conducting surveillance flights. A base in Djibouti, established in 2011, houses roughly 200 SDF personnel. The move has not stirred controversy in Japan, as the MSDF is highly capable and closely cooperates with the U.S. Navy. The MSDF has a close relationship with the U.S. Navy, conducting over 100 joint exercises annually. They have strong anti-submarine warfare cooperation dating back to the Cold War. The MSDF also supports U.S. operations by refueling coalition vessels, participating in multinational exercises, and deploying vessels for anti-piracy missions. The Japanese Coast Guard (JCG) plays a crucial role in enhancing Japan's maritime capabilities, including administrative control over the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu islets. JCG focuses on rescue, environmental protection, securing sea lanes, and maintaining order in the seas. Their protection of Japanese waters and participation in overseas exercises is more politically acceptable than MSDF involvement. Coordination between MSDF and JCG improved significantly amid the maritime standoff with China. U.S.-Japan efforts on ballistic missile defense are seen as a robust aspect of bilateral security cooperation. The U.S.-Japan efforts on ballistic missile defense (BMD) are a key aspect of bilateral security cooperation. Japan has acquired BMD systems for national defense, purchasing U.S.-developed technologies and interceptors to have the second-most potent BMD capability in the world. The Self-Defense Forces (SDF) have 17 PAC-3 units deployed across Japan and six vessels with Aegis air/missile defense software and SM-3 Block IA interceptors. The U.S. and Japan have a strong partnership in ballistic missile defense (BMD), with Japan possessing advanced BMD systems and the U.S. deploying PAC-3 units and Aegis BMD-capable vessels in the region. The two countries share information through joint command relationships and operate a Bilateral Joint Operating Command Center to enhance target identification and interceptor cueing. This collaboration has significantly improved alliance interoperability and defense capabilities against potential adversaries like North Korea. The U.S. and Japan collaborate on ballistic missile defense, with a focus on target identification, tracking, and interceptor cueing. Concerns about North Korea and China's nuclear capabilities have led to discussions on U.S. extended deterrence. The Extended Deterrence Dialogue between the U.S. and Japan aims to address Japanese perceptions of U.S. credibility in deterring threats. This dialogue influenced the 2010 U.S. Nuclear Posture Review. Tokyo discouraged a proposal to declare the \"sole purpose\" of U.S. nuclear weapons is to deter nuclear attack. Lack of confidence in U.S. security guarantee could lead Tokyo to reconsider its non-nuclear weapons status. Donald Trump suggested Japan develop its own nuclear arsenal to counter North Korean threat, but analysts warn of negative consequences such as high costs, reduced international standing, and potential sanctions. Encouraging Japan to develop nuclear weapons could diminish U.S. influence. Encouraging Japan to develop nuclear weapons could lead to diminished U.S. influence in Asia, unraveling of the U.S. alliance system, and a destabilizing nuclear arms race in the region. Japanese leaders have rejected this idea and instead focus on extended deterrence through their BMD capabilities. Japan's diplomatic support for nuclear nonproliferation and cooperation in reducing nuclear threats are key elements. Japan is a major purchaser of U.S.-produced defense equipment and has the status of a NATO Plus Five country. U.S. foreign military sales to Japan averaged $1.47 billion per year over FY2011-FY2015. The SDF has close equipment ties with the U.S. military. A Reciprocal Defense Procurement Agreement was signed in June 2016, allowing fair competition for defense contracts. Japan domestically produces some equipment under license and purchases others from U.S. companies. Recent high-profile purchases include F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, RQ-4 \"Global Hawk\" UAVs, and V-22 \"Osprey\" aircraft. Japan has purchased various military equipment from the U.S., including unmanned aerial vehicles, tilt-rotor aircraft, aerial refueling tankers, and airborne early warning aircraft. They have also shown interest in buying BMD systems like Aegis Ashore and THAAD. The two countries are exploring deeper defense industry cooperation and co-production of weapons systems. In the 1990s and 2000s, Japan and the U.S. cooperated on BMD technology, leading to the joint production of the SM-3 Block IIA missile interceptors. Japan relaxed its arms export restrictions in 2011, allowing transfers of the SM-3 Block IIA to third parties. This decision paved the way for further co-production arrangements and extensions to the \"Three Principles on Arms Exports.\" The Abe Cabinet extended exceptions to the \"Three Principles on Arms Exports\" in 2013 to allow Japanese firms to participate in producing parts for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and to export defense equipment for peace contribution. Japan provides nearly $2 billion annually to offset U.S. forces stationed in Japan, with the U.S. spending an additional $2.7 billion on non-personnel costs. Japan contributes approximately 40% of the non-personnel costs for U.S. military presence in Japan through Special Measures Agreements (SMAs) and the Facilities Improvement Program (FIP). Under the current SMA from 2016-2020, Japan will contribute \u00a5189 billion ($1.8 billion) annually and at least \u00a520.6 billion ($195 million) for the FIP. Japan contributes approximately 40% of the non-personnel costs for U.S. military presence in Japan through Special Measures Agreements (SMAs) and the Facilities Improvement Program (FIP). The FIP funding is not strictly defined, with Japan adjusting the total at its discretion. Tokyo decides which projects receive FIP funding, taking into account U.S. priorities. There has been debate on burden sharing arrangements and costs of U.S. alliances, sparked by comments from Donald Trump during the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign. In addition to host nation support, Japan spends approximately \u00a5128 billion ($1.2 billion) annually on measures. Japan spends approximately \u00a5128 billion ($1.2 billion) annually on measures to subsidize or compensate base-hosting communities and pays for relocating U.S. bases within Japan. The value of Japan's host nation support fluctuates based on the exchange rate, with Okinawa hosting a disproportionate share of the U.S. military presence in Japan. The attitudes of native Okinawans towards U.S. military bases are generally negative due to a tumultuous history and complex relationships with Japan and the United States. The sustainability of the U.S. military presence in Okinawa remains a challenge, with concerns among Okinawans. In 2013, an important political hurdle was cleared for the relocation of a major U.S. military base on the island of Okinawa. The relocation of a major U.S. military base on Okinawa was approved by Nakaima, allowing for the construction of a new facility in the sparsely populated Henoko area to replace MCAS Futenma. This move aims to reduce the risks of aircraft accidents in residential areas and maintain military capability on the island. The new base is expected to be completed by 2022 as part of the Marine Corps realignment plans. The Marine Corps realignment plans involve relocating about 9,000 marines and their dependents from Okinawa to Guam, Australia, Hawaii, and potentially the continental United States by 2022. This realignment aims to make U.S. force posture in Asia more geographically distributed, operationally resilient, and politically sustainable. Congress froze funds for the planned realignment due to concerns about construction costs on Guam and uncertainty about future U.S. force posture in the Asia-Pacific region. The FY2015 NDAA allows DOD to proceed with military construction for the Marine Corps realignment on Guam, using Japanese government funds. Challenges remain, especially with civilian infrastructure on Guam. Despite opposition, Congress's removal of restrictions could facilitate the realignment and reduce the U.S. military presence on Okinawa. The Okinawan government, led by Governor Takeshi Onaga, has been in a legal battle with the Japanese central government over a landfill permit revoked in 2015. Anti-base civic groups in Okinawa are increasing protest activities to prevent construction at Henoko, causing potential delays and doubts about the project's viability. The Abe Administration, which invested time and money in gaining consent, may face additional political challenges. The Abe Administration, which invested time and money in gaining Nakaima's consent, may face additional political challenges to ensure base construction proceeds without delays and alienating the Okinawan public. Failure to relocate Futenma could reinforce the perception of Japanese political system struggles. However, heavy-handed actions by Tokyo or Washington could spark more intense anti-base protests. The deployment of Osprey aircraft in 2012 caused public outcry due to safety concerns. The MV-22 Osprey was introduced to Japan with concerns over safety, leading to protests. However, the arrival of more Ospreys in 2013 saw smaller protests in Okinawa. To address public concerns, Osprey training flights have been shifted to mainland Japan and Guam since 2015. The Ospreys in Okinawa enhance Marine operational capability, with plans for a special operations squadron deployment at Yokota Air Base in 2017. The U.S. military and SDF do not share base facilities in Japan on a large scale, but some commentators suggest joint use of military bases to integrate operations and gain popular support. Co-location could be challenging due to differences in rules of engagement between the two forces, with Japan's constitutional restrictions contrasting with the U.S. military's more flexible doctrine. Japanese defense policy has evolved towards a more assertive and flexible approach since the end of the Cold War. This shift is driven by a growing sense of insecurity among Japanese elites, erosion of anti-militarist norms, positive experiences in international security missions, and strong conservative leaders focused on defense policies. The SDF and U.S. military operate under different legal frameworks, with the SDF subject to domestic laws and the U.S. military under the Status of Forces Agreement. The long-term trend is towards a more capable SDF and deeper cooperation with the U.S. military. The Abe Administration's defense reforms in 2013-2015 have led to a more proactive approach in Japan's security policies. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 prompted a shift in Japanese defense posture, but it was slow to evolve. By 2010, national defense policy moved beyond the \"basic defense force\" concept, allowing for new missions such as U.N. peacekeeping operations and support for the U.S. in regional contingencies. In 2010, Japan shifted its national defense policy beyond the \"basic defense force\" concept and established a Joint Staff Office to improve capabilities and work closely with U.S. forces. A 2016 study found Japanese command and control mechanisms insufficient for high-intensity warfare with U.S. forces. The 2010 National Defense Program Guidelines signaled a shift away from Cold War framework to focus on new missions and smoother coordination with U.S. joint command. The 2010 National Defense Program Guidelines shifted Japan's focus from the northern areas to the southwestern islands, emphasizing a \"dynamic defense force\" concept for operational readiness and mobility. It highlighted the need for cooperation with countries like South Korea, Australia, India, and Southeast Asian nations, while also expressing concerns about China's military modernization and lack of transparency. Subsequent defense white papers further emphasized potential military threats from China. The 2013 NDPG builds on the 2010 NDPG, emphasizing jointness and operational cooperation among air, naval, and ground forces. Japan will invest in amphibious capabilities and BMD for defense. The SDF aims to become more joint, strengthen ISR, and develop capabilities in outer space and cyberspace. Force posture in Japan's southwest island chain is being bolstered, including an additional ASDF air wing on Okinawa. China has accused Japan of hyping the \"China threat\" to mislead international opinion. Japan is enhancing its force posture in the southwest island chain, including adding an ASDF air wing on Okinawa and a radar base on Yonaguni Island. Plans for missile batteries are in progress. This shift towards a more dynamic defense posture has been well-received by U.S. experts, as it aligns with the security environment. The U.S.-Japan alliance is better equipped to handle security challenges with this transformation. While some countries in the Asia-Pacific region welcome Japan's increased security presence, concerns have been raised in South Korea about Japan's \"remilitarization\". Japanese leaders are wary of China's actions. Japan is concerned about China's potential actions in the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands and has enhanced its rapid response capabilities. The United States and Japan have developed seamless alliance functions to address gray zone contingencies. Bilateral cooperation includes improving ISR to prevent surprises and the Alliance Coordination Mechanism facilitates military coordination. Japan has increased its military capabilities, focusing on amphibious warfare and developing a Marine Corps-like function within the GSDF. This shift was motivated by the need to defend against potential threats in the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands and to improve disaster relief efforts after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Cooperation with the U.S. Marine Corps has been instrumental in this development. The GSDF is establishing an Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade of 3,000 personnel to respond to attacks on Japan's remote islands. Japan is enhancing inter-service jointness for amphibious operations and acquiring amphibious assault vehicles, V-22 Osprey aircraft, and other assets for mobile deployment capabilities. Japan is also expanding defense policies to outer space and cyberspace, but lags behind the United States in these domains. Japan has been developing space technology for decades and has launched imagery satellites with low resolution. They are now working on higher-resolution replacements and considering early warning satellites due to the threat of North Korean missiles. In 2013, the US and Japan signed an agreement on Space Situational Awareness to share information on space debris. Japan emphasizes cooperation with the US in cybersecurity efforts and established a Cybersecurity Cabinet Secretariat in 2014. The Japanese Cabinet Secretariat established a Cybersecurity Strategic Headquarters in 2014 to coordinate cybersecurity policy and response. A bilateral cybersecurity dialogue between the United States and Japan was initiated in 2013. The SDF created a Cyber Defense Group in 2014 with a budget of $140 million and 100 officers, but it is considered inadequate for modern cyber challenges due to legal barriers. Following Japan's defeat in World War II, the Allied Powers occupied the country from 1945 to 1952. The initial goal was to demilitarize Japan, but as the Cold War intensified, the focus shifted to building Japan as a strategic ally against the Communist threat. This led to the establishment of the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) in 1954. The SDF's Cyber Defense Group was created in 2014 with a budget of $140 million and 100 officers, but it is considered insufficient for modern cyber challenges. Following Japan's defeat in World War II, the Allied Powers occupied the country from 1945 to 1952. The Self-Defense Forces (SDF) were established in 1954, evolving into a well-funded military. Debate continues on whether the SDF violates Article 9. Japan regained sovereignty in 1952 with the San Francisco Peace Treaty. The 1960 Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security established Japan as a key ally to the U.S. during the Cold War, granting basing rights in exchange for security protection. Unlike other defense treaties, Japan is not obligated to defend the U.S. if attacked. During the 1950s, Japan received military aid for self-defense and expanded its Self-Defense Forces (SDF). Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida followed U.S. leadership on foreign policies and focused on economic development. The \"Yoshida Doctrine\" resisted full-scale Japanese rearmament, leading to debates and unsuccessful attempts to revise Article 9 of the Constitution and the Treaty. Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi negotiated a revision to the Treaty in 1960. In 1960, Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi negotiated a revision to the Treaty, leading to protests in Tokyo and his resignation. U.S.-Japan defense relations faced uncertainty due to Nixon's Guam Doctrine, normalization of China-U.S. relations, and U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam. Okinawa islands were returned to Japan in 1972, but U.S. military bases remain. In 1976, the bilateral Security Consultative Committee was established for defense cooperation between the United States and Japan. Japan faced criticism for not providing direct military assistance during the Persian Gulf War, despite contributing $13 billion. The Self-Defense Forces (SDF) were deployed to various countries after Japan passed a bill in 1991 allowing participation in U.N. peacekeeping operations. Tensions over North Korea and the Taiwan Strait led to a revision of defense guidelines in 1996-1997 by President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. In 1996-1997, President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto revised defense guidelines, granting the U.S. military greater use of Japanese installations and hinting at a limited Japanese military role in surrounding areas. This led to joint research on ballistic missile defense after North Korea's 1998 missile launch over Japan. The Bush Administration later adopted a pro-Japan approach in East Asia. The final paper produced by a bipartisan study group before the 2000 U.S. presidential election called for a more equal partnership with Japan and enhanced defense cooperation. Japan's response to the 9/11 attacks reinforced the U.S.-Japan alliance as a central partnership in U.S. foreign policy. Japan dispatched military personnel to Iraq in 2004 for reconstruction activities, the first time since World War II. After the withdrawal of ground troops in 2006, a Japanese SDF air division remained in Iraq until 2008. Expectations of a transformed alliance with a more forward-leaning defense posture from Japan diminished. Successors to Koizumi struggled to govern effectively, with Shinzo Abe upgrading the Defense Agency but failing on pledges for a National Security Council and a permanent deployment law. Yasuo Fukuda, elected in 2007, was considered a friend of the alliance but more cautious in security outlook. In the final years of the decade, political paralysis and budgetary constraints in Tokyo, Japan's minimal progress in implementing base realignment agreements, Japanese disappointment in Bush's policy on North Korea, and concerns over burden-sharing arrangements led to reduced cooperation and unease about the U.S.-Japan partnership under the Obama and DPJ administrations. In the fall of 2009, the DPJ under Yukio Hatoyama's leadership caused a rocky start in US-Japan relations due to disagreements over the Futenma Marine base relocation. This raised concerns about the erosion of the alliance, as the DPJ initially leaned towards a more Asia-centric foreign policy. After intense deliberation, Hatoyama agreed to relocate the Futenma base, but resigned in June 2010 due to political controversy. His successor, Naoto Kan, supported the agreement and worked to mend relations with the US. By December 2012, American policymakers regained confidence in Tokyo's alliance management approach, buoyed by the response to the 2011 Tohoku disaster and regional security concerns. The U.S.-Japan alliance was reinforced by provocations from North Korea and China's increased maritime assertiveness."
