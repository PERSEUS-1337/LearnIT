    "content": "The Supreme Court case law focuses on whether the rights of U.S. citizens limit the government's power to exclude aliens. Nonresident aliens outside the U.S. do not have constitutional rights regarding entry, and statutory provisions do not allow judicial review unless Congress expressly authorizes it. Congress has the power to enforce immigration rules through executive officers without judicial intervention unless specified otherwise. The Supreme Court has established that judicial review of exclusion decisions for aliens abroad is generally unavailable unless Congress specifically allows it. In a notable case from 1895, a Chinese national challenged his exclusion under Chinese exclusion laws by immigration officers, claiming he was a merchant, not a laborer. The Supreme Court acknowledged his right to challenge his detention through a habeas corpus petition. The Supreme Court acknowledged the Chinese national's right to challenge his detention through a habeas corpus petition, but ultimately could not review the immigration officials' determination due to statutory limitations. The Court could only consider whether the immigration officers had jurisdiction to make exclusion decisions under the Chinese exclusion acts. The Supreme Court rejected a habeas petition challenging a Chinese national's detention, stating that immigration officers had statutory authority to make exclusion decisions. The Court upheld Congress's delegation of final authority over exclusion decisions to executive officials, citing that aliens lack constitutional rights with respect to entry. The Supreme Court upheld Congress's delegation of final authority over exclusion decisions to executive officials, stating that aliens lack constitutional rights with respect to entry. In the 1950s, two major Supreme Court decisions appeared to transform the principle that judicial review of exclusion decisions is barred unless Congress expressly provides otherwise. The Supreme Court ruled that aliens do not have constitutional rights regarding entry, allowing Congress to determine due process for denied entry. The Court also established a presumption against judicial review of exclusion decisions. In the case of Shaughnessy v. Mezei, the Court upheld the Executive's undisclosed reasons for denying entry to a stateless alien, citing previous rulings that federal courts cannot review exclusion decisions unless authorized by law. The Supreme Court held that federal courts may not review exclusion decisions unless authorized by law, as seen in the case of Mezei. The Court conducted a limited inquiry into the legality of detention for aliens challenging their exclusion, despite the general bar on judicial review in immigration cases. The Supreme Court does not interpret a general bar on judicial review to prevent habeas corpus review, but the extent of habeas review for exclusion cases involving arriving aliens is unclear. Knauff and Mezei cases are often cited for the principle that exclusion decisions are not subject to court review unless specified by Congress, despite criticism from scholars. The indefinite detention of arriving aliens upheld in Mezei is controversial and limited by some lower courts to cases involving national security. The Supreme Court has referenced Knauff and previous exclusion cases to support the idea that nonresident aliens can be excluded without judicial review. The doctrine of consular nonreviewability prevents nonresident aliens from challenging their exclusion in federal court, based on Knauff and earlier exclusion cases. This doctrine also applies to visa denials and decisions to deny entry to aliens arriving in the United States. The doctrine of consular nonreviewability prevents nonresident aliens from challenging visa denials and other actions by executive branch officials to deny them admission. This doctrine gives considerable power to U.S. consular officers in making final decisions about visa applications. The doctrine of consular nonreviewability applies to various types of visa claims, with controversy surrounding its foundation in law. Lower federal courts generally uphold this doctrine, citing Supreme Court cases like Knauff. Congress's plenary immigration power is often cited as the basis for allowing visa decisions to be enforced exclusively by executive officers without judicial review. The doctrine of consular nonreviewability, upheld by lower federal courts, allows visa decisions to be enforced by executive officers without judicial review. This is based on Congress's plenary immigration power and the presumption against judicial review of exclusion decisions. Some courts have tried to reconcile this doctrine with the Administrative Procedure Act. The Administrative Procedure Act establishes a \"strong presumption\" for judicial review of federal agency actions, including the Department of State. However, courts have upheld the doctrine of consular nonreviewability as a preexisting limitation on judicial review, preserved by the APA. This doctrine allows consular decisions to be exempt from judicial review, despite the general availability of review for agency actions. The doctrine of consular nonreviewability is based on the absence of specific statutory authorization for reviewing visa denials, rather than an explicit prohibition. While the Administrative Procedure Act establishes a presumption for judicial review of federal agency actions, courts have upheld consular nonreviewability as a limitation on judicial review. Congress has not legislated to shield visa decisions from judicial review, and the INA bars the Secretary of State from overturning visa decisions. The doctrine of consular nonreviewability is based on the absence of specific statutory authorization for reviewing visa denials. However, there is an exception when a U.S. citizen challenges the exclusion of a nonresident alien abroad on constitutional grounds, allowing for a limited judicial inquiry into the reason for the decision. The exception to consular nonreviewability allows for limited judicial review of visa denials when a U.S. citizen challenges the exclusion of a nonresident alien abroad on constitutional grounds. Some lower federal courts have recognized other exceptions to consular nonreviewability, but there is split opinion on whether U.S. citizens can challenge visa denials on statutory grounds. The nonresident alien denied statutory waivers for a visa had no constitutional right of entry, with limited judicial review available only for constitutional claims by U.S. citizens. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit allows nonresident aliens to challenge a consular officer's failure to act on a visa application. This exception is based on the Mandamus Act for judicial review when an official fails to take a legally required action. The exception to consular nonreviewability is not well established, with federal district courts split on recognizing it. The Mandamus Act creates an exception to the presumption against judicial review of decisions to exclude aliens abroad. Other courts have recognized further exceptions, such as allowing visa applicants to challenge applicable statutes, regulations, or policies. Review under Mandel is available for constitutional challenges by U.S. citizens. The review under Mandel for constitutional challenges by U.S. citizens is the only exception to consular nonreviewability recognized by lower federal courts. The question in other cases involving aliens abroad is whether a federal court can order the executive branch to grant entry to remedy violations of constitutional or statutory rights. The Seventh and Ninth Circuits say yes, while the D.C. Circuit requires statutory authorization for such orders. The Ninth Circuit ruled that federal courts can order the government to allow aliens back into the country for fair removal proceedings if their due process rights were violated. This remedy does not infringe on the political branches' authority over exclusion decisions. The Seventh Circuit had broad authority over exclusion decisions related to a case involving an alien who had overstayed his visa and was denied reentry to the United States after receiving advance parole. The Seventh Circuit ordered executive branch officials to grant reentry to an alien who was denied entry after receiving advance parole. The court held that the DHS used parole as a trap to exclude the alien permanently. The court enforced the alien's right to reenter based on a regulation granting him the right to continue his pending application for adjustment of status. The court distinguished this case from Knauff, stating that when a statute or regulation grants an excluded alien a right to be in the US, courts can intervene. The D.C. Circuit's decision in Kiyemba v. Obama regarding the authority to order entry into the United States for Chinese nationals stands in contrast to the Seventh and Ninth Circuit cases where courts intervened to grant reentry to aliens denied entry after receiving advance parole. The issue of judicial review of an alien's exclusion based on parole regulations remains unclear, with conflicting decisions among different circuits. The D.C. Circuit denied the request of seventeen Chinese nationals detained in Guantanamo Bay to enter the United States due to persecution fears in China. Despite the illegality of their detention, the court cited the political branches' exclusive power to decide on entry into the U.S. The D.C. Circuit denied entry to Chinese nationals detained in Guantanamo Bay, citing the political branches' exclusive power over who can enter the United States. The court concluded that the aliens did not have due process rights and no law authorized courts to override the executive branch's decision on entry. The doctrine of consular nonreviewability does not prevent federal courts from ordering entry for nonresident aliens abroad to remedy constitutional issues. The D.C. Circuit denied entry to Chinese nationals in Guantanamo Bay, stating that courts cannot override the executive branch's decision on entry. Federal courts may order entry for nonresident aliens abroad to address constitutional issues, despite the doctrine of consular nonreviewability. Federal courts often review and overturn executive exclusion decisions for aliens at the border, which can result in detention. Unlike decisions for aliens abroad, exclusion of arriving aliens may lead to prolonged detention, raising questions about constitutional rights and protection from burdensome enforcement measures. For example, the 1953 Mezei case highlighted the issue of a stateless alien detained on Ellis Island without relief. Unlike cases involving aliens denied visas abroad, arriving alien cases may involve challenges to exclusion and detention. Mezei raised the question of whether the alien could challenge his exclusion from the US and his detention on Ellis Island. The majority ruled that his lack of constitutional and statutory rights foreclosed his challenge. Justice Jackson questioned if exclusion justified any means of enforcement. The Supreme Court has hesitated to rely on Mezei for the proposition that the federal government has the constitutional power to subject arriving aliens to prolonged detention. Some lower courts have held that arriving aliens have due process rights that offer protection against unreasonably prolonged detention, especially in cases involving specific national security concerns. The extent to which aliens arriving at the border enjoy constitutional protections against prolonged detention or other enforcement measures connected to the denial of entry is a disputed issue. While arriving nonresident aliens do not have constitutional rights with respect to entry itself, they may have constitutional rights in other aspects. The Supreme Court has hesitated to rely on Mezei for the proposition that the federal government has the constitutional power to subject arriving aliens to prolonged detention. Some lower courts have held that arriving aliens have due process rights that offer protection against unreasonably prolonged detention, especially in cases involving specific national security concerns. While arriving nonresident aliens do not have constitutional rights with respect to entry itself, they may have constitutional rights against detention or other enforcement measures that implicate fundamental rights, leading to judicial review of exclusion issues. Knauff and Mezei establish that no judicial review is available for exclusion decisions unless a statute expressly authorizes it, but arriving aliens who suffer detention as a consequence of exclusion may challenge their exclusion in habeas corpus proceedings. The Supreme Court has held that judicial review is unavailable for challenges to exclusion decisions, but habeas corpus proceedings can still be used to review executive jurisdiction and procedure in the immigration context. This allows arriving aliens who suffer detention as a consequence of exclusion to challenge their exclusion. The scope of federal court review in habeas corpus proceedings of exclusion decisions is limited, with unclear boundaries. The Court's review in Knauff and Mezei did not address the merits of the exclusion decisions, indicating that courts may review legal questions but not the basis for exclusion in habeas proceedings. The scope of federal court review in habeas corpus proceedings of exclusion decisions is limited, with unclear boundaries. The Supreme Court may review legal questions but not the basis for exclusion in habeas proceedings. The availability of habeas review in arriving alien cases remains unsettled, with the Supreme Court set to consider this issue in 2020. The INA establishes limited judicial review for orders of removal against arriving nonresident aliens, with procedures for expedited removal and formal removal. Judicial review is available in specific circumstances for aliens ordered removed under these procedures. The INA establishes limited judicial review for orders of removal against arriving nonresident aliens, with procedures for expedited removal and formal removal. Judicial review is available in specific circumstances for aliens ordered removed under these procedures, but the INA also limits judicial review of executive branch actions related to the removal process. This scheme may not prevent review of certain executive branch exclusion policies affecting expedited removal, such as asylum eligibility restrictions for some aliens at the border. These provisions have replaced the Knauff presumption regarding judicial review of exclusion decisions for arriving nonresident aliens. Judicial review of exclusion decisions or policies for arriving nonresident aliens is subject to review by federal courts, especially when the INA does not expressly prohibit such review. This can occur when arriving aliens challenge executive branch exclusion policies under the APA. The Supreme Court has allowed for judicial review of inadmissibility determinations of arriving aliens in certain cases. The Supreme Court allowed for judicial review of inadmissibility determinations of arriving aliens, despite the presumption against judicial review of exclusion determinations. This decision was based on the case Brownwell v. We Shung, where arriving aliens could challenge inadmissibility determinations through declaratory judgment actions. The review framework for orders of removal replaces the Knauff presumption against judicial review in arriving alien exclusion cases. Current case law allows for statutory challenges to exclusion unless expressly barred, but does not fully reconcile with the Knauff presumption. The Supreme Court's jurisprudence establishes that challenges to exclusion of nonresident aliens may not be reviewed unless Congress expressly provides for it, leading to the rule of consular nonreviewability. The rule of consular nonreviewability bars judicial review in most circumstances of visa refusals and exclusion decisions for aliens located abroad. However, constitutional issues and INA provisions may allow for some level of review, especially concerning enforcement measures related to denial of entry. The rule against nonresident alien challenges to denials of entry only applies to challenges brought by nonresident aliens themselves, not U.S. citizens claiming violations of constitutional rights. Cases involving challenges to denial of entry by nonresident aliens do not fall under the rule against alien challenges, which mainly applies to U.S. citizens asserting constitutional rights. The Supreme Court has focused on U.S. citizens' ability to challenge alien exclusion in several key cases since 1972, establishing a limited judicial review standard where the government only needs to show a justification independent of unconstitutional grounds to prevail against a citizen's claim of violation of constitutional rights. In 1972, the Supreme Court established a limited judicial review standard for claims that the exclusion of an alien violates an American citizen's constitutional rights. This case involved American professors inviting a Belgian intellectual, Ernest Mandel, to speak at their universities, but he was deemed ineligible for a visa due to his communist beliefs. The Court upheld the plenary congressional power to make exclusion policies for aliens. The Supreme Court upheld the exclusion of an alien based on a facially legitimate and bona fide reason, without looking behind the government's justification. Despite dissenting opinions suggesting pretext, the Court accepted the government's explanation for denying a visa to Ernest Mandel due to past visa abuse, not his communist beliefs. The Supreme Court upheld the exclusion of an alien, Ernest Mandel, based on a \"facially legitimate and bona fide\" reason without delving into the government's justification. The Court's decision protected Congress's power to exclude aliens and avoided interfering with the exclusion process, despite potential First Amendment claims from American citizens seeking to interact with excluded aliens. The Supreme Court upheld the exclusion of alien Ernest Mandel based on a \"facially legitimate and bona fide\" reason, protecting Congress's power to exclude aliens and avoiding interference with the exclusion process. The Court did not allow American professors to balance their First Amendment rights against the government's exclusion power, leaving open the question of whether they were entitled to any constitutional statement justifying the exclusion. The Supreme Court cases Fiallo v. Bell, Kerry v. Din, and Trump v. Hawaii all deal with the government's power to exclude aliens, with different standards of review applied in certain situations. The cases reinforce the government's plenary power to exclude aliens, even when facing constitutional challenges from U.S. citizens. The second and third cases suggest that a different standard of review may apply when challengers present evidence of an unconstitutional justification for an exclusion decision or policy. In Fiallo v. Bell, the Court upheld a provision of the INA that classified people by gender and legitimacy, granting special immigration preferences to certain individuals. Despite the \"double-barreled discrimination\" on the face of the statute, the Court upheld it as a valid exercise of Congress's power to determine which classes of aliens may lawfully enter the country, without identifying a concrete justification for the statute. The Court in Fiallo v. Bell upheld a provision of the INA that granted special immigration preferences based on gender and legitimacy without a clear justification. In Kerry v. Din, the Court rejected a U.S. citizen's claim that the Department of State violated her due process rights by denying her husband's visa application without explanation. Justice Scalia wrote for a plurality of three Justices. In Kerry v. Din, the Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 without a majority opinion. Justice Scalia concluded that Din did not have a protected liberty interest in her husband's ability to immigrate. Justice Kennedy, in a concurring opinion, rejected the claim under the \"facially legitimate and bona fide reason\" test. He stated that the government can cite the statutory provision for excluding the alien to meet the standard. In Kerry v. Din, Justice Kennedy upheld the government's exclusion decision based on legislative criteria and the \"bona fide\" prong. He mentioned that citing the statutory provision for exclusion suffices as a justification, even without disclosing specific factual findings. However, he noted that in some cases, an affirmative showing of bad faith by the consular officer may warrant further scrutiny. In Kerry v. Din, Justice Kennedy upheld the government's exclusion decision based on legislative criteria and the \"bona fide\" prong. He mentioned that citing the statutory provision for exclusion suffices as a justification, even without disclosing specific factual findings. Under Justice Kennedy's reading of the Mandel standard, courts will assume the government has a valid basis for exclusion unless an affirmative showing suggests otherwise. The concept of a bad faith exception to Mandel's rule against judicial scrutiny of the government's factual basis for exclusion became a prominent issue in the Supreme Court's most recent exclusion case. In Trump v. Hawaii, the Supreme Court rejected a challenge against a presidential proclamation for indefinite exclusion of nonresident aliens from seven countries, including five Muslim-majority countries. The proclamation, known as the \"Travel Ban\" or \"Muslim Ban,\" was based on INA \u00a7 212(f) granting the President power to suspend entry for aliens detrimental to the U.S. interests. In Trump v. Hawaii, the Supreme Court upheld a presidential proclamation excluding nationals from seven countries deemed detrimental to U.S. interests. The proclamation aimed to protect national security by excluding individuals from countries with inadequate vetting processes or posing security risks. Challengers argued the true purpose was to ban Muslims, citing extrinsic evidence. The challengers in Trump v. Hawaii argued that the presidential proclamation excluding nationals from seven countries was illegal on statutory and constitutional grounds. They contended that the proclamation exceeded the President's authority under INA \u00a7 212(f) and did not provide sufficient findings as required by the statute. Additionally, they claimed that the proclamation violated the Establishment Clause. The challengers argued that the presidential proclamation violated the Establishment Clause by excluding Muslims from the US. The Supreme Court rejected these challenges, reaffirming the political branches' power over aliens. The Court did not address the consular nonreviewability doctrine but held that the proclamation did not violate the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Supreme Court upheld the presidential proclamation, stating that it did not violate the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Court emphasized the deference given to the President in national security and immigration matters, suggesting that judicial review of the President's determination under \u00a7 212(f) may not be appropriate. Ultimately, the Court found that the findings in the proclamation regarding vetting practices satisfied any potential review. The Supreme Court upheld the presidential proclamation, stating that it did not violate the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Court emphasized deference to the President in national security and immigration matters, suggesting limited judicial review under \u00a7 212(f). The Court rejected statutory claims against the proclamation, citing Congress's delegation of power to the President for alien exclusion. Judicial inquiry on constitutional issues is constrained, with exclusion of aliens largely immune from judicial control. The Court did not decide on the admissibility of extrinsic evidence regarding the proclamation's purpose, a key issue in lower court litigation. The Supreme Court upheld the presidential proclamation, emphasizing deference to the President in national security and immigration matters. The Court did not decide on the admissibility of extrinsic evidence regarding the proclamation's purpose, a key issue in lower court litigation. The Supreme Court upheld the presidential proclamation, emphasizing deference to the President in national security and immigration matters. The Court considered whether the entry policy is related to the Government's objective to protect the country and improve vetting processes. The Court stated that even if evidence of anti-Muslim animus was present, the inquiry remained limited to whether the proclamation was rationally related to national security concerns. The government \"hardly ever\" loses in such rational basis inquiries. The Supreme Court upheld the presidential proclamation, emphasizing deference to the President in national security and immigration matters. The Court explained that the government \"hardly ever\" loses in rational basis inquiries unless the laws lack any purpose other than a desire to harm a politically unpopular group. The Court held that the proclamation satisfied the standard due to deficient information-sharing by the governments of the covered countries, establishing legitimate national security concerns. Justice Sotomayor dissented, arguing that the Court failed to provide explanation or precedential support for limiting its analysis to rational basis review. Justice Sotomayor criticized the majority for tolerating invidious religious discrimination in the name of national security, comparing their decision to Korematsu v. United States. She argued that the proclamation failed to satisfy rational basis review due to anti-Muslim animus evident in the President's statements. The Supreme Court overruled Korematsu in Trump v. Hawaii, stating it was \"gravely wrong.\" The decision leaves questions about the Mandel test unresolved but clarifies that courts have limited review over executive decisions to exclude aliens. It did not address whether U.S. citizens can challenge exclusion decisions or consider extrinsic evidence of the government's purpose. The majority opinion reaffirms the highly constrained standard of review for constitutional claims by U.S. citizens against the exclusion of aliens abroad. The Mandel line of cases upholds Congress's broad power over alien admission and exclusion, with some uncertainty about the limits. Justice Kennedy in Din concluded that visa denials are constitutional if tied to a statutory provision, assuming Congress's exclusion power as absolute. The government justifies exclusion of aliens based on statutory provisions, asserting Congress's authority to impose limitations on alien entry. The Mandel case upheld Congress's power to restrict entry based on political beliefs, without assessing First Amendment violations. The decision focused on the Attorney General's refusal to waive the visa denial. The Supreme Court's decision in Mandel focused on the Attorney General's refusal to waive visa denial based on political beliefs, without considering First Amendment implications. The plenary power doctrine raises questions about the scope of Congress's immigration power and judicial deference in reviewing such exercises of power. The Supreme Court's decision in Mandel focused on the Attorney General's refusal to waive visa denial based on political beliefs, without considering First Amendment implications. The plenary power doctrine raises questions about the scope of Congress's immigration power and judicial deference in reviewing such exercises of power. The congressional power to admit or exclude aliens is seen as overriding constitutional limitations, but aspects of Fiallo suggest limits to this power. Fiallo's outcome upheld an immigration law discriminating by gender and legitimacy, raising questions about the extent of legislative power in regulating alien entry. The Fiallo Court's reasoning on legislative power wavered between suggesting limits and describing it as absolute. The lack of clarity stemmed from applying the Mandel test, which was not actually used in the case. Instead, the Court upheld the statute under a version of rational basis review, implying a constitutional limitation against legislative unreasonableness. This suggests that statutes regulating alien admission must be reasonable. The Supreme Court has upheld that statutes regulating the admission of aliens must be reasonable. Some scholars argue for stricter scrutiny on laws classifying aliens by race, religion, and gender, but this has not been supported by Supreme Court precedent. The Court has applied deferential rational basis review to laws regulating the admission of non-LPR aliens. The Supreme Court has applied heightened scrutiny in some cases involving gender classifications in immigration laws, but has generally used deferential rational basis review. The Court's decision in Morales-Santana distinguished Fiallo and the plenary power doctrine, indicating no imminent reconsideration of Fiallo. Trump v. Hawaii applied rational basis review to an executive exclusion policy, suggesting similar scrutiny for exclusion statutes. The Supreme Court has generally used deferential rational basis review in cases involving immigration laws. The cases of Mandel, Din, and Trump v. Hawaii outline the Executive's power to exclude aliens, with Mandel's \"facially legitimate and bona fide reason\" test governing claims of constitutional rights violations. Despite calls for more exacting review, the Court has not changed its approach to laws regulating alien entry. The Executive's power to exclude aliens is governed by the \"facially legitimate and bona fide reason\" test from the Mandel case. Challenges to exclusion decisions may involve consideration of extrinsic evidence of unconstitutional purpose. However, unresolved issues include the extent of the Executive's inherent exclusion power, challenges by U.S. persons on statutory grounds, and constitutional limits on broad delegations of congressional power for exclusion determinations. The Supreme Court's exclusion cases show that the Executive's authority to exclude aliens comes from congressional delegation. Cases like Mandel, Din, and Trump v. Hawaii emphasize the need for executive exclusion decisions to be based on statutory authority. For example, Trump v. Hawaii focused on whether the \"Travel Ban\" order fell within the President's authority under INA \u00a7 212(f) to suspend entry. This highlights the importance of a statutory basis for executive actions to exclude aliens. The Executive's authority to exclude aliens is debated, with some arguing for inherent authority while others require statutory authorization. Supreme Court cases suggest that Congress and the Executive may share power in regulating immigration. One pre-Mandel decision acknowledged the Executive's inherent authority to exclude aliens, but in the context of challenging congressional delegations of immigration authority. The case discusses the delegation of immigration authority to executive agencies and the limitations of the Executive's inherent exclusion authority. It highlights that the Constitution does not clearly define the Executive's power to exclude aliens independently of statutory authorization. The issue remains unresolved in Supreme Court precedent. The Supreme Court precedent does not definitively resolve the issue of executive exclusion decisions violating governing statutes. The weight of authority suggests that the power to exclude aliens belongs primarily to Congress, challenging separation of powers principles. The Supreme Court has not clearly established that the Executive cannot exclude aliens in violation of a statute or without statutory authorization. This lack of precedent may be due to Congress's broad delegation of exclusion authority to the Executive. The Executive's power to exclude aliens is primarily derived from statutes, making executive exclusion decisions susceptible to legal challenges. In Trump v. Hawaii, the Supreme Court rejected arguments that the \"Travel Ban\" violated immigration laws but did not address whether such challenges are barred by the doctrine of consular nonreviewability. Consular nonreviewability prohibits judicial review of visa denials unless they burden the constitutional rights of a U.S. citizen. The Mandel Court allowed U.S. citizens to challenge exclusion decisions on constitutional grounds. Trump v. Hawaii found statutory claims failed on the merits, leaving unanswered whether the Mandel exception applies to statutory claims by U.S. citizens. The doctrine of consular nonreviewability bars U.S. citizen challenges to visa denials on statutory grounds, unless constitutional claims are also raised. Some courts have held that reviewing purely statutory claims would undermine consular nonreviewability, while others have reviewed and rejected visa denials based on a combination of statutory and constitutional claims. The Ninth Circuit disagreed with the framework endorsed by other circuits, holding that statutory challenges to visa denials should receive stricter review than constitutional challenges. This led to a closer scrutiny of the government's justifications for excluding aliens in cases where the courts analyzed the statutory claims without deferring to the government's determination. The Supreme Court has rejected statutory challenges brought by U.S. citizens against the exclusion of aliens abroad without deciding on judicial review. In cases like Trump v. Hawaii and Sale v. Haitian Centers Council, the Court considered and rejected statutory challenges to immigration policies. The Sale Court did not address the consular nonreviewability issue, but assumed that statutory challenges to interdictions and forced returns were reviewable. Federal appellate courts have held that consular nonreviewability does not deprive courts of jurisdiction over statutory challenges brought by U.S. citizens against the exclusion of aliens abroad. The doctrine of consular nonreviewability bars statutory challenges by U.S. citizens against executive decisions to exclude aliens abroad, unless constitutional challenges are also raised. The Supreme Court has not definitively resolved this issue, but has reviewed combined statutory and constitutional challenges in Trump v. Hawaii and exclusively statutory challenges in Sale. Justice Kennedy in Din stated that Congress's power to exclude aliens makes executive exclusion decisions legitimate, but questions remain when Congress delegates exclusion power with few limits. Trump v. Hawaii suggests the Executive must adhere to constitutional guarantees when exercising delegated power from Congress. The Supreme Court emphasized the need for executive exclusion policies to comply with constitutional guarantees, especially when delegated power from Congress is involved. In cases like Trump v. Hawaii, the Court conducted a constrained level of judicial review to ensure that exclusion policies are based on justifications independent of unconstitutional grounds. The Court's avoidance of deciding on this issue in Mandel highlights the importance of constitutional restrictions on executive exclusion authority. The Mandel Court adopted the \"facially legitimate and bona fide\" standard for denying an inadmissibility waiver based on alleged prior visa abuse. This decision left open the possibility that the First Amendment could limit the executive branch's power to exclude based on political belief, but the Court did not make a definitive ruling on the issue. After Trump v. Hawaii, executive exclusion policies must be supported by justifications independent of unconstitutional grounds. The Executive's exercise of exclusion power delegated by Congress is restricted by constitutional guarantees. The Supreme Court has affirmed that decisions to exclude aliens abroad are largely immune from judicial control, with consular nonreviewability doctrine barring judicial review in most cases. The Mandel line of cases holds that even when such decisions burden U.S. citizens' constitutional rights, judicial review is limited. The Mandel line of cases emphasizes that federal courts must defer substantially to executive exclusion decisions, giving government the upper hand in challenges. While Supreme Court precedent suggests that the level of deference is within Congress's purview, the doctrine of consular nonreviewability and the Mandel line follow legislative inaction, limiting judicial review of executive decisions to exclude aliens abroad. Congress has the power to expand review through legislation."
