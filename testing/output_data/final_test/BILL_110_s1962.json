    "content": "The \"Regional Ground and Surface Water Enhancement Program Act of 2007\" authorizes a program to improve water quality and quantity through cooperative agreements with producers, governmental entities, and Indian tribes. The goal is to enhance conservation efforts on agricultural land through coordinated activities. The Secretary of Agriculture is responsible for developing goals and providing assistance for water improvement projects. SEC. 1240I of the Food Security Act of 1985 is amended to establish the Regional Ground and Surface Water Enhancement Program. This program aims to improve water quality and quantity through cooperative agreements with producers, governmental entities, and Indian tribes. The Secretary of Agriculture will oversee the development of goals and provide assistance for water improvement projects. The Regional Water Enhancement Program aims to improve water quality and quantity through various activities such as assessment, modeling, plan development, monitoring, restoration projects, land management incentives, conservation contracts, and irrigation system improvements. The Regional Water Enhancement Program focuses on improving water quality and quantity through activities like irrigation system improvements, water banking, groundwater recharge, and other conservation-related activities identified in partnership agreements with landowners and partners. The Secretary establishes a regional water enhancement program to prioritize areas for water quality and quantity improvement, including agricultural producers, government entities, and Indian tribes. The Secretary establishes a regional water enhancement program to improve water quality and quantity on a regional scale for agricultural and surrounding land. The program will be implemented by the Chief of the Natural Resources Conservation Service, and partners can submit grant proposals for consideration. Partners submitting proposals for the regional water enhancement program must identify the geographical area, water quality or quantity issues, and a method for determining a baseline. The regional water enhancement program requires partners to submit proposals with details on the proposed activities, timeline, budget, performance measures, and past and current regional water enhancement activities. The Secretary will select proposals based on these criteria. The Secretary will award grants competitively based on criteria including the inclusion of agricultural land, on-the-ground activities versus administrative costs, contribution to sustaining agricultural production or rural economic development, and performance measures for post-project evaluation. The proposed project aims to increase water availability for irrigated systems, improve land use efficiency, reduce nitrogen in the soil, and enhance pesticide and herbicide application efficiency. It also focuses on storing surface water runoff or recharging groundwater for agricultural use during the growing season through the construction of irrigation ponds and associated water transport infrastructure. The Secretary prioritizes proposals that facilitate water conservation measures resulting in savings for agricultural operations. Grants for regional water enhancement activities are multiyear but can be terminated early by the Secretary. The Secretary can terminate a grant early if performance measures are not met. Partnership agreements with grant recipients must outline duties, responsibilities, and effectiveness criteria for regional water enhancement activities. The Secretary may accept non-Federal funds for regional water enhancement activities. They can use general authorities to ensure all producers and landowners can participate. The Secretary must also coordinate with other programs for individual participation. The regional water enhancement program allows producers and landowners to participate in improving water quality and quantity. Activities must comply with State water laws. Funding of $100,000,000 per year from 2008 to 2012 is available from the Commodity Credit Corporation. The regional water enhancement program allows participation in improving water quality and quantity with funding of $100,000,000 per year from 2008 to 2012. Administrative expenses limited to 3 percent of funds available."
