There is ongoing debate over whether the act should be amended, with proponents citing its success in creating a more stable financial system and protecting consumers, while opponents blame it for restricted credit availability and slow economic recovery. The act is the largest source of new financial regulations since the crisis, but not the only one. This report summarizes the major provisions of Dodd-Frank and its relation to the financial crisis. The 111th Congress considered various proposals to reorganize financial regulators and reform financial regulation following the financial crisis. Chairman Barney Frank introduced the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2009 (H.R. 4173), which passed the House on December 11, 2009. Chairman Christopher Dodd issued the Restoring American Financial Stability Act of 2009, which was revised over the following months. The Restoring American Financial Stability Act of 2010, marked up in committee on March 22, 2010, was reported as S. 3217 on April 15, 2010. The Senate passed its version of H.R. 4173 on May 20, 2010, and it was signed into law on July 21, 2010 as P.L. 111-203. Other reform proposals were introduced but not scheduled for markup. The Consumer Protection and Regulatory Enhancement Act (H.R. 3310) was proposed along with an amendment (H.Amdt. 539) during House consideration of H.R. 4173. Various financial reform proposals were introduced following the financial crisis of 2008, including a blueprint by then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and legislative language by the Obama Administration. Systemic risk became a focal point of policy attention post-crisis, highlighting concerns about risks in the financial system. The financial system faced significant threats to economic stability, with the last major risk episode being the Great Depression. The events of 2007 and 2008 led to a reassessment of the system's self-stabilizing capacity. The Federal Reserve typically provided liquidity to stem panic, but the crisis highlighted concerns about systemic risks in the financial system. The financial system faced a sharp reassessment of its self-stabilizing capacity after the events of 2007 and 2008. Timothy Geithner highlighted the system's failure to efficiently allocate savings and risk, leading to global financial panic. Non-bank institutions, not just banks, experienced failures, with U.S. financial firms suffering heavy losses primarily due to declines in mortgage-related assets. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Merrill Lynch faced significant challenges during this period. In 2008, the financial crisis saw the failure of Lehman Brothers, triggering a run on money market funds. The Fed intervened with an $85 billion loan to AIG to prevent bankruptcy. Congress approved the $700 billion TARP program to address the panic in the financial markets. The financial crisis in 2008 led to the failure of Lehman Brothers and a run on money market funds. The Fed introduced lending facilities and the FDIC implemented a debt guarantee program for banks. The panic was rooted in the subprime mortgage market, causing major financial institutions to suffer losses from rising foreclosures and bad loans. This resulted in a ripple effect through the financial system. The 2008 financial crisis caused a $1 trillion setback in the U.S. housing market, leading to significant financial losses. Giant financial institutions faced liquidity runs, resulting in failures and rescues. Confidence in complex financial instruments waned, and risks became highly correlated. Doubts about counterparty exposure grew due to opacity in derivatives markets, exacerbating recessionary forces. Asset prices plummeted, causing sharp losses for consumers in their retirement and college savings accounts. The financial crisis of 2008 led to significant losses in the housing market and affected consumers' savings accounts and home values. The recession was the deepest since the Great Depression, prompting the Dodd-Frank Act to address systemic stability, transparency in financial markets, and consumer protection. The Act granted new authority to federal financial regulatory agencies to cope with failing financial firms and improve policy options. The financial crisis of 2008 highlighted systemic risks in the regulatory system, with no overarching regulator to mitigate these risks. Liquidity crises were not limited to depository institutions, and nonbank firms like Lehman Brothers and AIG were deemed \"too big to fail.\" Concerns arose about the breakdown of payment and clearing systems. The Dodd-Frank Act created the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to address systemic risks in the financial system. The council, composed of the Treasury Secretary and heads of federal regulatory agencies, has limited powers to identify and advise on sources of systemic risk but lacks rulemaking or enforcement authority. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) was created by the Dodd-Frank Act to address systemic risks in the financial system. It has limited powers to identify systemically important financial firms and subject them to stricter oversight and regulation by the Fed, including counterparty exposure limits, stress tests, resolution planning, and risk management standards. The act also included provisions to prevent firms from changing their charter to escape Fed regulation and imposed liability concentration limits for financial firms. Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act empowers the Fed to regulate large firms posing financial stability risks. It allows for regulation of systemically important PCS systems by the Fed, SEC, or CFTC, with access to the Fed's discount window in emergencies. The Fed engaged in emergency lending to nonbank financial firms during the recent financial turmoil under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. The Federal Reserve, under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, has the authority to authorize Federal reserve banks to discount notes, drafts, and bills of exchange for individuals, partnerships, or corporations. This lending can only occur if the borrower is unable to obtain credit elsewhere and if the loan is secured to the Fed's satisfaction. The Fed also created liquidity facilities for nonbank financial firms and lent $72.6 billion to purchase illiquid assets from Bear Stearns and AIG. This led to debates in Congress about amending the Fed's emergency lending powers, which were addressed in the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the Federal Reserve's lending authority by allowing collateralized loans through a broadly available credit facility, but not to single entities without Treasury Secretary approval. It also permitted the FDIC to establish emergency liquidity programs for bank holding companies. Additionally, the act mandated GAO audits of the Fed's lending facilities and actions during crises, with disclosure requirements for borrowers and borrowing terms. The Dodd-Frank Act prohibited regulated firms from selecting directors of regional Federal Reserve Banks and created a Vice Chair of Supervision on the Board of Governors. Corporate bankruptcies in the US aim to provide debtors with a fresh start by either liquidating assets or reorganizing debts to maximize returns to creditors. Federal law prohibits certain financial companies, like depository institutions, from filing for bankruptcy protection. Instead, these institutions are subject to a special resolution regime administered by the FDIC, known as conservatorship or receivership. This nonjudicial process allows the FDIC to either preserve the institution's assets as conservator or liquidate it as receiver, granting broad powers to the FDIC in the process. The FDIC as conservator or receiver has flexible powers to protect federally insured deposits of failed institutions. It aims to pay off or transfer deposits to another institution, often becoming the largest creditor. The FDIC must choose the \"least-cost resolution\" strategy but can waive it to prevent adverse economic effects. The Lehman Brothers bankruptcy and government assistance to AIG and Bear Stearns raised concerns about resolving large financial companies without destabilizing the system. Some suggested a special resolution regime similar to the C/R process for failed depositories to avoid taxpayer-funded bailouts. Opponents argued against this approach. Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act establishes the \"Orderly Liquidation Authority\" (OLA) as a resolution regime for certain financial companies, serving as a fallback alternative to the Bankruptcy Code in extraordinary circumstances. The Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) is a resolution regime for financial companies to be used in extraordinary circumstances when the Bankruptcy Code is not suitable. It is a nonjudicial, administrative process administered by the FDIC, with powers similar to those under the C/R regime for depositories. Unlike the C/R regime, OLA is available to a broader range of financial institutions. The Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) is available to a broad array of financial companies, including bank holding companies, thrift holding companies, and insurance holding companies, as well as many of their subsidiaries. OLA's primary objective is to liquidate failing financial companies that pose a significant risk to the financial stability of the United States in a way that minimizes risk and moral hazard. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates that failing financial companies under the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) should be liquidated without using taxpayer funds. The OLA's funding mechanism differs from the C/R regime for depositories, as the Orderly Liquidation Fund is not prefunded and the FDIC can borrow from the Treasury to fund resolutions. If the failed company's assets are insufficient to repay the borrowed funds, the FDIC can recover the shortfall from the financial industry. Securitization is the process of turning loans into securities for investors, reducing banks' risk by spreading it to other investors. Proper risk management can enhance financial stability, but mismanagement contributed to the financial crisis. Lenders benefit from origination fees and are not exposed to loan losses if they sell their loans, creating incentives. Private securitization in the subprime mortgage market led to deteriorating underwriting standards and widespread loan defaults. Losses in the mortgage-backed securities market caused a lack of confidence in financial firms due to uncertainty about their exposure to potential MBS losses. Requiring loan securitizers to retain a portion of the long-term default risk could address incentives in securitization. Requiring securitizers to retain a portion of the long-term default risk may help preserve underwriting standards and ensure they share risks with investors. However, this could raise credit costs and increase financial instability by concentrating risk in certain sectors. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates risk retention for asset-backed securities, with regulators setting rules based on asset quality. Retained risk can be less than 5% if underwriting standards are met. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates risk retention for asset-backed securities, with regulators setting rules based on asset quality. Retained risk can be less than 5% if underwriting standards are met. Securitizers are prohibited from hedging the retained credit risk. Certain exemptions are allowed for government-guaranteed securities. Due diligence on underlying assets and increased disclosure to investors are required for asset-backed securities. During the financial crisis, banks and bank-holding companies faced significant stress, leading to over 500 bank failures. This highlighted concerns such as capital requirements, regulatory fragmentation, and risky bank activities. Observers suggested that capital requirements should be stricter post-crisis, with BHCs facing similar standards as depositories to ensure safety and soundness. Interchange Fees. When a debit card is used for a purchase, the merchant pays an interchange fee to the bank that issued the card. This fee compensates for services like authorization, clearance, settlement, and fraud prevention. Network providers determine interchange fee rates. Network providers and issuing banks set interchange fees for debit card transactions, with merchants alleging market power abuse leading to above-market fees. Proponents of fee limits argue for eliminating anticompetitive pricing, while opponents warn of economic distortions from price restrictions. Regulatory examination ensures safety and soundness of commercial banks and similar institutions. The system of multiple bank regulators, including the Federal Reserve, OCC, FDIC, OTS, NCUA, and state authorities, faced criticism for inconsistent enforcement. Shortcomings in OTS's supervision of large institutions were highlighted during the crisis. Arguments for and against regulatory consolidation were debated, with concerns about potential disadvantages for smaller banks. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insures deposits up to a certain limit, funded by bank premiums. During the crisis, the FDIC temporarily raised the insured deposit amount to $250,000 due to increased bank failures. During the financial crisis, depositors with accounts over $100,000 faced risks as bank failures depleted the FDIC's funds. Calls were made for the FDIC to have more flexibility in collecting assessments and maintaining reserves. Concerns were raised about risky activities in banks, with some advocating for limits on activities like proprietary trading and hedge fund sponsorship to protect bank solvency and financial stability. The Collins Amendment of Dodd-Frank directed federal banking agencies to establish minimum capital requirements for insured depository institutions, BHCs, and nonbank financial companies to address risks and ensure financial stability. Critics argue that banning proprietary trading or hedge fund sponsorship is unnecessary and undermines financial stability. The Durbin Amendment in Title X of Dodd-Frank authorized the Federal Reserve Board to regulate interchange fees for debit card issuers. Small institutions were exempted from certain requirements. Dodd-Frank did not fully consolidate banking agencies but eliminated the Office of Thrift Supervision. The Dodd-Frank Act made changes to federal deposit insurance, raising the minimum DIF reserve ratio and eliminating the 1.5% maximum. It also permanently raised the insured deposit limit to $250,000. The Volcker Rule in the Act prohibits banks from proprietary trading of risky assets and certain relationships with risky investment funds. Exemptions are provided for trading activities deemed legitimate for banks. The Dodd-Frank Act introduced the Volcker Rule, which prohibits banks from engaging in proprietary trading of risky assets and certain relationships with risky investment funds. However, it exempts certain securities and trading activities that Congress deemed legitimate for banks. The Act also restructured federal consumer financial protection regulatory authority among various agencies. The banking agencies, including the OCC, Fed, FDIC, NCUA, and OTS, had varying regulatory jurisdictions based on institution type and financial activities. They were responsible for ensuring safety and soundness, as well as consumer compliance, of depository institutions within their purview. The focus of safety and soundness regulation is to ensure institutions are managed safely and profitably. Consumer compliance regulation ensures institutions follow consumer protection laws. Banking agencies have authority to conduct on-site examinations and enforce compliance. The FTC regulates nondepository financial companies. The FTC lacked upfront supervisory authority over nondepository financial companies, relying on enforcement actions triggered by consumer complaints. Federal consumer financial protection laws applied to both depository and nondepository institutions, ensuring consumer protections in various financial activities. Before the Dodd-Frank Act, the regulatory authority for federal consumer financial protection laws was fragmented among various agencies, leading to inefficiencies and inadequate consumer protection. Some argued for consolidating regulatory powers under a single regulator with a consumer-centric mission. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) as an independent agency with rulemaking, enforcement, and supervisory powers over consumer financial products and services. The CFPB is funded by nonappropriated funds from the Federal Reserve System and has regulatory authority over nondepository financial companies. Certain industries are exempt from CFPB regulation under the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB with supervisory authority over nondepository financial companies, consolidating federal consumer financial protection authority. Other agencies like the OCC, Fed, FDIC, NCUA, HUD, and FTC also have powers in this field. The law transferred primary consumer compliance authority over larger depositories to the CFPB, while banking agencies retain safety and soundness authority over both larger and smaller depositories. The CFPB has rulemaking authority over consumer laws and can prohibit unfair practices. It enforces consumer financial protection laws through penalties and restitution orders. Mortgage delinquency rates rose sharply in the US around 2006. Mortgage delinquency rates surged in the US, leading to the financial crisis by straining financial firms' balance sheets. Poorly performing mortgages had complex features like adjustable rates and negative amortization, with some considered predatory. Nontraditional mortgage terms were widely used, contributing to the crisis. Some observers believe that the widespread use of risky mortgage terms worsened the housing bubble and financial crisis. To prevent future losses, suggestions include limiting risky mortgage features and requiring lenders to offer traditional mortgage products alongside nontraditional ones. These actions may reduce mortgage failures but could also restrict consumer choice. The Dodd-Frank Act amended the Truth in Lending Act to set minimum standards for residential mortgages, including the Ability-to-Repay requirements. Lenders must ensure borrowers have the ability to repay based on verified income. Certain \"Qualified Mortgages\" with traditional terms are presumed to meet these requirements. The CFPB was directed to issue regulations to prevent mortgage originators from steering consumers towards risky or predatory mortgages. The Dodd-Frank Act amended the Truth in Lending Act to set standards for residential mortgages, including Ability-to-Repay requirements. It prohibited predatory practices and restricted prepayment penalties. Mortgage originators cannot receive compensation based on mortgage terms. Increased disclosures to consumers were required, including information on how mortgage features may impact them. The act also included new requirements for \"high-cost mortgages,\" such as limitations on terms and mandatory prepurchase counseling for borrowers. Derivatives are financial contracts tied to underlying asset prices, categorized as futures, options, and swaps. Swaps are traded in an over-the-counter market exempt from regulation by the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. The collapse of AIG in 2008 highlighted risks of large OTC derivatives positions without collateral or margin requirements, leading to a significant taxpayer bailout. The Dodd-Frank Act mandated centralized clearing and exchange-trading of many OTC derivatives, aiming to reduce systemic stability threats and taxpayer bailouts. The Act gave regulatory authority over swaps to the Commodities Futures Trading Commission and security-based swaps to the SEC. This move was in response to the opacity in the OTC market during the financial crisis, which made it challenging to assess firms' risk exposures. Calls for changes in derivatives regulation arose, questioning whether OTC markets should adopt features of regulated markets. The Dodd-Frank Act mandated centralized clearing and exchange-trading of many OTC derivatives, with exemptions for certain market participants. Swaps that must be cleared also need to be traded on an exchange for price transparency. End users, non-financial entities hedging commercial risk, are exempt from clearing requirements but must inform regulators how they meet financial obligations for uncleared swaps. Registration, capital, and margin requirements are imposed on swap dealers and major participants. The Dodd-Frank Act mandated centralized clearing and exchange-trading of many OTC derivatives, with exemptions for certain market participants. It requires regulators to impose margin requirements on certain swaps that remain uncleared by any clearinghouse and reporting of all swaps to swap data repositories. Section 716, known as the \"swaps pushout rule,\" prohibited federal assistance to any swaps entity but included exemptions for large commercial banks to hedge their risk without becoming ineligible for federal assistance. Depository institutions were allowed to establish a supervised affiliate that was a swap entity. The Dodd-Frank Act mandated centralized clearing and exchange-trading of many OTC derivatives, with exemptions for certain market participants. Section 716 of the Act prohibited federal assistance to any swaps entity but allowed large commercial banks to hedge their risk through supervised affiliates. An omnibus appropriations bill narrowed the scope of Section 716. Credit rating agencies evaluate the creditworthiness of bonds and can be designated as Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations by the SEC in exchange for compliance with regulations. The Dodd-Frank Act mandated centralized clearing and exchange-trading of many OTC derivatives, with exemptions for certain market participants. Credit rating agencies evaluate the creditworthiness of bonds and can be designated as Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations by the SEC in exchange for compliance with regulations. Historically, the provision of investment-grade ratings by the three dominant CRAs\u2014Moody's, Standard & Poor's, and Fitch\u2014was crucial in structuring residential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations during the financial crisis. Many observers believed that the leading CRAs failed in their rating of these securities, contributing to the market collapse. The Dodd-Frank Act enhanced SEC regulation of credit rating agencies by establishing the SEC Office of Credit Ratings, imposing new requirements on NRSROs, setting new legal standards, and removing references to NRSRO ratings from federal statutes. This was in response to criticism of the agencies' issuer-pays model, which was seen as potentially biased towards providing favorable ratings. The Act aimed to address these issues and mitigate bias in the rating process. The Dodd-Frank Act directed the SEC to study a public utility/self-regulatory body to assign NRSROs for credit ratings of structured finance products. The study recommended a roundtable discussion on alternative business models. The public utility system has not been implemented. Bernard Madoff was arrested in 2008 for a massive Ponzi scheme involving billions of client funds through his securities firm. Bernard Madoff was arrested in 2008 for running a massive Ponzi scheme through his securities firm, which was regulated by FINRA and the SEC. This event raised concerns about investor protection and the SEC's funding. There have been debates about giving the SEC budgetary independence to bridge the resource gap with regulated entities, but critics argue it could compromise agency accountability. Broker-dealers, regulated by FINRA, must provide suitable investment recommendations based on the investor's circumstances. SEC-registered investment advisers have a fiduciary duty to prioritize their client's best interests. There is overlap in the services provided by both, leading to concerns about customers assuming a fiduciary duty. The Dodd-Frank Act established an Investor Advisory Committee within the SEC to advise on regulatory priorities for investor protection. The Dodd-Frank Act created an Office of the Investor Advocate within the SEC and enhanced rewards for whistleblowers of securities fraud. It also required a study on the standards of care for broker-dealers and investment advisers, recommending a uniform fiduciary standard. Financial advisors in municipal securities markets were required to register with the SEC under the Act. The Dodd-Frank Act requires financial advisors in municipal securities markets to register with the SEC and allows the SEC to establish a Reserve Fund for its operations. Congress has rescinded $25 million from the fund in two years, which the SEC has used to modernize its information technology. The SEC has used the Reserve Fund to modernize its information technology. Hedge funds are privately organized investment vehicles with potential risks, as seen in the LTCM collapse in 1998. Hedge fund failures did not play a major role in the 2008 financial crisis. The collapse of LTCM in 1998 revealed systemic issues leading Congress to consider laws for hedge funds. Prior to Dodd-Frank Act, most hedge funds were not required to register with the SEC due to exemptions in the ICA and IAA. Section 3(c)(1) and 3(c)(7) exempted certain issuers from being deemed investment companies. The ICA and IAA exempt certain companies from being considered investment companies and require investment advisers to register with the SEC, except for those under the private adviser exemption. Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, advisers were not required to register with the SEC if they did not hold themselves out as investment advisers, had fewer than 15 clients, and did not advise registered investment companies. The Act preserved exemptions for hedge funds and private pooled investment vehicles, defining \"private funds\" based on their use of these exemptions. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the \"private adviser\" exemption in the Investment Advisers Act, requiring advisers to private funds with over $150 million in assets to register with the SEC. This change aimed to provide the government access to information about hedge funds' size, trading strategies, and market positions to monitor systemic risk in future financial crises. The Dodd-Frank Act raised the asset threshold for SEC registration of investment advisers to funds that are not investment companies from $25 million to $100 million. It addressed concerns about incentive compensation arrangements at financial firms creating excessive risks and included executive compensation provisions for all public companies. Dodd-Frank required the SEC to issue rules affecting all companies listed on a stock exchange. The Dodd-Frank Act required the SEC to issue rules affecting all companies listed on a stock exchange, including clawing back executive compensation for noncompliance with financial disclosure requirements. It also aimed to prohibit risky incentive compensation arrangements at financial institutions with over $1 billion in assets and mandated public companies to disclose CEO pay ratios and allow shareholders to vote on executive compensation every three years. The Dodd-Frank Act granted the SEC authority for shareholder proxy access and \"say on pay\" votes on executive compensation. There were debates on federalizing insurance regulation after the financial crisis highlighted the systemic importance of some insurance companies. The financial crisis highlighted the need for federal regulation of insurance, but the financial regulatory reform debate focused on creating a Federal Insurance Office within the Treasury Department. This office gathers information, advises on insurance issues, and has limited preemptive power over state insurance laws. The Dodd-Frank Act exempted insurers from oversight by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and established regulations for systemically important insurers. Insurers may also be subject to resolution by a special authority at the holding company level. The Federal Reserve oversees insurers with depository subsidiaries after the Office of Thrift Supervision was abolished. The Collins Amendment could have imposed additional capital requirements on insurers overseen by the Federal Reserve. The Dodd-Frank Act amended provisions on insurers overseen by the Federal Reserve, allowing flexibility in implementation. It also streamlined state regulation of surplus lines insurance and reinsurance. The Act included miscellaneous provisions in various titles, such as improving access to mainstream financial institutions and reducing the TARP amount authorized to $475 billion. The Dodd-Frank Act reduced the TARP amount authorized to $475 billion from $700 billion and prohibited the Treasury from using repaid TARP funds for new investments. Title XV required assessments of IMF loans to middle-income nations with high public debt. Companies using minerals from Congo must disclose due diligence measures to the SEC. The Dodd-Frank Act requires companies to disclose payments to foreign governments for mineral extraction rights and mine safety violations. Section 342 establishes an office to promote diversity and equal opportunity for women and minority-owned businesses at Treasury offices and financial regulators."
