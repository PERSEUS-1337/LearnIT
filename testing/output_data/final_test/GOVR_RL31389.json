    "content": "The U.S.-led effort in Afghanistan aims to defeat the Taliban and establish a stable, moderate Afghan state to prevent it from becoming a terrorist base. The Bush Administration recognizes the importance of creating stability in Afghanistan to avoid wider repercussions in Pakistan and Central Asia. The United States aims to play a major role in promoting economic development and political stability in Afghanistan, alongside NATO allies, Japan, the United Nations, and international financial institutions. This includes denying sanctuary to terrorists, maintaining influence in Pakistan, curbing drug trafficking, and potentially creating alternative routes for Central Asian oil and gas exports. The future U.S. role in Afghanistan and the adjacent region is likely to be a focus of interaction between the Administration and Congress in 2002. Congress strongly supports American involvement in supporting the government led by Karzai and advocates for more aid, prompt delivery of aid, and an expanded U.S. role in peacekeeping. H.R. 3994 (Hyde), the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act of 2002, was introduced to authorize economic and democratic development assistance for Afghanistan and military assistance for certain foreign countries. The bill H.R. 3994, known as the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act of 2002, authorizes military assistance for Afghanistan and other countries. It addresses U.S. policy towards humanitarian relief, economic reconstruction, narcotics suppression, and support for a democratic Afghanistan. The bill allocates about $1.05 billion in appropriations from FY2002 to FY2005. A Senate version, S. 2712, was introduced by Senator Chuck Hagel. This report analyzes the current situation in Afghanistan since the overthrow of the last Afghan King in 1973. The report discusses four scenarios for Afghanistan's future, considering the Communist coup, Soviet occupation, civil war, and Taliban rule. It analyzes factors influencing Afghanistan's political future and suggests key policy areas for the United States and Congress to consider. An appendix includes documents related to the Bonn Agreement of December 2001. The report will be updated in response to major political developments. The CRS Report RL30588 provides comprehensive coverage of Afghanistan and U.S. policy issues. Another report, RL31355, focuses on humanitarian and reconstruction assistance in Afghanistan. The stability of Afghanistan hinges on establishing a political process with support from ethnic groups and ordinary Afghans seeking peace. The struggle in Afghanistan involves moderate reform, economic modernization, Islamic fundamentalism, and Marxism. Efforts towards stability began in 2001 with the creation of an Interim Administration and plans for a new constitution. The delegation in 2001 was more diverse on paper than in reality. The 23 signatories to the December 2001 agreement represented four anti-Taliban groups: The Northern Alliance, the Rome Process, the Cyprus Group, and the Peshwar Group. The Northern Alliance had significant military power and allied with U.S. forces. The Rome and Peshwar groups were mainly composed of Western-educated professionals and former urbanized Pashtun elite. Pashtun commanders in Southern Afghanistan were not directly represented in the negotiations. The 28-member multi-ethnic interim Afghan administration was inaugurated on December 22, 2001, with Hamid Karzai as the head. The administration included two women leading the ministries of women's affairs and health. A roadmap for a democratic political structure was agreed upon, leaving details for the future. Karzai was confirmed as head of a Transitional Administration in June 2002 after a successful Emergency Loya Jirga. The Loya Jirga confirmed Karzai as head of the Transitional Administration, overseeing government organization, constitution drafting, and election preparation. Complaints arose from groups feeling underrepresented, including Pashtun tribes and other ethnic groups. Stability and modernization of Afghanistan's political history are crucial for creating a stable and moderate state. The establishment of Afghanistan as a nation-state in 1747 under Ahmad Shah Durrani's rule marked a period of dynastic changes and survival as a buffer state between expanding empires. In the 20th century, Afghanistan saw shifts between Western and Soviet modernization efforts and rural power struggles led by Pashtun leaders and Muslim clerics. The traditional power structure in Afghanistan included tribal chieftains, local notables, commanders, and Muslim clerics like mullahs and influential pirs. Modernization progressed faster among Tajiks, Uzbeks, and cosmopolitan residents of Kabul. Pashtun tribes in Southern Afghanistan were more resistant to centralization. The Pashtun dominance in Afghanistan has caused resentment among minority groups like the Tajiks, Uzbeks, and Hazaras. The Tajiks and Uzbeks have connections to Iran and Uzbekistan respectively, both following Sunni Islam. The Hazaras are a Shi'a Muslim minority with ties to Central Asia and Iran. The language divide between tribal Pashtuns and other Afghans is evident, with Dari being more widely spoken than Pashto. The conversion of Afghanistan from a tribal society to a nation state has been a slow process with frequent periods of violent traditionalist reaction. Every Afghan king in the past century was either assassinated or deposed, including Habibullah Khan and Amanullah Khan who were modernizers but faced challenges. Aminullah's modernization policies, including women's emancipation, faced violent opposition from mullahs and tribal leaders. He introduced reforms such as creating the Afghan Royal Air Force, outlawing polygamy, and establishing compulsory education. Durrani rule was briefly interrupted by Bacha-i Saqqo, a Tajik interloper, which Pashtuns viewed as a humiliation. The modern Afghan state reached its peak under Zahir Shah, who cautiously modernized while maintaining distance from foreign powers. His efforts inadvertently led to the rise of new social and political forces that undermined his rule. Zahir Shah ascended the throne at 19 and initially left government to relatives. He took charge in 1963 after economic devastation caused by his cousin's policies. Despite efforts to reduce royal family's role and introduce limited democratic features, his liberalization program failed due to his lack of assertiveness and elite's fear of being displaced. Zahir Shah and his advisors expanded the central government, army, police, and education system. However, the government was seen as repressive and corrupt, with economic modernization not enough to lift Afghanistan out of underdevelopment. The middle class in Kabul saw some positive changes. The middle class in Kabul and other cities grew significantly from the end of World War II to the early 1970s. Public frustration increased due to the government's inability to manage the economic and physical infrastructure provided by aid donors. The rise of Marxist and Radical Islamist conflict was fueled by the political opening from the 1964 constitution, leading to the founding of the Marxist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan in 1965. The emergence of the radical left in Afghanistan was paralleled by the growth of a radical Islamist movement in the mid-1960s. The Marxist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan split between a Pashtun Kalq movement and a more moderate Parcham wing, while the Islamist ranks divided along ethnic and generational lines. The followers of Professor Burnhanuddin Rabbani and \"Engineer\" Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, leaders of Jamiat-i-Islami and Hezb-i-Islami respectively, represented ethnic and generational divisions in Afghanistan. Afghan foreign policy under Zahir Shah focused on reclaiming Pashtun territories lost to British India, influencing the country's political history. After Pakistan and India gained independence in 1947, territories became part of Pakistan's Northwest Frontier Province. Afghanistan remained loosely tied to Afghanistan through trade, nomadic grazing, and family connections. The Paktunistan campaign strained relations with Pakistan, leading to chronic tensions and dependence on the Soviet Union for aid and military support. Ultimately, King Zahir Shah sought and received the resignation of his cousin, Mohammad Daoud, due to the harm caused to the Afghan economy. The King sought and received his cousin's resignation, leading to Daoud overthrowing the monarchy and becoming President of the first Afghan republic. Afghan irredentism and the U.S. Cold War alliance with Pakistan caused friction in U.S.-Afghan relations, pushing Kabul into the Soviet orbit. The U.S. rejection of Kabul's requests for military aid resulted in the USSR becoming Afghanistan's main arms supplier, giving Moscow extensive influence within the Afghan military. The Soviets also built military airfields in Bagram, Mazar-i-Sharif, and Shindand. The United States constructed military airfields and infrastructure in Afghanistan, contested for influence with the U.S.S.R., and provided economic assistance for various projects. Key visits by Vice-President Richard M. Nixon, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and King Zahir Shah highlighted the relationship between the two countries. In 1973, Daoud overthrew the monarchy in Afghanistan and established the Republic of Afghanistan with Soviet-trained army officers. He became president with a single-party legislature, approved a new constitution, and reversed previous policies. After overthrowing the monarchy in 1973, Daoud initially used leftist allies to suppress Islamic militants. However, he later turned on them in the mid-1970s, purging leftists from the army and cracking down on the PDPA. Daoud also distanced himself from the Soviet Union, cultivated relations with the Shah of Iran and the Saudi monarchy, and improved ties with Pakistan. Despite these efforts, Afghanistan remained impoverished with little economic infrastructure. Daoud's repression of both Islamists and leftists, along with his disregard for parliament, led to his assassination in a coup by leftist army officers and the PDPA in 1978. After Daoud's assassination in 1978 by leftist army officers and the PDPA, Afghanistan saw the end of over 230 years of Durrani Pashtun rule. The overthrow led to a diaspora of the country's educated elite and the collapse of the old order. The Afghan communists attempted progressive social changes, but their lack of understanding of rural traditions and clumsy efforts provoked widespread rebellion. The PDPA's internal split further exacerbated the situation. The bitter split between the Kalq and Parcham factions of the PDPA, led by Taraki and Amin, brought the Afghan government to the brink of collapse. The revolution also gave rise to violent radical groups. In 1979, U.S. Ambassador Dubs was kidnapped and killed in unclear circumstances. The Khalqis gained power in 1978, leading to the expulsion of Babrak Karmal and other Parchamites. In the summer of 1978, Babrak Karmal and other pro-Soviet Parchamites were sent into exile. The split in the PDPA led to rebellions due to Prime Minister Amin's reckless policies. Amin organized the murder of Taraki in October 1979 and seized power. The Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in December 1979 to prevent the collapse of the PDPA government. The Soviet invasion led to the killing of Amin and his replacement by Babrak Karmal. The anti-Soviet campaign by the Afghan mujahidin intensified ethnic, tribal, religious, and ideological divisions in Afghan society, hindering national reconciliation. The war boosted Islamic extremism and exacerbated power rivalries among leaders. The rise of radical Islam in reaction to modernization and Western influences, as well as power rivalries among leaders, played a significant role in the anti-Soviet resistance in Afghanistan. Islamist political leaders were often educated and held positions of social influence, with real power tending to flow to younger leaders with Islamist leanings but secular backgrounds. The rise of radical Islam in Afghanistan was fueled by power rivalries among leaders and support from foreign powers like Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Iran. Osama bin Laden and other Saudis promoted their radical Sunni Islam among the mujahidin. The power struggle after the Soviet withdrawal led to the rise of the Taliban. The power struggle in Afghanistan after the Soviet withdrawal involved the communist government led by Najibullah, Afghan army, Alliance parties, and field commanders. Regional power rivalries and ambitions hindered agreement on power division, leading to a new period of misery. Efforts to broker a peace settlement in 1991 and 1992 were unsuccessful. The final version of the peace plan, accepted by most parties and foreign backers, outlined a transitional authority leading to free and fair elections within two years. Efforts to reach a settlement were hindered by dissension among mujahidin parties and Najibullah's decision to retract his resignation commitment. The deadlock was broken by General Dostum, who joined forces with Ahmed Shah Masud. General Dostum's alliance with Ahmed Shah Masud resolved a power struggle in favor of the Tajiks, blocking Najibullah's escape to the Soviet Union. Najibullah sought asylum at the United Nations compound, where he was later executed by the Taliban. With Hekmatyar sidelined, the new Islamic Republic of Afghanistan was predominantly non-Pashtun. The presidency was initially planned to rotate among mujahidin leaders, but this changed after the first president, Sibghatullah Mojadedi. After Mojadedi, Rabbani refused to give up the presidency, leading to factional fighting in Kabul. Hekmatyar's forces destroyed much of the city, reducing the population. Rabbani and Masud briefly made a deal with Hekmatyar but were later defeated by the Taliban. Hekmatyar fled to Iran, while Rabbani and Masud sought refuge in the Panjsher Valley with limited Russian support. After reclaiming the presidency, Rabbani took the credentials of the Afghan Islamic Republic of Afghanistan with him. The rise of the Taliban post-9/11 and the anti-terrorist war in Afghanistan has been well-documented. The Taliban were initially welcomed for bringing an end to warfare and disorder, especially in Pashtun areas, which is still crucial for commercial interests and ordinary Afghans. They also recruited tribal members to consolidate power. The Taliban recruited tribal leaders motivated by self-interest rather than ideology, leading to a Pashtun resurgence and polarization in Afghanistan. Mullah Mohammad Omar's preference to rule from Kandahar symbolized the cultural alienation of Pashtun conservatives from the Tajik-dominated Northern Alliance. The period of 1992-1996 in Bagram and adjacent areas saw oppression and misrule, especially among Pashtuns. The goal of a stable and moderate Afghan state depends on various internal and external factors. Understanding past contributing factors, current status, claimants to power, and possible scenarios is crucial for reconstructing a stable state. Many Afghans look back to Zahir Shah's reign for guidance. During Zahir Shah's reign (1933-1973), Afghanistan experienced stability under the Durani Pashtun tribe. However, this stability was temporary and eventually led to political instability and the overthrow of the monarchy. Today, Afghanistan lacks many characteristics of its past under the monarchy or Daoud's Republic. Sources of legitimacy were tied to the king and senior officials being from the Durani Pashtun tribe. During Zahir Shah's reign, his legitimacy was initially accepted but later contested by various groups. The overthrow of Zahir Shah led to a decrease in the state's legitimacy. Currently, the Transitional Administration's legitimacy with ordinary Afghans is based on Karzai's acceptability, international support, and the promise of a democratic future. The legitimacy of the current Afghan government is contested by opponents such as Taliban, warlords, and radical Islamists. Ethnic balance is crucial in Afghanistan, with Pashtuns forming a plurality but facing conflict with Tajiks, Uzbeks, and Hazaras. Pashtun control over power has been historically maintained through informal agreements. The informal social compact in Afghanistan historically allowed Pashtun control over power while allowing space for Tajiks and Uzbeks to participate in administration and dominate commercial life. Positive relations between the central government and local power centers have been key to stability, but modernization has strained this relationship. The breakdown of the administration in Afghanistan since the Marxist coup in 1978 has made it challenging to reestablish a functioning nation state. Past stability relied on a balance between the state and Islam, but this balance was disrupted by the rise of Islamist movements. The Taliban's theocratic system eliminated the state apparatus, leading to resistance from Islamists. The breakdown of the administration in Afghanistan since the Marxist coup in 1978 has disrupted the balance between the state and Islam. The Taliban's theocratic system largely eliminated the state apparatus, leading to resistance from Islamists and traditionalists. Foreign powers have played a critical role in Afghan history, with Afghanistan serving as a corridor for conquerors in the past. The collapse of the Durrani Dynasty in Afghanistan led to extensive foreign intervention, including Soviet occupation and support from various countries like the United States, Pakistan, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. The Taliban's rise to power was backed by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, while Russia and Iran supported opposing forces. After 9/11, a coalition formed to remove the Taliban, involving the United States, Russia, and former Soviet Central Asian republics. Iran's involvement in Afghan affairs post-Taliban defeat has raised concerns, with reported support to Ismail Khan and General Dostum. Pakistan's influence in Afghanistan has diminished, requiring reconciliation of competing interests for a legitimate government. The Afghan political landscape is complex, likened to a Rubik's Cube. The Afghan political matrix resembles a Rubik's Cube with layers of independent actors based on ethnicity and regional warlords. Ethnic divisions hinder national unity, with Tajik-Pashtun rivalry being a core issue. Warlords like General Mohammad Fahim and General Rashid Dostum play significant roles in Afghan politics. Key Afghan political figures include Mohammad Fahim, Rashid Dostum, Ismail Khan, Gul Agha Shirzai, and various Pashtun tribal leaders. Nangahar Province was previously controlled by Haji Abdul Qadir, who was assassinated in Kabul after accepting the post of vice-president. In early July 2002, after accepting the post of vice-president, key Afghan political figures gathered in Kabul. Among them were remnants of the Taliban, tribal leaders, and various ideologically-oriented political party leaders, including modernists, moderate Islamists, and Islamic radicals like Burnhanuddin Rabbani and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, once supported by Pakistan's ISI and a major recipient of CIA aid during the anti-Soviet war, was targeted by the CIA in an attack near Kabul. Rabbani, a traditionalist from Badakhshan Province, is known for his hostility towards Western influence. Yunis Khalis, a Pashtun leader, heads a different faction of Hezb-i-Islami and has led men in combat. Yunis Khalis, an 87-year-old Pashtun leader, still holds influence among Eastern Pashtun tribes in the region around Jalalabad. Rabbani, a political \"Godfather\" of the Northern Alliance, faces challenges from younger leaders like General Mohammad Fahim and Younis Qanooni. The \"Panjsheri Tajik triumvirate\" now holds key ministries despite Rabbani's objections. Abdul Rasoon is among the most pan-Islamic members inclined towards cooperation with Islamic terrorists. Abdul Rasoon Sayyaf and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, backed by Saudi Arabia, are linked to an alleged plot against the Interim Administration in Kabul. Hekmatyar seeks support from Iran and has aligned with former Taliban opponents. Traditional rural leaders in Afghanistan struggle to regain influence after decades of conflict. The new forces of local power in Afghanistan, including commanders and militia leaders, are vying for dominance and control over revenue sources. Economic interests in the country are influenced by various groups such as the transport mafia, drug kingpins, and smugglers. Exiles, including businessmen and former civil servants, also play a role in the economic landscape. The Tajik component of the Northern Alliance is considered the strongest in the region. The Northern Alliance in Afghanistan has strong military forces and political structure led by Rabbani's Jamiat-i-Islami. They receive support from various groups including Uzbeks, Hazaras, and some Pashtuns. The organization benefits from powerful foreign patrons like Russia, Iran, Uzbekistan, and the United States. General Dostum, a prominent Uzbek warlord, controls a vital road connection with Central Asia. Pashtuns are divided by tribal loyalties, while Hazaras have been historically repressed. The Hazaras, a Shi'a minority group, have gained assertiveness due to their role in the anti-Soviet campaign and fight against the Taliban. Led by Karim Khalili, they are organized under Hizb-e-Wahadat and will fight for autonomy if threatened. Swing groups like the Shinwaris in southeastern Afghanistan also play a significant role in the complex political landscape. The Shinwaris, residing in Nangahar Province and areas around Jalalabad and the Kyber Pass, have a history of drug production, smuggling, and resisting Durrani supremacy. They have allied with Tajik and dissident Pashtun groups in the past. During the anti-Soviet war, they supported radical mujahidin groups and assisted U.S. forces in Tora Bora, potentially aiding Al Qaeda's escape. Nangarhar Province's opium production and strategic location make it a hotspot for conflict among powerful factions. In Nangahar Province, internecine conflict among powerful commanders and tribal leaders has intensified post-Taliban era. The power struggle is driven by negative motives like ethnic nationalism, personal power aspirations, and control of transportation routes. The struggle for power in Afghanistan involves control of transportation routes, drug trade, and ethnic tensions between Pashtuns and Tajiks. The government lacks security capabilities until power issues are resolved, but international aid offers incentives for progress. The prospect of $10-15 billion in international aid incentivizes Afghans to cooperate with the Interim Administration, but aid delivery is slow due to power struggles. Despite awareness of past conflicts, the civil war continues as some factions fight for control and personal power. The civil war in Afghanistan continues as factions fight for control and personal power, hindering the construction of a stable and economically viable state. The collapse of the Durrani ascendancy and the rise of Tajik power suggest that past conflicts have destroyed the old Afghan polity. The scattering of the Afghan elite and the polarization of Pashtun society make it unlikely for Durrani political dominance to be reestablished. The return of King Zahir Shah may offer some support to the political process. The return of King Zahir Shah after 30 years of exile may support the political process, but cannot restore the previous status quo. The attempt by relatives of the king to gain a direct role in governance was thwarted by Karzai, Panjsheri Tajik leaders, and the United States. Tajiks, particularly Ismail Khan, hold significant power in Kabul and the Northeast, while General Dostum's control of Mazar-i-Sharif is being challenged. Kandahar, Jalalabad, and other key cities remain important population centers. The breakdown of the royalist governing structure in Afghanistan has led to instability, with no clear leader or group emerging in the Pashtun South and Southeast. The inability of the mujahidin or the Taliban to establish a stable government suggests that democratic processes may be the key to stability at both provincial and central levels. Despite decades of civil war, many Afghans are politically mobilized and unlikely to accept a return to traditional autocratic rule. A situation with a weak government in Kabul and control by regional warlords may provide temporary stability but is not a long-term solution. The future of the Afghan state depends on various factors, including the actions of main contenders for power, neighboring countries' interventions, and the role of the United States and the international community. Different outcomes are possible, with a workable constitutional model being crucial for achieving stability and cooperation across ethnic, tribal, and ideological lines. The most desirable outcome for Afghanistan and U.S. interests is the formation of a transitional authority leading to a pluralistic democracy. The success of the Bonn agreement is crucial, but uncertainties remain about the Transitional Administration and future political system. Incentives like international aid may promote cooperation among current members of the administration in Kabul. The success of the Bonn agreement is crucial for Afghanistan and U.S. interests, but uncertainties remain about the Transitional Administration and future political system. Incentives like international aid may promote cooperation among current members of the administration in Kabul, but gaining the cooperation of warlords and commanders in main cities and provinces remains questionable. The collapse of Pashtun political cohesiveness and the Tajiks' control of key ministries pose obstacles to ethnic harmony. A government with a broadly accepted claim to legitimacy would benefit from a representative legislature. The rise and fall of the Taliban have strengthened the position of minority ethnic groups in the Northern Alliance, which effectively controls over half of the country. The Northern Alliance holds sway over more than half of Afghanistan and its borders, except with Pakistan. The main ethnic components - Tajiks, Uzbeks, and Hazaras - may not have fully learned from past conflicts. Some leaders aim to create personal fiefdoms, while Panjsheri Tajiks, led by Marshal Fahim, retain power within the Alliance. The replacement of Yunis Qanooni as interior minister by Taj Muhammad Wardak is not seen as a significant reduction of Tajik control in the Karzai administration. Non-Tajiks appointed to other ministries may not integrate into the governing power structure, risking the perception of Tajik dominance. The former Northern Alliance's limited influence in the southern Pashtun region could lead to de facto partition, potentially causing the Afghan state to disappear if divisions remain unresolved, with severe regional consequences. If divisions in Afghanistan remain unresolved, neighboring countries may compete for control over adjacent areas. Countries facing Islamic extremism or ethnic revolts, like Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, would not want a \"no man's land\" on their borders. Russia would also be interested in preventing the establishment of havens for armed independence movements. The de facto partition could benefit Russia by ensuring oil and gas from Central Asia flow through them. Afghanistan's western and southern neighbors are particularly concerned about potential consequences. Neighboring countries like Iran and Pakistan have a strong interest in influencing Afghan affairs. Iran aims to extend its influence over western Afghanistan and protect co-religionists in the Hazarajat region. Pakistan, while currently cooperating with the United States, may support Afghan allies to stabilize the Pashtun belt and contest power in Kabul if chaos ensues. Potential allies could come from leaders affiliated with Karzai, remnants of the Taliban, or other factions. Many analysts are concerned about the current situation in Afghanistan, which resembles a form of disintegration with a unified government lacking real power or resources. Regional warlords and local councils hold authority in various areas, potentially leading to ethnic cleansing and humanitarian crises. The potential consequences of Afghanistan's descent into chaos include humanitarian crises, human rights abuses, internal displacement, border security concerns, and threats to U.S. interests such as access to resources, terrorism, and drug production. Maintaining stability in Afghanistan is crucial to prevent these negative outcomes. The consequences of failing to stabilize Afghanistan could lead to the establishment of an Afghan-staffed caretaker government supported by foreign advisors and international peacekeepers to maintain security. This approach would require the acceptance of the international community by the Afghans and warlords to prevent ongoing civil strife. Basic security, services, and reconstruction in densely populated areas could attract Afghans to seek the benefits of international support. The potential scenario in Afghanistan involves an interim government made up of acceptable figures from various ethnic groups, with technocratic qualifications. Foreign advisors may assist the government, but prolonged foreign involvement could lead to a military and political quagmire. Key factors will determine which scenario prevails. The potential scenarios in Afghanistan's interim government will be influenced by key factors, some externally influenced and others determined by Afghans themselves. Progress hinges on parties agreeing on power-sharing. Despite achieving a stable power balance, Afghan leaders' instinct to compete for control and extract resources from the population hinders centralized institution-building. The results of the June 2002 Emergency Loya Jirga are crucial in overcoming these obstacles. Observers generally view the Emergency Loya Jirga in mid-June 2002 as a success despite divisive and chaotic sessions. The assembly confirmed Karzai as head of the new Transitional Administration, defeating a bid to promote the ex-King as President. Delegates engaged in a free and unruly debate, bringing some satisfaction to participants. The Emergency Loya Jirga in mid-June 2002 was viewed as a success despite divisive sessions. Islamic extremists had little influence, and the country was declared an Islamic republic. The conclave featured debates instead of violence, with appointed women actively participating. Karzai removed Amanullah Zadran from his cabinet due to his brother's challenge to Kabul's authority. The selection process for delegates was uneven, with powerful warlords reportedly influencing it in some provinces. The outcome of the Emergency Loya Jirga in mid-June 2002 reflected the dominance of the government by two groups - Panjshiri Tajiks of the Northern Alliance and Afghans associated with the \"Afghan diaspora.\" Despite efforts to coopt regional warlords, Karzai's strategy failed, leading to continued regional autonomy by figures like Ismail Khan and General Dostum. The outcome of the Emergency Loya Jirga in mid-June 2002 showed the dominance of the government by Panjshiri Tajiks and Afghans from the \"Afghan diaspora.\" Despite attempts to include regional warlords, Karzai's plan failed, resulting in continued regional autonomy, particularly by figures like Ismail Khan and General Dostum. The delegates did not agree on a specific plan for creating a legislature, leading Karzai to suggest a council of 45 Loya Jirga members to come up with a proposal. The reestablishment of normal life may not provide enough jobs for former combatants, potentially leading them to join warlords or study in Islamic madrassas. One significant problem in Afghanistan and Pakistan is the challenge of supporting large families of Afghan emigres on family farmsteads. Industrial development, including food processing and textile manufacturing, is necessary to absorb surplus workers. Resistance to economic modernization, especially in education and women's employment, may come from radical fundamentalist Afghan combatants. Reconstruction and modernization of the Afghan economy could help prevent internecine warfare and chaos. The economy needs to become more dynamic to prevent internecine warfare and chaos in Afghanistan. Politicized Islam may remain a powerful force, but if the Taliban stay dispersed and other Islamist groups are marginalized, religion may not be the main rallying cry for anti-government forces. US policy will play a significant role in reconstructing a stable Afghan state. The United States has been a major donor to feeding programs and economic reconstruction in Afghanistan. It is crucial for the US to establish a stable political order, effective state institutions, and rebuild the country's economic infrastructure. The US is seen as having the influence and power to shape the internal Afghan political process. The United States has significant influence in shaping the internal Afghan political process, as demonstrated by its role in supporting Karzai during the June 2002 Loya Jirga. Despite efforts to avoid interference, the presence of U.S. officials alongside Karzai and the ex-king, Zahir Shah, raised concerns. The bid by the ex-king's supporters to elect him as head of state was viewed as a transparent maneuver. The ex-king's supporters' attempt to elect him as head of state was seen as a ploy by corrupt individuals out of touch with Afghan realities. Close U.S. engagement with Pakistan is crucial for stability in Afghanistan, as Pakistan has the greatest capacity to influence developments in the Pashtun South. Islamabad is concerned about ongoing conflict in the Pashtun belt and increased Indian, Russian, and Iranian influence in Kabul. The Bush Administration and Congress acknowledge the importance of cooperation with Pakistan's military president, General Musharraf. President Musharraf's decision to cooperate with the U.S. in the anti-terrorist campaign, under extreme pressure, brought benefits to Pakistan. The crackdown on Islamic radicals showed lack of public support for these groups and strengthened Musharraf's power. Tensions with India over Kashmir, fueled by alleged support of local terrorist groups, have heightened Islamabad's sense of being squeezed between Afghanistan and India. The possession of nuclear weapons by both countries has led the U.S. to pressure them to act responsibly. The United States has a strong interest in pressuring Pakistan and India on the Kashmir issue, as shown during a tense standoff in 2002. Efforts are being made to ensure Pakistan's positive role in Afghanistan and the fight against terrorism. Close engagement with Pakistan is necessary to promote U.S. viewpoints among influential parties and leaders. Both the Bush Administration and Congress intend to provide substantial aid to Afghanistan, which is crucial for stabilizing the Afghan government. The Tokyo meeting of aid donors in January 2002 generated nearly $1.5 billion in aid pledges, including a $296 million commitment from the United States. U.S. aid for humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan for FY 2002 is about $311.3 million. American aid through various channels is crucial for preventing famine, reconstructing agriculture, and restoring infrastructure in Afghanistan. Visible bilateral American aid is seen as essential for influencing desired political outcomes in Afghanistan. The Interim Administration in Afghanistan needs the backing of the United States and aid donors for creating a new democratic order. U.S. support must bring tangible benefits, not just influence over the Karzai administration. Political violence and assassinations highlight the urgency of the situation in Afghanistan. Positive developments are offset by negative ones, making progress a matter of individual perspective. Concerns include Afghanistan's opium production and the status of women. The U.S. stake in economic development in Afghanistan is evident due to its status as the world's leading producer of opium. Poppy-growing areas are controlled by tribal leaders reliant on illicit income sources. International efforts have seen some success in reducing poppy production in exchange for economic aid. The Karzai administration in Afghanistan has announced a program backed by the U.S. to pay farmers to destroy their opium crops. However, the program faces challenges as the government lacks resources to reach key producing areas, the crop is ready for harvest, and growers may resist destruction efforts. The decree signed by Chairman Karzai to make collecting loans from opium growers illegal is seen as unenforceable. Speculation surrounds Haji Qadir's assassination in Nangahar Province, with possible links to malfeasance in the anti-narcotics program or opposition from drug lords. The status of women in Afghan society reflects a struggle between modernization and tradition, with concerns about retrogression due to limited contact with women in refugee camps. The status of women in Afghan society reflects a struggle between modernization and tradition. Limited contact with women in refugee camps in Pakistan has heightened sex discrimination beyond traditional levels. Women sometimes embrace the veil and burka for self-protection. Despite challenges, there is progress in female education, especially in urban areas with support from regional warlords. The outcome of the Loya Jirga on women's rights is seen as mixed. The outcome of the Loya Jirga on women's rights is seen as mixed, with active participation of women but also conservative Islamic backlash against women in the cabinet. Congress may need to address issues affecting US assistance to the interim government in Kabul. The delivery of U.S. support to the Transitional Administration is delayed due to funding scattered across multiple departments. There is tension between U.S. military operations against Taliban and Al Qaeda remnants and the goal of strengthening the Kabul administration. The U.S. military worked with Afghan militias to replace the Taliban government with the Interim Administration, saving lives. However, their strategy unintentionally empowered warlords resisting Kabul's authority, increasing the risk of intense conflict. Efforts to address this include forming a new national army, but it remains small compared to warlord forces. In July 2002, mistaken air attacks on villages in Uruzgan Province occurred. Mistaken air attacks on villages in Uruzgan Province on July 2, 2002, have raised concerns about the heavy reliance on local Afghan militias for intelligence by the U.S. and its allies. The use of lethal ordnance based on potentially flawed information has led to serious civilian casualties, with some suspecting deliberate actions by Afghan warlords.
