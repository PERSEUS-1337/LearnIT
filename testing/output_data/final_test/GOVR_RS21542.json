They were established post-World War II to attract top scientific talent due to government limitations in pay and hiring speed. FFRDCs are non-profit organizations funded by the federal government, operating as private corporations under certain controls. They were established post-World War II to attract top scientific talent due to government limitations in pay and hiring speed. FFRDCs are not allowed to compete for federal or private sector contracts, which government officials argue eliminates conflicts of interest and enhances protection of classified information. There are four categories of FFRDCs: research laboratories, R&D laboratories, study and analysis centers, and systems engineering/systems integration centers. Research laboratories focus on basic and applied research, while R&D laboratories engage in research and hardware development. Study and analysis centers conduct analytical activities. Study and analysis centers and systems engineering/systems integration centers provide analytical activities and systems engineering support for large technical systems. These centers were established to assist the Department of Defense in solving organizational or operational problems and to fill in-house capabilities gaps in large systems development. Currently, eight federal agencies operate a total of 36 FFRDCs, with the Department of Energy (DOE) also having parts of its FFRDC designated as study and analysis and systems engineering centers. The Department of Energy (DOE) and the Department of Defense (DOD) sponsor a total of 26 FFRDCs, with DOE operating 16 Centers and DOD operating 10. The other 10 FFRDCs are operated by various organizations such as NSF, FAA, NASA, NIH, NRC, and IRS. DOE's FFRDCs are administered by universities, private sector companies, and not-for-profit organizations, while DOD's Centers include R&D laboratories, Study and Analysis Centers, and Systems Engineering Centers. In FY2000, the federal government spent $77.4 billion on R&D, with $6.385 billion (8.3%) allocated for FFRDCs. DOE accounted for $3.897 billion (61%) of total federal FFRDC expenditures, representing 57% of its total federal R&D budget. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory received $1.202 billion (12.3%) of its R&D budget, while DOD's 10 FFRDCs received $783 million (2.4%) of its RDT&E budget. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) Letter 84-1 and the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) govern the establishment of FFRDCs. The policy letter and regulations govern the establishment of FFRDCs, stating they should only be created if the agency cannot do the work in-house or through traditional procurement. Guidelines from the OFPP must be followed to establish an FFRDC. The National Science Foundation outlines the characteristics of a new FFRDC, including primary activities like research and development, separate operational unit within the parent organization, direct monitoring by the federal government, major financial support from the government, and a long-term relationship with the sponsoring agency. FFRDCs are not-for-profit entities with an average annual budget of at least $500,000, owned or funded by the federal government. They cannot compete with for-profit companies and have privileged access to sensitive data to address complex issues. FFRDCs have privileged access to sensitive data from industry and government sources, allowing them to address complex long-term problems with objectivity. They are not-for-profit entities that can charge the government fees above their ordinary costs, which can be used for independent research. The Homeland Security Act calls for the establishment of FFRDCs to support science and technology in homeland security. The Homeland Security Act calls for the establishment of FFRDCs to support science and technology in homeland security, including the creation of the Homeland Security Institute. This Institute is tasked with conducting systems analysis, risk analysis, and simulation to assess the vulnerability of critical infrastructure. However, concerns have been raised about the provision that mandates the Institute to terminate three years after the Act's effective date, potentially impacting recruitment efforts. The Homeland Security Act mandates the establishment of FFRDCs to support science and technology in homeland security. The legislation provides the Secretary of Homeland Security with the authority to establish multiple FFRDCs, following specific requirements. The Competition in Contracting Act allows for sole-source procedures to select the highest quality bid. Congress can set spending and personnel limits for the FFRDC. Universities, private sector firms, and existing FFRDCs can compete to operate a DHS sponsored FFRDC. FFRDCs operate under a five-year contract with a review of performance by the sponsoring agency after the third year. The DHS selects the organization to administer an FFRDC, and the Board of Trustees establishes procedures and selects the Director. The Director is responsible for hiring personnel. The FFRDC operates with personnel employed by the organization, not the sponsoring agency, to ensure independence and establish a close partnership. Congress has had concerns about FFRDCs regarding the number of centers, cost, insulation from competition, and product quality. Public sector advocacy groups like the Professional Services Council have raised concerns about the need for FFRDCs, suggesting that the private sector could handle the work. However, proponents argue that FFRDCs play a crucial role in coordinating and integrating research programs for agencies like the DHS. FFRDCs are facing scrutiny for potentially diversifying beyond their original missions, with concerns raised about them receiving contracts that private companies could have competed for. Agencies like DOD and DOE are working on defining the core work of each FFRDC to identify tasks that could be opened up for competition. Some agencies have identified work for traditional procurement processes. Concerns have been raised about oversight of FFRDCs, with reports showing persistent management weaknesses leading to performance problems. Congress mandates employee ceiling levels for DOD's FFRDCs to control costs. DOD and DOE FFRDCs employ thousands of people with budgets in the hundreds of millions. DHS FFRDCs are smaller centers with 50-100 employees and budgets of $15-30 million, while DOD and DOE FFRDCs employ thousands of people with budgets in the hundreds of millions."
