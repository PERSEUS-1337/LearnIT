    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Expanding Opportunities for Recovery Act of 2014\" and includes provisions for opioid addiction treatment. The \"Expanding Opportunities for Recovery Act of 2014\" authorizes grants to States for expanding access to clinically appropriate services for opioid abuse, dependence, or addiction. States receiving grants must comply with requirements such as administering the grant through the primary agency responsible for substance abuse programs, providing evidence-based services like medication-assisted treatment, and following physician or clinician recommendations for service delivery. The grant provides services exclusively to individuals without health insurance or with insurance that does not cover substance use disorder treatment adequately. This ensures optimal treatment duration as recommended by physicians or clinicians. The grant provides treatment for opioid abuse with limitations on duration and types of services. It will not cover more than 60 consecutive days of treatment for any individual. States can use the grant to expand access to clinically appropriate services, including medications. The grant allows States to provide medication-assisted treatment for addiction, as long as the medications are FDA-approved, clinically indicated, and offered based on consumer choice. The program must be coordinated with substance abuse prevention and treatment programs. States receiving the grant must report outcome measures. The grant requires States to report outcome measures such as decreases in substance use, changes in retention in care, connections to the next level of care, decreases in criminal justice activities, and other relevant data. States must also report on individuals' length of time in addiction treatment and the use of medication-assisted treatment. Additionally, the activities supported by the grants will be evaluated and reports will be submitted to Congress and the Secretary. The grant requires States to report outcome measures such as decreases in substance use, changes in retention in care, connections to the next level of care, decreases in criminal justice activities, and other relevant data. States must also report on individuals' length of time in addiction treatment and the use of medication-assisted treatment. Additionally, 5 percent of funds appropriated for this section will be available for certain activities, and technical assistance will be offered to States receiving the grant."
