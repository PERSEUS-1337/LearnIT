    "title": "AB 1778",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 67386 of the Education Code is amended to require educational institutions to adopt a policy addressing sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking involving students on and off campus to receive state funds for student financial assistance. An affirmative consent standard is required for determining consent in sexual activity. It must be affirmative, conscious, and voluntary, with ongoing consent throughout the activity and the ability to revoke it at any time. Past relationships or dating history should not be assumed as consent indicators. In any disciplinary process, lack of affirmative consent cannot be excused if the accused believed the complainant consented due to their own intoxication or recklessness, or if they did not take reasonable steps to ensure consent. The standard for determining guilt is based on the preponderance of evidence. In disciplinary processes, lack of affirmative consent is not a valid excuse if the accused knew or should have known that the complainant was unable to consent due to being asleep, unconscious, incapacitated by drugs or alcohol, or unable to communicate. The governing boards of educational institutions must adopt policies on sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking involving students, ensuring privacy and confidentiality protections. The institution must have policies on responding to reports of incidents, including assisting victims, preserving evidence, identifying witnesses, conducting victim and accused interviews, providing resources, involving victim advocates, investigating involvement of alcohol or drugs. (9) Investigating allegations of alcohol or drug involvement in the incident.\n(10) Ensuring complainants or witnesses in sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, or stalking cases are not penalized unless the violation is egregious.\n(11) Supervision of institutional staff.\n(12) Implementing a trauma-informed training program for campus officials handling such cases.\n(13) Establishing procedures for confidential reporting by victims and third parties. To receive state funds for student financial assistance, educational institutions must collaborate with on-campus and community organizations to provide counseling, health, mental health, victim advocacy, and legal assistance to students, including resources for the accused. To receive state funds for student financial assistance, educational institutions must implement comprehensive prevention and outreach programs addressing sexual violence, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. These programs include empowerment programming, awareness campaigns, bystander intervention, and risk reduction. Outreach efforts aim to inform students about the institution's policies on these issues. The institution must inform students about its sexual assault policy, affirmative consent standard, and student rights and responsibilities. Starting January 1, 2018, all higher education institutions in California must provide annual training to employees on responding to and reporting incidents of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking involving students. Additionally, outreach programming must be included in every incoming student's orientation."
