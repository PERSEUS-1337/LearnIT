The Congress finds that in 1830, Representative David Crockett courageously opposed a bill to fund the removal of Southeastern Native American tribes to the west of the Mississippi River, despite knowing it went against the majority of his constituents' wishes. He stood firm against political threats, refusing to support the removal of \"the poor remnants of a once powerful people.\" The year 2005 marks the 50th anniversary of a feature-length motion picture that portrayed David Crockett as the classic image of the American frontier and the embodiment of the frontier spirit. Crockett, popularized as \"Davy\" Crockett in movies and television, became a cultural icon of the 1950s, representing a new, proud, and irreverent American character unique from European customs. As a young man from East Tennessee, he stood against the removal of Native American tribes despite political threats.

Known for his wit and leadership, he served in the Tennessee General Assembly and the United States House of Representatives. In his final months, he fought for Texas independence. David Crockett, a hero of the Republic of Texas, died at the Alamo at 49. His life was chronicled through various mediums, solidifying his status as an American folk hero.
