    "content": "During 2007, the House and Senate established new earmark transparency procedures for public disclosure of approved earmarks and their congressional sponsors. The House rule defines \"congressional earmarks\" while the Senate rule defines \"congressionally directed spending items,\" but both terms are used interchangeably in this report. Earmarks are provisions in legislation or report language primarily requested by a Member and recommend a specific amount of discretionary budget. This report provides information on earmarks disclosed by the House and Senate for FY2008, FY2009, and FY2010 appropriations bills. Earmarks are specific spending authorities recommended by a Member and are not selected through a competitive process. The data analysis focuses on the disclosure lists published by the appropriations committees starting in FY2008. This report analyzes earmarks disclosed by the House and Senate for FY2008-FY2010 appropriations bills, focusing on the data in the lists directly without additions or deletions. The report does not address earmarks for bills other than the 12 regular appropriations bills for those fiscal years. The report analyzes earmarks disclosed for FY2008-FY2010 appropriations bills, focusing on data without additions or deletions. It includes all earmarks in the disclosure lists for the 11 appropriations bills, regardless of requester or funding level. Earmarking is not solely a congressional activity, as the President and others in the executive branch also engage in earmarking during budget formulation and execution. The executive branch, along with Congress, engages in earmarking during budget formulation. There is no comprehensive source identifying executive branch earmarks. Some FY2008-FY2010 disclosure lists show earmarks requested by the President or in collaboration with Members. The report tabulates earmark values, subject to potential changes due to fund rescissions or non-compliance by recipients. In FY2010, Congress disclosed 11,320 earmarks worth $32.0 billion, representing 1.5% of the total regular FY2010 appropriation. Data on earmarks for FY2010 and comparisons with prior years back to FY2008 are provided in tables and graphs. In FY2010, Congress disclosed 11,320 earmarks worth $32.0 billion, with some appropriations bills having more earmarks than others. The Energy-Water bill had the most earmarks (2,293) and the Military Construction-VA bill had the highest value of earmarks ($14.5 billion). Some appropriations bills have a higher number of earmarks but lower value, while others have fewer earmarks but higher value. For example, Military Construction-VA ranks first in value of earmarks despite being sixth in number. Energy-Water ranks first in number but second in value. Labor-HHS-Education ranks second in number but sixth in value. Commerce-Justice-Science ranks fifth in number but seventh in value. Interior ranks seventh in number but eighth in value, and Agriculture ranks eighth in number but tenth in value. Another measure is the percentage of the appropriation that is earmarked, with different types of appropriations totals being compared. The comparison between total and non-mandatory appropriations in various bills shows that discretionary spending supports a wide range of activities, controlled by appropriations acts. Mandatory spending primarily funds entitlement programs and is controlled by authorization acts. The difference between total and non-mandatory appropriations can vary significantly, as seen in bills like Labor-HHS-Education. In FY2010 appropriations bills, earmarked funds were allocated to various programs, with percentages ranging from 0% to 16.9% of total appropriations. Excluding mandatory funds, the percentage of earmarked funds changed significantly, highlighting the importance of understanding the breakdown of funding sources. In FY2010 appropriations bills, earmarked funds were allocated to various programs, with percentages ranging from 0% to 16.9% of total appropriations. The percentage of earmarked funds for Military Construction-VA is 7.9%, increasing to 11.5% of non-mandatory appropriations. House and Senate rules do not mandate disclosure of presidentially requested earmarks, but some bills list the President as a requester. The disclosure lists for FY2010 show earmarks requested by the President and the Judiciary. Administration earmarks may not be consistently defined or disclosed across all appropriations bills, potentially leading to more presidentially requested earmarks than reflected in the disclosure lists. In FY2010 appropriations bills, the President (or the Judiciary) is listed as a requester for earmarks, totaling 2,039 earmarks worth $21.8 billion. The Defense and Legislative Branch appropriations bills did not identify earmarks requested by the President. The President is disclosed as the sole requester for a subset of earmarks, totaling 1,265 earmarks worth $9.5 billion. The Energy-Water bill had 768 earmarks worth $2.0 billion, followed by Military Construction-VA with 320 earmarks for $6.4 billion. In FY2010, earmarks were requested by the President (or the Judiciary) and Members of Congress. The total number of earmarks across all appropriations bills is 9,281, with a value of $10.2 billion. The Energy-Water bill had 409 earmarks worth $2.7 billion, while the Military Construction-VA bill had 243 earmarks worth $7.0 billion. Members of Congress requested between 1,500 and 1,800 earmarks in the Labor-HHS-Education, Defense, Transportation-HUD, and Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations bills. Defense accounted for $4.2 billion of the earmarks, followed by Transportation-HUD with $1.2 billion. In FY2010, earmarks were requested by the President and Members of Congress across various appropriations bills. The majority of earmarks are Member-only, with the value evenly split among requesters. Presidential requests for Military Construction-VA and Energy-Water reflect agency practices of managing funds at the project level. In FY2010, earmarks requested funds for specific agency projects in various appropriations bills. The number of appropriations earmarks decreased by 12% to 11,320, but the value increased by 11% to $32.0 billion. The percentage of appropriations earmarked decreased to 1.5% of the total appropriation in FY2010. Seven of the 11 bills with earmarks had a decrease in number, including Energy-Water, Labor-HHS-Education, Defense, Transportation-HUD, and Commerce-Justice-Science bills. In FY2010, earmarks requested funds for specific agency projects in various appropriations bills. The number of appropriations earmarks decreased by 12% to 11,320, but the value increased by 11% to $32.0 billion. Seven of the 11 bills with earmarks had a decrease in number, including Energy-Water, Labor-HHS-Education, Defense, Transportation-HUD, and Commerce-Justice-Science bills. Two bills (Transportation-HUD and Labor-HHS-Education) saw a significant decline in earmarks, while four bills (Military Construction-VA, Interior-Environment, Homeland Security, and Financial Services) had an increase in the number of earmarks. Six bills had a decrease in the value of earmarks, totaling a $1.7 billion decline, while five bills saw an increase in the value of earmarks. Excluding Military Construction-VA, the value of earmarks for the remaining bills decreased by 7% in the two years since FY2008. In FY2010, the percentage of non-mandatory appropriations earmarked decreased from 2.9% in FY2008 to 2.4% in FY2010 across 12 appropriations bills. Despite some bills showing growth in earmark value, the overall percentage earmarked decreased due to a 30% increase in total appropriations. The number and value of earmarks in presidential earmarks also varied from FY2008 to FY2010. The number and value of presidential earmarks requested solely by the President increased significantly from FY2008 to FY2010. The number of these earmarks rose by 54%, from 819 to 1,265, while the value increased by 126%, from $4.2 billion to $9.5 billion. In contrast, the number and value of earmarks requested solely by Members decreased by 17% and 19% respectively during the same period. In FY2010, there was a 17% decrease in Member-only earmarks, larger than the overall 12% decrease in earmarks from FY2008 to FY2010. The value of Member-only earmarks decreased by 19%, contrasting with the 11% increase in total earmark value since FY2008. Earmarks requested jointly by the President and Members remained relatively steady, with a 11% decrease in number and 1% increase in value. Excluding Military Construction-VA earmarks, the total number of earmarks requested solely by the President increased by 36%, while Member-only earmarks decreased by 17%. In FY2010, the total value of earmarks requested solely by the President increased by 70%, while Member-only earmarks decreased by 20%."
