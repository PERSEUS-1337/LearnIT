    "content": "The \"Federal Entrepreneur-in-Residence Act of 2012\" establishes the Federal entrepreneur-in-residence program, defining key terms such as Administrator, agency, Director, entrepreneur-in-residence, program, and small business concern. The Federal entrepreneur-in-residence program, established by the Director in consultation with the Administrator, appoints entrepreneurs to positions in agencies to improve outreach to the private sector, enhance coordination between the government and private sector, and streamline federal programs for small businesses and entrepreneurs. The Director appoints entrepreneurs-in-residence under the program each year, with a limit of 10 appointments. Entrepreneurs are selected based on their success in the field, experience working with small businesses, or product development achievements. Placement priority is given to entrepreneurs-in-residence. The Director appoints entrepreneurs-in-residence annually, prioritizing placements across different federal agencies. Each agency can have a maximum of 2 entrepreneurs-in-residence per year, serving for up to 2 years. Their duties include enhancing outreach to small businesses and providing recommendations to agency heads. The entrepreneur-in-residence appointed by the Director serves to provide recommendations on program efficiency, facilitate educational sessions for small businesses, and offer mentorship in accessing agency programs. The entrepreneur-in-residence at the agency assists with program access for businesses and entrepreneurs. Their compensation is equivalent to GS-13, GS-14, or GS-15 pay rates, with the possibility of a promotion after one year of satisfactory service. An entrepreneur-in-residence reports directly to the agency head and must be appointed before September 30, 2016."
