    "content": "The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act, is the primary law governing pollution of the nation's surface waters. Originally enacted in 1948, it was extensively revised in 1972 to include ambitious programs for water quality improvement. Subsequent amendments were made in 1977, 1981, 1987, and 2014. This report provides a summary of the law, extracted from a larger document, focusing on the statute itself with some details and provisions omitted. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act, was enacted in 1948 and revised in 1972 with subsequent amendments in 1977, 1981, 1987, and 2014. Authorizations for appropriations expired in FY1990, but programs continued with funds appropriated by Congress. Despite amendments, major programs or requirements have not been comprehensively addressed. The Act provided technical assistance funds to state and local governments for water pollution issues. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1948 addressed water pollution issues with federal assistance to state and local governments. In the 1950s and 1960s, laws were amended to extend federal jurisdiction over water pollution control programs, including setting water quality standards in 1965. The 1972 amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act set ambitious goals for controlling pollution, requiring treatment of all municipal and industrial wastewater before discharge into waterways. This was in response to frustrations over slow cleanup efforts and a perception that existing enforcement procedures were ineffective. The 1972 Clean Water Act aimed to treat wastewater before discharge, provide federal assistance for treatment plant construction, enforce regulations, and set goals for water quality. The Act consists of Title II and Title VI provisions for financial assistance and regulatory requirements. The Clean Water Act of 1972 required industries and municipalities to meet strict pollution abatement standards by installing best practicable control technology (BPT) and secondary treatment for waste discharges by July 1, 1977. Municipalities failing to meet the deadline could apply for extensions until July 1, 1988. The EPA reported that 86% of cities met the 1988 deadline, with the rest under schedules for compliance. Many cities are still investing in facilities to meet the requirements. Many cities are investing in facilities to achieve secondary treatment for waste discharges, with high funding needs. Case-by-case waivers were available for cities discharging wastes into marine waters if natural factors could eliminate traditional pollution and protect water quality standards. The focus of BPT was on controlling discharges of conventional pollutants that deplete dissolved oxygen necessary for aquatic life. The Clean Water Act (CWA) mandated greater pollutant cleanup with the \"best available technology\" (BAT) by March 31, 1989, focusing on toxic substances. Compliance extensions are available for innovative technology, with enforcement action for missed deadlines. The CWA uses water quality standards and technology-based effluent limitations to protect water quality, with numerical limitations on pollutants from industrial and municipal sources in discharge permits. Water quality standards are set by states or EPA in discharge permits to designate beneficial uses of waterbodies and identify maximum pollutant concentrations. States must establish these standards for all bodies of water to complement technology-based requirements and indicate where additional pollutant controls are necessary. Compliance may require additional pollution control measures for waters where water quality standards are not met. The Clean Water Act requires states to set total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) for impaired waters to meet water quality standards. Over 40,000 U.S. waters need TMDL preparation due to pollution. Control of toxic pollutant discharges is a focus, with states implementing strategies for polluted waters even after industrial cleanup technologies are in place. Prior to the 1987 amendments, Clean Water Act programs mainly targeted point source pollution from industrial and municipal sources. However, nonpoint source pollution, such as runoff from agricultural lands and urban areas, was largely overlooked despite accounting for more than 50% of the nation's water pollution issues. Rainfall and snowmelt runoff can pick up pollutants like sediments and toxic materials, degrading water quality as it flows towards rivers and streams. The 1987 amendments to the Clean Water Act addressed pollution from various sources, including sediments, toxic materials, and conventional wastes that degrade water quality. States were directed to develop nonpoint pollution management programs, with federal financial assistance available for implementation. Special regulations were put in place for the discharge of oil or hazardous substances to prevent catastrophic effects on public health and welfare. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 amended the Clean Water Act to establish a system for oil spill cleanup and liability. It addresses pollution in water bodies like the Great Lakes and Chesapeake Bay, toxic pollutants in harbors, and mine drainage. Federal jurisdiction under the act is broad, supporting training for wastewater treatment personnel. The Clean Water Act gives federal jurisdiction over establishing national standards for treatment facilities and effluent limitations. The EPA issues regulations for industrial sources, with states able to assume certain responsibilities. This act emphasizes a federal-state partnership for pollution abatement, with states carrying out day-to-day implementation and enforcement activities. Qualified states can issue discharge permits and enforce them, with 46 states authorized to administer this program. EPA issues discharge permits in states where this authority has not been delegated. The Clean Water Act authorizes states to administer discharge permits, with EPA issuing permits in certain states and territories. Federal law provides grants for sewage treatment facilities, with Congress allocating funds based on state population and treatment funding needs. Over $94 billion has been appropriated for wastewater treatment projects since 1956. The most recent estimate indicated that $271 billion more would be required to build and upgrade municipal wastewater treatment plants in the United States, a 20% decrease from the previous estimate. Grants were generally available for as much as 55% of total project costs under the Title II construction grants program established in 1972. The Clean Water Act provided federal funding for wastewater treatment projects, with grants covering up to 55% of total costs and up to 75% for projects using innovative technology. Recipients were responsible for non-federal costs and were not required to repay the grants. Congress extended federal aid for construction through FY1994, transitioning towards state and local government responsibility for financing after that date. Grants under the Title II program were authorized through FY1990, with Title VI authorizing grants for State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds starting in FY1989. Revolving Funds, or loan programs, were authorized in FY1989 to replace Title II grants. States contribute matching funds, and monies used for wastewater treatment construction are repaid to the state for project loans to other communities. The shift from federal grants to loans has been a challenge for some cities, especially small towns. Statutory authorization for grants expired in 1994, but Congress continues to provide annual appropriations. Some cities face issues with overflow discharges of inadequately treated wastes from municipal sewers and costly remediation projects. The Clean Water Act aims to regulate all discharges into the nation's waters. The Clean Water Act requires permits for industrial and municipal discharges into water bodies, with technology-based effluent limits and compliance deadlines. Permits must be renewed every five years. The Clean Water Act requires permits for industrial and municipal discharges into water bodies, with technology-based effluent limits and compliance deadlines. Permits are issued for up to five years and must be renewed thereafter. The NPDES permit includes numerical effluent limitations issued by EPA, focusing on regulating conventional and toxic pollutants. EPA has also issued water quality criteria for over 115 pollutants, providing guidance to states for establishing water quality standards.

The NPDES permit includes numerical effluent limitations issued by EPA, focusing on regulating conventional and toxic pollutants. EPA has also issued water quality criteria for over 115 pollutants, providing guidance to states for establishing water quality standards. A permit is required to dispose of dredged or fill material in the nation's waters, including wetlands, authorized by Section 404 of the act and administered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Some activities are exempt from permit requirements, and EPA may delegate Section 404 permitting responsibility to qualified states. The wetlands permit program has been controversial, with some arguing federal regulation intrudes on private land-use decisions and environmentalists seeking more protection. The Clean Water Act regulates industrial and municipal discharges into water bodies with permits issued for up to five years. Nonpoint sources of pollution are managed by state programs under Section 319 of the act. EPA also regulates sewage sludge disposal and land-based pollutant discharge into the ocean. The Ocean Dumping Act governs intentional waste disposal in ocean waters. EPA provides guidance on technologies to meet effluent limitations. The NPDES permit sets limits on discharges. The NPDES permit is the main enforcement tool of the Clean Water Act, setting effluent limitations on discharges. EPA can issue compliance orders or civil suits against violators, with penalties up to $25,000 per day for permit violations. Criminal violations can result in penalties of up to $50,000 per day, three years' imprisonment, or both. Knowing endangerment violations can lead to fines of up to $250,000, 15 years in prison, or both. EPA can also assess civil penalties administratively for documented violations. These enforcement provisions are outlined in Section 309 of the act. EPA, in collaboration with the Army Corps of Engineers, enforces these regulations. The Clean Water Act enforcement is primarily carried out by states, with EPA overseeing state enforcement. EPA can take direct action if a state fails to act or requests EPA involvement. The federal government enforces criminal violations, and individuals can bring citizen suits in U.S. district court. Individuals can bring a citizen suit in U.S. district court against those who violate effluent standards or permit requirements under federal law. They can also sue the EPA Administrator for failing to fulfill a mandatory duty under the Clean Water Act."
