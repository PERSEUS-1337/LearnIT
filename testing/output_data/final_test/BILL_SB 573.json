    "title": "SB 573",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Chapter 7.7 is added to the Government Code, establishing the Statewide Open Data Portal. Terms defined include \"Agency\" and \"Data set,\" with specific criteria outlined for the latter. The Statewide Open Data Portal establishes terms like \"Inventory\" and \"Open data roadmap,\" which outline the listing of available data sets and a strategic plan for making agency data publicly available. The Statewide Open Data Portal also defines the \"Statewide open data portal\" as a centralized website for displaying and exporting data from state agencies. The Chief Data Officer, appointed by the Governor, must create an inventory of state data by October 1, 2016, and establish a statewide open data portal by January 1, 2017, in cooperation with the Department of Technology. The Chief Data Officer must publish a listing of data available to the public, create a statewide open data roadmap, and ensure at least 150 data sets are on the open data portal by June 1, 2017. The statewide open data portal includes links to agency websites publishing data, such as https://bythenumbers.sco.ca.gov/ and https://chhs.data.ca.gov/. The Chief Data Officer allows local agencies to use the portal to publish data, which must comply with privacy laws. The Chief Data Officer is required to publish a progress report on open data annually, assessing outcomes, innovation of the statewide open data portal, cost savings, and agency collaboration. Guidelines for agencies on security, privacy, and legal concerns related to data inventory and publication must be published by January 1, 2017. The Chief Data Officer is mandated to establish an open data working group by October 1, 2016, consisting of state agencies' data coordinators. The group will meet quarterly to assess progress on the open data roadmap, recommend policies, share best practices, and coordinate data sharing. State agencies must appoint data coordinators by August 1, 2016, who will ensure compliance with open data regulations. Each agency must identify and transmit data sets to the Chief Data Officer by October 1, 2016. By November 1, 2016, agencies must create a plan for publishing the inventory on the statewide open data portal, ensuring compliance with privacy laws. Agencies can seek and accept funding for the statewide open data portal. Funds must be used for this purpose with legislative approval. This chapter does not change agencies' obligation to provide public notice or information under other laws."
