    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 76140 of the Education Code is amended to allow community colleges to charge tuition fees to nonresident students, with exemptions for certain individuals based on enrollment units or financial need. Nonresidents enrolling for six or fewer units may be exempt, as well as nonresidents who are citizens and residents of foreign countries with demonstrated financial need. The total number of exemptions for nonresident foreign students is limited to 10 percent. (A) Eligibility for exemption from tuition fees is granted to students affected by Hurricane Katrina in the 2005-06 academic year at accredited institutions in Alabama, Louisiana, or Mississippi.\n(B) Guidelines for eligibility documentation will be developed by the chancellor.\n(C) The exemption is only applicable for the specified academic year.\n(D) Special part-time students admitted under Section 76001 are also eligible.\n(E) Nonresident U.S. citizens residing in foreign countries may qualify for exemption based on financial need. To qualify for exemption from tuition fees, a student must demonstrate financial need, have a deported parent or guardian, moved abroad due to deportation, lived in California before moving, and attended a secondary school in the state for three or more years. Proof of these criteria must be provided. (F) Upon enrollment, a student in their first academic year in California public higher education, living in California, must file an affidavit stating intent to establish residency. A nonresident student using GI Bill benefits while enrolled at a community college in California is also eligible for exemption from tuition fees. Nonresident students using GI Bill education benefits at a community college in California may be exempt from tuition fees. The district can contract with various entities for payment of a nonresident student's tuition fee, and nonresident students are not counted as full-time equivalent students for state funding purposes unless specified by law. The governing board of each community college district sets the nonresident tuition fee annually, with notice given to students in advance. Fee increases are gradual and can be paid in installments. Nonresident students enrolled in a certain number of units per fiscal year are subject to the established fee. The district's education expenses are adjusted based on the Consumer Price Index increase and divided by the number of students attending. If noncredit course students make up 10% or more of total students, data for grades 13 and 14 can be used instead. The district's education expenses are adjusted based on the Consumer Price Index increase and divided by the number of students attending. If the calculated amount for the succeeding fiscal year is less than the current or past four-year amounts, the district can set the nonresident tuition fee at the greater of those amounts. Additionally, the fee cannot exceed the amount established by a contiguous district or the district's own expenses for education, but must be at least the statewide average. The nonresident tuition fees for public community colleges in California are determined based on the average of 12 comparable states' fees. Any additional revenue generated from increased nonresident tuition must be used to enhance services for resident students without compromising their enrollment. The governing board of each community college district sets tuition fees for nonresident students based on unit credits. The rate is determined by dividing the fee by 30 or 45, depending on the college system, and rounded to the nearest whole dollar. Any revenue loss from nonresident tuition fees cannot be compensated by state funding. Any community college district with fewer than 1,500 FTES near a state with a reciprocity agreement can exempt nonresident students from mandatory fees. Districts with 1,500 to 3,000 FTES can exempt up to 100 nonresident students from neighboring states in a fiscal year. Nonresident students exempt from mandatory fees can be reported as resident FTES for state funding. They must pay a higher fee and any costs mandated by the state will be reimbursed. SEC. 3: This act is urgent for public peace, health, or safety per the Constitution. It needs immediate effect for nonresident tuition exemption in the 2015-16 academic year."
