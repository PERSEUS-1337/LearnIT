The Code Talkers Recognition Act authorizes medals to honor Native American Code Talkers who played a crucial role in communication operations during World War I and II, saving lives and hastening the end of the wars. The Act includes sections for Sioux, Comanche, Choctaw, and Sac and Fox Code Talkers, each with specific findings and provisions for a Congressional commemorative medal. TITLE I--SIOUX CODE TALKERS\n\nSEC. 101. FINDINGS.\n\nCongress finds that Sioux Indians used their native languages as code during World War II, becoming known as the Sioux Code Talkers. They provided crucial information that saved many American lives in the Pacific and Europe, with military commanders crediting them for the success of the United States in battles. The President Pro Tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives will present a commemorative medal to each Sioux Code Talker, including individuals like Eddie Eagle Boy and Simon Brokenleg. Additionally, a separate section titled \"COMANCHE CODE TALKERS\" begins with findings. Congress finds that the Japanese Empire attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, leading to a declaration of war. The United States military code was deciphered by Axis powers, prompting the development of a new code using the Comanche language. Despite being considered second-class citizens, Comanche men were recruited to serve in the Army and develop a secret code. The Comanches of the 4th Signal Division, known as the \"Comanche Code Talkers,\" developed an unbreakable code using their language during World War II. Their efforts greatly contributed to the Allied war effort in Europe and were instrumental in winning the war. The Comanche Code Talkers of World War II were instrumental in winning the war in Europe and saved countless lives. Only 1 of them remains alive today, and Congress should honor them for their valor and service to the United States. Congress will present a commemorative medal to the Comanche Code Talkers of World War II, including Charles Chibitty and others, in recognition of their contributions. Additionally, there is a separate section honoring the Choctaw Code Talkers. During World War I, despite not being recognized as citizens of the United States, members of the Choctaw Nation enlisted in the Armed Forces and joined the American Expeditionary Force in France in 1917. During World War I, Choctaw soldiers serving in the 142d Infantry Company of the 36th Division faced challenges due to German forces deciphering Allied codes, leading to significant losses. To overcome this, a method of communication without enemy knowledge was needed, which was realized by a United States commander who had Native language speakers under his command. During World War I, a United States commander recruited 18 Choctaw Indians to assist in transmitting field telephone communications. The Choctaw soldiers used their native language as a code, which the Germans could not understand, allowing for secure communication and strategic advantage. During World War I, Choctaw Indians played a crucial role in American military operations in 1918. They were instrumental in securing positions, protecting supplies, and preparing for assaults on German positions. Their use in transmitting information in their native language was highly successful, leading to their withdrawal from frontline units for training in code transmission. During World War I, Choctaw Indians used their native language to transmit codes, which the Germans failed to break. This marked the first instance of using a Native American language for confusing the enemy in modern warfare. The Choctaw Nation's actions in code transmission exemplify their commitment to defending the United States and have been honored with a memorial in Durant, Oklahoma. The President Pro Tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives will present a commemorative medal honoring the Choctaw Code Talkers. Congress also recognizes the Sac and Fox Code Talkers who used their native language, Meskwaki, to transmit military code during World War II, saving many American lives. Congress will present a commemorative medal to the Sac and Fox Code Talkers of World War II, including Frank Sanache, Willard Sanache, Dewey Youngbear, Edward Benson, Judie Wayne Wabaunasee, Mike Wayne Wabaunasee, Dewey Roberts, and Melvin Twin. Additionally, there is a definition of \"Indian tribe\" and provision for medals for other Code Talkers. The President Pro Tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives will arrange for the presentation of a commemorative medal to any Native American Code Talker identified by the Secretary of Defense who has not yet received a congressional medal. Native American members of the US Armed Forces who served as Code Talkers in foreign conflicts during the 20th Century are eligible for this medal. The Secretary of Defense will determine eligibility and establish a list of individuals eligible to receive a medal within 120 days of the enactment of the Act. SEC. 503. PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL MEDALS UNDER THIS ACT. A medal authorized by this Act may be awarded posthumously to a Native American Code Talker's next of kin. The Secretary of the Treasury will strike commemorative gold medals with suitable designs for Code Talkers of the same tribe. SEC. 504. DUPLICATE MEDALS. SEC. 504. The Secretary of the Treasury may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of commemorative medals under this Act at a price covering costs. The text chunk discusses the funding for striking and awarding medals authorized by the Act, with proceeds from the sale of duplicate bronze medals being deposited in the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund. The Act authorizes the presentation of commemorative medals to Native American Code Talkers for their service during 20th-century foreign conflicts."
