    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Colombian Temporary Protected Status Act of 2003\". Congress finds that Colombia has been in a 38-year internal conflict, with the FARC and ELN rebel groups controlling a significant portion of the country and engaging in violent activities against civilians. The main paramilitary groups in Colombia, such as the AUC, have significantly grown in recent years and are responsible for a large percentage of killings and disappearances in the country. The FARC, ELN, and AUC are designated as foreign terrorist organizations and have a combined force of 35,000 combatants. According to Colombian and international refugee organizations, the number of people newly displaced by political violence in Colombia increased by 30% from 317,340 in 2000 to 412,000 in 2002. This makes Colombia's internally displaced population of approximately 3 million people the second largest in the world. Afro-Colombian communities, especially in the province of Choco, had the highest percentage of population displaced in 2002. The number of people killed or disappeared per day increased from 14 in 2000 to 20 in 2002, according to human rights organizations. Direct violations by the Colombian military also increased in 2002, as reported by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in their 2003 Annual Report. In 2002, Colombian military increased collaboration with paramilitary forces, leading to persistent human rights violations. Kidnappings by FARC, ELN, and criminal groups targeted middle and upper classes, declining but still high. President Uribe reduced budgets for human rights offices by over 50%. Investigations and prosecutions of human rights crimes have stalled under Colombian Attorney General Luis Camilo Osorio. Peace negotiations with FARC are unlikely to resume after talks collapsed in 2002. Urban violence in cities like Medellin has escalated, with an average of 13 killings a day, spreading from rural to urban areas. The Congress believes that due to the recent escalation of the civil war in Colombia, Colombia should be designated for temporary protected status for Colombian nationals in the United States. Colombia is designated for temporary protected status for Colombian nationals in the United States under section 244 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The initial designation lasts for 2 years, and Colombian nationals must meet specific requirements to be eligible for this status. The alien must have been continuously present in the US since the enactment of the Act, be admissible as an immigrant, and register for temporary protected status. The Secretary of Homeland Security must give consent for travel abroad to aliens granted temporary protected status. An alien granted temporary protected status may be allowed to depart for a brief trip abroad due to emergency circumstances. Upon returning to the US with authorization, they will be treated the same as other returning aliens with temporary protected status."
