    "content": "The American Dream Downpayment Act, also known as the Downpayment Assistance Initiative, amends the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act to provide assistance for downpayments on homes. The Secretary may grant assistance to low-income families for homeownership through downpayment assistance. Grants can only be used for first-time homebuyers to purchase single-family housing. Participating jurisdictions must include the use of grant amounts in their housing affordability strategy to be eligible. The Secretary allocates assistance amounts based on a formula considering jurisdictions' need and prior commitment to homebuyer aid. Reallocation of funds to other jurisdictions is done according to the established formula. The funds allocated under this section can be reallocated to a State if a local participating jurisdiction fails to receive them. Grants made under this section are not subject to certain provisions of the title but are subject to specific requirements and provisions outlined in other sections. \"In applying the requirements of subtitle A, references to funds under subtitle A shall refer to amounts for assistance under this section. References to funds allocated or reallocated under section 217 or 217(d) shall refer to amounts allocated or reallocated under subsection (d) or (e) of this section. Participating jurisdictions can use funds for administrative and planning costs. The limitation on administrative costs shall be based on the total amount of funds available under subtitle A and this section.\" The section authorizes $200,000,000 for fiscal years 2003 through 2006 for the Downpayment Assistance Initiative under the HOME Investment Partnerships Program. Additionally, relocation assistance and downpayment assistance are provided under subtitle F of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act. SEC. 291 states that the Uniform Relocation Assistance Act does not apply to downpayment assistance. SEC. 3 amends the Housing Opportunity Program Extension Act for funding in fiscal years 2003 and 2004. SEC. 4 reauthorizes the HOPE VI program.
