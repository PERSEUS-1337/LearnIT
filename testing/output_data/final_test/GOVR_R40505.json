Retired Ambassador Charles Freeman withdrew his name from consideration due to congressional criticism. In May 2009, Christopher A. Kojm was appointed as NIC chairman by then-Director of National Intelligence Dennis C. Blair. Kojm had previous experience in various intelligence roles and academia. The NIC is responsible for authoritative assessments within the U.S. intelligence community. The National Intelligence Council (NIC) is a key component of the U.S. intelligence community, responsible for providing authoritative assessments on national security issues. The NIC consists of senior analysts and experts from both public and private sectors, appointed to serve at the center of government intelligence analysis efforts. The National Intelligence Council (NIC) consists of senior analysts and experts from public and private sectors, appointed by the DNI to produce national intelligence estimates for the US government. NIOs serve as senior intelligence advisers to the federal government and are part of the ODNI. The National Intelligence Council (NIC) is comprised of senior analysts and experts appointed by the DNI to produce national intelligence estimates. NIO positions cover various geographic and functional areas, and appointments are made by the DNI. The National Intelligence Council (NIC) is composed of experts from various backgrounds, including the Foreign Service, Defense Department, and intelligence community. NIC appointments do not require Senate approval. The NIC's responsibilities are outlined in Directive 207, which mandates NIOs to provide intelligence assessments to the National Security Council, military decision-makers, and Congress. NIOs can task agencies for analytical support and collaborate with the ODNI to establish collection requirements. The NIC plays a crucial role in preparing and providing intelligence assessments. The National Intelligence Council (NIC) provides preparatory materials for the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) and plays a crucial role in preparing intelligence assessments. There is a tendency to include NIOs with diverse backgrounds, which can lead to tensions between expertise in preparing assessments, managing collection efforts, and providing staff support to the DNI. Some argue that non-governmental backgrounds help ensure analytical relevance, while others emphasize the importance of understanding collection limitations. The National Intelligence Council (NIC) provides assessments for the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) and produces NIEs, the NIC's flagship product. NIEs are authoritative judgments on national security issues initiated by policymakers, Congress, or the NIC itself. The NIC evaluates drafts of NIEs, which are then coordinated line-by-line by intelligence agencies. Once approved, NIEs are disseminated to the President, senior officials, and Congress. NIC members are not public spokesmen and focus on internal government work. Occasionally, NIE summaries are released to the public for policy debates. In 2007, an unclassified summary of an NIE on Iran's nuclear programs was released, showing differing judgments from previous assessments. The CIA's Center for the Study of Intelligence occasionally publishes older NIEs of historical interest. The Office of Strategic Services (OSS) during World War II included scholars who prepared intelligence reports, later transferred to the CIA. In 1950, the CIA established the Office of National Estimates (ONE) with a Board of National Estimates (BNE) chaired by William L. Langer to reflect the views of the entire intelligence community. The Office of National Estimates (ONE) was established by the CIA in 1950 with a Board of National Estimates (BNE) chaired by William L. Langer. The goal was to provide the President and senior officials with collective wisdom from all agencies to avoid past mistakes. The BNE, led by Sherman Kent from 1952 to 1967, consisted of specialists in various fields and had access to intelligence from multiple agencies. The Office of National Estimates (ONE) was established by the CIA in 1950 with a Board of National Estimates (BNE) chaired by William L. Langer. The BNE set high analytical standards and produced over 1,500 National Intelligence Estimates (NIEs) over 23 years. These estimates, considered the DCI's, did not always reflect the views of CIA analysts or other agencies. The Board of National Estimates (BNE) provided key estimates for U.S. defense planning during the Cold War. Despite some inaccuracies, such as missing the Cuban Missile Crisis, concerns arose about the board's disconnect from policymakers. In 1973, DCI William Colby replaced the BNE with National Intelligence Officers (NIOs) to address this issue. In 1973, DCI William Colby replaced the Board of National Estimates with National Intelligence Officers (NIOs) due to concerns about disconnect from policymakers and the need for better organization and access to information. In 1973, DCI William Colby replaced the Board of National Estimates with National Intelligence Officers (NIOs) to improve organization and access to information. The NIOs were experts in various subjects and were tasked with providing timely and sharp intelligence assessments. In 1979, the NIOs were formally organized into a National Intelligence Council by DCI Stansfield Turner. The National Intelligence Officers (NIOs) were organized into a National Intelligence Council by DCI Stansfield Turner in 1979. Unlike the Board of National Estimates, the NIOs had specific areas of responsibility and reported directly to the DCI. There was a need to separate the NIOs from the management of the CIA's Directorate of Intelligence to ensure independence and equal access to intelligence conclusions from other agencies. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY1993 established the National Intelligence Council (NIC) to ensure equal access to intelligence conclusions. The NIC was intended to include experts from within and outside the government, but a provision for a designated chairman and deputy chairmen was not adopted due to objections from the George H. W. Bush Administration. The NIC was established to include experts from within and outside the government, but a provision for a designated chairman and deputy chairmen was not adopted due to objections from the George H. W. Bush Administration. The conferees emphasized the importance of including outside experts in the NIC for creating and maintaining expertise, objectivity, and independence in national intelligence estimates. The NIC prepared estimates on post-Cold War issues and non-traditional issues like environmental change during the Clinton Administration. In 1995, NIOs coordinated a NIE predicting terrorist threats, but the NIC was criticized in December 2002 by a joint congressional inquiry. The NIC was criticized in December 2002 for not preparing an NIE on the threat posed by Al Qaeda. The NIE on Iraqi WMDs in 2002 raised concerns about the intelligence community's competence. Subsequent investigations found problems in collection and analysis efforts. The 9/11 Commission also reviewed intelligence agencies' role before the September 2001 attacks. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 was enacted in response to the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, creating the position of Director of National Intelligence and transferring the NIC and NIOs to the ODNI. The NIC's chairman also serves as Deputy DNI for Analysis, with the NIC now directly under the DNI. Congressional committees benefit from the testimony of NIC members. The NIC is responsible for preparing NIEs and intelligence assessments for Congress. Oversight of the NIC by congressional committees may be changed by establishing the position of NIC chairman appointed by the President with Senate approval. NIOs produce independent intelligence but are not just technical experts. Requiring confirmation of National Intelligence Officers (NIOs) by the Senate would ensure nominees are fully qualified and uphold obligations to provide timely, objective, and independent intelligence. This process would prevent the NIC from being influenced by NIOs with similar perspectives on national security issues and provide oversight opportunities. Some concerns include potential delays in appointments and the introduction of a partisan component to the selection process. Senate confirmation for National Intelligence Officers (NIOs could introduce a partisan element to a nonpartisan role. It may not be necessary as the NIC's work does not involve policymaking. Alternatively, greater congressional oversight of NIC activities could be implemented, potentially in closed sessions, to ensure accountability and effectiveness. The NIC has implemented new procedures to integrate formal reviews of source reporting and technical judgments, requiring formal assessments from key intelligence agencies. More rigorous standards have been applied, including clarifying terms like \"we judge\" in NIEs. The NIC aims to enhance credibility and transparency in critical judgments. The NIC has faced questions about its role within the government, with some suggesting it serves as administrative support for the DNI. Concerns have been raised about the time spent preparing intelligence products and the influence of NIOs and the NIC chairman. However, it is also noted that these positions allow for qualified appointees to shape them effectively. The National Intelligence Council (NIC) aims to provide policymakers with a thorough understanding of national security conditions. While the ultimate goal is achievable, providing warning of imminent threats is challenging due to the complexity of threats and players involved. The NIC members serve as senior intelligence advisors with access to information from all U.S. intelligence agencies. The National Intelligence Council (NIC) provides policymakers with a comprehensive understanding of national security conditions by utilizing information from all U.S. intelligence agencies. The NIC members serve as senior intelligence advisors with access to all intelligence analysts in the government, offering context and perspective on international issues. The NIC supports the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) and ensures the intelligence community's views are reflected in interagency discussions. The role of the National Intelligence Council (NIC) may expand as issues become more complex and interconnected. Congress may seek to increase scrutiny of NIC products and provide more oversight of the intelligence community's analytical efforts. This could involve testing analysts' conclusions from various perspectives within congressional committees, which may be uncomfortable for analysts and NIC officials. The National Intelligence Council (NIC) may face uncomfortable scrutiny during oversight hearings, but some believe rigorous exchanges can benefit the national interest. Intelligence analysis inherently carries uncertainty, and the NIC is composed of senior analysts and experts from public and private sectors. The National Intelligence Council (NIC) produces national intelligence estimates for the US Government, evaluates intelligence collection and production, and assists the Director of National Intelligence. The National Intelligence Council (NIC) assists the Director of National Intelligence in carrying out responsibilities and ensures policymakers' intelligence needs are met. Members serve as senior intelligence advisers representing the views of the intelligence community within the US Government. The NIC may use contracts for expertise as needed. The Director of National Intelligence provides staff and support to the National Intelligence Council to fulfill its responsibilities, ensuring accessibility to policymakers and other individuals outside the intelligence community. The heads of intelligence elements offer necessary support, including intelligence analysis, as directed by the Director. The National Intelligence Council produces intelligence assessments for the Director of National Intelligence, including National Intelligence Estimates and other community judgments. The Council has had various chairmen and deputies over the years, such as William Langer, Sherman Kent, and Robert Gates. The National Intelligence Council has had various chairmen and deputies over the years, including Robert Gates, Frank Horton III, Fritz Ermarth, Joseph Nye, Christine Williams, Richard Cooper, John Gannon, John Helgerson, Robert Hutchings, C. Thomas Fingar, Peter Lavoy, and Christopher Kojm. (Source: National Intelligence Council)"
