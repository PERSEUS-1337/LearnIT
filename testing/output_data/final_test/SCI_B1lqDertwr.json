Regularization techniques in training neural networks have been overlooked in RL methods. A study shows that conventional regularization techniques can significantly improve task performance, especially on difficult tasks, compared to entropy regularization. The findings are robust across different training hyperparameters. Regularization techniques, such as L2 regularization and dropout, are essential for preventing overfitting in neural networks. These methods are widely used in various domains like computer vision and natural language processing. The study emphasizes the importance of regularizing the policy network in policy optimization algorithms. In deep reinforcement learning, conventional regularization methods are often overlooked, unlike in natural language processing where models like Transformer and BERT use dropout and L2 regularization. This lack of focus on regularization in deep RL is attributed to the minimal generalization gap between training and testing environments, with researchers prioritizing high-level algorithm designs over network training techniques. In deep reinforcement learning, conventional regularization methods are often overlooked. Popular policy optimization algorithms prioritize entropy regularization to encourage exploration and prevent overfitting. This approach contrasts with natural language processing models that use dropout and L2 regularization for generalization. In this study, the focus is on policy optimization methods in deep reinforcement learning. Four popular algorithms (SAC, PPO, TRPO, A2C) are evaluated on multiple continuous control tasks. Various regularization techniques are considered, including L2/L1 weight regularization, dropout, weight clipping, and Batch Normalization. The study questions the conventional wisdom of not using common regularizations and emphasizes performance on the current task over generalization ability to different environments. Regularization techniques such as L2 regularization, L1 regularization, weight clipping, dropout, and Batch Normalization are compared in policy networks for deep reinforcement learning. L2 regularization is found to be the most effective, outperforming entropy regularization. L1 regularization and weight clipping can also improve performance, while Dropout and Batch Normalization show enhancements mainly in off-policy algorithms. All regularization methods are more effective on challenging tasks. The study validates these findings across various training hyperparameters and network sizes. Our study explores the effectiveness of various regularization methods in policy optimization algorithms for deep reinforcement learning. We find that L2 regularization is the most effective, surpassing entropy regularization, while L1 regularization and weight clipping also show improvements. Regularizing the policy network is generally sufficient, as imposing regularization on value networks does not provide significant benefits. Our results highlight the importance of neural network training techniques, such as regularization, in enhancing performance in continuous control tasks. Regularization methods, particularly L2 regularization, are effective in improving performance on continuous control tasks. Simple L2 regularization outperforms entropy regularization. Batch Normalization and dropout are beneficial in off-policy algorithms. Experimenting with various hyperparameters confirms the effectiveness of proper regularization in easing the tuning process. Regularizing the policy network, but not the value network, is key. Conventional regularization methods are rarely used in deep RL, with one exception being Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) where Batch Normalization is applied to actor and critic networks. Regularization methods are applied to actor and critic networks in deep reinforcement learning. Different approaches include adjusting regularization weight based on temporal difference error, introducing a default policy as a regularizer, and using TD error regularization to penalize inaccurate value estimation. These methods aim to improve performance and accelerate convergence in continuous control tasks. In this work, simpler regularization methods are studied in deep reinforcement learning, focusing on penalizing inaccurate value estimation and GAE variance. Generalization in Deep RL refers to model performance in different environments, influenced by game modes, simulation vs. real world, parameter variations, and random seeds in environment generation. In Deep RL, various methods address generalization issues such as training over multiple domains, adversarial training, model architecture design, and meta reinforcement learning. Studies show that algorithms performing well in training environments may struggle with domain shifts. Recent research also explores the impact of conventional regularization techniques. Recent studies have explored the effects of conventional regularization techniques on generalization in Deep Q-Networks (DQN). Different approaches include L2 regularization, dropout, data augmentation, and Batch Normalization. This study focuses on the impact of regularization in the same environment, a more direct goal compared to generalization. Two common approaches for regularization are discouraging complex models and injecting noise. In the context of Deep Q-Networks (DQN), regularization techniques such as L2/L1 weight regularization and weight clipping are explored to prevent overfitting and encourage simpler models. L2 regularization penalizes the norm of the weight vector, while L1 regularization penalizes the absolute weight values. Weight clipping involves limiting individual weight values after each gradient update step. Weight clipping is a simple regularization technique where each weight is clipped to a specified range after each gradient update step. It is used in Wasserstein GANs to ensure Lipschitz continuity and stabilize training. This method reduces model complexity by preventing weights from exceeding a certain magnitude. In contrast, dropout randomly deactivates neurons during training to prevent overfitting in neural networks. Batch Normalization (BN) addresses internal covariate shift by rescaling activations during training. Dropout prevents overfitting by acting as an implicit model ensemble method. Entropy regularization in policy optimization penalizes the output distribution to maintain high entropy and prevent overfitting to specific actions. Entropy regularization in policy optimization penalizes high entropy in the network. The regularization term is calculated for each state-action pair and averaged within the batch. A coefficient \u03bb is added to the policy objective to encourage exploration and improve long-term performance. Six regularization methods are evaluated using popular policy optimization algorithms such as A2C, TRPO, PPO, and SAC. The algorithms are either on-policy or off-policy, with code adopted from OpenAI Baseline and official implementations used for SAC. The algorithms with different regularizations are tested on nine continuous control tasks from MuJoCo and RoboSchool environments. The tasks are categorized as \"easy\" or \"hard\" based on their difficulty levels. The study evaluates different regularization methods on nine continuous control tasks from MuJoCo and RoboSchool environments. Training hyperparameters are kept unchanged for MuJoCo tasks, while they are briefly tuned for RoboSchool tasks. Results are based on regularizing the policy network and using five random seeds for each experiment. Regularization methods are evaluated independently, with the baseline being no regularization. Training and test modes are used for BN and dropout when updating the network and sampling trajectories. In experiments, entropy regularization is added to the policy optimization loss function for SAC. Policy network dropout is not suitable for TRPO due to violation of trust region constraint during policy updates. Training curves show the performance of four algorithms in four environments. In experiments, entropy regularization is added to the policy optimization loss function for SAC. Policy network dropout is not suitable for TRPO due to violation of trust region constraint during policy updates. Training curves from four environments and four algorithms are plotted in Figure 1, with different regularization methods showing performance improvements. Regularizations can boost performance across tasks and algorithms, with some cases requiring regularization for convergence to a high level. BN consistently hurts the baseline for on-policy algorithms. Regularizations can boost performance across tasks and algorithms, with some cases requiring regularization for convergence to a high level. For the off-policy SAC algorithm, dropout and BN sometimes bring large improvements on hard tasks like AtlasForwardWalk and RoboschoolHumanoid. Performance is considered \"improved\" by the regularization if the return with regularization is greater than the baseline return minus the standard deviation. The study set thresholds for regularization techniques in different tasks. L2 regularization most often improved performance, while A2C benefited from entropy regularization. L1 regularization was outperformed by L2. Weight clipping's effectiveness varied. BN and dropout were not useful in some algorithms but showed benefits in others like SAC. Regularization methods generally improved performance more on harder tasks. Under the study's definition, L2 and entropy regularization never hurt performance, while L1, weight clipping, dropout, and BN showed varying levels of hurting in certain cases. Hurting percentages ranged from 0.0% for L2 to 72.2% for dropout, with most hurting cases observed in on-policy algorithms. Regularizations like L2 and entropy rarely hurt performance, with hurting percentages ranging from 0.0% for L2 to 72.2% for dropout. BN and dropout in on-policy algorithms showed the most hurting cases. Rankings of regularization methods were compared for effectiveness in improving performance. Regularizations like L2 and entropy generally outperform baselines, with L2 being the strongest in most cases. Baseline performance is lower on harder tasks, indicating that regularization is more effective in such scenarios. Experiments were conducted with default hyperparameters, which may not be optimized, leading to poor performance in some cases. RL algorithms are sensitive to hyperparameter changes. Our findings suggest that RL algorithms are sensitive to hyperparameter changes, which can affect the results. To confirm our findings, we evaluated regularizations under various hyperparameter settings and observed significant improvements in poor baselines. The standard deviation of ranks for different regularization methods was analyzed under randomly sampled training hyperparameters. Further details can be found in the appendices and tables provided. The study evaluated the effectiveness of different regularization methods on RL algorithms under various hyperparameter settings. Results showed that regularizations can improve baselines with harder tasks, with L2 being the most effective method. Interestingly, L1 regularization and weight clipping were found to be more effective than entropy regularization, especially for harder tasks. Visualizations in Figure 2 demonstrate the impact of varying a single hyperparameter on the results. Proper regularizations can simplify the hyperparameter tuning process. Regularizations can ease hyperparameter tuning by improving baseline performance, even surpassing baselines with better hyperparameters. They show robustness against different network widths/depths and can help prevent overfitting in larger networks. For example, L2 regularization may be more beneficial for thinner networks in some cases. In experiments evaluating regularization on policy and value networks, it was found that regularizing the policy network alone was generally the most effective approach across different algorithms. Regularizing the policy network tends to be the most effective approach in improving performance in reinforcement learning. Generalization between samples in RL environments makes regularization necessary for successful policy optimization, especially on harder tasks with larger state spaces. Regularization is crucial for successful policy optimization in reinforcement learning, especially on harder tasks with larger state spaces. BN and dropout may improve off-policy algorithms like SAC but can harm on-policy algorithms due to discrepancies between sampling and optimization policies. Batch Normalization layers can be sensitive to input distribution shifts, causing potential destabilization in training, especially in on-policy algorithms where discrepancies between sampling and optimization policies can lead to off-policy issues. In contrast, off-policy algorithms naturally accept off-policy data, making this discrepancy less of an issue. Regularization methods were studied with various policy optimization algorithms on continuous control benchmarks. L2 regularization was found to be effective in improving performance, more so than entropy regularization. Batch Normalization and dropout were useful only in off-policy algorithms. It is recommended to regularize the policy network alone, rather than the value network or both. The policy optimization algorithms A2C and A3C aim to update the parametric policy to maximize cumulative rewards in reinforcement learning. A3C introduces a function approximator for values to reduce variance and utilizes multiple actors for parallel training. The main difference between A2C and A3C is the timing of updating neural network parameters during training iterations. Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) proposes to constrain updates within a safe region defined by KL divergence for policy improvement. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) simplifies TRPO by clipping the probability ratio for computational efficiency. Soft Actor Critic (SAC) optimizes the maximum entropy objective in reward, combining soft policy iteration and clipping. Soft Actor Critic (SAC) combines soft policy iteration with clipped double Q learning to prevent overestimation bias. Regularization is applied to the policy and value networks by adding L1 and L2 terms to the loss function. Different lambda values are tuned for each algorithm, with SAC using a specific range for L1 and L2 regularization. The policy network weight clipping is applied differently in OpenAI Baseline implementation of A2C, TRPO, and PPO compared to SAC. In A2C, TRPO, and PPO, weight clipping is applied only to the weights of the MLP, resulting in better performance. In SAC, weight clipping is applied to all the weights of the MLP since both the mean and log standard deviation come from the same MLP. The policy network clipping range is tuned for all algorithms. For all algorithms, policy network clipping range is tuned in [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5]. Value network in MLP produces a single output of estimated value, so weights are clipped. A2C, TRPO, and PPO tune clipping range in [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5]. SAC clips V network weights only, not the two Q networks, with range [0.3, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0]. Batch Normalization/dropout applied before/after activation function. Regularization used in train mode for updates and test mode for sampling trajectories. During training, regularization techniques like Batch Normalization and dropout are used for the value network, while only training mode is applied for Batch Normalization/dropout on the value network. Policy network dropout can cause training to fail on TRPO due to violated constraints. Entropy regularization is added to the policy loss with different tuning parameters for A2C, TRPO, PPO, and SAC algorithms. In SAC, entropy regularization is directly added to the optimization objective. The optimal policy network regularization strength for each algorithm and environment is detailed in the legends of Appendix L. Results are also shown when the regularization strength is fixed across all environments for the same algorithm. The effect of regularizing both policy and value networks is investigated by combining the tuned optimal policy and value network regularization strengths. Training A2C, TRPO, and PPO on the HalfCheetah environment shows high variance in results, requiring reruns for final outcomes. In Table 1 Training timesteps, different algorithms require varying numbers of timesteps for different environments. SAC runs fewer timesteps compared to A2C, TRPO, and PPO due to its slower simulation speed. Hyperparameters for RoboSchool tasks are based on those from the original PPO paper. The hyperparameters for different algorithms are adjusted to optimize performance. The log standard deviation of action distribution is learned by the algorithm in OpenAI Baseline. TRPO and PPO share hyperparameters, while A2C keeps its original settings. The number of actors and timesteps are tuned for A2C, reward scale is adjusted for SAC. Results based on five hyperparameter settings are presented. For hyperparameter variations, learning rates and key hyperparameters are adjusted for algorithms like A2C, TRPO, PPO, and SAC. Parameters such as rollout timesteps, trajectory sampling timesteps, and number of actors are varied within specific ranges for each algorithm. Learning rates and other parameters are sampled within specified ranges for each algorithm to optimize performance. The update uses conjugate gradient descent controlled by max KL divergence. For PPO, learning rate, number of actors, and cliprange are varied. Default reward scale is adjusted for different modes. Experiments on generalization include evaluating rewards on sampled trajectories for PPO Humanoid and TRPO Ant models. Reward distribution is plotted for 100 trajectories. The trajectory reward distributions for regularized models show higher and more stable rewards compared to the baseline, indicating improved generalization ability. Fewer training samples are needed for regularized models to reach the same reward level as the baseline on unseen samples/trajectories. Regularized models demonstrate better generalization ability compared to baselines, especially when trained on fewer samples. The strength of regularization was tuned for each algorithm and environment in previous sections, but now a single strength is applied across different environments. L2 regularization generally performs the best, except in the case of SAC where Batch Normalization is more effective due to varying reward scaling coefficients. The study explores the impact of combining L2 and entropy regularization on different algorithms in various environments. Results show mixed effects on performance, with some algorithms benefiting while others do not. This suggests that the benefits of regularization may not always be additive. The study compares the effects of L2 regularization and AdamW on performance in different environments. Results show that both methods can improve performance significantly. Both L2 regularization and AdamW can enhance performance significantly, with AdamW slightly underperforming compared to L2 regularization."
