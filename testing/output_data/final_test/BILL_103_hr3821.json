It includes provisions for interim coastwise passenger trade endorsement. The United States Passenger Vessel Development Act promotes the construction and operation of US flag passenger vessels, including provisions for an interim coastwise passenger trade endorsement. This endorsement allows a passenger vessel to be eligible for documentation if owned by a US citizen, meets certain size requirements, and is not a ferry. The interim coastwise passenger trade endorsement requires the owner or charterer of a vessel to build new vessels in the US, with a berthing capacity of at least 80% of the endorsed vessel. Vessels with this endorsement can carry passengers in coastwise trade, and the endorsement can be extended for up to 6 months after a demise charter ends. The interim coastwise passenger trade endorsement issued for a vessel expires after 12 months if the owner or demise charter fails to submit a letter stating their interest in building a new vessel in the US with at least 80% berthing capacity of the endorsed vessel. The coastwise passenger trade endorsement expires if a new vessel is not contracted for within 24 months, construction does not begin within 3 years, or a completed vessel is not delivered within 180 days. The Secretary has the authority to extend these timeframes. The Secretary has the authority to extend the period for an interim coastwise passenger trade endorsement for a vessel by up to 6 months. The endorsement prohibits the vessel from operating in a trade served by another passenger vessel of certain specifications, unless the owner or charterer of both vessels is the same. The vessel must comply with all requirements applicable to a comparable passenger vessel documented under US laws. The table of sections in chapter 121 of title 46, United States Code, is amended by adding a new item after section 12112. Section 12113 of title 46, United States Code allows a person to operate a vessel under a foreign registry or authority without approval from the Secretary of Transportation if the vessel has an interim coastwise passenger trade endorsement. The person must notify the Secretary within specific timeframes outlined in the amendment to Section 9 of the Shipping Act, 1916. The amendment allows for the operation of vessels under a foreign registry without approval if they have an interim coastwise passenger trade endorsement or are beginning construction of replacement vessels required under section 12113 of title 46, United States Code. SEC. 4 amends Section 2113 of title 46, United States Code to establish construction standards for SOLAS. A documented vessel with an interim coastwise passenger trade endorsement must comply with safety standards issued under the International Maritime Organization convention. SEC. 5 addresses citizenship requirements for vessel documentation. SEC. 5 amends the Shipping Act, 1916 to define citizenship requirements for issuing certificates of documentation for vessels. SEC. 6 modifies the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 by updating terminology related to passenger and cargo transportation. SEC. 7 addresses permits for vessels entering units of the National Park System. The Secretary of Commerce may only allow vessels to operate in the National Park System based on priority: first, US-documented vessels; second, foreign-documented vessels already permitted; third, other vessels. The Secretary must revoke permits for foreign-documented vessels if necessary. The Secretary of Commerce can revoke permission for a foreign-documented vessel to operate in a National Park if a US-documented vessel requests permission and there is a limit on permits."
