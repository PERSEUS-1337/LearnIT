    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Paleontological Resources Preservation Act\" and includes definitions for various terms. The \"Paleontological Resources Preservation Act\" defines casual collecting as the non-commercial collection of common invertebrate and plant paleontological resources with minimal disturbance, determined by the Secretary of the Interior or Agriculture. The \"Paleontological Resources Preservation Act\" defines terms related to land ownership, including Federal lands controlled by the Secretary of the Interior or Agriculture, Indian lands held in trust or with restrictions, and the definition of State. The \"Paleontological Resources Preservation Act\" defines paleontological resources as fossilized remains, traces, or imprints of organisms that provide information about the history of life on earth, excluding materials associated with archaeological resources or cultural items. The Secretary is responsible for managing and protecting paleontological resources on Federal lands using scientific principles. Plans for inventory, monitoring, and use of these resources must be developed, emphasizing coordination with non-Federal partners and the public. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture should coordinate in implementing the Act. Additionally, a public awareness and education program will be established, and there will be a collection of paleontological resources. (a) Permit Requirement. A paleontological resource may not be collected from Federal lands without a permit issued by the Secretary, except for casual collecting on certain Federal lands without a permit. Previous valid permits are not affected. (b) Criteria for Issuance of a Permit. The Secretary may issue a permit for collection if certain criteria are met. The Secretary may issue a permit for the collection of paleontological resources on Federal lands if the applicant is qualified, the activity furthers paleontological knowledge or public education, aligns with management plans, and does not threaten natural or cultural resources. The permit will include terms ensuring that collected resources remain the property of the United States. Federal lands under the permit will remain the property of the United States; the paleontological resource and associated records will be preserved in an approved repository for scientific research and public education; specific locality data will not be released without written permission. The Secretary may modify, suspend, or revoke a permit for resource, safety, or management reasons, or for violations of permit terms. The permit may be revoked if a person is convicted under section 9 or assessed a civil penalty under section 10. The Secretary has the authority to restrict access or close areas to protect paleontological resources and ensure public safety. SEC. 6. CURATION OF RESOURCES. Any paleontological resource collected under a permit must be deposited in an approved repository. The Secretary can make agreements with non-Federal repositories for curation. SEC. 7. PROHIBITED ACTS; CRIMINAL PENALTIES. (a) A person may not excavate, remove, damage, or alter any paleontological resources on Federal lands without following this Act. They also cannot exchange, transport, export, receive, or sell any paleontological resource if they knew or should have known it was obtained illegally from Federal lands. A person may not make false records or labels for paleontological resources excavated from Federal lands. Violators may face fines or imprisonment up to 10 years, depending on the value of the resources involved. The Act prohibits making false records or labels for paleontological resources from Federal lands, with penalties of fines, imprisonment up to 10 years, or both. However, this does not apply to individuals who lawfully possessed the resources before the Act's enactment. SEC. 8. CIVIL PENALTIES. The Secretary may assess penalties for violations of regulations or permits under the Act, with each violation considered a separate offense. The penalty amount is determined based on factors such as the value of the paleontological resource and the cost of response and restoration. The Secretary may assess penalties for violations under the Act based on factors like the value of the resource and site damage. For multiple offenses, the penalty amount may double, but it cannot exceed double the cost of response and resource value. Judicial review is available for those penalized. The Secretary may assess penalties for violations under the Act based on factors like the value of the resource and site damage. Judicial review of the penalty order can be sought in the United States District Court within 30 days of issuance. If the penalty is not paid within 30 days after becoming final, further actions may be taken. The Secretary may request the Attorney General to collect penalties through a civil action in a district court if a person fails to file a petition for judicial review or if a court upholds the penalty assessment. The district court will have jurisdiction over the case, and the validity and amount of the penalty cannot be reviewed. Penalties for failure to pay assessments may include attorneys fees and collection costs. Hearings during proceedings will follow section 554 of title 5, United States Code. Collected penalties will be used to protect, restore, or acquire paleontological resources and sites. The Federal government will monitor and study resources and sites, subject to limitations in the legislation. They will also provide educational materials to the public and pay rewards as specified in section 11. SEC. 9. REWARDS AND FORFEITURE. The Secretary may pay rewards from penalties collected under section 9 or 10 to individuals providing information leading to civil or criminal violations. The reward amount is determined by regulations or half of the penalty, up to $500. Government officials are not eligible for rewards. All paleontological resources involved in violations are subject to forfeiture. The Secretary may transfer seized paleontological resources to educational institutions for scientific or educational purposes. Civil and criminal violations of the Act may result in forfeiture of resources and vehicles used in connection with the violation. Provisions of law regarding seizure, forfeiture, and condemnation apply, along with procedural provisions of title 18, United States Code. SEC. 10.
