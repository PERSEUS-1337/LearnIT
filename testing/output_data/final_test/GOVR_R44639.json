    "content": "The FY2017 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act will fund military construction activities for the Armed Forces, including base closures, housing operations, and NATO Security Investment. The Administration requested $7.62 billion for military construction in FY2017, with $7.44 billion for base activities and $172.4 million for Overseas Contingency Operations. The FY2017 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act requested $7.62 billion for military construction, with the House proposing $7.87 billion and the Senate proposing $7.93 billion. The House-Senate conference reported a total appropriation of $8.21 billion, pending Senate action. Congressional deliberations on the defense budget may be influenced by broader budget discussions. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established annual caps on discretionary appropriations through FY2021. The impact on defense appropriations is discussed in detail in CRS Report R44519. H.R. 4974 and S. 2806 were introduced for military construction appropriations. H.R. 2577, originally for T-HUD appropriations, was amended to encompass three separate appropriations. In May 2016, amendments were made to H.R. 2577, which combined three separate appropriations into Division A for T-HUD, Division B for MILCON/VA, and an additional Title V for Zika virus response. The Senate passed the amended bill on May 19, 2016, and sent it to the House. The House proposed further amendments, passing the bill on May 26, 2016, and requesting a conference. The conference was held on June 15, 2016, resulting in the filing of report H.Rept. 114-640. The conference held on June 15, 2016, resulted in the filing of report H.Rept. 114-640. The House and Senate agreed to the amended bill, which included divisions for Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, Zika Response, Continuing Appropriations, and Rescissions of Funds. The Senate passed the bill on September 28, 2016, and the House agreed on September 29, 2016. Congress authorized the BRAC rounds in 1988, 1990, 1991, 1993, and 1995 to reduce defense property and costs. The President signed the bill into law on September 29, 2016. The BRAC rounds were authorized by Congress in various years to reduce defense property and costs. The most recent round was approved in 2005 and carried out between 2006 and late 2011. Despite repeated requests for new rounds, Congress has declined to authorize them, as shown in Figure 1. The current NDAA explicitly prohibits a new BRAC round, leading to objections from the Obama Administration. The President has requested $7.62 billion for military construction and housing in FY2017, a decrease from previous years. The trend of reduced military construction funding began in FY2010 due to the decline in BRAC-related activities. The OCO portion of the budget request reflects a shift towards construction in the CENTCOM region. In recent years, OCO military construction has shifted from the CENTCOM and AFRICOM regions to EUCOM in Europe. Funding for OCO construction in FY2011 was directed to the CENTCOM region, with a significant amount allocated to Afghanistan, Qatar, and Bahrain. This trend began to change in FY2012, with a shift towards projects in Afghanistan, Bahrain, and Djibouti. In FY2013, construction funds were allocated to Djibouti, Bahrain, Diego Garcia, and Romania for the ballistic missile defense AEGIS Ashore complex. Funding for OCO construction in FY2015 focused on Djibouti and Bahrain, with an emphasis on improvement projects. The FY2016 appropriation of $428.9 million focused on AEGIS Ashore Missile Defense Complex in Poland, ship repair in Bahrain, and airfield improvements in Oman, Niger, and Djibouti. The FY2017 request of $172.4 million prioritized airfield improvements in Estonia, Lithuania, Romania, Bulgaria, and Poland, with additional facilities in Iceland and Germany for specific aircraft. The remaining funds were intended for projects in Djibouti. The Federal Budget Process includes various reports on Department of Veterans Affairs, Defense Appropriations, National Defense Authorization Act, Defense Budget Request, Overseas Contingency Operations Funding, and Defense Spending under the Budget Control Act Limits. Table A-1 displays budget authority amounts for military construction and family housing appropriations for FY2016, as enacted and requested by the President, passed by chambers, and reported by the conference committee. It includes clusters similar to those in the bills, along with Administrative Provisions detailing fund rescissions and new military funding. The Provisions section includes rescissions of funds and new funding for military departments' Unfunded Priorities List (UPL), which identifies budget authority not requested by the President for various components such as Active Components, Reserve Components, NATO Security Investment Program, Family Housing, BRAC, Administrative Provisions, and Unfunded Priority Lists. Table A-2 presents the military construction funding requested and recommended for Overseas.
