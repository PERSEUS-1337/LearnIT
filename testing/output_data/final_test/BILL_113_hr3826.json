    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Electricity Security and Affordability Act\" and includes standards of performance for new fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating units. The \"Electricity Security and Affordability Act\" prohibits the EPA from issuing rules for greenhouse gas emissions from new fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating units unless specific requirements are met. These rules must separate coal and natural gas sources and cannot be based on the best system. The \"Electricity Security and Affordability Act\" prohibits the EPA from setting emission standards based on the best system of emission reduction for new sources within a fossil-fuel category unless specific criteria are met. This includes achieving the standard for at least one continuous 12-month period by at least 6 representative units located at different electric generating stations in the United States. The \"Electricity Security and Affordability Act\" prohibits the EPA from setting emission standards based on the best system of emission reduction for new sources within a fossil-fuel category unless specific criteria are met. This includes achieving the standard for at least one continuous 12-month period by at least 6 representative units located at different electric generating stations in the United States. In carrying out subsection (b)(1), the EPA shall establish a separate subcategory for new sources that are fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating units using coal with an average heat content of 8300 or less British Thermal Units per pound. The EPA cannot set emission standards based on the best system of emission reduction for a subcategory unless the standard has been achieved for at least one continuous 12-month period by at least 3 units located at different electric generating stations in the United States. The EPA can set emission standards based on foreign technologies demonstrated at US fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating units, as long as the standards meet specific requirements. Congress will determine the effective date for standards of performance for existing, modified, and reconstructed fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating units. This section applies to rules issued by the EPA under the Clean Air Act for emissions of greenhouse gases from fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating units. The effective date of these rules must be set by Congress through federal law. Reporting requirements must be met before these rules can take effect. The EPA must submit a report to Congress before rules on greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating units can take effect. The report must include the text of the rule, economic impacts, including effects on economic growth, competitiveness, and jobs, as well as greenhouse gas emission reductions. The EPA must consult with various agencies when implementing rules to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. SEC. 4. REPEAL OF EARLIER RULES AND GUIDELINES. The rules and guidelines regarding greenhouse gas emissions for new stationary sources, specifically for electric utility generating units, published in 2012 and withdrawn in 2013, shall be treated as if they had never been issued. The proposed rule for greenhouse gas emissions from new stationary sources, specifically electric utility generating units, signed in 2013, and identified by docket ID number EPA-HQ-OAR-2013-0495, is subject to certain conditions for any successor or similar rule issued before the enactment of this Act. Any proposed or final rule or guidelines under section 111 of the Clean Air Act that establish standards for greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating units before the enactment of this Act. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, key definitions include \"demonstration project\" for testing carbon capture technologies, \"existing source\" as defined in the Clean Air Act, \"greenhouse gas\" encompassing various gases, and \"modification\" in the context of sources. The term \"modification\" in this Act refers to changes as defined in the Clean Air Act, while \"modified source\" and \"new source\" are stationary sources with specific modifications or new constructions after the enactment of this Act. The House of Representatives passed the Act on March 6, 2014. Karen L. Haas attested to it as the Clerk."
