The Seniors Health Choice Preservation Act of 2000 applies budget neutrality to the new Medicare+Choice risk adjustment methodology, ensuring no significant change in expenditures compared to previous methodology. Effective from the date of enactment, it applies to payments starting January 2001. The Seniors Health Choice Preservation Act of 2000 ensures budget neutrality for the new Medicare+Choice risk adjustment methodology. It mandates the implementation of health-status risk adjustment through negotiated rulemaking, involving representatives of Medicare+Choice organizations and providers. The Seniors Health Choice Preservation Act of 2000 mandates the implementation of health-status risk adjustment for Medicare+Choice enrollees. The methodology will be developed through negotiated rulemaking involving various stakeholders and will consider costs versus benefits in terms of predictive power. The Secretary will appoint a committee to oversee the process and establish deadlines for implementation. The negotiated rulemaking committee must be appointed within 6 months of the enactment of the paragraph, with recommendations due to the Secretary by December 31, 2001. Regulations based on the committee's recommendations will supersede those implemented under paragraph (3). Additionally, there are limitations on the phase-in of the current health-status risk adjustment methodology. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 is amended to adjust capitation rates for Medicare+Choice organizations. The requirement to report encounter data for sites other than hospital inpatient departments is eliminated. Regulations are implemented for the health-status risk adjustment methodology developed under the amendment. SEC. 4 amends the Social Security Act to increase Medicare+Choice capitation rates annually. SEC. 5 addresses payment for drug inflation differentials in Medicare+Choice plans with prescription drug coverage. SEC. 4 amends the Social Security Act to increase Medicare+Choice capitation rates annually. It includes a provision for payment of additional drug inflation differentials for Medicare+Choice plans offering qualified prescription drug coverage. The term 'qualified prescription drug coverage' refers to outpatient coverage without a deductible and with benefits of at least $1,500 annually. Medicare+Choice plans can impose copayments but not deductibles. Conditions for these plans include no separate premium for prescription drug coverage. The adjusted community rate proposal for Medicare+Choice plans must certify that the cost of drug benefits does not exceed 150 percent of the Secretary's estimate, taking into account changes in benefits provided. The percentage specified for a plan in a year is determined by the drug inflation differential. The Medicare+Choice plans must ensure that the cost of drug benefits does not exceed a certain percentage increase in the annual capitation rate. The ratio of the average value of prescription drug coverage to the total benefits value must be maintained, with a minimum percentage set at 0. The Medicare+Choice plans must ensure that the cost of drug benefits does not exceed a certain percentage increase in the annual capitation rate, with a minimum percentage set at 0. The amendments made by subsection (a) apply to payment for months beginning with January 2002."
