    "content": "Eligible veterans are entitled to receive military honors at their funerals, provided by the Department of Defense at various types of cemeteries. There is no cost to the family for these honors, as outlined in specific statutes. The conferees agree that veterans deserve military honors at their funerals to commemorate their service and sacrifices. Prior to P.L. 105-261, there was no formal requirement for the Department of Defense to provide these honors, but they were customarily given. Active duty servicemembers and members of the Selected Reserve who die while in service are eligible for military funeral honors. Veterans who served on active duty may also be eligible for military funeral honors if they meet certain requirements. Veterans eligible for military funeral honors include those who served in various branches of the military or civilian groups granted veterans status, and were disabled or died from a duty-related disease or injury. Former members of the Selected Reserve are also eligible if they completed an enlistment or were discharged due to a duty-related disability. Ineligibility may result from discharge type or involvement in a capital crime. A person may be ineligible for military funeral honors if discharged under dishonorable conditions, convicted of a capital crime, or if circumstances would bring discredit upon their service. Specific types of discharges that make a person ineligible include dishonorable discharge, bad conduct discharge, dismissal from service by courts-martial, and others specified by the Secretary of Defense. A person is ineligible for military funeral honors if convicted of a federal or state capital crime, as determined by clear and convincing evidence. A federal capital crime is one that carries a sentence of life imprisonment or death under federal law, while a state capital crime involves the deliberate killing of another human being. The denial of eligibility for military funeral honors for individuals involved in capital crimes was established in 1997 with the enactment of P.L. 105-116. This legislation prohibits interment or inurnment in VA national cemeteries, Arlington National Cemetery, or military cemeteries for those convicted of federal capital crimes. The passage of P.L. 105-116 in 1997 denied eligibility for interment in national cemeteries for individuals convicted of federal or state capital crimes, unless sentenced to death or life imprisonment without parole. This legislation aimed to prevent individuals like Timothy McVeigh, convicted in the Oklahoma City bombing, from being buried in a national cemetery. The Oklahoma City bombing deeply affected the nation, leading to legislation in 2006 that denied military funeral honors for individuals involved in capital crimes. This law aimed to prevent individuals like Timothy McVeigh, responsible for the bombing, from receiving a hero's burial. The legislation in 2006, known as P.L. 109-163, prohibits individuals with final federal or state capital crime convictions from being interred in national cemeteries or receiving military funeral honors. This affected cases like that of Russell Wayne Wagner, an Army veteran convicted of murder, who was inurned at Arlington National Cemetery before the law was enacted. The enactment of P.L. 109-163 did not prohibit military honors for individuals involved in capital crimes. Wagner's funeral at Arlington National Cemetery included such honors, despite concerns from the victims' family. The law prevented Wagner from receiving military funeral honors at Arlington, but his cremated remains remained there. Another law in 2006, P.L. 109-461, ordered the removal of Wagner's remains. The enactment of P.L. 109-461 in 2006 ordered the Secretary of the Army to remove Wagner's cremated remains from Arlington National Cemetery and return them to his family. Federal law mandates minimum elements for military funeral honors, including a funeral honors detail of at least two non-retired uniformed members of the Armed Forces, the folding and presentation of a U.S. flag, and the playing of Taps. Each branch can add additional elements like firing parties or color guards. The funeral honors detail must include at least two non-retired members in uniform, with one from the deceased's branch of service. The DOD established the Authorized Provider Partnership Program (AP3) to authorize volunteers to augment funeral honors details. AP3 participants are members of Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs), other veterans groups, and ROTC detachments. They can serve as color guards, firing parties, pallbearers, or buglers, selected and trained by local military base commanders. Members of the Ready Reserve and National Guard can also serve on funeral honors details. Members of the Ready Reserve and National Guard serving on funeral honors details are entitled to a $50 daily stipend. AP3 members can receive reimbursement for expenses or the stipend set by the DOD. Taps, a bugle call used in military funeral ceremonies, is a required component of honors. It can be played live or through a recorded version using a ceremonial bugle. The bugle plays a recording of Taps during military funeral honors. Veterans are entitled to a burial flag provided by the VA. The flag is draped over the casket with the union at the head and left shoulder. Only one flag is authorized per veteran. After Taps, the flag is folded into a traditional shape by two members of the funeral honors detail. Members of the funeral honors detail fold the flag into a traditional tri-cornered shape with only the union visible. The flag is then presented to the next-of-kin or family member following a specific protocol. If there is no honors detail, a funeral director may present the flag to the family. The presentation of the burial flag to the family has a standardized statement since 2012, with eligibility requirements for Arlington National Cemetery being more stringent than VA national cemeteries. Different criteria apply for ground burial and inurnment at Arlington National Cemetery. Civilians who have performed active duty military service and granted veteran status are eligible for inurnment in the Columbarium or Niche Wall at Arlington National Cemetery. Enlisted personnel at pay grades E-8 or below receive Standard Military Honors, while senior enlisted personnel, warrant officers, and commissioned officers are entitled to Full Military Honors. Officers entitled to Full Military Honors at Arlington National Cemetery include Standard Military Honors, an escort platoon, a military band, and the use of the caisson. Colonels may also receive a caparisoned riderless horse. General and flag officers, high state officials, and the President are entitled to cannon or minute gun salutes. Effective January 2, 2009, all servicemembers who die from enemy action wounds are eligible for Full Military Honors. Spouses and eligible dependents receive a casket team of body bearers. Same-sex spouses are now eligible for burial at Arlington National Cemetery and VA national cemeteries following the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Windsor."
