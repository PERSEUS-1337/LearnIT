    "content": "The Act titled \"Equalizing Transparency for Veterans Act\" requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to publish information on the provision of health care. The \"Equalizing Transparency for Veterans Act\" mandates the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to publish biennially on an Internet database information about health care provision, including measures for inpatient and outpatient care at each medical facility. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to report on various healthcare measures, such as emergency department throughput, hospital consumer assessments, and patient outcomes like length of stay, opioid prescription rate, and suicide rate. The publication required by the Department of Veterans Affairs for nursing homes must include measures publicly available for Medicare nursing homes. The information covered should include the average wait time for appointments or procedures requested by patients. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will publish information equivalent to that of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Personal information connected to the published data will be protected. A validation process will be established, including audits of medical facilities and opportunities for appeal. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will submit an annual report to Congress listing underperforming facilities and improvement plans. The Comptroller General will provide recommendations to enhance safety and health evaluations for individuals receiving care. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will establish a toll-free hotline for reporting low-quality care at VA health care facilities within two years of the Act's enactment. Patients and caregivers will be informed of this telephone number."
