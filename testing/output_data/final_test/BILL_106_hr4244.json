    "content": "The \"National Child Protection Volunteer Screening Assistance Act of 2000\" establishes a National Center on Volunteer Screening under the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974. Congress acknowledges the significant role of volunteers in child and youth organizations, providing essential services in safe environments. Despite the small incidence of child abuse, it has a profound impact on victims and erodes public trust in care providers. Congress addressed concerns about abuse by enacting laws for criminal record checks of care providers working with vulnerable populations. National criminal history checks using fingerprints are recommended for volunteers who may have lived in multiple states, despite the high cost. A national volunteer screening center is needed to provide no-cost national criminal history background checks for volunteers to protect children from risks associated with the current cumbersome and costly system. National criminal history background checks are conducted on volunteers providing care through public and nonprofit private agencies and organizations. \"SEC. 603.
