    "content": "On October 9, 2006, North Korea conducted a nuclear test with a low yield of less than one kiloton. This followed a series of provocations, including missile launches in July 2006. Since 2005, North Korea had boycotted the Six-Party Talks aimed at eliminating its nuclear weapons program. Experts estimate North Korea may have added six to eight more weapons' worth of plutonium since 2002. President Bush and U.S. officials condemned the test. North Korea conducted a nuclear test with a low yield on October 9, 2006. President Bush and U.S. officials condemned the test and called for a swift response from the United Nations Security Council. The U.N. adopted punitive sanctions, and Secretary of State Rice reaffirmed U.S. security commitment to South Korea and Japan. North Korean officials provided conflicting information on the test's yield to Russian and Chinese officials. Seismic data indicated an explosion equivalent to a 3.58 magnitude earthquake occurred at 10:35 a.m. on October 9. A nuclear test with a low yield was conducted by North Korea on October 9, 2006, near Musudan-ri, North Hamgyong Province. Experts doubted the effectiveness of North Korean nuclear weapons design due to the sub-kiloton explosion. The U.S. Director of National Intelligence confirmed the test had a yield under 1 kiloton near P'unggye. Some experts suggested the test fell short of the expected yield due to imprecise manufacturing, estimating the blast at around 0.2 kt. Comparatively, a simple plutonium implosion device would typically produce a larger blast of 5 to 20 kilotons. On December 8, 2006, President Bush confirmed North Korea's nuclear test. Chinese officials announced resumption of negotiations on December 11, 2006. U.S. negotiators offered assistance details, and financial sanctions were discussed. North Korea dropped its demand for sanctions to be lifted as a precondition for talks. North Korea's Nuclear Weapons Development and Diplomacy report by [author name scrubbed] complements other existing CRS reports on the topic. Additional reports cover sanctions, missiles, counterfeiting, the North Korean economy, U.S. and international assistance, U.S.-Korean relations, and chronologies. In the 109th Congress, legislation was enacted regarding North Korea, including the appointment of a Policy Coordinator and reporting requirements on North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. The North Korea Nonproliferation Act of 2006 added North Korea to the Iran-Syria Nonproliferation Act, authorizing sanctions on third parties. The North Korea Nonproliferation Act of 2006 (P.L. 106-178; P.L. 109-112) authorized sanctions on third parties for weapons-of-mass-destruction-related transfers to and from North Korea, impacting North Korea's missile trade. The UNSC supported a resolution banning trade in heavy weapons and luxury goods, authorizing cargo inspections, and freezing funds related to North Korea's non-conventional weapons programs. The resolution also called on North Korea to refrain from nuclear and ballistic missile tests, rejoin the NPT, suspend its ballistic missile program, and abandon nuclear weapons in a verifiable manner. The final resolution on North Korea, Res. 1718, was weakened in key areas by China and Russia at the UN Security Council. China insisted on language that requested, but did not require, cargo inspections and ruled out military force. The military embargo was scaled back to only include heavy equipment. North Korea viewed the sanctions as an act of war, but the impact on the isolated country's economy remains uncertain. Experts debate the effectiveness of sanctions in changing government policies. Res. 1718 bans trade in certain items instead of imposing a complete embargo. The UN Security Council resolution on North Korea, Res. 1718, bans trade in certain items instead of imposing a complete embargo. China's stance aims to prevent the collapse of the North Korean regime and maintain it as a buffer state between China and US troops in South Korea. The resolution seeks to create conditions for a peaceful resolution through dialogue. After the passage of the resolution, Chinese officials began inspecting trucks bound for North Korea more closely to enforce the sanctions regime on air or ship trade. Beijing stated it would not stop North Korean-bound ships for inspections for illegal weapons and missiles as requested by the resolution. Economists suggest that suspending energy aid from China, which supplies 70% of North Korea's fuel, would be the most effective punishment. Reports showed a decline in oil exports to North Korea in September, leading to speculation about Beijing's actions. Chinese officials denied a cutoff of oil exports to North Korea in September, with customs data showing a resumption in October. Some analysts suggest Beijing may be pressuring Pyongyang by sending fewer refined oil products. South Korea supports the UNSC resolution but will continue cooperation with North Korea on joint projects like the Kaesong Industrial Park and Mt. Kumgang tourism site. South Korea plans to continue economic cooperation with North Korea on joint projects like the Kaesong Industrial Park and Mt. Kumgang tourism site, despite pressure from the Bush Administration. Japan has imposed unilateral sanctions, more restrictive than those in the UN resolution, banning all North Korean ships. Japan has imposed unilateral sanctions, more restrictive than those in the UN resolution, banning all North Korean ships from entering Japanese ports and restricting imports. Additionally, Japan has listed luxury goods such as caviar, jewelry, and watches. Tokyo officials have pledged to assist the US military in inspecting North Korean cargo ships, despite Japan's pacifist constitution. This hardline stance follows Japan's previous actions after North Korea's missile tests in 2006, including freezing bank remittances to North Korea. Japan is now the fifth largest trading partner of North Korea. Analysts suggest North Korea's nuclear test was a bid for bilateral negotiations with the US, aiming to gain leverage. The Bush Administration has refused direct talks outside of the Six-Party Talks process. Selig Harrison believes top North Korean officials are pushing for bilateral discussions. Top North Korean officials are seeking bilateral talks to implement the denuclearization agreement from the 2005 Six-Party Talks. The agreement outlined a path to peaceful denuclearization, with North Korea committing to abandoning its nuclear weapons program in exchange for economic and diplomatic incentives. The United States and North Korea are working towards normalizing relations, with the US seeking resolution on ballistic missile programs and human rights concerns. North Korea's nuclear test may stem from deep insecurity and fear of a US attack, possibly influenced by lessons from the invasion of Iraq. Pyongyang may believe that developing a nuclear capability will deter a US attack. North Korea's nuclear test may be a response to deep insecurity and fear of a US attack, with the belief that having a nuclear capability will deter such an attack. The test could also be a way to demonstrate the country's status as a nuclear-capable state and strengthen leader Kim Jong-il's regime. North Korea's nuclear test is seen as a way for leader Kim Jong-il to maintain power and assert the country's status as a nuclear-capable state. The test is also viewed as a means to compete with South Korea for legitimacy and recognition on the world stage. The CIA had previously assessed that North Korea's experience in high explosives testing may have made nuclear tests unnecessary for validating simple fission weapons. North Korea may have desired to test an implosion device using plutonium, whether indigenous or foreign. U.S. intelligence agencies believe the device used plutonium, but more data is needed to confirm. The test's small yield could suggest a more sophisticated design, but it's unclear if North Korea can place nuclear warheads on ballistic missiles based on this test alone. North Korea's recent nuclear test may not have produced the desired yield, prompting the possibility of further testing to improve the weapon's design. The test, regardless of success or failure, demonstrates North Korea's willingness to defy opposition and endure consequences. This breach of diplomatic norms has significant psychological and stability implications in the region and globally. The uncertainty surrounding North Korea's nuclear capabilities and intentions makes it challenging to assess the actual threat posed to the region and the United States. Different scenarios could shed light on potential threats that may arise. North Korea's nuclear test may lead to further testing to enhance weapon design. The test showcases defiance and willingness to face consequences, impacting regional and global stability. Uncertainty surrounds North Korea's nuclear capabilities and intentions, complicating threat assessment. Potential threats include providing technology to rogue states or terrorist groups, driven by motivations like prestige, leverage, and security concerns. Developing a more sophisticated nuclear arsenal is a possibility for North Korea. North Korea currently has the capability to deliver a crude nuclear device within the region using various means of transportation. They also have the ability to deploy a radiological dispersal device. However, they do not possess the capability to marry nuclear warheads with long-range missiles that could reach the mainland of the United States. North Korea's nuclear ambitions are primarily focused on deterring the United States, with uncertainties surrounding their potential use of nuclear weapons in a conventional conflict. North Korea's possession of nuclear weapons is seen as a strong deterrent against war and a balance of power in the region, with the belief that it can counter a possible U.S. pre-emptive strike. The country claims to have developed nuclear weapons due to a perceived nuclear threat from the United States. North Korea seeks nuclear deterrent against potential U.S. attack, focusing on developing reliable warheads for ICBMs. Threat perception may lead to unconventional use of weapons, such as demonstration detonations or transfers to terrorist groups. Many fear that North Korea's nuclear test could trigger an arms race in Northeast Asia, leading countries like Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan to develop their own nuclear weapons programs in response. This could escalate geopolitical tensions in the region. Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan may consider developing their own nuclear weapons programs in response to the threat from mainland China. Japan, with existing plutonium stocks, could quickly manufacture a nuclear arsenal, while South Korea and Taiwan would take longer. However, Japan is unlikely to pursue nuclear weapons development due to public resistance and adherence to the \"three non-nuclear principles.\" Many Tokyo strategists may recognize that \"going nuclear\" could undermine security by eroding the global nonproliferation regime. Japan and South Korea are protected under the U.S.-Japan alliance's \"nuclear umbrella.\" Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to defend against North Korean threats. Some suggest Japan's nuclear threat was emphasized to pressure Beijing and Seoul. After North Korea's test, Japan's Foreign Minister and ruling party policy chief discussed the possibility of nuclear weapons development. Party policy chief Shoichi Nakagawa suggested Japan should debate the possibility of nuclear weapons, stating they would not violate the constitution. Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone also proposed studying the nuclear option due to regional threats. However, Prime Minister Aso clarified Japan has no intention of developing nuclear weapons, with analysts warning of policy shifts if U.S. alliance weakens. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe aims to strengthen Japan's defense posture, supported by the U.S. to deter North Korea's WMD proliferation. The proliferation of WMD capabilities has raised concerns about sharing nuclear weapons with other states or non-state actors. While there have been few instances of such sharing, the CIA warned in 2002 that countries like North Korea may supply WMD-related technology to others. However, the focus has been on ballistic-missile-related equipment rather than nuclear-related items. North Korea is known for exporting ballistic missiles, leading to concerns about the possibility of selling nuclear weapons or fissile material. Some argue that nuclear weapons confer special prestige and that North Korea may initially keep its nuclear material for its own purposes. However, as North Korea's arsenal grows, there is a possibility that it may be more inclined to share its nuclear capabilities. The Yongbyon reactor produces enough plutonium for about one weapon per year. North Korea's Yongbyon reactor produces about six kg of plutonium per year, enough for one weapon. If North Korea completes its two reactors under construction, it could significantly increase its nuclear stockpile. There are concerns about the risks of transferring nuclear weapons or material due to potential loss of control. Pyongyang has hinted at demonstrating its nuclear capabilities during negotiations in 2003. Former Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly was warned by North Korea that they might demonstrate or transfer nuclear weapons. Despite North Korea denying intentions to sell or export nuclear material to terrorists, the U.S. remains concerned. North Korea has been on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism since 1988, maintaining ties to terrorist groups and selling weapons to them. North Korea has a history of selling weapons to militant groups and providing safe haven to terrorists. Despite signing agreements against terrorism, their past activities raise concerns about the possibility of selling nuclear materials. The North Korean test highlights the risk of selling nuclear materials to terrorist groups and the need for a strong response to demonstrate consequences for disregarding international norms. Lessons from North Korea's past proliferation activities suggest that multilateral incentive programs may not prevent such behavior. The international community faces a key question on how states view North Korea's withdrawal from the NPT and potential consequences. Iranian President Ahmadinejad criticizes UN Security Council actions as a tool for hegemony. The extent to which inspections curb Pyongyang's actions remains uncertain. Iran remains defiant against intimidation, with concerns about North Korea's nuclear weapons program extending beyond the current regime's use. Uncertainty over control of North's nuclear arsenal in case of collapse raises fears of rash military actions or transfer of weapons to foreign entities. Questions also arise about Seoul's willingness to handle reunification scenarios. The Korean government's willingness to give up nuclear weapons is questioned due to uncertain geopolitical conditions. The U.S. aims to prevent further proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and attacks on itself or allies. The Bush Administration is divided on negotiation vs. weakening the regime. Japan's goals align closely with the U.S. in dealing with North Korea through the Six-Party Talks. Japan's interests align closely with U.S. objectives in dealing with North Korea, focusing on security and resolving abduction issues. China and South Korea are concerned about political instability and economic consequences of a collapse in North Korea. Cooperation from Beijing and Seoul is crucial for pursuing U.S. goals. The nuclear test by Pyongyang has led to harsher measures from China and South Korea, but their ultimate objective remains preventing the collapse of North Korea. The current Bush Administration policy on North Korea aims to combine elements of various strategies. The current Bush Administration's North Korea policy focuses on dismantling North Korea's nuclear weapons program through the Six-Party process. It includes diplomatic and economic pressures, criticism of human rights abuses and criminal activities. Critics argue about a divide between those favoring negotiation and regime change, leading to policy paralysis. Some view the policy as weak and passive, with North Korea being a low priority compared to other global issues. Some analysts suggest accepting North Korea as a nuclear power and making nonproliferation commitments in exchange for tacit acceptance of its nuclear status, similar to India, Pakistan, and Israel. However, the US Administration's language indicates they are unlikely to take this approach. Pakistan and India, once criticized for testing nuclear weapons, are now US allies for geopolitical reasons. The U.S. government officials believe North Korea, an adversary with an unpredictable regime, cannot be trusted with nuclear weapons. North Korea, like Iran, joined the NPT but violated it. Pro-engagement advocates suggest direct bilateral relations and reciprocity for a nuclear settlement. Negotiations for normalization of relations would start if North Korea suspends nuclear activities. As North Korea moves towards dismantling its nuclear programs, incentives like access to international banking, energy assistance, and removal from the U.S. terrorism list could be offered. Direct talks between U.S. and North Korean negotiators may precede a potential agreement. This approach aims to leverage positive incentives for a nuclear deal, believing in North Korea's willingness to disarm or strengthening the multilateral coalition through a bilateral approach. The Bush Administration is unlikely to pursue this option. The Bush Administration is unlikely to pursue bilateral negotiations with North Korea, believing that multilateral talks provide the best leverage. North Korea may seek propaganda benefits from negotiations, but U.S. and regional officials still view multilateral negotiations as the way forward. If North Korea remains recalcitrant or boycotts the talks, other options will be considered. If North Korea continues to resist or boycott the Six-Party Talks, the other parties may convene to develop a joint strategy in response to the tests. The focus would be on coordinating strategies, urging China and South Korea to implement measures and strengthen sanctions to pressure North Korea to return to negotiations. Sustaining punitive measures from South Korea and China post-crisis could be a challenge. The United States and Japan would need to uphold their commitment to resolving the issue diplomatically, as China and South Korea oppose military threats. The Bush Administration has developed programs to increase pressure on North Korea, targeting cash and goods acquired through illicit activities. Strengthening these initiatives may threaten Kim Jong-il's hold on power and encourage negotiations. However, squeezing North Korea could lead to quicker proliferation of weapons and nuclear material. Some experts question the significance of illegal activities in the North Korean economy. The United States has taken unilateral measures to financially isolate North Korea, targeting banks involved in money laundering and counterfeiting activities. This action has led to several banks, including those in China, suspending business with North Korean companies. By using financial leverage on international banks, the U.S. aims to squeeze the North Korean regime and reinforce its message through sanctions on other banks. The U.S. government is considering imposing sanctions on a mainland Chinese bank suspected of aiding North Korean firms in illegal activities. There is a discussion about strengthening the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) to intercept WMD-related materials, technology, and equipment. The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) aims to intercept WMD-related materials, technology, and equipment. Efforts have been made to conclude bilateral ship-boarding agreements for short-notice cargo inspections. UN Res. 1718 does not authorize interception or confiscation of cargo, only focuses efforts. Japan is the only country in the region that is a member of PSI, while South Korea may participate on a case-by-case basis and China has reservations about the legal standing of PSI. Some observers believe China's resistance to PSI may be due to its reliance on Middle East oil, fear of ceding interdiction rights to the US, and concerns about power balance. North Korea's nuclear test and UN sanctions may make it easier for other states in the region to join PSI. The US could consider regime change in North Korea, leading to abandonment of Six-Party Talks. The United States may consider regime change in North Korea, which could involve coercing China and South Korea to cut off aid and economic cooperation programs. This approach aims to pressure the North Korean elite class and potentially convince leaders to give up nuclear weapons. Some commentators suggest coercing Seoul and Beijing by threatening to withdraw U.S. troops and support for trade agreements. Critics warn of damaging relations with major global players like China and South Korea, potentially disrupting peace in northeast Asia. This approach could align the U.S. more closely with Tokyo but may also destabilize the region. The U.S. military's role in the region may be questioned, with concerns about North Korea proliferating nuclear weapons to terrorist groups. Military options are being considered, but an all-out invasion is unlikely due to potential devastating consequences. In 1993, estimates of casualties from a potential invasion of North Korea's nuclear facilities were significant. The potential consequences of a military strike on North Korea's nuclear facilities are significant, with concerns about civilian casualties and the difficulty of completely destroying the facilities. Suggestions for using direct retaliation as a deterrent against North Korea transferring nuclear material to terrorist groups have been made. The transfer of nuclear weapons or material to a terrorist group poses a significant threat to U.S. security. President Bush warned North Korea about the consequences of such actions. This approach, labeled \"nuclear accountability\" and \"expanded deterrence,\" would require enhanced U.S. nuclear forensic capability. Uncertainties exist in attributing a nuclear event to a single source with 100% assurance, making drastic responses like nuclear retaliation less credible. Some suggest the U.S. should consider ceding leadership in diplomatic efforts due to military overstretchedness. By ceding leadership in diplomatic efforts on North Korea, the U.S. would shift the resolution to regional powers like China, potentially altering the geopolitical landscape in Asia. This move could also impact the U.S.'s dominant stake in shaping a new regional order post-Korean unification.
