    "content": "The \"Nuclear Plant Decommissioning Act of 2016\" requires reports on post-shutdown decommissioning activities. This Act amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to include provisions for these reports. The \"Nuclear Plant Decommissioning Act of 2016\" defines key terms related to decommissioning activities, including 'affected State', 'Commission', 'covered facility', 'host State', 'licensee', and 'PSDAR'. The licensee must develop a proposed PSDAR for a covered facility after consulting with affected States, local governments, and tribal governments within 50 miles. After additional consultation, the licensee submits the proposed PSDAR to the Commission. The licensee must submit the proposed PSDAR to the Commission and make it available to the public. The Commission will then make the proposed PSDAR public while protecting national security. Public participation will be solicited for at least 90 days in the host State. The Commission must conduct at least 2 public hearings in the host State and solicit written comments from the public. The host State has 60 days to provide a statement of support, conditional support with recommendations, or nonsupport for the proposed PSDAR. The Commission will issue a determination on the proposed PSDAR based on the host State's statement of support, nonsupport, or failure to submit a statement by the deadline. This determination will consider written comments from the host State and other sources. The Commission will evaluate the proposed PSDAR based on input from the host State, other States, local communities, and the public. The adequacy of the proposed PSDAR will be determined based on its ability to protect human health and the environment, as well as the likelihood of implementation within the specified timeframe. The Commission evaluates proposed PSDAR based on input from various stakeholders to determine adequacy in protecting human health and the environment. If deemed adequate, a decision document approving the PSDAR is issued; if inadequate, the Commission will not approve it. The Commission will reject inadequate proposed PSDARs under subparagraphs (A) and (B) and require a new submission within 2 years of plant operations ceasing. Conditional support from the host state is considered in determining the permissibility of the PSDAR under applicable law. The Commission will review proposed changes to the PSDAR submitted by the host State, incorporating them unless proven inappropriate by the licensee based on clear evidence of violation of law or disproportionate costs outweighing benefits. The Commission will issue a decision document based on determinations made regarding proposed changes to the PSDAR by the host State, accepting with recommended changes not deemed inappropriate or rejecting the proposed PSDAR. If the Commission rejects the proposed PSDAR, the licensee must submit a new proposed PSDAR within 2 years of plant operations ceasing. If the Commission approves the proposed PSDAR, it becomes final and the licensee can start implementation. The Commission must approve a PSDAR that includes compliance with more restrictive State laws on air, water, soil quality, or radiological standards. Licensees are notified to develop revised PSDARs for facilities with existing decommissioning activities. The Nuclear Plant Decommissioning Act of 2016 requires licensees to consult with nearby states before commencing decontamination and dismantlement activities. Licensees may develop revised PSDARs for approval by the Commission. The Nuclear Plant Decommissioning Act of 2016 mandates licensees to consult with nearby states before starting decontamination and dismantlement. Approval of revised PSDARs must follow specific processes outlined in the Act. If a licensee chooses not to revise the original PSDAR, entities can express support or nonsupport according to the host State's process. The Nuclear Plant Decommissioning Act of 2016 requires licensees to consult with nearby states before decontamination and dismantlement. Approval of revised PSDARs must adhere to specific processes, with a deadline of 1 year after activities begin. If a revised PSDAR is rejected, a new one must be submitted within 2 years. Licensees must submit a new PSDAR within 2 years if the Commission rejects the revised plan."
