    "content": "Congress has long considered Puerto Rico's political status, referring to its relationship with the federal government. Despite being located far from the continental United States, Puerto Rico has played a significant role in American politics and policy since it was acquired from Spain in 1898. It is the largest of the five major U.S. territories, with a large population, heavy traffic and commerce with the mainland, and strong ties to the U.S. military. Congress delegated authority over local matters to a civilian territorial government in 1900, granted Puerto Ricans U.S. citizenship, and recognized a delegate to the U.S. House. The political status of Puerto Rico has been a long-standing issue, with debates on whether it should remain a territory, become a state, or gain independence. In 2012, a plebiscite was held for the people to vote on their status, which could have implications for Congress. Any change in Puerto Rico's status would require congressional action, as Congress has jurisdiction over territories and monitors status developments. This report provides a foundation for understanding Puerto Rico's status and the 2012 plebiscite, with key issues and questions discussed for Congress to consider. The report highlights issues relevant to Congress considering the plebiscite on Puerto Rico's political status. It provides a brief overview for congressional readers interested in policy and political matters, emphasizing that Puerto Rican politics differ from mainland party labels. The report does not substitute for a comprehensive analysis of the complex issues surrounding Puerto Rico's relationship with the United States. In Puerto Rican politics, three major parties dominate, with positions on status not following clear partisan patterns at the federal level. Members of Congress argue that clear consensus among the Puerto Rican people is necessary for any change in status. The three established political parties represent different status perspectives: the Popular Democratic Party (PDP/PPD) supports the status quo or \"pro-commonwealth\" position, while the pro-statehood position is generally associated with another party. The Popular Democratic Party (PDP/PPD) supports the status quo or \"pro-commonwealth\" position, while the pro-statehood position is generally associated with the New Progressive Party (NPP/PNP). The independence position is generally associated with the Independence Party (PIP or Independistas). Other options may appeal to members of different parties, such as \"enhanced commonwealth\" and \"free association.\" Views within the parties and interest groups are not uniform. The PDP, NPP, and PIP are the main political forces in Puerto Rican politics. Puerto Rico's status as a U.S. territory is governed by federal laws, including the Federal Relations Act and the island's Constitution. Changing Puerto Rico's status would require congressional and presidential approval. Puerto Rico's political relationship with the United States is shaped by constitutional and statutory authority, with Congress having the power to make rules regarding the territory. The island's current status, determined by federal statute, dates back to its acquisition from Spain in 1898. Congress established a civilian government in 1900 under the Foraker Act, appointing a civilian governor and department heads. The Foraker Act of 1900 established a civilian government in Puerto Rico, including a governor, department heads, a House of Delegates, and a judiciary system. The act also created the position of Resident Commissioner to represent the island in Washington, with nonvoting representation in the U.S. House of Representatives. The Jones Act of 1917 extended U.S. citizenship to Puerto Ricans, established a bill of rights, and recognized island authority over internal governance. After the approval of the Constitution in 1952, Puerto Rico became formally known as the \"Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\" The term \"commonwealth\" and its legal or political significance have been subject to debate, with some viewing it as a unique status between territory and state, known as \"enhanced commonwealth\" or \"new commonwealth.\" This perspective argues for more than just local self-government. Those who argue for the unique status of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico believe it is not just local self-government but a new legal entity with internationally recognized non-colonial status. They see it as sui generis, not a territory or state, with judicial bounds determined by a compact requiring consent from both Puerto Rico and the United States. Others, however, view \"commonwealth\" as a stylistic or historical term without specific legal or political significance. Some argue that the term \"commonwealth\" in relation to Puerto Rico does not designate a unique non-territorial status, and question the concept of the Commonwealth. They believe that Congress may still exercise broad powers granted under the Territorial Clause of the Constitution. Despite debates over the term's significance, changing Puerto Rico's political status would require action by Congress and approval by the President. Some argue that Puerto Rico's current status may not be permanent, with options for statehood or independence. The 2012 plebiscite allowed voters to choose their relationship with the US, but Congress did not pass legislation for a status plebiscite. In 2012, a plebiscite was held in Puerto Rico alongside the general election, allowing voters to choose their relationship with the US. Efforts to authorize a status plebiscite through legislation like H.R. 2499 had stalled in Congress, leading to local legislation in Puerto Rico for the plebiscite. Governor Fortu\u00f1o played a key role in urging the Legislative Assembly to authorize the plebiscite. The 2012 plebiscite in Puerto Rico included ballots for various races and two questions on the ballot regarding the territorial status. Voters were asked to choose between statehood, independence, or a \"sovereign free associated state\" option, which is not historically linked to the status issue. The 2012 plebiscite in Puerto Rico included ballots for various races and two questions on the ballot regarding the territorial status. Results of the plebiscite have been controversial, with approximately 54.0% voting \"no\" to the first question and 61.2% choosing statehood in the second question. The new governor has endorsed a concurrent resolution contending that the results were inconclusive. The Puerto Rico State Elections Commission issued certified election results on December 31, 2012. 53.97% voted \"no\" to retaining the current status, while 46.03% voted \"yes.\" In the second question, 61.16% chose statehood, 33.34% chose \"sovereign free associated state,\" and 5.49% chose independence. Debate arose over the inclusion of almost 500,000 blank answers in the total tally. Previous status plebiscites in Puerto Rico have shown no clear change in status. The 1998 vote had a slim majority choosing \"none of the above\" from five options. The status quo, including a \"commonwealth\" option, has received the most votes in past referenda. \"Statehood\" has been the second-place finisher in previous ballots. Previous status plebiscites in Puerto Rico have shown no clear change in status, with voters divided on statehood. Interpretation of results has sparked debate on viability of options and voter turnout impact. Congress has not amended Puerto Rico's status since the 1950-1952 period. The most recent activity was during the 111th Congress when H.R. 2499 was passed by the House but declined by the Senate. In the 113th Congress, Commissioner Pierluisi introduced H.R. 2000 for a \"ratification vote\" on Puerto Rico's statehood. Previous status plebiscites in Puerto Rico have shown no clear change in status, with voters divided on statehood. Congress has not amended Puerto Rico's status since the 1950-1952 period. In the 113th Congress, Mr. Pierluisi proposed H.R. 2000 for a vote on Puerto Rico's statehood. The House previously passed H.R. 2499 in the 111th Congress, which would have authorized a two-step plebiscite on Puerto Rico's status. In the 111th Congress, H.R. 2499 proposed a two-step plebiscite on Puerto Rico's status, offering choices of independence, association with the US, statehood, or maintaining commonwealth status. Senator Salazar introduced an alternative plebiscite mechanism in S. 1936 during the same Congress. Some legislation suggested conventions for Puerto Ricans to develop status proposals instead of predetermined options. During the 110th and 111th Congress, various bills and proposals were introduced regarding Puerto Rico's political status, including plebiscite options for independence, association with the US, statehood, or maintaining commonwealth status. The results of the plebiscite are non-binding, leaving it uncertain if further action will be taken by the House and Senate. Selected issues relevant to Congress considering the plebiscite are discussed, focusing on potential actions and considerations. The 2012 plebiscite options generated controversy, with some arguing they favored statehood. Statehood and independence options were clear, while the \"sovereign free associated state\" option was less so. Additional developments may impact the relevance of other factors not discussed. The 2012 plebiscite options sparked debate, with concerns over favoring statehood. The \"sovereign free associated state\" option's implications remain uncertain. Some suggest revisiting status through a convention for more flexible choices. The 2012 plebiscite sparked debate over statehood favoritism. Some suggest a convention for more flexible status options, including the \"enhanced commonwealth\" status. The White House Task Force and some in Congress argue that this option is unconstitutional. President Obama's FY2014 budget proposal includes funding for voter education and a plebiscite on Puerto Rico's political status, with a condition that materials must comply with US laws. This is significant due to concerns about the \"enhanced commonwealth\" option's constitutionality. Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman and Ranking Member Lisa Murkowski wrote to President Obama expressing concerns that the \"new\" commonwealth option in Puerto Rico's plebiscite is incompatible with US laws. The plebiscite results may indicate a desire for a change in political status, but the significance is uncertain as voters also ousted pro-statehood officials. Any change in Puerto Rico's status would require congressional action. Debate has continued since the 2012 plebiscite on the certified results. Debate has ensued since the 2012 plebiscite about the certified results in Puerto Rico, particularly regarding the inclusion of \"blank votes\" in the calculations. The certified results show approximately 61.2% in favor of statehood, calculated from votes cast using the three options listed on the ballot. However, the Puerto Rico Legislative Assembly's resolution includes the ballots that did not answer the second question in their calculations. The debate in Puerto Rico revolves around the inclusion of \"blank votes\" in calculating election results. The certified results show 61.2% favoring statehood, while the Legislative Assembly's resolution includes blank answers, resulting in no majority option. The key issue is which denominator to use when calculating results, with the CEE results based on answered ballots favoring statehood. The 2012 plebiscite in Puerto Rico resulted in no majority option due to blank votes, raising questions about voter intent and the clarity of choices surrounding the island's political status. The debate includes proposals for revisiting status, with Congress considering different approaches to determine a mandate for reconsidering Puerto Rico's political status. Only registered voters in Puerto Rico were allowed to participate in the plebiscite, while previous proposals have suggested including those born on the island but living elsewhere. The 2012 plebiscite in Puerto Rico raised questions about voter intent and the clarity of choices surrounding the island's political status. Some suggest a majority opted for statehood, while others argue the results were inconclusive. Congress may assess the results to determine the next steps."
