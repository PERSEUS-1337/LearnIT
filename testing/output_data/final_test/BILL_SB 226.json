    "title": "SB 226",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The state of California enacts laws regarding groundwater management, including intervention in adjudications and setting minimum standards for sustainable management. The state of California enacts laws to establish minimum standards for sustainable groundwater management, provide local agencies with necessary authority and assistance, avoid subsidence, improve data collection, increase storage, manage basins locally, and streamline adjudication processes. Section 10720.5 of the Water Code is amended to ensure groundwater management aligns with the California Constitution. In designated basins, no extraction of groundwater between January 1, 2015, and the adoption of a sustainability plan can be used as evidence in legal claims. Section 10722.2 of the Water Code is amended to allow a local agency to request the department to revise basin boundaries for sustainable groundwater management, supported by necessary information. The entity proposing a basin boundary adjustment must consult with local agencies and public water systems before filing with the department. The department may request additional information to justify the revision of the basin's boundary. The department must adopt regulations by January 1, 2016, for compliance with proposed basin boundary revisions, including evaluation criteria. These regulations will be considered emergency measures for public safety and welfare, exempt from normal review processes. The department must establish methodology and criteria to assess sustainable management of proposed basins, including impacts on adjacent basins and history of groundwater level management. Before adopting regulations, three public meetings will be held in different locations in California to consider public comments. The California Water Commission must review and comment on draft revisions of basin boundaries provided by the department within 60 days. A new chapter is added to the Water Code for adjudication actions to determine groundwater rights in basins, following the procedures outlined in the Code of Civil Procedure. In adjudication actions for basins requiring groundwater sustainability plans, the court must manage proceedings to avoid delays, redundancy, and unnecessary costs. Chapter 11 does not apply to approved judgments if certain conditions are met. The department evaluates proposed stipulated judgments for basins to ensure they meet objectives. Submissions can be made after January 1, 2017, and the department's determination is subject to judicial review. Venue for review is in the court with jurisdiction over the adjudication action. The department evaluates proposed stipulated judgments for basins to ensure they meet objectives. If the department deems a judgment satisfactory, they submit assessments and recommended corrective actions to the court for consideration and possible amendment. The court must not approve entry of judgment in an adjudication action for a basin requiring a groundwater sustainability plan unless it will not impair the ability to achieve sustainable groundwater management. This act will only take effect if Assembly Bill 1390 is enacted."
