    "content": "Episodic Backward Update is a new algorithm for deep reinforcement learning that improves performance by propagating rewards quickly. It samples whole episodes and propagates state values backwards, allowing sparse rewards to be effective. The algorithm is evaluated on 2D MNIST Maze Environment and 49 Atari 2600 games, showing improved sample efficiency with competitive computational cost. Experience replay with random sampling in deep reinforcement learning allows for more stable and sample-efficient learning, leading to super-human performance on various tasks. Despite the impressive results of Deep Q-Networks (DQN), they are still data-inefficient, requiring 200 million frames of experience for training, which is equivalent to 39 days of real-time gameplay. This highlights a significant gap between the learning process of humans and deep reinforcement learning agents. The DQN agent's low sample efficiency may be due to the sampling method over the replay memory, especially in environments like autonomous driving. Sampling one-step transitions uniformly at random can lead to issues with sparse and delayed reward signals, as updating transitions without future rewards can result in training to return zero value. Episodic Backward Update (EBU) is proposed to address issues with sparse and delayed reward signals in RL. By sampling transitions in an episodic manner and updating them in a backward way, the method ensures efficient reward propagation without meaningless updates, following the principle of dynamic programming. Our update algorithm, based on dynamic programming principles, outperforms baselines in various environments. Reinforcement learning involves agents taking actions in states to maximize rewards. Q-learning is a widely used method for solving RL tasks by estimating state-action values. The key idea of Q-learning is to estimate the state-action value function Q(s, a), known as the Q-function, to maximize expected return. Traditional Q-learning has inefficiencies in using experiences only once and learning in a forward order. Experience replay is proposed to address these issues by storing transitions in a replay buffer and sampling them in a backward order for learning Q-values efficiently. Deep Q-Network (DQN) uses deep neural networks to approximate the Q-function by processing state information through convolutional and fully connected networks. It avoids errors accumulation by sampling transitions uniformly at random for training, breaking down correlations between consecutive transitions. Some methods proposed to improve DQN performance include new network architectures like the dueling network architecture and neural episodic control. Prioritized experience replay assigns non-uniform probabilities to sample transitions based on temporal difference error. Some methods aggregate TD values with Monte-Carlo returns, inspired by Lin's backward use of replay memory. Our method modifies target values for safe and efficient reward propagation, incorporating count-based exploration and intrinsic motivation. Optimality Tightening BID5 constrains target values using neighboring transitions, achieving faster convergence without changing the network structure. Sampling whole episodes from replay memory helps propagate reliable values. Our method samples whole episodes from replay memory to propagate values efficiently, reducing errors from consecutive updates. It incorporates a temporary backward Q-table with a diffusion coefficient to improve performance. Our method samples whole episodes from replay memory to propagate values efficiently, reducing errors from consecutive updates. It incorporates a temporary backward Q-table with a diffusion coefficient to improve performance. By updating all transitions within the episode in a backward manner, we can speed up reward propagation and learn the optimal policy in just 4 updates of Q-values, compared to the more than 30 transitions required by the uniform sampling method. Our method utilizes a backward update algorithm with a temporary Q-table to efficiently propagate values and learn the optimal policy in just 4 updates. The algorithm considers T future values and uses a function approximator to estimate Q-values. The algorithm introduced in Algorithm 2 builds on Nature DQN BID11 with episodic sampling and recursive backward update. It includes target generation with a diffusion coefficient to prevent errors from correlated states accumulating. The novelty lies in the sampling stage, where transitions are not sampled uniformly random. The algorithm builds on Nature DQN with episodic sampling and recursive backward update. It introduces a novel approach in the sampling stage by utilizing all transitions within the sampled episode. The temporary target Q-table is initialized to store target Q-values for all valid actions, and a recursive backward update is performed to estimate the target vector y and minimize loss between Q-values and y. The algorithm introduces a backward update idea in a deep Q-network, where transitions within an episode are utilized. By recursively updating the Q-table, the target vector y is estimated to minimize loss between Q-values and y. The diffusion coefficient \u03b2 is introduced to stabilize learning by weighting newly learnt values with pre-existing values. The episodic backward update algorithm in deep Q-networks uses a diffusion coefficient \u03b2 to stabilize learning by combining newly learnt values with pre-existing ones. It converges to the optimal Q-function in finite and deterministic MDPs, given certain conditions are met. The network is trained to minimize the squared-loss between Q-values and the backward target y.

It converges to the optimal Q-function in finite and deterministic MDPs. The network is trained to minimize the squared-loss between Q-values and the backward target y. Experiments were conducted to test the efficiency of the EBU agent in propagating reward signals in environments with sparse and delayed rewards, as well as its sample efficiency in complex domains without stability issues. The algorithm is tested in a 2D maze with sparse rewards. The agent navigates using 4 actions and returns to the previous state when hitting a wall. MNIST dataset is used for state representation. Performance is compared to other Q-learning methods in 10x10 mazes with random walls. The goal is to reach (9,9) with varying wall density. In a 2D maze with sparse rewards, the algorithm assigns rewards for reaching the goal and bumping into walls. 50 agents are trained on random mazes with different wall densities. The median relative lengths of the agents are compared at 100,000 steps. The diffusion coefficient is set to 1 for this example. The EBU agent outperforms other baselines in most situations, especially in environments with sparse and delayed rewards. As wall density increases, valid paths become more complex, requiring correct decisions at bottleneck positions. N-step Q-learning performs best with low wall density, but EBU surpasses it as density increases, finding paths twice as short at 50% density due to different target generation methods. The EBU agent outperforms other baselines, especially in environments with sparse and delayed rewards. It uses recursive max operators for faster learning of optimal Q-values at bottlenecks. The Arcade Learning Environment is a popular RL benchmark with diverse tasks. Creating a robust agent for all games is challenging due to different observations and objectives. The EBU algorithm is compared to four baselines on 49 Atari games, showing promising results after training for 10 million frames. The EBU agent outperforms baselines in Atari games with sparse rewards. Training includes 40 epochs of 250,000 frames, evaluated with -greedy policy. Using \u03b2 = 1 2 improves performance over \u03b2 = 1 in most games. The EBU agent shows improvements over Nature DQN in 32 out of 49 games, with significant enhancements in 'Atlantis', 'Breakout', and 'Video Pinball'. The algorithm outperforms baselines in both mean and median human normalized scores. Our algorithm, EBU, outperforms baselines in mean and median human normalized scores, requiring only 37% of the computation time of Optimality Tightening 1. EBU shows competitive performance in games like 'Assault', 'Breakout', 'Gopher', and 'Video Pinball', with a diffusion coefficient \u03b2 = 0.5, indicating stability in sequential updates. Our algorithm, EBU, demonstrates stability in sequential updates, outperforming other baselines in 43 out of 49 games. Using 2 CNNs and a fully connected layer, we achieve the best median and mean scores with a total of 200,000 training steps. The agent is trained for 200,000 steps using rectified linear unit and -greedy exploration. The learning rate is 0.001 with RMSProp optimizer. The online-network is updated every 50 steps, the target network every 2000 steps. The replay memory size is 30000 with a minibatch size of 350. The discount factor is 0.9 and the agent plays until reaching the goal or after 1000 time steps in the maze. The network structure and hyperparameters are identical to Nature DQN BID11, with raw observations preprocessed into 84x84 grayscale images passing through three convolutional layers. The curr_chunk describes the training process of the agent, including the network structure with convolutional layers and fully connected layers, training duration, exploration strategy, optimizer, minibatch size, replay buffer size, target network update frequency, and discount factor. The agent is trained for 10 million frames with -greedy exploration, starting from 1 and annealed to 0.1. Randomness is introduced with k no-op actions at the beginning of each episode. The network is trained with RMSProp optimizer, minibatch size of 32, and a replay buffer size of 1 million steps. The target network is updated every 10,000 steps. The training process involves updating the target network every 10,000 steps with a discount factor of \u03b3 = 0.99. Training is divided into 40 epochs of 250,000 frames each, followed by testing the agent for 30 episodes. The diffusion coefficient \u03b2 = 0.5 is set, and rank-based DQN version with hyperparameters \u03b1 = 0.5, \u03b2 = 0 is used. Loss vectors are generated based on behavior and evaluation policies. The episodic backward update algorithm converges to the true action-value function Q* in a finite and deterministic environment. It updates a single (state, action) pair through multiple episodes, with evaluated targets for each transition in the sample episode. The episodic backward operator updates (state, action) pairs through multiple episodes, with different evaluated targets. It depends on the exploration policy for the MDP and defines a schedule for each distinct episode. The algorithm converges to the true action-value function Q* in a finite and deterministic environment. The episodic backward operator in MDPs involves enumerating all possible episodes starting from each (state, action) pair. The empirical frequency for each path in the path set belongs to the schedule set, which can vary across time. Independent schedules are grouped into the time schedule set, and the operator computes the maximum return of the path via backward update. The episodic backward operator in MDPs computes the maximum return of the path via backward update. For deterministic MDPs, the operator is a contraction in the sup-norm, with the fixed point being the optimal action-value function regardless of the time schedule.
