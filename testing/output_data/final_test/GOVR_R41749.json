Despite efforts for transparent aid delivery, North Korean officials have diverted humanitarian assistance. Several NGOs in North Korea have had successes in providing food aid and sponsoring informal diplomacy, as well as enhancing capacity and boosting agricultural production. Relief agencies offered projects including alternative farming methods, hospital renovations, water and sanitation projects, and disaster management training. Despite initial obstacles, some NGOs have obtained good access and monitoring, giving them assurance in their aid delivery efforts. Many NGOs in North Korea have been successful in providing food aid and engaging in informal diplomacy. The Obama Administration is considering restarting an aid program from 2008, with requests for food aid coming from North Korea since 2010. The U.S. government is assessing the needs and ensuring aid is effectively managed to reach the intended recipients. Ambassador Stephen Bosworth highlighted the importance of NGOs in delivering humanitarian assistance. The U.S. Special Envoy for North Korea Policy, Ambassador Stephen Bosworth, mentioned providing food aid based on perceived need and monitoring capabilities. NGOs have been involved in aid delivery in North Korea, promoting transparency and accountability. Some active NGOs in North Korea include the Mennonite Central Committee, First Steps, the Eugene Bell Foundation, Christian Friends of Korea, Canadian Food Grains Bank, and German foundations. Several European NGOs can expect consular protection from embassies in Pyongyang, except for Canada, France, and Ireland which have embassies in Seoul. U.S. NGOs rely on the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang. South Korea has cut off bilateral food and fertilizer aid and curbed NGO contacts with North Korea since 2007. The South Korean government imposed tight restrictions after incidents in 2010 resulting in the loss of South Korean lives. Many South Korean NGOs criticized the restrictions, asking the government to allow them to send food to North Korea, but their offers were rejected. In 2010, South Korea and the U.S. made small donations of aid to North Korea. South Korea donated 10,000 tons of food and 20 tons of milk powder, while the U.S. provided $600,000 for flood assistance. North Korean government tightly controlled and monitored NGO activities, resisting efforts to monitor aid distribution. They initially blocked NGO visits to certain provinces and tried to limit monitoring by NGOs. North Korean officials tightly controlled NGO activities, restricting monitoring efforts and aid distribution. NGOs faced restrictions on monitoring, including exclusion of Korean speakers and limitations on site visits. Some NGOs, like Doctors without Borders and Oxfam, withdrew from North Korea due to these restrictions. By 2005, travel restrictions had eased but still included parts of North and South Pyongan provinces. The government insisted on using the Public Distribution System for aid transmission. NGOs in North Korea have government contacts assigned for aid distribution, citing security reasons. These contacts act as buffers between organizations and the public, with assignments based on national origin or residency. Some NGOs coordinate their work through these government entities, with varying success. U.S. NGOs, European NGOs, and international groups like the World Food Programme fell under the Flood Damage Rehabilitation Committee's purview. In 2005, U.S. NGOs were reassigned to the Korean American Private Exchange. In 2005, North Korean officials reassigned U.S. NGOs to the Korean American Private Exchange Society (KAPES), reducing the number of NGOs on the ground. The FDRC/KAPES staff are from the North Korean Foreign Ministry or local authorities. The APPC reports to the central committee of the Korean Worker's Party and is responsible for Asian-Pacific states without diplomatic relations with North Korea. North Korean officials limited the movement of U.S. and South Korean NGOs by refusing residency. InterAction, a U.S. NGO consortium, coordinated humanitarian relief in North Korea through its North Korea Working Group. NGOs in InterAction formed the North Korea Working Group to advocate for assistance to North Korea. They recommended the establishment of the Food Aid Liaison Unit (FALU) in WFP's office in Pyongyang. WFP and NGOs worked within the Public Distribution System for food rationing. The Private Voluntary Organization Consortium (PVOC) was created by non-resident NGOs to monitor distribution of U.S. government food aid. USAID and the United States Department of Agriculture funded PVOC's food assistance programs. In 2000, the PVOC group's food assistance programs funded by the United States Department of Agriculture yielded \"mixed results\" according to the General Accounting Office. The North Korean government's restrictions made monitoring food distribution difficult, leading to the PVOC withdrawing from North Korea. European NGOs negotiated residency in North Korea for assistance, promoting a new dynamic in North Korean society. In response to calls for aid from the U.N. agencies in 2008, the U.S. pledged to donate 500,000 MT of food aid to North Korea for one year. The Bush Administration stated that North Korea had agreed to monitoring and access concessions. 100,000 MT of aid was sent through five U.S. NGOs selected by the U.S. Department of State. The NGO aid consortium operated in two northwest provinces of North Korea. Many South Korean NGOs, such as Good Friends South Korea/Peace Foundation and Korean Sharing Movement, provide aid to North Korea. South Korean NGOs used to contribute through the Red Cross and needed approval from the Ministry of Unification to travel to North Korea. Some NGOs expedited aid delivery by using their affiliates, like World Vision Korea shipping rice via World Vision International. The U.S. NGO Eugene Bell Foundation also provided aid to North Korea. After the \"sunshine\" policy of engaging North Korea, South Korean NGOs increased aid delivery to North Korea. The South Korean government provided large quantities of aid with less monitoring under Presidents Kim Dae Jung and Roh Moo-hyun. President Lee Myung-bak later restricted aid and private visits to North Korea. During the \"sunshine policy era,\" South Korean NGOs implemented various food security programs in North Korea, including planting high-yield crops, providing fertilizer, promoting greenhouse use, and offering nutrition and disease control initiatives. By 2000, the South Korean Ministry of Unification supported NGOs aiding flood survivors, children, and the elderly, as well as promoting agriculture and health capacity building projects. NGOs have sponsored projects in agriculture and health, including water and sanitation, seed improvement, animal husbandry, and land management. They have also promoted programs for study abroad, English language courses, and trade. Specific initiatives include establishing a digital library at a North Korean university, creating a U.S.-DPRK Scientific Engagement Consortium, and founding a foreign university in Pyongyang. Members of Syracuse University, the Korea Society, and North Korea's Permanent Mission to the United Nations discussed the potential for a digital library in 2001 to improve opportunities for North Korean students and promote science education. The Permanent Mission selected Kim Chaek University as the project partner to establish a digital library in North Korea. Private grants from various organizations funded the project, with Kim Chaek University covering the construction costs. The digital library opened in 2006 and journalists visiting Pyongyang in 2008 accessed their Facebook accounts there. Additionally, a Twin Labs project was developed as part of the initiative to support exchanges between Syracuse and Kim Chaek Universities. The U.S.-North Korea Science Engagement Consortium aims to promote science cooperation between the two countries' academic institutions. The consortium's core members include AAAS, CRDF Global, Pacific Century Institute, and Syracuse University. The collaboration was inspired by the digital library project between Syracuse University and Kim Chaek University of Technology. The project has been ongoing for almost ten years, with no North Korean faculty members enrolled at Syracuse yet. The U.S.-North Korea Science Engagement Consortium was formed in 2007 to promote scientific collaboration with North Korea. It has sent delegations to Pyongyang and hosted North Korean scientists in Atlanta. The Consortium plans initiatives like English language training for scientists, pending funding and legal approvals. In 2010, American educator James Kim and a South Korean NGO were involved in the Consortium's activities. James Kim and a South Korean NGO, NAFEC, established North Korea's first private university, Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST), offering masters and doctorate programs in various fields. Construction began in 2001, with plans for an industrial park on campus. Funds were raised from public and private sources, including a $1 million contribution from the South Korean Ministry of Unification. North Korea's first private university, Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST), was established by James Kim and NAFEC. NAFEC raised $32 million from South Korean churches and foreign donors. PUST expects to spend $4 million in its first year and has enrolled 160 graduate students. The university plans to expand to 250 faculty members, 600 graduate students, and 2,000 undergraduates. NGOs have provided technical assistance in economics, agriculture, and capacity building to North Korean students selected by the government. NGOs like the Hanns-Seidel-Foundation Korea (HSS) have provided technical assistance in various projects in North Korea, including sanitation, seed improvement, and soil erosion prevention. They also offer study-abroad opportunities, English language classes, and business/economic training to North Korean officials. HSS partnered with other organizations to sponsor the EU-NK Trade Capacity Project in 2006, introducing mid-level North Korean officials to business and trade practices. The Hanns-Seidel-Foundation Korea (HSS) provided technical assistance in various projects in North Korea, including business and trade seminars. North Korea withdrew from the EU-North Korea Trade Capacity Project in 2009 due to unwillingness to accept trade practices. The Friedrich Naumann Foundation (FNF) is a non-profit organization linked to the German Free Democratic Party. The Friedrich Naumann Foundation (FNF) is linked to the German Free Democratic Party and aims to promote democratic institutions, human rights, the rule of law, and economic freedom. FNF provides policy consultation and educational programs in collaboration with local NGOs, civic organizations, and educational institutions. In July 2010, FNF hosted a delegation of North Korean officials to introduce them to German engineering practices. The U.S.-North Korean Tuberculosis (TB) Project established a national reference laboratory in North Korea to improve diagnostic capacity and enhance health security in the region. The U.S.-North Korean TB project aimed to lower TB risks in North Korea and neighboring states. North Korea's infection rate was 345 per 100,000, much higher than the U.S. rate of 3.8 per 100,000 in 2009. The project began in 2008 with funding from organizations like Stanford University, Bay Area TB Consortium, and Nuclear Threat Initiative. Christian Friends of Korea also joined later. They renovated a public health facility in Pyongyang to serve as the TB reference laboratory. The TB reference laboratory in Pyongyang was renovated with equipment costing $1.7 million. By fall 2010, staff were trained in TB culturing methods. The Global Fund provided aid for medication supply and testing for multi-drug resistant TB in North Korea from 2010-2012. The North Korean regime's deep isolation poses challenges in dealing with health issues. Some NGOs facilitate Track II exchanges to overcome challenges in diplomatic relations with North Korea. These informal communications involve various sectors like scientists, academics, and military officers. Organizations like the Korea Society, Stanford University, and Syracuse University have sponsored such dialogues. Retired diplomats often play a crucial role in Track II diplomacy efforts. Some NGOs facilitate Track II exchanges involving retired diplomats and government officials to engage North Korean diplomats. Organizations like the Korea Society, Stanford University, and the University of California's Northeast Asia Conflict Dialogue have played roles in these efforts. North Korean diplomats have attended sessions with officials from the North Korean Permanent Mission to the United Nations and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Pyongyang. U.S. representatives, including former President Jimmy Carter, have also contributed to diplomatic efforts. Former President Jimmy Carter, former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, and retired Director of Los Alamos National Laboratory Dr. Siegfried Hecker have participated in public exchanges for diplomacy with North Korea. Some view these exchanges as tools for diplomacy, while others see them as opportunities for the North Korean regime to use for propaganda. South Korean activists and defectors have established radio broadcast organizations to gain information from North Korea, with some receiving funding from the National Endowment for Democracy and the U.S. Department of State. South Korean and North Korean defectors have been broadcasting news and interviews via short- and medium-wave radio since 2004. Defectors confirmed they listened to these broadcasts after modifying radios locked onto official frequencies by North Korean authorities. A survey showed defectors in China and South Korea listened to foreign media. Radio transmissions offer hope for North Korean people by discussing potential economic and cooperative opportunities with other countries. The economy can revive in North Korea through cooperation with South Korea, China, and the United States, potentially ending hunger."
