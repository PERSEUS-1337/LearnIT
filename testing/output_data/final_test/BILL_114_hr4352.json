    "content": "The \"Faster Care for Veterans Act of 2016\" establishes a pilot program for veterans to schedule medical appointments online or through a mobile app. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will select at least three locations for the program and seek contracts with contractors to provide the scheduling capability. The Secretary will issue a request for proposals for a contract within 60 days of the Act's enactment. The contract will be awarded within 120 days, and the pilot program will run for 18 months, with a possible extension. The Secretary may extend the pilot program for reducing wait times of veterans seeking medical care and ensuring more appointment times are filled. The term \"mobile application\" is defined as a software program that runs on portable devices. The patient self-scheduling appointment system must meet minimum capabilities. The pilot program and patient self-scheduling appointment system by the Department of Veterans Affairs must have capabilities like scheduling, modifying, and canceling appointments for various types of care, supporting telehealth services, real-time appointment availability, filling cancelled appointments, prompting veterans for follow-up appointments, 24/7 availability, and integration with Veterans Health. The Secretary seeks agreement with a non-governmental entity to validate and verify the patient self-scheduling appointment system's capabilities in the pilot program and other systems used by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Comptroller General of the United States will evaluate the validation and verification of patient self-scheduling appointment systems used in the pilot program and by the Department of Veterans Affairs within 60 days of deployment. The Comptroller General will evaluate validation and verification of patient self-scheduling appointment systems. A report will be submitted to congressional committees within 30 days. The Secretary must certify capabilities to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs by December 31, 2017. The Secretary must certify to congressional committees that any patient self-scheduling appointment system used by the Department of Veterans Affairs includes specified capabilities. If a new system is developed, certification must be provided within 30 days of implementation. Failure to certify may result in consequences. The Secretary must certify that the VA's patient self-scheduling system meets specific requirements. Failure to do so will result in the system being replaced with a commercial online scheduling system. No new funds are authorized for this Act. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
