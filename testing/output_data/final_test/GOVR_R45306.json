    "content": "The U.S. nuclear weapons complex, known as the Nuclear Security Enterprise, is an infrastructure designed to ensure the safety, security, and reliability of the nation's nuclear stockpile. This complex includes various functions such as production of nuclear materials, assembly of warheads, and integration with delivery vehicles. While the U.S. no longer produces highly enriched uranium or plutonium for weapons, materials from retired weapons are reused. Additionally, explosive nuclear testing has been halted since 1992. The United States nuclear weapons complex conducts science-based research and testing to support the stockpile stewardship program. The Department of Defense handles the deployment and operation of nuclear warheads, while the Department of Energy and its National Nuclear Security Administration oversee the research, development, and maintenance of the warheads. DOE is responsible for storing and securing the warheads. The Department of Energy (DOE) is responsible for storing, securing, and dismantling nuclear warheads not deployed by the Department of Defense (DOD). The current nuclear weapons complex consists of nine government-owned sites in seven states, including laboratories, fabrication plants, assembly sites, and a testing facility. The complex also includes a Tennessee Valley Authority nuclear reactor for producing tritium. The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review highlights the aging and underfunded U.S. nuclear weapons infrastructure, with over half of NNSA's infrastructure over 40 years old. Previous reviews emphasized the need for a modern nuclear weapons infrastructure, but the U.S. has not invested enough to sustain and replace its nuclear forces. Funding for nuclear weapons declined after the Cold War. Funding for nuclear weapons activities at NNSA has increased steadily in recent years, with a budget request of $7 billion for maintaining the nuclear-weapons stockpile and complex in FY2011. Despite the Budget Control Act in 2011, appropriations for NNSA's weapons activities have continued to grow, reaching $9.25 billion in FY2017. The Trump Administration's budget for FY2018 and FY2019 requested significant increases in funding for NNSA's weapons activities, totaling $11.02 billion in FY2019. Concerns remain about the aging facilities in the nuclear weapons infrastructure despite these funding increases. The Administrator of NNSA expressed concerns about the aging infrastructure, stating that it poses risks to the mission, safety of workers, public, and environment. General Klotz highlighted the insufficient resources for infrastructure maintenance, while Secretary of Energy Moniz requested a $5.2 billion budget increase to address programmatic gaps. Lisa E. Gordon-Hagerty echoed these concerns. The NNSA Administrator supported General Klotz's concerns about aging infrastructure and requested a $3 billion budget for Infrastructure and Operations in FY2019. This funding would address deferred maintenance and new facility construction, including the Uranium Processing Facility and CMRR project. NNSA aimed to produce 80 nuclear pits per year by repurposing the MOX Facility at the Savannah River Site. The NNSA proposed a two-prong approach for pit production, with 50 pits per year at Savannah River and 30 pits per year at Los Alamos. Interest in U.S. nuclear policy and NNSA-managed facilities is increasing, with a focus on funding and current issues. The history of the nuclear weapons complex, including the Manhattan Project, is discussed. The Manhattan Project initiated the nuclear weapons program in 1942, with sites and facilities still operational under the DOE nuclear security enterprise. Post-Cold War, the focus shifted to stockpile stewardship and research, reducing warhead production sites while maintaining capability. The enterprise now emphasizes sustaining warheads without explosive nuclear testing and research into new technologies and processes. In 1939, Albert Einstein informed President Roosevelt about the potential for powerful bombs using uranium chain reactions, prompting research by the U.S. government. The President's Advisory Committee on Uranium was set up in 1939 and recommended government funding for research into uranium. After the German invasion of Poland in 1940, the committee evolved into the National Defense Research Committee, supporting scientists in developing fissionable materials for a nuclear bomb. By mid-1942, the Manhattan Engineer District was established to produce an atomic weapon before the end of the war. The Manhattan Engineer District, led by Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, collaborated with industrial partners, scientists, and academia to develop the atomic bomb during World War II. After the war, the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 transferred the weapons program from the Army to the Atomic Energy Commission, placing nuclear energy and the U.S. nuclear weapons program under civilian control. The decision on whether to place nuclear energy under civilian or military control was contentious in 1946. Some feared military control would impede development for peaceful purposes and international exchange of information on atomic energy. The Atomic Energy Act institutionalized civilian control, authorizing research on military applications of nuclear energy. The Atomic Energy Act authorized the AEC to conduct research on military applications of nuclear energy and produce nuclear weapons with the President's consent. It also gave the President control to direct the Commission on delivering fissionable materials to the armed forces for national defense. Additionally, the act established a Military Liaison Committee to coordinate nuclear defense activities between the War and Navy Departments. The Atomic Energy Act authorized the AEC to conduct research on military applications of nuclear energy and produce nuclear weapons with the President's consent. It also established civilian control over operational nuclear weapons. The Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 dissolved the AEC and created the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and ERDA, which later became the Department of Energy. The Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 dissolved the AEC and created the Department of Energy. Congress established the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) to maintain and enhance the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile. NNSA's mission includes reducing global weapons of mass destruction, providing safe nuclear propulsion for the U.S. Navy, and responding to nuclear emergencies. The nuclear weapons stockpile maintenance has been structured in three phases since the Manhattan Project in the 1940s, with key facilities like Los Alamos National Laboratory, Hanford Site, and Oak Ridge. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) was established to oversee these functions. During the early years of the nuclear weapons program, smaller COCO facilities allowed for rapid production increases. In the 1950s, the Atomic Energy Commission consolidated functions into larger GOCO facilities to meet Cold War stockpile needs efficiently. The Atomic Energy Commission consolidated functions into larger GOCO facilities in the 1950s to meet Cold War stockpile needs efficiently. By late 1952, new production plants were planned or under construction at various locations across the U.S. The third phase of the U.S. nuclear weapons complex coincided with the end of the Cold War, leading to a decline in the need for new nuclear warheads and a sharp decrease in the number of warheads in the U.S. nuclear stockpile. In 1992, the U.S. nuclear stockpile began to decline sharply, and a moratorium on nuclear weapons testing was enacted by Congress. President George H.W. Bush signed the bill into law, and President Clinton extended the moratorium before signing the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1996. The United States has not conducted any explosive nuclear tests since September 1992 and has not designed or produced a new nuclear warhead since 1992. Regulatory challenges and concerns about environmental, safety, and health issues at nuclear weapons facilities have also been a focus. The reduction in U.S. nuclear weapons facilities in the mid-1990s led to only nine sites remaining, including a TVA reactor in seven states. These facilities faced budget increases for safety and environmental issues, with a shift towards environmental management over nuclear weapons production in FY1995. Shutdowns of nuclear weapons operations often lacked follow-up plans, such as the closure of the Rocky Flats Plant in Colorado in June 1989. The Rocky Flats Plant in Colorado ceased plutonium production operations in June 1989 without clear plans for restoring pit capacity elsewhere. Significant challenges arose when operations ceased at Hanford, Rocky Flats, and the Savannah River Site, with special nuclear materials in processing. Efforts to restart the K-reactor at the Savannah River Site failed, leading to tritium contamination in 1991. New tritium production capacity had to be developed using commercial power reactors. Alternative facilities were developed over time to meet stockpile needs, including nonnuclear hydrodynamic testing facilities at Los Alamos and Livermore National Laboratories, and tritium production capacity from Tennessee Valley Authority nuclear power reactors. The United States has a science-based program to maintain confidence in the nuclear stockpile without testing. LANL's plutonium pit capacity has not kept up with NNSA's needs. The Nuclear Security Enterprise includes NNSA Headquarters and national security laboratories. The Nuclear Security Enterprise includes the NNSA field offices, national security laboratories, nuclear weapons production facilities, and essential facilities like the TVA's Watts Barr nuclear power reactor and the WIPP site in New Mexico. These sites focus on laboratories, testing, production, and support facilities for the nuclear weapons infrastructure. The primary mission of national security laboratories is to develop and sustain nuclear weapons capabilities without testing. They also engage in long-term research and development activities for the nuclear weapon mission and apply science to solve national challenges. Production facilities produce materials for nuclear weapons, with some components replaced regularly and others as needed to extend the arsenal's life. Pantex Plant and Y-12 are responsible for dismantling retired weapons and storage. The Nevada National Security Site near Las Vegas maintains facilities for testing critical to the stockpile stewardship program and has the capability to resume nuclear explosive testing if ordered by the President. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plan (WIPP) in New Mexico manages plutonium-contaminated waste from nuclear weapons facilities. Without WIPP, nuclear warhead operations generating such waste would be restricted. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plan (WIPP) in New Mexico manages plutonium-contaminated waste from nuclear weapons facilities. NNSA operates three national security laboratories focused on nuclear weapons design and testing. Los Alamos and Livermore historically designed U.S. nuclear weapons, including the physics package. Today, all three labs work to maintain stockpile confidence without nuclear testing. Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and Livermore labs work to maintain stockpile confidence without nuclear testing. LANL, established in 1943, is responsible for nuclear design and engineering of certain nuclear weapons. Los Alamos is responsible for nuclear design and engineering of various warheads, managing life extension programs for existing warheads. It develops capabilities for stockpile confidence without nuclear testing, conducts regular evaluations, and possesses unique capabilities in neutron scattering, surveillance, radiography, and plutonium science. Los Alamos has unique capabilities for plutonium processing and fabrication, working with special nuclear materials and producing limited numbers of plutonium pits. Safety concerns have limited production to 10-15 pits per year, with a shut-down in 2013 due to safety issues. The lab has faced questions about its safety culture and seismic risks. Los Alamos National Laboratory employs about 11,700 people, with a budget of $2.55 billion in FY2017, mostly allocated to nuclear weapons activities. The management contract was awarded to Los Alamos National Security, which will be transitioned to Triad National Security. The management and operating contract for Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) was awarded to Triad National Security, a new LLC consisting of Battelle Memorial Institute, the Regents of the University of California, and the Regents of Texas A&M University. LLNL, established in 1952, is located in Livermore, CA, and is known for its research and development of nuclear weapons, including designing the first nuclear warhead for a U.S. submarine-launched ballistic missile. Livermore National Laboratory is responsible for nuclear design activities for various warheads and conducts regular evaluations of warheads to ensure stockpile confidence without nuclear testing. Livermore's core capabilities include high performance computing, high energy density physics, plutonium research, weapons engineering, and advanced manufacturing. Livermore National Laboratory is home to the National Ignition Facility (NIF), the world's largest and highest-energy laser, designed for fusion ignition and thermonuclear burn studies. NIF, part of NNSA's Stockpile Stewardship program, aims to ensure the safety and reliability of the nuclear stockpile through research on extreme conditions. Despite facing delays and cost overruns during construction, NIF has not yet achieved nuclear fusion ignition. Some in the Department of Energy question its potential for reaching this milestone. Livermore National Laboratory, managed by Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC, has a significant budget allocated to nuclear weapons activities. Sandia National Laboratories, established in 1949, conducts nonnuclear engineering development for nuclear weapons and has a principal laboratory in Livermore. Sandia National Laboratories, located in Albuquerque, NM, operates at various locations including Livermore, CA, Tonopah Test Range in NV, Pantex Plant in TX, and five other sites. Sandia designs, develops, and tests nonnuclear components for U.S. nuclear weapons, participates in warhead life extension programs, and is responsible for systems integration and manufacturing of specialized components. Sandia National Laboratories manufactures specialized components for U.S. nuclear weapons and contributes to annual stockpile assessments. It operates the Z machine, a powerful radiation source used for high energy density science research. Sandia National Laboratories, managed by National Technology and Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, is a key player in nuclear weapons activities with a budget of $3.2 billion in FY2017. The Nevada National Security Site, located 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas, is a significant location for Sandia's operations. The Nevada National Security Site, formerly known as the Nevada Test Site, is located 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas on a 1,300-square-mile tract surrounded by the Nevada Test and Training Range. It was established in 1950 as a continental proving ground for U.S. nuclear weapons tests and conducted its first atmospheric nuclear test in 1951. The site has a total area of over 5,400 square miles and has evolved its mission to reflect the United States' shift away from explosive nuclear tests. The Nevada National Security Site, formerly the Nevada Test Site, conducted 100 atmospheric tests by July 1962. Atmospheric testing ceased in 1963 due to the Limited Test Ban Treaty, but underground nuclear testing continued until 1992, with 828 tests conducted. The last underground test was on September 23, 1992. Since then, the US has upheld a moratorium on nuclear testing, reaffirmed by each administration, including the Trump Administration in 2018. The United States maintains a moratorium on nuclear testing since 1992, reaffirmed by the Trump Administration in 2018. While confident in the safety of its nuclear stockpile through stewardship, the US retains the ability to conduct underground tests if necessary, under specific conditions and presidential directive. The Nevada National Security Site, formerly known as the Nevada Test Site, plays a crucial role in the nation's Stockpile Stewardship Programs. It conducts subcritical experiments and other essential tests to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the remaining nuclear weapons without full-scale testing. The site employs around 1,900 people and has a budget of $447 million, with the capability to conduct highly enriched-driven plutonium experiments. The Nevada National Security Site, managed by National Security Technologies, LLC, has a budget of $447 million, with $357.9 million allocated to nuclear weapons activities. Originally located in Kansas City, MO, the facility moved to the new Kansas City National Security Campus in 2013. The move was necessary due to aging facilities and increasing costs. The Kansas City NSC, managed by Honeywell Federal Manufacturing & Technologies, LLC, is responsible for producing nonnuclear components for nuclear weapons. It employs 2,500 people and has a budget of $797 million for FY2019. The Savannah River Site, located near Aiken, SC, spans 310 square miles along the Savannah River. The Savannah River Site was constructed in the early 1950s to produce tritium and plutonium-239 for U.S. nuclear weapons. Five reactors operated at the site from 1953 to 1988. Despite hopes to resume reactor operations, a leak in 1991 led to a permanent shutdown in 1993. The Savannah River Site shifted focus from nuclear material production to waste management and environmental remediation in the 1980s. DOE announced a permanent shutdown in 1993 due to a leak. The Department of Energy's Office of Environmental Management is the landlord, while NNSA is a tenant. SRS no longer operates nuclear reactors but recycles tritium from dismantled warheads and extracts tritium from burnable absorber rods irradiated in TVA's Watts Barr reactor. The Savannah River Site (SRS) in Tennessee is the only facility in the nuclear security enterprise that can extract, recycle, purify, and reload tritium. SRS also provides interim storage for excess plutonium and manages the surplus plutonium disposition program. The DOE planned to blend surplus plutonium with uranium to make mixed oxide (MOX) fuel for commercial nuclear reactors at the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) at SRS, but the program has faced delays and cost increases. The program to dispose of surplus plutonium at the Savannah River Site has faced delays and cost increases since 2007. The Obama Administration slowed the project in FY2013 and FY2014 to consider alternative strategies. The Trump Administration supported terminating the MOX project in favor of diluting and disposing of the plutonium at the WIPP facility in New Mexico. NNSA announced plans to repurpose the MOX facility for plutonium pit production. The Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina, managed by the DOE, is involved in environmental remediation, waste management, and facility decommissioning. It employs around 12,000 people, with most working on clean-up projects. The annual budget is approximately $1.7 billion, with a significant portion allocated to Environmental Management activities. During the Cold War, the SRS was operated by the Dupont Corporation. The Pantex Plant, managed by Savannah River Nuclear Solutions, is located in Texas and handles nuclear weapons assembly and disassembly. It is the only facility in the US for this purpose since 1975. Pantex returned nuclear weapon components to Rocky Flats or the Y-12 plant during the Cold War. The Pantex Plant in Texas, managed by Savannah River Nuclear Solutions, handles nuclear weapons assembly and disassembly. It now focuses on refurbishing existing warheads and disassembling retired weapons as part of the Life Extension programs. Pantex is also responsible for developing high-explosive components and has 3,246 employees. The budget requested for Pantex for FY2019 is $825 million, with $814.4 million allocated to weapons activities. Pantex is managed by Consolidated Nuclear Security, LLC, a subsidiary of Bechtel National, Lockheed Martin Services, ATK Launch Systems, and SOC, LLC. The Y-12 National Security Complex is located in Oak Ridge Reservation, about 20 miles west of Knoxville, TN. The Y-12 National Security Complex is located on a 5.3-square-mile site in the Oak Ridge Reservation, about 20 miles west of Knoxville, TN. It was built in 1943 as part of the Manhattan Project to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. Y-12 continues to manufacture nuclear weapons components, including uranium and lithium, and is the sole source for enriched uranium components for nuclear weapons. It also contributes to life extension programs by producing refurbished, replaced, and upgraded weapon components. The Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, TN manufactures nuclear weapons components and serves as a storage facility for highly enriched uranium. It is currently building a new Uranium Processing Facility (UPF) projected to be completed by 2025 at a cost of $6.5 billion. The facility has experienced delays and cost increases. When completed, it is expected to produce 50-80 canned secondaries per year and employs approximately 4,678 people. NNSA has requested $1.78 billion for Y-12 in its FY2019 budget, with $703 million allocated to the UPF project. The Y-12 National Security Complex is managed by Consolidated Nuclear Security, LLC and is involved in producing tritium for nuclear weapons. Tritium is currently recycled from dismantled warheads at the Savannah River Site, but additional production is needed as current stocks degrade. Since 2003, tritium has been produced by irradiating TPBARs in the Watts Bar Unit 1 nuclear power reactor owned by TVA. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) owns the Watts Barr nuclear power reactor, which produces tritium and electricity domestically. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) has been extracting tritium from TPBARs since FY2007. To meet stockpile needs, Watts Barr aims to produce 2,800 grams of tritium by 2025. NNSA seeks NRC approval to use a second reactor at Watts Barr for tritium production starting in early FY2021. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in Carlsbad, NM, disposes of plutonium-contaminated transuranic waste from nuclear weapons facilities in specialized casks stored in salt caverns. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) stores transuranic waste in specialized casks in salt caverns 2,150 feet underground. It plays a crucial role in disposing of waste from various DOE sites, although questions remain about its future disposal capacity. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) is a crucial facility for disposing of transuranic waste from DOE sites, but questions have been raised about its disposal capacity due to contamination, collapsed ceilings, and strain from compliance-related disposal. DOE has tried to address the issue by adjusting volume capacity calculations to increase disposal without permit modifications, but New Mexico's review has been delayed until 2019. Congress may address these concerns as it oversees DOE and NNSA management and funding for the Nuclear Security Enterprise. The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, NNSA organization and management, infrastructure recapitalization, plutonium pit production, and tritium supply concerns are key topics Congress has addressed. Changes to the DNFSB's authorities could impact access to information on nuclear facility incidents. The DNFSB was established in 1988 to oversee public health and safety at DOE-managed defense nuclear facilities. The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board's mission is to ensure public health and safety at DOE-managed defense nuclear facilities. Recent restrictions imposed by the DOE limit the board's access to sensitive information, raising concerns about transparency and oversight. The recent restrictions imposed by the DOE limit transparency and weaken the board's oversight ability. This follows reports from 2017, where the chairman recommended downsizing or abolishing the group, a position supported by some contractors managing sites in the nuclear weapons complex. The responsibility for the nuclear weapons program has shifted over the years, leading to reorganizations due to concerns about management. The Congressional Advisory Panel on the Governance of the Nuclear Security Enterprise found existing governance structures and practices to be inefficient and ineffective, putting the entire enterprise at risk over the long term due to decades of neglect. The Congressional Advisory Panel on the Governance of the Nuclear Security Enterprise concluded that NNSA governance reform has failed to create an effective, mission-focused enterprise as intended by Congress. Recommendations include strengthening presidential guidance, establishing new congressional oversight mechanisms, and building a culture of performance and accountability. NNSA supported some management changes but opposed restructuring the organization or its leadership. Congress remains concerned about the situation. The Senate has expressed concerns about NNSA's organization and management, noting a lack of progress in implementing recommendations. The Senate sought to clarify NNSA's roles and authorities to provide greater autonomy. The legislation aims to address delays and cost overruns in weapons programs and tensions within the current organizational structure. The legislation aims to implement recommendations from the Augustine-Mies panel to clarify the roles and authority of the NNSA Administrator, addressing long-standing concerns with NNSA management and organization. The conferees described the nuclear security enterprise as broken, citing cost overruns, disputes over capital acquisition decisions, safety concerns, and delayed infrastructure projects. They emphasized the need for engagement by key officials to ensure NNSA meets military requirements efficiently. The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review highlighted the effects of aging and underfunding on the U.S. nuclear weapons infrastructure. NNSA administrators have testified to Congress about the backlog. NNSA administrators have testified to Congress about the need for prompt investment in replacing aging facilities to maintain a safe and effective nuclear arsenal. Congress generally supports this need, but questions remain about NNSA's prioritization in budget proposals and program management. Funding for NNSA's recapitalization projects, under Infrastructure and Operations (I&O), has seen steady growth in recent years, with Congress often adding funds above the budget request. For example, Congress increased funding by $86.4 million in FY2017, despite NNSA not requesting an increase in I&O funding. In FY2018, Congress provided $3,117.8 million for NNSA's Infrastructure and Operations (I&O) funding, an increase of more than 10% and triple the increase from FY2016 to FY2017. NNSA requested $3,002.7 million for FY2019, with the House increasing the budget further while the Senate reduced it. Funding for recapitalization, crucial for NNSA infrastructure, has shown mixed results, with Congress providing $743.1 million in FY2017 but NNSA requesting only $427.3 million in FY2018. In FY2018, Congress provided $3,117.8 million for NNSA's Infrastructure and Operations funding, with funding for recapitalization showing mixed results. The House recommended $612.6 million for the NNSA program area, while the Senate reduced the request to $425 million in FY2019. NNSA announced plans to repurpose the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility in South Carolina to produce plutonium pits. The NNSA proposed an alternative for pit production capacity in New Mexico, aiming for 50 pits per year at Savannah River and 30 pits per year at Los Alamos. This approach is seen as the best way to manage cost, schedule, and risk for meeting DOD requirements. The US has been seeking a reliable pit production capability since the closure of the Rocky Flats plant, with various unsuccessful projects proposed over the years. Currently, the US can produce small numbers of pits at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Facility (CMR) at Los Alamos National Laboratory, dating from the 1950s, has been unable to meet the required pit production capacity. Operations ceased in 2013 due to safety issues but have slowly resumed, producing one demonstration pit. Plans to replace the aging CMR with a new facility were canceled due to cost concerns. Instead, the NNSA planned to expand production capacity by constructing smaller modules at Los Alamos. The NNSA plans to repurpose the MFFF facility at Savannah River to increase pit production capacity. Congress is reviewing the plan, questioning the total cost, rationale for ramping up production by 2030, and the need for a minimum of 80 pits per year. The plan aims to improve the resiliency of the Nuclear Security Enterprise by not relying on a single production site. The NNSA plans to repurpose the MFFF facility at Savannah River to increase pit production capacity. Congress is questioning the need for a minimum of 80 pits per year, citing varying capacity estimates from past administrations. Andrew Weber, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Defense Programs, emphasized the need for pit production capacity to increase to 80 per year by 2030. Congress has requested more information on this goal through the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 mandated NNSA to produce 30 pits per year at Los Alamos National Laboratory by 2026 and plan for pits 31-80 by 2030. The legislation requires briefings to Congress on the implementation plan and annual certification of progress towards the 80 pits per year goal. The final bill did not include some reporting requirements from the House version. The Nuclear Posture Review changed the annual plutonium pit requirement to \"at least 80 pits\" from the previous range of \"50-80 pits.\" Tritium, used to boost the yield of nuclear weapons, must be replenished regularly due to its half-life. The U.S. is seeking to add tritium production to a second reactor at Watts Barr to meet future demand. The U.S. faces a challenge in producing tritium for nuclear weapons due to the closure of its last uranium enrichment facility in 2013. With existing stocks of U.S.-origin low-enriched uranium expected to run out in the mid-2020s, NNSA is exploring plans to extend the stockpile until around 2030. The NNSA is considering options to acquire low-enriched uranium for tritium production, including building a new centrifuge plant, blending down highly enriched uranium, or using foreign-origin low-enriched uranium. These decisions could have implications for U.S. nonproliferation policy."
