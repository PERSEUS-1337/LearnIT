    "content": "Nicaragua transitioned to democracy in the early 1990s after a civil war. However, democratic institutions like the legislature and judiciary remained weak and politicized. In 1998, the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) and Constitutionalist Liberal Party (PLC) limited political party participation. Current President Daniel Ortega, a former junta member, has been in power since 1984. Since transitioning to democracy in the early 1990s, Nicaragua has seen Daniel Ortega's rise to power through democratic elections in 2006, 2011, and 2016. Despite growing authoritarianism, Ortega and the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) have improved living standards for the poor, increasing their popularity. However, elections have been criticized for flaws and strengthening Ortega's control over national institutions. In 2011, Daniel Ortega won the national elections with almost 63% of the vote, despite concerns about legitimacy. By 2012, the FSLN had gained dominance over the country's institutions. In 2016, Ortega's power was further solidified by removing opposition members from the legislature. Ortega's popularity may be declining, with disputed voter turnout numbers. He was inaugurated for his third consecutive term in January 2017. In September 2016, Nicaragua granted asylum to former El Salvadoran President Mauricio Funes, who cited political persecution as the reason for fleeing. President Ortega consolidated his power through constitutional amendments and a revised military code, granting himself new powers and expanding the military's role in public administration. President Ortega consolidated his power through constitutional amendments and a revised military code, granting himself new powers of patronage and expanding the military's role in public administration. The 2014 code gave the president more influence over the army's high command appointments and allowed active-duty officers to hold civilian government positions. It also expanded the army's responsibilities in internal security, including providing security for the inter-oceanic canal and managing ports, airports, and telecommunications facilities. Critics fear these expanded duties could lead to increased surveillance of civilians for political purposes. Ortega expanded his control over state institutions in 2014, shifting responsibility for the police directly to the president. The law raised concerns about increased political repression and hindered investigative reporting by the media. The Ortega administration obstructs and discredits media critics, with journalists facing death threats and violence without police protection. The Nicaraguan government under Ortega has been accused of limiting press freedom and consolidating power by removing checks on his authority. In 2016, the Supreme Court ruled to prevent major opposition forces from running against Ortega, leading to the ousting of opposition leaders and legislators. This has raised concerns about political repression and hindered investigative reporting. The Electoral Council ousted 16 legislators from the PLI and MRS for not recognizing Reyes as their party's leader, seen as a move to eliminate political pluralism. The Sandinista government defends its actions as strengthening the legal system, but critics view them as a way to keep Ortega in power indefinitely. Ortega's social welfare programs have reduced poverty and raised incomes, boosting his popularity despite some domestic criticism. Despite some criticism and a slight decline in popularity, Ortega remains the most popular political figure in Nicaragua. His family's wealth and influence have grown alongside his power, with his children owning businesses. Ortega's wife, Rosario Murillo, holds significant power in his administration and is seen as a de facto co-ruler. There is speculation that she may succeed him, as she was named as his vice-presidential running mate. Ortega's power in Nicaragua is criticized for being authoritarian, with his wife, Rosario Murillo, seen as a co-ruler. The opposition is weak due to FSLN control of political institutions. Ortega has maintained international relations with countries critical of the US, balancing antagonism with cooperation. Ortega in Nicaragua balances his antagonistic stance against the US and Europe with cooperation on key issues like counternarcotics, free trade, and Central American integration. His government's macroeconomic policies enable working relationships with financial institutions like the World Bank and IMF. Nicaragua's stability and lack of violence, along with the divided opposition, make it challenging for other countries to press Ortega on his policies. Ortega's governance in Nicaragua is supported by populist measures that have improved living standards, despite concerns about his authoritarian tendencies. He won a third consecutive term in the 2016 elections, with critics questioning the legitimacy of the electoral process. The divided opposition has been unable to present a coherent alternative to Ortega's leadership. The Supreme Electoral Council in Nicaragua issued the electoral calendar without incorporating suggested changes from political parties. Opposition party participation has been restricted, and international observation is not allowed. Ortega began his fifth term in 2017, extending his presidency to over 16 years. In 2016, two main opposition candidates withdrew from the race, including Fabio Gadea who cited lack of transparency in the electoral process as his reason. Gadea, aged 84, cited lack of transparency in the electoral process as his reason for withdrawing from the race. PLC candidate Noel Vidaurre also withdrew, citing concerns about party leader Arnoldo Alem\u00e1n naming his wife and close associates as candidates. Alem\u00e1n, a former president prosecuted for embezzlement, had a negative impact on opposition parties' chances in legislative elections. Despite the FSLN's significant lead in polls, the Sandinista government continued to weaken the opposition. The Sandinista government further crippled the opposition by preventing major opposition forces from running against Ortega and the FSLN through Supreme Court rulings in June 2016. Opposition leader Eduardo Montealegre was removed as the head of the PLI, leading to denunciations from him and other party leaders. The Supreme Court also invalidated factions seeking control of the Partido de Acci\u00f3n Ciudadana, hindering the National Coalition for Democracy's ability to run candidates in the 2016 electoral race. In July 2016, the government ousted 16 members of the PLI and MRS from the legislature. On September 6, 2016, the election-oriented coalition disbanded after being prohibited from participating in the elections. Some members of the CND launched a protest movement, Citizens for Liberty, and boycotted the November 6 presidential election. Various organizations, including COSEP and human rights groups, expressed concern about the Supreme Court's decisions. The State Department also expressed grave concern over the actions of the Nicaraguan government and Supreme Court. The State Department expressed grave concern over the Nicaraguan government's actions to limit democratic space before the elections, calling for fair and transparent elections. The flawed electoral process prevented a free and fair election on November 6, allowing the ruling FSLN party to maintain its supermajority in the National Assembly. Municipal elections are scheduled for 2017, with expectations of FSLN victories. Nicaragua's economic development has been more consistent than its democratic development since the 1990 Central American Peace Accords. The World Bank notes Nicaragua's above-average growth levels in Latin America and the Caribbean, with a peak of 6.2% in 2011. President Ortega aims to implement socialism in Nicaragua while maintaining elements of a market-based economy. The country faces challenges, including high. Nicaragua's economy faces challenges with high electricity costs hindering competitiveness and foreign investment. The future of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement could impact textile production, a major export. Despite declining poverty rates, President Ortega has implemented social-welfare programs to assist the poor population. Nicaragua's economy struggles with high electricity costs and limited foreign investment. President Ortega's social welfare programs, funded in part by Venezuela, have raised concerns about transparency and political patronage. Reduced aid from Venezuela due to low oil prices and political factors could further strain Nicaragua's finances. The Ortega administration in Nicaragua is preparing for the possibility of reduced funds from Venezuela, which could harm the economy. They are curbing subsidies, seeking external finance, and utilizing trade agreements to boost exports and attract foreign investment. Nicaragua also joined CARICOM in 2016 to promote economic integration and cooperation. Controversy surrounds Ortega's decision to grant a 100-year concession for an inter-oceanic canal through Nicaragua to a Chinese company. The deal, rushed through in 2013, gives the company extensive powers and exemptions, with no environmental study conducted beforehand. Despite government claims of economic benefits, details of the project remain secret. The Chinese company granted a 100-year concession for an inter-oceanic canal through Nicaragua, estimated to cost $50 billion. Despite breaking ground in 2014, there has been no visible progress, raising concerns about the project's financing. HKND officials claim preconstruction studies are ongoing, but experts question if the project is still viable. Biologists and scientific organizations are alarmed at the potential environmental impact on Lake Nicaragua and protected nature reserves. Several scientific organizations and the U.S. embassy have raised concerns about the environmental impact of the inter-oceanic canal project in Nicaragua. They have called for independent studies to be completed and publicly debated before work proceeds. A British consulting firm recommended further studies in various areas, citing issues such as drought, deforestation, and seismic events that could affect the project's stability. In April 2016, the National Council for the Defense of Land, Lake, and Sovereignty presented a measure to repeal the law allowing the construction of the canal in Nicaragua. Despite collecting 7,000 stamped signatures and over 28,000 non-stamped signatures, the National Assembly rejected the measure, citing lack of jurisdiction. Nicaraguan human rights and indigenous groups have filed a complaint with the Inter-American Court on Human Rights, claiming their rights to prior consent have been violated due to the proposed canal route going through indigenous lands. The proposed canal route in Nicaragua has raised concerns among indigenous and Afro-Caribbean communities due to potential displacement. Opposition groups fear corruption due to lack of oversight in the agreement. Demonstrations against the canal have led to clashes with government forces, resulting in protester deaths. The United States has been involved in supporting democratic practices in Nicaragua since 1990. Nicaragua transitioned to democracy in 1990, but the United States has expressed concerns about politicization of institutions and narrowing democratic space. In 2013, the US redirected $4 million in counternarcotics assistance away from the Nicaraguan government due to transparency issues. Congress is considering bills to oppose loans for Nicaragua unless free and fair elections are held. Despite concerns about the Ortega government, US support for Nicaragua continues. Increasing numbers of private American citizens, including retirees, reside in Nicaragua, with about 250,000 U.S. citizens visiting in 2014. Tensions between the two countries have risen, leading to Nicaragua expelling three U.S. officials. The State Department expressed concern over the expulsion, stating it could impact bilateral relations and trade. The Ortega government claimed two officials were acting without their knowledge. A travel alert was issued for U.S. citizens regarding increased Nicaraguan government scrutiny and new requirements for volunteer groups. The Administration's foreign aid request for Nicaragua in FY2016 and FY2017 focused on strengthening independent media, civil society organizations, and at-risk youth to address increasing violence and insecurity. The request included Development Assistance (DA) and International Military Education and Training (IMET) funding to support civil society, education, and citizen-security programs. The United States and Nicaragua cooperate on security and counternarcotics issues. The United States has provided assistance to Nicaragua through the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) to strengthen the military-to-military relationship and support law-enforcement operations. U.S. administrations had to certify Nicaragua's resolution of property claims by U.S. citizens before approving aid, but this requirement was dropped in 2015. The House of Representatives passed the Nicaraguan Investment Conditionality Act of 2016 to oppose loans for Nicaragua unless free elections were held. Concerns about human rights abuses in Nicaragua have been ongoing, including restrictions on voting rights and freedom of speech. The State Department's human rights report highlighted various abuses in Nicaragua, including biased policies, arbitrary arrests, life-threatening prison conditions, corruption, violence against marginalized groups, trafficking, and violations of trade union rights. Discrimination against ethnic minorities, indigenous people, individuals with disabilities, and those with HIV/AIDS was also reported. Allegations of arbitrary or unlawful killings by the government or its agents were made, with some killings believed to be politically motivated. The government was accused of not acting on complaints of human rights violations. The Nicaraguan government has been criticized for not addressing complaints of corruption and human rights abuses, including unlawful killings by security forces. Concerns have been raised about the participation of officers in U.S.-sponsored IMET programs. Human rights organizations reported arbitrary arrests related to protests, intimidation of journalists, and harassment of civil society organizations by the Ortega government in 2015. Nicaragua showed some progress in combating corruption. In 2015, Nicaragua made progress in combating corruption, with former president Arnoldo Alem\u00e1n convicted of embezzling $100 million in public funds. The State Department's 2015 human rights report highlighted corrupt practices among Nicaraguan officials. Concerns were raised about Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson's commitment to human rights during confirmation hearings. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted to send his nomination to the full Senate for a vote. The United States and Nicaragua are participants in the U.S.-Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR). U.S. exports to Nicaragua have increased by 101% and Nicaraguan exports to the United States have grown by 170% since the accord went into effect in 2005. Nicaragua is the United States' 62nd largest goods trading partner, with $4.4 billion in total goods trade during 2015. President Trump has not mentioned any intentions regarding CAFTA-DR, and Central American leaders believe the trade agreement will remain intact. Nicaraguan officials are monitoring the new Administration for any changes to the U.S.-Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement. In 2015, top U.S. exports to Nicaragua included machinery, relief articles, electrical machinery, mineral fuels, and fabrics. U.S. goods exports to Nicaragua increased by 25% ($248 million) from 2014. Agricultural exports to Nicaragua from the U.S. included soybean meal and oil, corn, dairy products, and prepared food. Nicaragua was the 57th largest supplier of goods imports to the U.S. in 2015. Recent U.S. laws on cigars may impact future tobacco exports from Nicaragua. The American Chamber of Commerce estimates that over 125 companies in Nicaragua have ties to U.S. companies, with more than 300,000 employees. Concerns have been raised about Nicaragua's military purchases from Russia, including fighter jets. Costa Rican and Honduran analysts fear this could destabilize the region. Nicaragua's purchase of 50 tanks from Russia in 2016-2017 for $80 million raised concerns about regional destabilization. The delivery of the tanks was part of military cooperation between Nicaragua and Russia. The Nicaraguan government has kept details of a canal deal secret, leading to speculation of Chinese involvement. China denies involvement in the canal project, but experts suggest influence over the private Chinese company granted the concession. Reports of Iran expanding its role in Nicaragua in 2009 also caused concern in Washington. Iran's foreign minister visited Nicaragua in 2016 to expand economic relations, focusing on cooperation in areas like the Nicaraguan canal, agriculture, energy production, and banking. This visit followed reports of Iran's involvement in Nicaragua, which had raised concerns in Washington."
