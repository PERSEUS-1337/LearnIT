    "content": "President Obama nominated Elena Kagan as the next Supreme Court Justice to replace Justice John Paul Stevens. Kagan, previously the Solicitor General, focused on analyzing free speech jurisprudence in her academic work. She aims to understand the evolution of the Supreme Court's First Amendment jurisprudence without advocating for changes in analysis. Elena Kagan's scholarship on First Amendment case law focuses on preventing laws with improper motives. Her article \"Private Speech, Public Purpose\" argues for using objective tests to reveal laws with improper government motives. It is uncertain how this scholarship would apply to her potential role as a Supreme Court Justice if confirmed. Elena Kagan's theory of First Amendment doctrine revolves around improper government motives influencing laws. She argues that the Court scrutinizes laws based on their risk of being improperly motivated, analyzing various aspects of First Amendment law. Ms. Kagan's analysis of First Amendment doctrine focuses on the effects of speech restrictions rather than the purpose of Congress. She argues that theories based solely on effects are insufficient to explain First Amendment doctrine. Ms. Kagan argues that First Amendment doctrine is primarily motivated by a desire to discover improper government motive, as seen in the case of R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul where the Supreme Court invalidated a statute prohibiting fighting words based on race. This challenges the traditional effects-based theory of speech restrictions. Ms. Kagan's theory suggests that the Court invalidates statutes to prevent official suppression of ideas, even within unprotected speech categories. She uses the example of R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul to explain her theory. Ms. Kagan's government motive theory offers a comprehensive explanation of First Amendment jurisprudence, although she acknowledges other theories may better explain certain aspects of doctrine. She believes her theory provides the best explanation for current First Amendment jurisprudence, despite recognizing room for disagreement. In her article, Ms. Kagan compares her improper motive theory of First Amendment doctrine with speaker-based and audience-based theories. The speaker-based theory focuses on conferring expressive rights on speakers, evaluating laws based on their impact on individuals' ability to speak. The curr_chunk discusses different theories of First Amendment doctrine, including quantity-based, audience-based, and government motive-based theories. The quantity-based theory emphasizes the importance of the amount of information or opinion disseminated, while the audience-based theory focuses on ensuring that all valuable ideas are expressed to help the audience arrive at truth. Ms. Kagan's government motive-based theory argues that the reasons behind a regulation are essential, rather than just the consequences. Ms. Kagan's government motive-based theory identifies four impermissible government motives that the Court is suspicious of when it comes to restricting speech. These include laws that restrict speech based on disagreement with the message, threats to officials' self-interest, providing advantages to favored ideas, and using opinions to advance lawmakers' self-interests. The Court is wary of laws using citizens' opinions to regulate speech, focusing on whether the government would treat ideas it disagreed with the same as those it agreed with or was indifferent to. This approach allows for speech regulations addressing unrelated harms but invalidates laws assuming harm based on disfavored ideas. Ms. Kagan argues that free speech cases involving private individuals are influenced by the Court's examination of government motives. Ms. Kagan argues that the Court indirectly examines government motives in free speech cases, placing a higher burden on laws with potential improper motivations. Ms. Kagan analyzes different theories for the development of First Amendment doctrine and concludes that the government motive theory is the best explanation. She suggests that the First Amendment prohibits speech restrictions based on hostility, sympathy, or self-interest of lawmakers, and proposes an indirect method to identify impermissible motives. Ms. Kagan argues that the development of First Amendment doctrine is best explained by the government motive theory. She suggests that laws discriminating against speech based on content are reviewed more strictly than those that do not. Using examples of billboard restrictions, she illustrates how laws targeting specific types of speech are less likely to be upheld as constitutional. She then explores speaker-based, audience-based, and government-motive-based models to support her argument. Ms. Kagan argues that the speaker-based theory does not explain the general rule that laws restricting the most speech are most likely to be constitutional. She suggests that the audience-based theory provides a better explanation, as content-based restrictions may disproportionately affect the marketplace of ideas. Ms. Kagan argues that content-based laws that skew speech markets should receive close scrutiny, contrary to the current practice. She suggests that content-based laws may lead to balance rather than distortion in the marketplace of ideas. Ms. Kagan disagrees with the audience-based theory on the distinction between content-based and content-neutral laws, arguing that it is possible to measure skewing effects. She suggests that some content-neutral laws may actually preserve a skewed speech market and should be scrutinized closely. Despite inconsistencies, she believes it is possible to reach a well-supported decision on the effects of regulation on speech. Ms. Kagan argues that the distinction between content-based and content-neutral laws cannot be solely based on the inability to evaluate skewing effects. She believes that all government actions have an impact on the speech market and that both types of laws can skew it. She proposes the government-motive-based theory as a clearer explanation for the distinction, suggesting that courts would disfavor content-based laws under this theory. Ms. Kagan argues that under the government-motive-based theory, content-based laws are disfavored as they are more likely to be linked to suspect government motives. She suggests that the goal should be to identify improper motives rather than untoward consequences. The distinction between content-based and content-neutral laws separates actions with varying probabilities of arising from illicit motives. For example, a law banning all billboards is less likely to be motivated by the suppression of disfavored ideas, thus justifying a presumption of constitutionality. Ms. Kagan argues that the government motive theory explains the different levels of scrutiny given to subject-based restrictions and why some laws are treated differently based on their terms rather than their effects. Content-neutral laws, even with significant skewing effects, are seen as less problematic due to their diffuse impact on various dimensions. Ms. Kagan argues that content-based laws have a focused effect, leading to heightened scrutiny for improper purpose. The distinctions between content-based and content-neutral laws may result in some errors but are necessary to prevent government abuse of power. The Court's standard serves as an evidentiary device for the government to disprove improper motive. The strict scrutiny standard serves as an evidentiary device for the government to disprove the presumption of improper motive arising from content-based laws. The Court's suspicions of bad motive deepen if the restriction captures more speech than necessary to protect the asserted interest. Content-neutral laws also carry a risk of improper motive as they restrict speech. Ms. Kagan argues that government motives play a crucial role in restricting speech, as lawmakers may suppress more speech than necessary to limit certain ideas. She suggests that laws, even if content-neutral, can be tainted by impermissible purposes. This motive-based model helps explain the different levels of review for content-based and content-neutral laws, highlighting its significance in First Amendment doctrine. Ms. Kagan explains that government motives are key in speech restrictions, as laws can be influenced by improper reasons. She points out that certain content-neutral laws are scrutinized more closely due to the risk of government bias. For example, in Saia v. New York, a law was struck down for restricting radio devices without proper permission. The Court has struck down laws granting officials discretion to determine when speech is permissible, concerned with wide authority granted to administrators. The speaker-based model cannot explain the rule against standardless licensing schemes. Ms. Kagan argues that the government motive theory is the only explanation for the higher standard applied to content-neutral laws that allow administrators to grant exceptions without setting standards. This is due to concerns about illicit motives leading to distortion rather than improvement of the speech market. Ms. Kagan argues that laws granting administrators the power to make decisions about speech without standards are closely scrutinized by the Court to prevent decisions based on speech content. Laws prohibiting speech based on its effects are also closely examined. Ms. Kagan discusses the potential for improper motives in content-based government actions, highlighting the importance of scrutinizing laws that rely on communicative impact. The risk of content-based actions justifies suspicion of improper motives, similar to laws granting administrators standardless discretion. The analysis focuses on the functional equivalence between content-based and communicative impact laws, emphasizing the connection between content discrimination and impermissible motives. Ms. Kagan argues that content-based government actions can be motivated by improper motives, similar to laws granting standardless discretion to administrators. She points to cases like Buckley v. Valeo and Miami Herald v. Tornillo as examples where the Court could have been motivated by enhancing the relative voice of certain speakers. This principle also applies to cases like Turner Broadcasting Inc. v. FCC, where dissenting Justices struck down \"must-carry\" rules. Ms. Kagan criticizes the \"must-carry\" laws and right-of-reply statute for potentially disadvantaging some speakers to favor others, in contrast to the Buckley principle. She questions the Court's acceptance of spending limits on corporate independent expenditures, which could distort elections. Ms. Kagan's analysis questions the Court's acceptance of spending limits on corporate independent expenditures, which could distort elections. She may find the holding in Citizens United consistent with Buckley's suspicion of laws seeking to \"equalize\" the speech market, but this doesn't necessarily mean she agrees with the decision. The Court's decision in Red Lion Broadcasting v. FCC, upholding the fairness doctrine, also deviated from Buckley's principle. Ms. Kagan challenges the Court's acceptance of spending limits on corporate independent expenditures, questioning the distortion of elections. She highlights the Court's decision in Red Lion Broadcasting v. FCC, which upheld the fairness doctrine, and the Court's view on \"must-carry\" rules in Turner Broadcasting. The Court did not see \"must-carry\" as a violation of the Buckley principle, preserving access to free over-the-air television. Ms. Kagan emphasizes that the Court's understanding of the rules avoided a conflict with Buckley. Ms. Kagan questions the Court's acceptance of spending limits on corporate independent expenditures, arguing that the audience-based theory of the First Amendment suggests a reallocation of speech opportunities to disadvantaged speakers. She challenges the Court's view on the Buckley principle and argues that the speaker-based model cannot explain it. Ms. Kagan challenges the Court's reliance on the speaker-based model to explain its treatment of \"equalizing\" laws, concluding it is a poor fit. She argues that the motive-based theory aligns better with the Buckley principle, as laws promoting diversity do not aim to silence anyone but grant more speakers the opportunity to speak. Ms. Kagan argues that laws equalizing speech opportunities aim to grant more speakers the chance to speak, but also carry a risk of improper factors influencing government officials. She believes these laws exist to alter the mix of ideas or speakers in the market. Ms. Kagan suggests that laws equalizing speech opportunities may be driven by improper motives, similar to content-based laws. She gives examples of campaign finance laws potentially serving as incumbent protection devices, leading to the Court invalidating certain statutes. This suspicion of improper motivation could have influenced decisions in cases like First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti and Tornillo. Ms. Kagan theorizes that the government motive theory explains the heightened scrutiny applied by the Court to laws equalizing speech opportunities. She suggests that laws may be driven by improper motives, such as incumbent protection, leading to certain statutes being invalidated. Justice Scalia also considers improper motives, stating that politicians and monopolists cannot be trusted when they claim to welcome fair competition. This theory implies that content-based laws with minimal risk of improper government motivation may receive less First Amendment review. Ms. Kagan argues that certain categories of speech, such as obscenity and fighting words, can be restricted with reduced scrutiny or no scrutiny at all. Obscenity, child pornography, and fighting words are considered unprotected speech and can be banned entirely. Commercial speech and libel also receive varying degrees of scrutiny. Ms. Kagan questions why libel can be restricted without facing the highest constitutional scrutiny, suggesting that it may not be considered political speech, which is typically protected under the First Amendment. Ms. Kagan analyzes the Court's treatment of low-value speech and political expression, concluding that the doctrine is better explained by the audience-based theory rather than the speaker-based model. She dismisses the idea that low-value speech is based on the speaker's lack of value, suggesting instead that it must promote values gained through less effective communication. Ms. Kagan argues that low-value speech is better explained by the audience-based theory rather than the speaker-based model. She believes that allowing speakers to choose what speech has value to them is more appropriate, contradicting the Court's creation of categories of speech with lower value under the First Amendment. The audience-based approach prioritizes speech that aids the audience in searching for truth. Ms. Kagan argues that low-value speech is better explained by the audience-based theory, prioritizing speech that aids the audience in searching for truth. Commercial speech may qualify for lower scrutiny due to the risk of deception, while false speech remains protected by the Constitution. The government-motive-based theory may not fully explain the creation of low-value speech categories. Ms. Kagan analyzes low-value speech categories to determine if they are less likely to have improper government motives. She suggests that defamation involving public figures or public issues may be exempt from punishment due to First Amendment concerns. In her view, speech about these subjects is more likely to influence decision-makers. Ms. Kagan suggests that speech about public figures or public issues is more likely to implicate decision-makers' views and interests, carrying a higher risk of improper government motivation. In contrast, speech about private individuals and private affairs is less likely to have improper motives and can be more easily restricted. She also applies this theory to commercial speech, noting that restrictions on commercial speech may be presumed legitimate due to the close regulation of commercial activity by the government. This logic leads to a lower standard of scrutiny for regulations on speech promoting commercial transactions. Ms. Kagan argues that restrictions on commercial speech can be justified with a lower level of scrutiny, allowing the government to restrict false and misleading commercial speech. She then discusses the lack of protection for certain categories of speech, such as fighting words and obscenity, suggesting that the government's response to immediate danger or regulation of commercial activity may reduce concerns about improper motives behind speech restrictions. Ms. Kagan discusses the difficulty in fitting obscenity restrictions into the framework of impermissible government motives for speech restrictions. The Court's main concern with obscenity is its effect on the audience, rather than government motive. Ms. Kagan suggests that calling certain speech categories \"low value\" may be a misnomer, as they may actually carry a \"low risk\" of improper government motive. Ms. Kagan argues that restrictions on certain speech categories carry a \"low risk\" of improper government motive. The Court may heighten its standard of review for restrictions that present a greater risk of improper motivation, even within these \"low value\" categories. Examples include the invalidation of a statute in R.A.V. that discriminated against fighting words based on viewpoint, and in Cincinnati v. Discovery Network where a statute prohibiting newsracks carrying commercial publications was invalidated. The Court invalidated a statute that discriminated against newsracks carrying commercial publications, stating that the distinction between commercial and noncommercial speech had no relationship to the city's interests. Ms. Kagan suggests that this decision was based on a suspicion of improper government motive, where restrictions on certain speech categories are seen as low-risk. This aligns with the Court's use of the secondary effects doctrine to uphold laws targeting the secondary effects of speech. The secondary effects doctrine focuses on preventing or mitigating the secondary effects of certain types of content, without making facial distinctions based on content. Ms. Kagan's theory on First Amendment doctrine conflicts with the secondary effects doctrine, as it directly considers government motive. She argues that the secondary effects doctrine does not align with speaker- or audience-based theories either. Ms. Kagan's theory challenges the secondary effects doctrine, which aims to regulate the secondary effects of certain content without focusing on the content itself. She argues that this doctrine does not align with speaker- or audience-based theories and conflicts with the government motive theory. Ms. Kagan's theory challenges the secondary effects doctrine, which aims to regulate the secondary effects of certain content without focusing on the content itself. She argues that this doctrine does not align with speaker- or audience-based theories and conflicts with the government motive theory. Ms. Kagan has developed objective tests to identify laws with the highest risk of improper government motive, noting that direct inquiry into such motives is ineffective. She attempts to reconcile the secondary effects doctrine with her theory by distinguishing between communicative and noncommunicative effects, stating that laws focusing on primary effects are less likely to be upheld as constitutional. The Court justifies a relaxed standard for laws targeting secondary effects, as the harm arises from the expressive aspects of speech. Ms. Kagan criticizes this theory, stating it hinders uncovering improper government purpose. Ms. Kagan criticizes the theory that a relaxed standard is justified for laws targeting secondary effects, as it hinders uncovering improper government purpose. She argues that communicative impact plays a \"quasi-evidentiary\" role in distinguishing between laws addressing expressive and nonexpressive effects of speech. Courts and legislators have two testing devices to reveal improper motives in regulating speech: checking if the government regulates speech without an asserted harm and if it regulates conduct causing the same harm as the affected expression. Ms. Kagan questions the fit between the secondary effects doctrine and government motive theory, suggesting the doctrine may be flawed or an aberration. Ms. Kagan finds a paradox in the secondary effects doctrine, as it conflicts with her motive-based model. She argues that evaluating reasons for restrictions by asking about them is ineffective. To align her government motive theory with the secondary effects doctrine, she views it as an evidentiary tool. However, she does not place much emphasis on this motive-based explanation. Ms. Kagan discusses the distinction between laws directly restricting speech and those that incidentally restrict speech, emphasizing that laws targeting expression alone receive closer scrutiny. She argues that laws applying generally to both expressive and nonexpressive activities are less likely to undergo First Amendment review. The key factor is whether a law would have applied regardless of the expressive nature of the action. Ms. Kagan discusses how laws that incidentally restrict speech are treated with less suspicion and are presumptively constitutional. She gives examples of laws that directly restrict speech versus those that apply generally to all activities, highlighting the different levels of scrutiny they receive. Ms. Kagan argues that generally applicable laws that do not target ideas are subject to less First Amendment scrutiny. However, laws that single out expressive activity or sanction conduct are closely scrutinized due to the risk of improper motivation. Ms. Kagan argues that laws targeting expressive activity or conduct with a significant expressive element should receive heightened scrutiny due to the risk of bias. For example, laws prohibiting flag burning can be done indirectly through laws banning public fires, which would be considered an incidental restriction on speech. Directly regulating flag burning as a form of protest against the government would likely be seen as a direct and unconstitutional restriction on speech. Ms. Kagan discusses the treatment of laws prohibiting the knowing mutilation of the American flag, noting that such laws may have improper government motives. She also addresses hate crimes laws as incidental restrictions on speech. Ms. Kagan argues that hate crimes laws ban conduct that may occur independent of expression, making the punishable offense itself a generally applicable law. She refutes claims that these laws target specific ideas and should be more closely reviewed. Ms. Kagan argues that hate crimes laws should be subject to increased scrutiny due to their potential impact on free speech and the government's true motives behind enacting them. She believes that these laws may not necessarily aim to eradicate hateful messages but rather to address racial disparities and prevent harm to specific groups. Ms. Kagan analyzes the justifications for rules of process, distinguishing between those based on outcomes and those justified by internal attributes. She suggests that a motive-based theory may be justified if it produces good results, such as promoting fair outcomes and discouraging actions based on improper motives. Kagan suggests that a motive-based theory may be justified if it produces good results, such as promoting fair outcomes and discouraging actions based on improper motives. The Court should adhere more completely to the audience-based theory if concerned about the effects a law would have on the speech market. The development of motive-based inquiry may stem from a desire to discover adverse effects indirectly, as actions tainted with certain motives tend to have such consequences. Ms. Kagan questions the legitimacy of governmental action based on motives, arguing that actions derive meaning from what motivates them. She raises concerns about the government restricting contemptible ideas due to the risk of bias in distinguishing between true and false ideas. Ms. Kagan argues that government actions derive meaning from motives, questioning the legitimacy of governmental action based on motives. She highlights the risk of bias in distinguishing between true and false ideas when the government restricts contemptible ideas. Ms. Kagan discusses designing laws to restrict hate speech and pornography in a way that aligns with Supreme Court doctrine, focusing on avoiding viewpoint discrimination. She references specific cases to illustrate the constitutional scrutiny these regulations face. Ms. Kagan discusses two cases, R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul and American Booksellers Ass'n, Inc. v. Hudnut, where the Court struck down laws that discriminated against certain viewpoints in hate speech and pornography regulations. The Court emphasized that the government cannot regulate speech based on hostility or favoritism towards the underlying message expressed. Ms. Kagan discusses the Court's decision to strike down laws discriminating against viewpoints in hate speech and pornography regulations, emphasizing that government cannot regulate speech based on hostility or favoritism towards the message expressed. She highlights the problem with creating an \"approved viewpoint\" for women in sexual conduct and argues that these decisions are deeply rooted in First Amendment doctrine. Ms. Kagan emphasizes the importance of viewpoint neutrality in crafting hate speech and pornography restrictions, aligning with the Court's decisions on First Amendment doctrine. She supports laws that are viewpoint neutral and opposes discrimination against viewpoints in speech regulations. Ms. Kagan supports the principle of viewpoint neutrality in regulating hate speech and pornography, arguing that efforts to regulate them should fail if they undermine this principle. She refutes the critique that such laws are harm-based rather than viewpoint-based, stating that there is no practical distinction between regulating based on harm caused by a viewpoint and discriminating against the idea behind the viewpoint. Kagan argues that there is no practical distinction between regulating based on harm caused by a viewpoint and discriminating against the idea behind the viewpoint. She also critiques the presumption against viewpoint discrimination, stating that it is incoherent and corrupt. The danger of viewpoint discrimination lies in the potential bias of those in power, such as judges, who may uphold laws that align with their personal views. Kagan argues that eliminating the principle of viewpoint discrimination is not the solution, citing historical examples and the ongoing relevance of the issue. The case of Rust v. Sullivan is highlighted as an example where the government favored anti-abortion speech. In Rust v. Sullivan, the government favored anti-abortion speech over abortion advocacy, counseling, and referral. Kagan argues that the viewpoint neutrality principle is essential to prevent the imposition of an official orthodoxy, especially for minority groups and women. Removing this safeguard goes against the goals of these groups. Kagan suggests new approaches for regulating hate speech and pornography, including stricter bans, viewpoint-neutral speech restrictions, enhanced obscenity laws, and limited exceptions to the rule against viewpoint discrimination. She presents these as well-reasoned suggestions, not guaranteed solutions. Kagan argues for the enactment and use of hate crimes laws to target conduct, not speech, in order to avoid making First Amendment doctrine incoherent. Hate crimes laws apply regardless of whether the discriminatory conduct expresses any message, similar to government prohibitions on certain illegal acts related to creating pornography. Kagan argues for the use of hate crimes laws to target conduct, not speech, similar to government prohibitions on certain illegal acts related to creating pornography. She believes penalty enhancements for crimes based on race are justified to prevent racially based disadvantage, regardless of any expressive component. Kagan suggests that civil violations based on race or sex should be considered by communities. Kagan argues for using existing laws to prosecute abuse and assault in pornography production, including fraud and illegal deception. She also suggests utilizing laws against prostitution and pandering to curb pornography, citing a case where a conviction was upheld for a sex show. Kagan suggests using existing laws to prosecute abuse and assault in pornography production, including fraud and illegal deception. She also proposes crafting content-based laws without viewpoint bias to regulate pornography, acknowledging potential constitutional challenges. Kagan suggests using existing laws to prosecute abuse and assault in pornography production, including fraud and illegal deception. She also proposes crafting content-based laws without viewpoint bias to regulate pornography, acknowledging potential constitutional challenges. Kagan further suggests that laws prohibiting sexual violence might be used to curb pornography, despite potential constitutional issues. Kagan proposes regulating speech in a viewpoint-neutral manner to control conduct in the manufacture of material, drawing on the New York v. Ferber case. She suggests prohibiting dissemination of material involving coercion or violence against participants, acknowledging limitations in capturing all offensive speech. Difficulty in distinguishing between pornographic and obscene content is noted. Kagan discusses the blurred distinction between obscenity and pornography, attributing it to the success of the anti-pornography movement. She notes that while public perception may have shifted, judicial treatment of such speech remains unchanged. Kagan argues that regulating obscenity could achieve some goals of the anti-pornography movement while posing fewer concerns for First Amendment principles. The Supreme Court has not allowed exceptions for hate speech and pornography, but Kagan questions if carefully considered exceptions could be justified based on the seriousness of harm. Kagan argues that exceptions to the general rule of free speech could be justified based on the seriousness of harm caused and the fit between the harm and the regulatory mechanism. She believes regulations on hate speech and pornography could meet these criteria but cautions against justifying exceptions solely on harm and fit. Kagan suggests that restrictions on low-value speech could justify exceptions to free speech rules. She contrasts R.A.V. with laws on obscenity, arguing for a proper \"fit\" in regulation. Kagan proposes defining pornography and hate speech narrowly to include speech that may not count as speech, like racial epithets, to maintain constitutionality. Kagan argues for narrow definitions of hate speech and pornography to preserve free speech rights, emphasizing the value of the presumption against viewpoint discrimination. She believes that any law restricting these types of speech must consider this presumption to survive legal scrutiny. In response to Stanford University's code of conduct, Kagan discusses the limitations and potential impact of regulating hate speech and pornography. According to Kagan, Stanford's speech policy regulated expression based on certain characteristics, presenting constitutional issues. She suggests that a policy banning harassment, threats, and fighting words would have been a better approach to avoid constitutional problems. However, Stanford's policy targeted specific viewpoints for punishment, which Kagan deemed potentially fatal."
