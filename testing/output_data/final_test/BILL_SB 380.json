    "title": "SB 380",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 3217 of the Public Resources Code prohibits Southern California Gas Company from injecting natural gas into the Aliso Canyon storage facility in Los Angeles County until a safety review is completed, well integrity is ensured, risks are addressed, and the Public Utilities Commission concurs with the supervisor's determination of safety. The Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility in Los Angeles County operated by Southern California Gas Company must undergo a comprehensive safety review with criteria determined by the supervisor and input from independent experts. The experts will provide a methodology for assessing tests and inspections, which will be posted online for public access. The gas storage well safety review includes testing and inspecting for leaks, stopping and remediating any leaks, retesting after remediation, and evaluating or plugging wells that have not been fully abandoned. If a gas storage well is to resume injections, it must be tested and inspected for mechanical integrity, including casing thickness, cement bond evaluation, deformities, and pressure resistance. If a well is found to be at risk of failure, the supervisor must take action. If tests show a gas storage well is at risk of failure, the supervisor must require remediation. If the operator cannot mitigate the risks to satisfaction, the well must be plugged and abandoned. If a gas storage well is to be taken out of service, it must be isolated from the reservoir through plugging with sufficient cement and a mechanical plug at the bottom. The well must be filled with fluid and meet specifications approved by the supervisor. Ongoing testing and monitoring, including real-time and daily pressure monitoring, are required before the well can be returned to service. The gas storage well cannot be returned to service until testing and remediation are completed. A gas storage well must be either returned to service or permanently plugged and abandoned within one year of being isolated from the reservoir. The supervisor must provide written findings for each well that completes required testing and remediation. The comprehensive safety review is not complete until all wells have completed necessary testing and remediation, or have been temporarily or fully abandoned to the supervisor's satisfaction. Before commencing injections at the gas storage facility, the operator must provide the division with the proposed maximum reservoir pressure and supporting data. A public meeting in the affected community must be held by the division to allow for comments on the safety review findings and proposed pressure limit. The pressure limit should not exceed design pressure limits with a safety margin. The operator's proposed maximum reservoir pressure must be approved by the supervisor after consulting with independent experts. Once the safety review is complete and reservoir pressure is approved, injections of natural gas may be allowed. Gas storage wells must only inject or produce gas through interior metal tubing, with ongoing pressure monitoring required. The gas storage wells at the facility must be periodically inspected for leaks using gas leak detection techniques. Production of natural gas from wells is limited to those that have completed required testing and remediation, unless production capacity is insufficient. The supervisor must ensure the availability of sufficient gas production capacity using tested and remediated gas storage wells. All safety review materials must be posted online by the division. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2021, unless extended or deleted by a later statute. The Public Utilities Code will open a proceeding to determine the feasibility of reducing the use of the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility in Los Angeles while maintaining energy reliability. The commission will consult with relevant entities to make this determination by July 1, 2017. Section 715 is added to the Public Utilities Code, effective until January 1, 2021, and may be repealed or extended by a later statute enacted before that date. The commission will direct the operator of the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility to provide necessary information to determine the range of working gas needed for safety and reliability in the region and fair rates in California. This determination will be based on the best available data and incorporate information from recent studies by various commissions and utilities. The commission will publish a report within 30 days of the new act, detailing the necessary working gas range, natural gas production, well requirements, and availability of gas storage wells. The report will be made available on the commission's website for public feedback. The executive director, in consultation with the State Oil and Gas Supervisor, will direct the operator to maintain a specified range of working gas at the facility for reliability and reasonable rates in California, after completing safety reviews, approving reservoir pressure, allowing gas injections, and receiving public comments on the report. The executive director, in consultation with the State Oil and Gas Supervisor, sets the volume of working gas to maintain reservoir pressures within a specified range. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2021, unless extended or repealed by a later statute. No reimbursement is required for local agencies or school districts under this act. The act is an urgency statute to address the gas leak at the Aliso Canyon facility and evaluate gas storage well risks, going into immediate effect for public safety."
