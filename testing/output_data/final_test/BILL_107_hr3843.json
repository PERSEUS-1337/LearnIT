    "content": "The Act titled \"Federal Information Technology Workforce and Acquisition Improvement Act of 2002\" extends the program applying simplified procedures to certain commercial items until January 1, 2008. Additionally, a report on the effectiveness of the implementation of these provisions is required by December 31, 2004. Congress finds that there will be a crisis in the government's ability to deliver essential services to the American people unless action is taken soon. By 2006, over 50 percent of the Federal Government's information technology workforce will be eligible to retire, creating a high demand for skilled workers. Despite a decrease in demand for IT workers in the private sector, employers will need to fill over 900,000 new IT jobs by 2001. The General Accounting Office identified human capital management in the Federal Government as a high-risk problem in 2001. Despite efforts to increase flexibility in employment practices, compensation issues hinder recruitment. To address this crisis, a program is proposed to facilitate the exchange of talent, expertise, and management practices between businesses and Federal agencies. CHAPTER 37--INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EXCHANGE PROGRAM The text chunk provides definitions for the Information Technology Exchange Program, including the terms 'agency' and 'detail' related to the assignment of employees between government agencies and private sector organizations. Sec. 3702 of the Information Technology Exchange Program allows for the assignment of eligible employees between government agencies and private sector organizations, specifically those in information technology management who are exceptional performers and expected to take on more responsibilities in the future. Eligible employees must be at the GS-11 level or above. The Information Technology Exchange Program allows eligible employees at the GS-11 level or above to be assigned between government agencies and private sector organizations. Agencies must have a written agreement with the employee regarding the terms of the assignment, requiring them to serve in the civil service for a period equal to the length of the assignment. Failure to fulfill the agreement may result in liability to the United States for payment. The employee is responsible for all expenses (excluding salary) during the assignment, treated as a debt to the United States. Assignments can be terminated at any time. They are initially for 1 year and can be extended for another year. The Chief Information Officers Council may assist in administration, maintaining candidate lists, establishing mentoring relationships, and promoting the program. During an assignment to a private sector organization, an employee retains coverage, rights, and benefits under chapter 81. Any payments or benefits received from the private sector organization for the same injury or death will be credited against compensation under chapter 81. During an assignment to a private sector organization, an employee may be reimbursed for travel expenses and pay, with reimbursements credited to the agency's appropriation. Federal tort liability statutes apply to employees assigned to private sector organizations. An employee of a private sector organization assigned to an agency under this chapter is considered on detail to the agency, can still receive pay and benefits from the private sector organization, and is deemed an agency employee for specific purposes outlined in the text. The employee of a private sector organization assigned to an agency under this chapter is subject to regulations prescribed by the President and may be governed by an agreement between the agency and the private sector organization. The assignment may be made with or without reimbursement for the employee's pay. An employee of a private sector organization assigned to an agency under this chapter may receive pay or benefits for disability or death resulting from injury sustained during the assignment. Any payments or benefits from the private sector organization will be deducted from compensation under subchapter I of chapter 81. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management will establish regulations for this chapter, and any payments from a private sector organization for disability or death will be deducted from compensation under subchapter I of chapter 81. The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council will amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation to recognize allowable costs for an employee's participation in the Information Technology Exchange Program. This includes salary, fringe benefits, moving, and travel expenses, to be accounted for as indirect costs.

Authorization of telecommuting for federal contractors. Amendment to the Federal Acquisition Regulation allows telecommuting for federal contractors in contracts with executive agencies. The amendment prohibits requirements that make offerors ineligible or reduce scoring based on telecommuting plans. The contractor's plan for telecommuting must be approved by the contracting officer unless agency needs, including security, cannot be met without it. The Comptroller General will evaluate agency compliance with regulations and their alignment with existing law. The term \"executive agency\" is defined in this section as per section 105 of title 5, United States Code."
