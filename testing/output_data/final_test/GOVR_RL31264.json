    "content": "The role of ports in handling the Nation's imports and exports is increasing as trade policies boost the quantity of goods transported. The U.S. marine transportation system is expected to double by 2020, with ocean carriers using larger ships to accommodate growth. The Harbor Maintenance Tax funds routine maintenance of harbors, but legal challenges raise concerns about its future. Dredging requirements for harbor maintenance are projected to rise due to channel deepening. Recent developments in harbor maintenance legislation and funding, including the impact of container shipping trends on port dredging requirements, are discussed. Alternative funding proposals are considered, with a focus on the potential impact on U.S. maritime commerce. The decision on financing harbor dredging involves balancing national economic efficiency with local port development concerns. Clarification is provided on the distinction between harbor maintenance and deepening projects, which are funded separately. Harbor maintenance involves routine dredging of harbor channels funded through the HMTF, while harbor-deepening projects increase channel depth/width funded from U.S. Treasury general funds. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for both maintenance and deepening, while dredging harbor berths is the responsibility of state or local port authorities. The distinction between \"shipper\" and \"carrier\" in the transportation industry is important. The shipper is the owner of the cargo, while the carrier provides the transportation service. The shipper is liable for the Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) for cargo vessels, while the carrier is liable for passenger vessels. Prior to 1986, U.S. Treasury funds were used for harbor maintenance, but cost-share requirements were enacted in 1986. The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) was established in 1986 at 0.04% of cargo value to fund O&M costs for federally-maintained ports. In 1990, it was increased to 0.125% to cover 100% of the Corps' port O&M expenditures. The U.S. Supreme Court later ruled the HMT unconstitutional for exports. The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) was established in 1986 to fund O&M costs for federally-maintained ports. It was later increased in 1990 to cover 100% of the Corps' port O&M expenditures. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled the HMT unconstitutional for exports, but it is considered constitutional for domestic shipments and cruise line passengers. Litigation is ongoing regarding the constitutionality of the HMT on imports, with the European Union viewing it as a discriminatory import tariff violating U.S. obligations under the WTO. The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) revenue comes from domestic cargo (11%), foreign trade zone cargo (8%), and cruise ship passengers (1%). The European Union requested WTO consultations in February 1998, with negotiations in March and June 1998. If satisfactory legislation was not passed by January 1, 2000, a dispute resolution panel would be requested. The HMTF balance was $1.85 billion at the end of FY2002, with uncertainty about its future due to legal challenges. The Harbor Maintenance Tax Fund balance increased in FY 1999 due to the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act. The fund, along with revenue from HMT collections and interest payments, is sufficient for future expenditures. However, legal and trade challenges could impact incoming revenue, potentially depleting the fund. Policymakers may need to decide on federal funding for harbor maintenance and develop a mechanism for it. Several channel deepening projects are in progress, raising concerns about future maintenance. The completion of current and future deepening projects will likely increase harbor maintenance costs in the near term. After justified deepening work, maintenance dredging requirements will initially rise until the deeper channels stabilize. Long-term impacts on maintenance dredging are uncertain due to various factors affecting sediment movement. The port industry cites U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' figures showing a steady increase in total expenditures for dredging from $370 million in 1990 to $684 million in 1999, despite a decrease in the volume of material dredged. Ports face challenges with disposal sites and options for contaminated sediments in environmentally sensitive areas. The volume of contaminated sediments has increased, possibly due to new testing requirements. Larger containerships are now driving current dredging activity, replacing deep draft colliers from the 1980s. Supertankers transfer cargo at sea and stay at sea for extended periods, while dry bulk vessels have also increased in size since World War II. In the container ship category, vessel sizes have been increasing since the 1990s, with no apparent limit. Larger ships with drafts of 45-50+ feet are replacing smaller vessels, allowing for the transportation of 2,000 to 3,000 additional containers and saving carriers an estimated $25 per container on voyage costs. This economic advantage is due to economies of scale, as ship costs do not increase as fast as capacity. The development of a double-stack train network in the early 1980s has also allowed for more efficient container transportation across the continent by rail. Container ships are expected to become more prevalent in the future, with 55% of general cargo currently being moved in containers. By 2010, it is projected that containerized market share will increase to 90%. Container ships require deeper access channels compared to bulk tankers due to differences in service patterns. Bulk tankers are chartered per voyage and have more flexibility with tidal actions, while container ships operate on a strict schedule and would be severely disrupted by tidal restrictions. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a user fee based on the value of service provided to a marine carrier would not violate the Constitution. The Clinton Administration proposed a Harbor Services User Fee (HSUF) in 1998, which would be placed on the carrier based on vessel capacity and frequency of port use. Revenues from the fee would fund routine maintenance and harbor-deepening projects. The proposal aimed to establish a link between revenue collection and services provided, in line with trade obligations. Critics noted that shifting the tax burden from shippers to shipowners could concentrate the burden, leading to political implications. Ports and carriers opposed using an industry-supported fund for federal contributions to deepening projects. Concerns were raised about the competitive disadvantage of U.S. ports with a user fee system, especially for bulk commodities. The European Union also expressed reservations about the proposal. The Clinton Administration's proposed fee was opposed by the European Union as an unfair trade practice. The 106th Congress did not pursue the proposal or other alternatives, such as funding maintenance and dredging from general revenues. Supporters of H.R. 1260 argued that general revenues were the only equitable option, citing heavy taxation on waterborne trade by federal agencies. Some suggested using a portion of U.S. Customs' annual $20 billion revenue from the maritime industry for harbor maintenance. The Supreme Court decision addressed the issue of funding harbor maintenance, stating that exporters should contribute fairly based on their use of port services. Policy questions include whether port users or taxpayers should pay for dredging, and if port users should pay, which users specifically. The debate also involves whether the federal government or local port authorities should administer the fee. The debate over funding harbor maintenance involves questions about who should administer the fee, whether it should be nationally uniform or port-specific, and the cost-sharing arrangement between federal and non-federal sources. Economic analysis can guide financing options, but ultimately, these decisions are political choices that require compromises. Maintaining the status quo is one option for funding harbor dredging. The debate over funding harbor maintenance involves questions about who should administer the fee and the cost-sharing arrangement between federal and non-federal sources. Some argue for maintaining the status quo of funding through a cargo-value-based tax, while others believe the system is broken and needs to be overhauled. Some argue that the Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) should be restructured to have both exporters and importers pay the tax, as it is currently seen as unfair that importers bear the burden. There are concerns about the legal and trade challenges to the HMT, leading some to suggest a user fee system that could promote better use of the nation's marine transportation system. Advocates propose a port-specific, carrier-based fee system to optimize transportation efficiency by allowing market forces to allocate cargo to the most efficient ports. The argument for restructuring the Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) funding scheme is that it currently favors larger ships due to externalized dredging costs. By internalizing these costs through a carrier-based fee based on ship size, ship investment decisions would more accurately reflect the true cost of bigger ships. Taxpayers argue that financing deeper channels only benefits foreign container carriers by subsidizing dredging costs, leading to inefficient ports attracting more traffic and raising overall transportation costs. They suggest allowing naturally deep harbors to reflect lower dredging costs in their rate structure to attract carriers. This would create a more efficient system by directing traffic to ports with lower dredging requirements. Coast and Gulf Coast ports require more dredging than West Coast ports due to shallower channels. Ports heavily skewed toward imports contribute more to the Harbor Maintenance Trust fund. Some argue for eliminating cross-subsidies among ports by reserving funds for local dredging needs. Others defend cross-subsidies, comparing it to the Highway Trust Fund's redistribution of gas tax monies. The Transportation Research Board report argues against using the highway program as a model for seaport development. It states that cross-subsidies based on scale economies do not apply to ports like they do to highways. Seaports do not form a network like highways, so revenues from high-volume ports should not be used to subsidize low-volume ports. Supporters advocate for a carrier-based, port-specific user fee system. Supporters of a carrier-based, port-specific user fee believe in market competition among ports based on factors like population base, intermodal connections, and labor costs. The development of a double-stack train network has increased competition between ports, especially for discretionary cargo. Port rationalization by liner carriers has also intensified competition. The competitive climate suggests that the market can adequately regulate port costs. Some believe ports should invest in dredging without federal involvement due to competitive climate. Advocates suggest a port-specific, carrier-based fee for adequate harbor depths and to prevent excess dredging. However, this fee raises distributional issues as harbor communities see ports as economic engines. Ports create jobs offsite through various businesses and attract importers/exporters for cost savings. Large ports near a port to save on shipping costs may benefit from a port-specific funding system, potentially disadvantaging smaller ports. Economic development is a key policy goal for ports, dating back to the late 1800s when port authorities were created to counter private railroad control over marine terminals. Railroads consolidated investments at selected ports, leaving others with neglected harbor facilities. The creation of a central public authority was driven by dissatisfaction with railroad control over local port development. This mirrors the current trend in the maritime industry of concentrating cargo flow through fewer ports, resembling a \"hub and spoke\" system. As carriers deploy larger ships for economies of scale, fewer ports are being called, leading to a potential shift towards a market-oriented selection process for large ports and feeder ports. A port-specific funding scheme may further accelerate this trend. The debate over harbor maintenance funding involves a trade-off between national economic efficiency and local interests of harbor communities. The issue revolves around how funding affects U.S. maritime commerce and competition with ports in Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean. U.S. ports near borders claim the current funding mechanism diverts cargo to nearby ports. The DOT's annual report on U.S. cargo transhipped through Canada shows that 4% to 6% of U.S. liner trade has been transhipped through Canadian ports since the late 1980s. Cargo diversion to Canadian ports may be influenced by factors such as economic considerations, routing preferences, and logistical advantages. Some argue that routing cargo through Canadian ports may benefit the nation as a whole and U.S. shippers, especially for certain U.S. cities. A carrier-based fee could impact cargo flow through domestic ports differently than a cargo-value-based tax. A carrier-based fee based on vessel size could lead carriers to divert their largest ships to foreign ports like Vancouver, Halifax, or Freeport to save on harbor user fees. Transhipping cargo from large ships to smaller vessels at these ports could reduce the need for deeper channels at U.S. ports. Carriers argue that the fee could significantly influence their port rotation decisions, but there are additional cost considerations that may limit transshipments. The cost of load and discharge handling at an additional port is significant, potentially limiting transshipments and increasing transit time. Regardless of how a dredging fee is levied, import consumers and export producers are the ultimate payers. Shippers' preferences for a tax based on cargo tonnage or value depend on the type of commodities they transport. Shippers may prefer a tax based on cargo value over tonnage. Shifting the user fee to shipowners could concentrate the tax, influencing decision-making. Political dynamics and port preferences vary based on volume and dredging costs. Ports argue that they are a vital component of the nation's economy, advocating for general revenues to finance maintenance and improvement. The maritime industry is concerned about the surplus from the Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) and believes that shipping, as a mature industry, should be self-supporting. Critics argue that relying on general revenues for harbor dredging amounts to a corporate subsidy and leads to overcapacity in port facilities. Critics argue that overcapacity in port facilities due to strong demand for channel deepening puts downward pressure on port revenues, leading to unhealthy port facilities requiring more public assistance. Some analysts suggest that not every port needs to become a super-port and advocate for greater market discipline in examining investment risk in port infrastructure. They believe the federal government should increase its investment in harbor dredging by revising the cost-share formula to decrease non-federal costs for deepening projects. The Water Resources Development Act of 2003 (H.R. 2557, sec. 2003) would decrease the non-federal cost-share for deepening projects from 60% to 35% and for maintenance projects with harbor depths between 45 feet and 53 feet from 50% to 0%. This change in cost-share arrangements was authorized by the Act, reflecting the evolving trends in vessel sizes and transportation methods. The Panama Canal's limitations were reduced, leading carriers to use \"post-Panamax\" ships. Opponents argue that reducing the local cost share could impact port efficiency and hinder natural cargo allocation processes. Coastal shipping advocates suggest using barges or ferries to alleviate highway congestion. Some believe a fee system for coastal shipping is an impediment as it raises prices relative to truck and rail alternatives. Others argue that charging port users for harbor infrastructure promotes equity among competing modes and reduces price distortions in modal choice."
