    "content": "A \"lame duck\" session of Congress occurs after the election but before the end of the current Congress's term. Participants are from the existing Congress, not the new one. The term originates from 18th century Britain, referring to vulnerable businessmen. In American usage, a \"lame duck\" refers to officeholders with a known termination date, such as a President or Members of Congress not seeking reelection. After an election, all Members who did not gain reelection are considered lame ducks until the new Congress starts. A post-election session of the previously sitting Congress is also called a lame duck session. A lame duck session of Congress began in 1935 with the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution. These sessions occur after election day but before January 3 of odd-numbered years. There have been 19 lame duck sessions from 1935 to 2012. The most recent one was at the end of the 112th Congress in 2012. This report focuses on specific lame duck sessions since 1935. The Constitution originally set the start of Congress sessions in December, but later changed to March 4 of odd-numbered years. Congressional elections were held in November of even-numbered years, causing a delay in the start of a new Congress. This resulted in sessions continuing until the summer of the following even-numbered year. The Twentieth Amendment aimed to eliminate lame duck sessions by changing the timing of Congress sessions. Previously, sessions started in December, causing delays due to elections in November. The new amendment shifted sessions to begin in March of odd-numbered years to avoid lame duck sessions. Under the Twentieth Amendment, lame duck sessions can still occur, but only as a result of specific actions undertaken either by the Congress already sitting or by the President. Lame duck sessions may occur through various means, such as pursuant to a previously enacted law, following a recess within a session spanning an election, under leadership authority during a contingent adjournment, by continuing to meet in pro forma sessions, or in response to a presidential proclamation. These methods illuminate the constitutional arrangements that allow for lame duck sessions and the conditions under which they operate. A session of Congress ends when Congress adjourns sine die, meaning it has adjourned without setting a day for its next meeting. This typically occurs in an election year, where Congress is not scheduled to meet again before the new Congress begins its term. The new Congress will then convene for its first session according to the Constitution or any relevant laws. The Constitution allows Congress to set its own adjournment date without the President's involvement, unless there is disagreement between the two houses. Congress can adjourn sine die through a concurrent resolution, which does not require the President's action. Prior to 1935, Congress would adjourn its session before the November elections, starting a new session in December. This \"lame duck session\" was a separate session of the same Congress. After 1935, Congress could create a lame duck session by adjourning sine die before an election and reconvening for a new session after the election. However, since the Twentieth Amendment, Congress has not utilized this method, opting instead to recess and reconvene within the constitutional term. Since 1935, Congress has used a recess to create a lame duck session, reconvening within the constitutional term. This method has been utilized 12 times, authorized through a concurrent resolution. Unlike a sine die adjournment, a session recess does not terminate the existing session but is technically an adjournment within a session. A lame duck session of Congress refers to any post-election meeting of the old Congress, which is a continuation of its existing session. This can occur through a recess within a session or an adjournment sine die after providing for a new session. Since the ratification of the Twentieth Amendment, Congress has commonly included contingent authority in resolutions for session recess or adjournment, allowing leadership to reconvene if necessary. However, despite the possibility of reconvening before or after an election, a lame duck session has not occurred in this manner. The Speaker of the House has used authority to reconvene the chamber in post-election sessions, known as lame duck sessions, in 1998 and 2008. No lame duck session of the Senate has been reconvened. In 2008, the Senate implemented its lame duck session through pro forma sessions. Another way a lame duck session can occur is if Congress continues to meet throughout the pre-election period and afterwards, with any post-election meetings considered a lame duck session. Each house typically convenes only on two or three days per week during this period. Pro forma sessions are held to satisfy the constitutional requirement that neither house adjourn for more than three consecutive days without consent. These sessions allow Members to remain in their constituencies during the campaign period. The Constitution does not require business to occur during pro forma sessions, only that the session itself takes place. Pro forma sessions are held to satisfy the constitutional requirement that neither house adjourn for more than three consecutive days without consent. These sessions allow Members to remain in their constituencies during the campaign period. There have been instances of pro forma sessions being used to extend election breaks, and a lame duck session could occur if the President calls for a special session of Congress. This has not happened since 1935. Congress begins. President Truman called Congress back for extraordinary sessions in 1947 and 1948, which did not constitute lame duck sessions. A President could also call an extraordinary session after an election, making the post-election meeting a lame duck session. No lame duck session has occurred since 1935. Since 1935, there have been 19 lame duck sessions of Congress. It is uncertain if the President can call Congress back during short recesses between pro forma sessions. Table 1 details the timing of pre-election and post-election sessions, including adjournment dates. The post-election session sine die details the actions taken by Congress during the election period, including recesses, pro forma sessions, and adjournments. Table 1 provides separate data for each house in cases of differing actions. The section presents generalizations about the occurrence, form, timing, and length of the 19 lame duck sessions since 1935. The discussion focuses on determining the mean and median starting dates, ending dates, and lengths of election breaks and lame duck sessions in Congress. It clarifies how to calculate these dates when Congress takes an election recess or reconvenes subject to call after a conditional adjournment. The text also highlights the challenges in identifying pro forma sessions during election breaks. The text discusses the challenges of distinguishing between pro forma sessions and regular sessions during election breaks in Congress to accurately calculate the length of breaks. The text discusses the challenges of identifying pro forma sessions in Congress during election breaks to accurately compare session lengths. It suggests counting a session as pro forma if there is no session on the preceding or following day. The approach to identifying pro forma sessions in Congress involves counting daily sessions as part of the regular schedule if another session of the same chamber occurs on the day before or after. This method simplifies the comparison of session lengths and addresses the challenges posed by different scheduling practices in Congress. Lame duck sessions were frequent in the years surrounding World War II, occurring in six of eight Congresses between 1940 and 1954. From 1956 through 1968, none occurred, with two in each of the next three decades. Beginning in 1994, lame duck sessions have been more common, happening in 9 of the last 10 Congresses. In 1954, only the Senate returned for a session to consider the censure of Senator Joseph McCarthy, and in 1998, only the House returned to consider the impeachment of President William J. Clinton. Between 1935 and 2012, the House and Senate have used various methods to provide for breaks before lame duck sessions, including recesses spanning the election, pro forma sessions, and contingent adjournments sine die. Different forms were used on four occasions, and a combination of recesses and pro forma sessions was used in four instances. A lame duck session can only occur if Congress adjourns sine die conditionally or if the President proclaims an extraordinary session. If Congress only recesses for the election, a lame duck session is certain to take place. Since 1935, recesses of both chambers before lame duck sessions have occurred in 11 instances (1944, 1948, 1950, 1970, 1974, 1980, 1982, 1994, 2000, 2004, and 2006). In some cases, only one chamber opted for a recess before the election, while the other engaged in pro forma sessions. In 5 out of 13 years, Congress authorized the recess without the authority to reconvene, while in the remaining 8 years, the authority was provided but not utilized. In 1954, the House adjourned sine die, allowing only the Senate to return for the censure of Senator McCarthy. Pro forma sessions were used during lame duck sessions in 1940, 1942, 2002, and 2012. The House and Senate used pro forma sessions in 2000, 2008, and 2010 before lame duck sessions. In 1944 and 2006, both chambers used pro forma sessions and recesses to extend the election break before the lame duck session. The House alone did so in 1950, and the Senate alone in 2000. The Senate has never convened in a lame duck session after a contingent adjournment sine die. In 1998, both chambers adjourned sine die with contingent reconvening authority, but only the House returned to address the impeachment of President Clinton. In 2008, the House was called back to address financial system dislocations while the Senate continued to meet in pro forma sessions. In 2008, the House and Senate used different methods for the election break before the lame duck session. The House recessed while the Senate continued to meet in pro forma sessions. Election breaks typically start in early to mid-October, allowing Members time to campaign in their constituencies. In recent years, election breaks have started relatively early, with the earliest break spanning an election occurring on August 7, 1948. This pattern has been especially common in years with a recess during the election break, with 7 out of 13 years having this occurrence. The break before the lame duck sessions from 1944 to 1954 also started early, with breaks beginning in September or even August. In recent years, election breaks have started early, with the earliest break occurring on August 7, 1948. The 112th Congress in 2012 departed early, with pro forma sessions starting in September. Lame duck sessions since 1998 have begun later than mid-October, with the 105th Congress adjourning on October 21 in 1998. During the 106th Congress, the election recess for the Senate started on November 2 and for the House on November 3, which was one of the latest breaks ever. Lame duck sessions typically convened in mid to late November, with most starting between November 12 and 30. This pattern was common in years when the lame duck session followed a recess, occurring in 9 out of 13 such years. During lame duck sessions, Congress reconvened after the election in November or December. In some cases, one house did not reconvene until December, with the latest date being December 31, 1948. Lame duck sessions tended to start earlier in years with pro forma sessions rather than recesses. The earliest reconvening of both houses occurred in 2002 on November 7. In 2002, the 97th Congress resumed consecutive sessions on November 7. Other early starts occurred in 1954, 1940, 1942, 1980, 2000, and 1944. The House and Senate reconvened on various dates in November after election breaks. The length of election breaks for each chamber is typically between one and two months, with only a few exceptions. Congress tends to return later after the election if they left later for the break, and vice versa. The two chambers usually follow similar schedules, except in years with pro forma sessions. The break duration between the House and Senate varied by more than four days due to the timing of consecutive sessions. In 1940, the House break was 16 days longer, in 1942 the Senate break was 6 days longer, and in 2000 the Senate break was 23 days longer. In years with only pro forma sessions, the shortest breaks occurred, with an average interval of 30 days in the House and 33 days in the Senate. In contrast, years with recesses or conditional adjournments had longer breaks, with an average of 49 days in the House and 59 days in the Senate. Specifically, in 1940 the Senate had a 22-day break (compared to 38 days in the House), in 1942 the House had a 12-day break (compared to 18 days in the Senate), and in 2002 both chambers had a 20-day break. In 2008, the Senate used pro forma sessions for a 42-day break, while the House reconvened after 46 days. The shortest break was in 2000, with the House returning after 9 days and the Senate after 32 days. The median length of election breaks is 44 days for the House and 42 days for the Senate. Excluding a long recess in 1948, the mean length of election breaks is 41 days for both chambers. In comparison to previous election breaks, the longest recesses for the House and Senate occurred in 1948, lasting 79 and 67 days respectively. Lame duck sessions typically adjourn around mid-December, with the average dates being December 20 for the House and December 19 for the Senate. Recent Congresses in 2008 and 2012 had late adjournments in early January. The House and Senate adjourned on various dates, with some sessions ending in early January and others in late November or December. Lame duck sessions typically last until mid-December, but there have been instances of early adjournments in November. The House and Senate adjourned on various dates, with some sessions ending in early January and others in late November or December. Lame duck sessions typically last until mid-December, but there have been instances of early adjournments in November. Lame duck sessions have typically lasted about a month, with the mean length of House sessions being 29 calendar days and the median 38 days, and the mean length of Senate sessions being 30 calendar days and the median 31 days. In most cases, both houses have followed similar schedules during lame duck sessions, with only two exceptions showing a significant difference in length between the two chambers. During the 106th Congress, the House adjourned after 37 days while the Senate adjourned after 11 days. Lame duck sessions between 1980 and 2006 were generally shorter than those before or after. Only two sessions from 1940 to 1980 were shorter than 30 days. During the 80th Congress in 1948, the Senate held a 25-day session to address the censure of Senator McCarthy. Lame duck sessions from 1982 to 2006 were generally shorter, with only one exceeding 27 days. However, more recent sessions in 2008, 2010, and 2012 showed a trend towards longer sessions. The longest lame duck session was during the 76th Congress, lasting from November 7, 1940, to January 3, 1941, with meetings every third day. The lame duck session in the 91st Congress in 1970 lasted for 48 calendar days, working on appropriations and President Nixon's legislative program. It was one of the longest lame duck sessions, with only a few others exceeding 38 days. In the 80th Congress, both houses returned briefly to close the session in 1948. The 103rd Congress met for a few days to implement the new GATT agreement in 1994. The House alone returned for two days in the 105th Congress to address President Clinton's impeachment in 1998. The Senate considered the McCarthy censure for 25 days in the 83rd Congress in 1954. Comparisons between lame duck sessions can be made using periods of consecutive sessions. In some Congresses, pro forma sessions were used to create breaks during lame duck sessions, including recesses for holidays. The activity of a lame duck session may be better measured by the number of actual daily sessions held after the election, rather than calendar days between convening and adjourning. This counting method includes all sessions held between election day and the end of the session. The pattern of lame duck sessions does not differ radically in terms of calendar days but shows less variation among years. In years with lame duck sessions, the House held an average of 15 sessions after the election, while the Senate held an average of 18 sessions. The sessions ranged from 5 to 24 days, with some shorter sessions focusing on limited agendas and longer sessions addressing fiscal and budgetary issues. In 2010 and 2012, lame duck sessions focused on fiscal and budgetary issues. These sessions were becoming routine, with the House meeting for an average of 17 days and the Senate for 27 days in the most recent sessions. The Senate used pro forma sessions to prevent recess appointments by President Bush. The 2008 session saw the House meet for 5 days and the Senate for 22 days. During the 2010 and 2012 lame duck sessions, Congress focused on fiscal and budgetary issues, with the House meeting for an average of 17 days and the Senate for 27 days. The 2008 session was brief, with the House meeting for 5 days and the Senate for 22 days. In contrast, the 2010 and 2012 sessions had more days in session due to negotiations over appropriations and revenue provisions. During lame duck sessions, Congress typically adjourns before Christmas and reconvenes before Thanksgiving. Pro forma sessions were common before 1950, but now both houses usually recess over the holidays. In 2008, the House recessed over Thanksgiving and Christmas, while the Senate held pro forma sessions to prevent recess appointments. In 2012, both chambers recessed for Thanksgiving but held pro forma sessions over Christmas. In 2012, both chambers recessed for Thanksgiving but engaged in pro forma sessions over the Christmas holiday. Summaries of 19 lame duck sessions held since 1935 were based on primary and secondary sources, including the Congressional Record, Congressional Directory, Congressional Quarterly Weekly Report, CQ Almanac, and the New York Times. President Franklin D. Roosevelt called Congress into an extraordinary session in September 1939 to address the threat of war in Europe, leading to the third session of the 76th Congress in January 1940 dominated by the international situation and the largest peacetime defense program in American history. During the longest session in history up to that point, Congress enacted a $13 billion defense program, military draft, tax revisions, and related measures. Despite calls to adjourn, Congress met regularly until January 3, 1941, with limited sessions per week. The lame duck period following the November 1940 elections saw little activity, with quorums often hard to raise. During the lame duck period of the 77th Congress, activities were impeded by the difficulty in raising quorums and the need for repairs in the Capitol chambers. Key actions included sustaining a veto on regulatory agency powers and publishing a report on sabotage of the defense effort. Congress remained in session continuously through the wartime year of 1942, adjourning on December 16. Meetings were held daily, except near the election when they met every third day. During the lame duck period of the 77th Congress, activities were affected by the upcoming 78th Congress with a narrowed Democratic majority. Key unresolved issues included national service legislation, income ceiling through tax code, regulatory agency powers, and censorship planning. Congress passed legislation for overtime pay adjustment and military draft for 18- and 19-year-old men. During the lame duck period of the 77th Congress, key unresolved issues included national service legislation, income ceiling through tax code, regulatory agency powers, and censorship planning. Congress passed legislation for military draft of 18- and 19-year-old men. Quorums became difficult to obtain by mid-December, leading to a recess until the start of the 78th Congress in January 1943. In 1944, Congress reconvened after the elections to address issues such as peacetime universal military training, extension of the War Powers Act, Social Security tax increase, and the reciprocal trade system.

Congress passed legislation for military draft of 18- and 19-year-old men. Quorums became difficult to obtain by mid-December, leading to a recess until the start of the 78th Congress in January 1943. In 1944, Congress reconvened after the elections to address issues such as peacetime universal military training, extension of the War Powers Act, Social Security tax increase, and the reciprocal trade system. Congress also debated congressional reform issues, restructuring the committee system, and increasing congressional pay. Postwar reconstruction and a renewal of domestic programs were mentioned as possible subjects for action. Ultimately, Congress deferred several issues until the start of the 79th Congress, including universal military training, the Bretton Woods monetary agreements, the Reciprocal Trade Act, and changes to the Social Security system. Several other measures could not be completed, including a rivers and harbors bill, a Senate-passed bill making major changes in congressional procedures, and a pay increase for postal workers. A bill delaying the Social Security tax increase was enacted, as were a renewal of the War Powers Act and a bill increasing the congressional clerk-hire allowance. In addition, the Senate confirmed.

A bill delaying the Social Security tax increase was enacted, as were a renewal of the War Powers Act and a bill increasing the congressional clerk-hire allowance. In addition, the Senate confirmed the nomination of Edward R. Stettinius as Secretary of State. Congress recessed in August 1948, before the national party conventions, with the intention of returning only on December 31 to bring the 80th Congress to a formal conclusion, unless earlier called back by congressional leaders. During the convention recess, however, President Harry S. Truman called Congress back in extraordinary session to deal with a series of legislative priorities he considered urgent. This occurrence represents the only time since the adoption of the Twentieth Amendment that the President has convened Congress in an extraordinary session. Congress met pursuant to this call from July 27 to August 7, but then recessed again under the same terms as before. The leadership did not exercise its option to reconvene Congress during this new recess, and Congress met again only on December 31. This session, the. During the shortest lame duck session under the Twentieth Amendment, Congress met for just under an hour and a half on December 31. Both chambers approved extending the life of the Hoover Commission and the Special Small Business Committee. New Members were sworn in, and the session adjourned sine die. The session was called after a recess that started on September 23, with the possibility of reconvening in late November. Chinese troops crossed into. During the lame duck session on November 27, Chinese troops crossed into Korea, prompting General Douglas A. MacArthur to warn Congress of a potential new war in the region. President Truman presented 18 proposals to Congress, including aid to Yugoslavia, defense appropriations, and statehood for Hawaii and Alaska. Congress stayed in session through the New Year, approving rent control extension and famine relief for Yugoslavia. During the lame duck session, Congress completed work on an $18 billion defense supplemental appropriations bill, an excess profits tax, and a civil defense program. Efforts for statehood for Alaska were abandoned after Senate debate. The 81st Congress adjourned on January 2, 1951, and the 82nd Congress convened the next day. The Senate reconvened on November 8 to consider censuring Senator Joseph R. McCarthy for improprieties in his investigations into communist influence. During the lame duck session, the Senate investigated Senator Joseph McCarthy's allegations, leading to a censure resolution submitted on November 9, 1954. The resolution was approved on December 1, and final action was completed the following day. The Senate adjourned finally on December 2 without considering other matters. During the lame duck session in 1970, Congress addressed pending legislation on electoral reform, welfare reform, occupational safety, equal rights for women, and other issues. Despite staying in session until January 2, 1971, many Administration proposals, including the Family Assistance Plan, were not approved. President Nixon criticized the \"major failures\" of the session. During the 1970 lame duck session, Congress completed work on two appropriations bills, foreign aid, and the Clean Air Act Amendments. President Nixon vetoed four measures, including a federal manpower training bill. Major legislation was delayed due to events like Watergate and Vice President Agnew's resignation. During the 1974 lame duck session, Congress reconvened to address a long list of important items, including the approval of Nelson A. Rockefeller as Vice President. President Ford presented a 10-page list of legislation he wanted passed before the session expired. Congress considered various issues and approved the Rockefeller nomination, despite overriding presidential vetoes on certain bills. During the 1974 lame duck session, Congress reconvened to address important items, including approving Nelson A. Rockefeller as Vice President. Congress also nullified a prior agreement giving former President Nixon control over his Administration's tapes and papers. Additionally, a trade reform bill was approved, granting the President broad authority in trade negotiations and import relief. Legislation for research on non-nuclear energy sources and continuing appropriations for federal agencies were also cleared. Postponing final congressional action on major issues until a post-election session was seen as a strategy to delay difficult pre-election votes on budget matters and allow extra time for campaigning. During the 1980 lame duck session, Congress completed action on important issues left unfinished in the regular session, including a budget resolution, appropriations bills, environmental legislation, and measures on nuclear waste disposal and chemical contamination cleanup. The session lasted from November 12 to December 16, 1980. During the second session of the 97th Congress in 1982, key measures included revenue sharing for three years, state responsibility for low-level nuclear waste disposal, changes to military pay and benefits, and authority for the President to call 100,000 military reservists to active duty without declaring a national emergency. President Reagan urged Congress to reconvene after the election due to budget and deficit issues, leading to political tension between the Republican President and Senate. The political tension between the Republican President and Senate, and the Democratic House during the second session of the 97th Congress in 1982 led to a contentious lame duck session. Congress struggled to complete money bills, resulting in the need for a large continuing resolution to fund government operations for FY1983. House Democrats proposed a $5.4 billion jobs program, but removed it after the President threatened a veto. The Senate faced frequent filibusters, including a heated debate over increasing the gasoline tax, which was approved shortly before Christmas. During a contentious lame duck session of the 97th Congress in 1982, Congress struggled to complete money bills and passed a large continuing resolution for FY1983. The House approved a controversial 15% pay raise for itself, while an immigration reform bill favored by the White House stalled due to opposition amendments. Congress denied funding for the production of MX intercontinental missiles but passed a nuclear waste disposal bill. In 1994, Congress reconvened to pass a bill implementing a new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). During a lame duck session, the House and Senate passed a bill on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) after facing opposition in the Senate. The House adjourned on November 29 and the Senate on December 1. In 1998, both chambers adjourned on October 21, with the House reconvening in December to consider impeaching President Clinton. During a lame duck session, the House and Senate passed a bill on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) after facing opposition in the Senate. The House adjourned on November 29 and the Senate on December 1. In 1998, both chambers adjourned on October 21, with the House reconvening in December to consider impeaching President Clinton. The House then adopted resolutions by votes of 228-206 and 221-212, appointed House managers for the Senate impeachment trial, and expressed support for military action in the Persian Gulf. Congress remained in session into early November, with a recess authorized until November 13 for the House and November 14 for the Senate. After reconvening, a short-term continuing resolution and the District of Columbia Appropriations Act were approved, followed by a further recess until December 5. During the lame duck session in December, Congress passed short-term continuing resolutions while negotiating final appropriations. The Senate recessed on December 11, agreeing to automatically pass the fourth resolution from the House. On December 15, both chambers completed FY2001 appropriations with an omnibus bill. Congress adjourned sine die with additional acts passed, including the Presidential Threat Protection Act and Intelligence Authorization Act. President Clinton pocket vetoed a bankruptcy reform measure sent by Congress. During the post-election period in 2002, Congress focused on passing appropriations bills and creating the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Senate passed a version of the DHS bill on November 19, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush on November 25. However, Congress was unable to resolve appropriations differences and passed a continuing resolution to fund the government at FY2002 levels through January 11, 2003. In November 2002, Congress funded the government at FY2002 levels through January 11, 2003. The Defense and Military Construction Appropriations bills were completed, along with other significant measures. The Senate adjourned on November 20 and the House on November 22. A lame duck session was necessary in 2004 due to unresolved appropriation bills and debt limit increase. No agreement was reached on consolidating intelligence activities under a new national director. During the post-election period in 2004, Congress passed an omnibus appropriations measure to adhere to spending caps. President Bush signed the bill on December 8. Efforts were made to increase the debt limit separately. The Administration pushed for modifications in provisions of the intelligence bill. During the post-election period in 2004, efforts were made to persuade House conferees on the intelligence bill to accept modifications in provisions to maintain military control over intelligence, keep funding confidential, and control immigration. The conference report cleared Congress on December 8 and was signed into law on December 17. Additionally, post-election conditions allowed for the resolution of deadlocks over reauthorizations such as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and authority for satellite television systems to carry network programming. Several other reauthorizations, including welfare reform and a highway bill, were doomed by policy disagreements. The 109th Congress reconvened in November 2006 to address appropriations bills, tax benefits, and a ban on assault weapons. Despite hopes for cooperation, the Congress did not achieve its goal of passing further appropriations measures. Democrats had gained control of both houses in the November election, leading to optimism for bi-partisanship. The 109th Congress focused on passing appropriations bills, tax benefit extensions, and other key legislation. This included funding the government through two continuing resolutions, tax benefit extensions for research and development, a trade package with benefits for undeveloped countries, and agreements with Vietnam. They also passed a bill allowing cooperation with India on nuclear power, an overhaul of the United States Postal Service, a Veterans' Affairs package, and confirmed Robert M. Gates as Secretary of Defense. The 110th Congress reconvened on November 6, 2008, after the elections that gave Democrats wider majorities in both the House and Senate. The Senate held pro forma sessions to prevent recess appointments by outgoing President George W. Bush. The House reconvened on November 19 but only met for five days during the post-election period. During the lame duck session, Congress focused on addressing financial system disruptions post-election. Legislation was considered to aid auto-making companies facing bankruptcy, with the House passing a bill for $14 billion in loans. However, Senate opposition blocked a vote, leading the President to provide $13.4 billion from the financial industry aid package. Another major measure was a pension bill that postponed pension funding rules. During the 2010 lame duck session, Congress focused on financial system disruptions post-election. A pension bill was passed to postpone employee pension funding rules and grant a moratorium on annual distributions for retirement accounts to prevent lay-offs and assist retirees. The House and Senate met for a total of 19 and 15 days of session, respectively, transacting business on all those days. The agenda for the 111th Congress lame duck session was much larger compared to the 110th Congress. During the 111th Congress lame duck session, significant legislation was enacted, including the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act, FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, and Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act. The session also saw the confirmation of 19 federal judges and negotiations on extending income tax cuts and other revenue provisions.
