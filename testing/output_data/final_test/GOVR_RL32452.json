    "content": "The development of negotiated rulemaking stemmed from dissatisfaction with the formal, complex, and adversarial nature of traditional rulemaking procedures. In 1982, Philip J. Harter advocated for a different approach where differences were resolved through face-to-face negotiations. The Administrative Conference of the United States also recommended agencies consider using negotiated rulemaking and provided criteria for its success. The Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) recommended specific procedures for implementing negotiated rulemaking, such as using \"conveners\" to assess appropriateness and identify affected interests. ACUS also suggested that Congress pass legislation authorizing agencies to use negotiated rulemaking with flexibility. Federal agencies like the FAA, EPA, and OSHA began using negotiated rulemaking in the 1980s, leading to refinements in procedures based on their experiences. ACUS emphasized agency participation in negotiations and highlighted the potential of negotiated rulemaking. The Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990, as amended and permanently authorized in 1996, enacted ACUS recommendations for using negotiated rulemaking in the rulemaking process. It supplements APA procedures, encourages agencies to use negotiated rulemaking, establishes public notice requirements, and clarifies compliance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990, as amended and permanently authorized in 1996, enacted ACUS recommendations for using negotiated rulemaking in the rulemaking process. The negotiating committee, composed of agency representatives and non-federal stakeholders, aims to reach agreement on proposed regulations to ease implementation and reduce litigation risks. President Clinton's Executive Order 12866 in 1993 directed federal agencies to increase their use of negotiated rulemaking. President Clinton issued Executive Order 12866 directing federal agencies to explore and use consensual mechanisms for developing regulations, including negotiated rulemaking. He also promoted greater use of negotiated rulemaking through memorandums in 1993 and 1998, designating the Regulatory Working Group to facilitate agency use of this approach. The Negotiated Rulemaking Act allows agencies to form committees to negotiate rules if it is in the public interest. The agency head must consider the need for a rule, the affected interests, the likelihood of reaching consensus, time constraints, resource availability, and commitment to using the committee's recommendations. The Negotiated Rulemaking Act allows agencies to establish committees to negotiate rules in the public interest. The agency must publish a notice in the Federal Register with details on the rule, affected interests, committee members, and a solicitation for comments. Membership on the committee is limited to 25 members. The agency can select an impartial \"facilitator\" to chair meetings and oversee the administration of the committee, with membership limited to 25 members. The facilitator does not have to be a federal employee, but agencies must ensure they have no conflicts of interest. Any agreement on a negotiated rule must be unanimous, and if the committee reaches consensus, it must submit a report to the sponsoring agency. However, the agency is not bound by the committee's proposal. The Negotiated Rulemaking Act allows agencies to establish committees with up to 25 members to craft proposed rules, with a facilitator overseeing the process. The agency may choose not to issue the proposed rule as designed by the committee, and interest groups involved may oppose the final rule. The committee dissolves upon the final rule's promulgation, and agencies can cover members' expenses. Judicial review is not applicable to procedural actions related to the committee, but it can be sought for the resulting rule. Congress can mandate the use of negotiated rulemaking in certain cases. The Negotiated Rulemaking Act allows agencies to establish committees with up to 25 members to craft proposed rules. Congress can mandate the use of negotiated rulemaking in certain cases, as seen in various legislative examples. The Negotiated Rulemaking Act allows agencies to establish committees to craft proposed rules. Section 1125(a)(5) of the No Child Left Behind Act required the Secretary of Education to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee for schools funded by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Section 106(b)(2) of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 mandated regulations to be issued through negotiated rulemaking procedures. The Negotiated Rulemaking Act mandates that negotiating committees consist of federal government representatives and geographically diverse Indian tribes. Various laws, such as the Native American Housing Assistance Act and Higher Education Amendments, require the use of negotiated rulemaking for issuing regulations unless impracticable or contrary to public interest. Several bills in the 110th Congress would require the use of negotiated rulemaking, such as the Indian Health Care Improvement Act Amendments of 2007 and 2008. Advocates believe negotiated rulemaking can reduce time and costs, lead to earlier implementation of rules, improve agency understanding of concerns, increase compliance rates, and result in more effective regulatory solutions. Negotiated rulemaking has advantages like creative regulatory solutions, less litigation, and cooperative relationships. However, it can be resource-intensive, ineffective for large groups, and used rarely for major rules. Some criticize it as giving too much power to private interests. Some critics argue that negotiated rulemaking gives too much power to private interests and undermines the principles of American administrative law. Negotiated rulemaking is viewed favorably by some, offering the public a direct role in the process. Studies have shown mixed results on its effectiveness, with some indicating it can reduce the time needed to develop rules. Critics argue it gives too much power to private interests. Negotiated rulemaking can improve participants' perception of the final rule and the overall rulemaking process, but it imposes substantial costs on participants. Studies have shown mixed results on its effectiveness, with some indicating it can reduce the time needed to develop rules. Researchers have differing opinions on how to measure the effectiveness of negotiated rulemaking, with a consensus that more research is needed to understand its impact on rules, the rulemaking process, and participants."
