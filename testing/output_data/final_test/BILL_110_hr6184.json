    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"America's Beautiful National Parks Quarter Dollar Coin Act of 2008\". The Congress finds that Yellowstone National Park was the first national park established in 1872. In 1890, several national sites were established, including Chickamauga and Chattanooga, Antietam, Sequoia, Rock Creek, General Grant, and Yosemite National Parks. Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th President of the United States, was known as the \"Conservationist President.\" He established Bird Reserves, Game Preserves, National Forests, the United States Forest Service, National Parks, and national monuments to address the destruction of wildlife habitats and overgrazing in the West. Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed 18 national monuments, protecting approximately 230,000,000 acres of land in the United States. He emphasized the importance of leaving a better land for future generations. The National Park Service was established in 1916 by President Woodrow Wilson, and the National Park System now includes 391 areas covering over 84,000,000 acres across various states and territories. The United States has various national sites under conservancy, including national parks, monuments, battlefields, and historic sites. There is also a provision for redesigning quarter dollars emblematic of national parks or other national sites in each state, the District of Columbia, and each territory. The redesign and issuance of quarter dollars emblematic of national sites in each state, the District of Columbia, and each territory began in 2010. The designs on the reverse side of the coins are selected to represent national sites in the United States, with flexibility in the placement of inscriptions. The redesign and issuance of quarter dollars emblematic of national sites in each state, the District of Columbia, and each territory began in 2010. The design on the reverse side of each quarter dollar issued during this period shall be emblematic of 1 national site in each State, with flexibility in the placement of inscriptions. The term 'State' has the same meaning as in section 3(a)(3) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior and state governors, selects a national park or site in each state to be honored with a coin based on natural or historic significance. The selection process must be completed within 270 days. Designs for quarter dollars must be selected by the Secretary within 270 days of the America's Beautiful National Parks Quarter Dollar Coin Act of 2008 enactment. The curr_chunk states that the decision on designs for quarter dollars must involve the Secretary of the Interior and the Commission of Fine Arts. The Secretary has the authority to review and approve site selections and designs for quarter dollars, following a selection and approval process. Participation in design may involve state officials, artists, engravers, and the general public. The Secretary must ensure that all designs are dignified and not frivolous or inappropriate. The quarter dollar coins issued under this subsection bearing designs of national sites shall be issued in the order in which the sites selected were first established as a national site, at a rate of 5 new designs each year. No portraits of living or dead persons, living person's portraits, or State outlines/maps are allowed on the reverse of any quarter dollar under this subsection. The Secretary of the Treasury determines the number of quarter dollar coins issued with each design annually. All coins minted under this subsection are considered numismatic items. The Secretary may mint and issue quarter dollars in uncirculated and proof qualities as deemed appropriate. Silver coins may be minted regardless of subsection (b). The Secretary may mint and issue silver quarter dollars with 90% silver content. The program will continue until a national site in each State is honored, with the option to extend for a second round. The Secretary will report to specific committees within 30 days after determining the design for the second national site in each State, the District of Columbia, and territories. The provisions for site and design selection, approval, and issuance will apply similarly to the initial issuance of the program. Upon completion of the coin program, the design on the obverse of the quarter dollar will revert to the image of President Washington that was in place before the program began. The program will continue until a second site in each state has been honored. The quarter dollar reverse will feature an image of General Washington crossing the Delaware River before the Battle of Trenton. A \"national site\" includes various locations supervised by federal agencies like the National Park Service or the United States Forest Service. The quarter dollar reverse will depict General Washington crossing the Delaware River before the Battle of Trenton. A \"national site\" includes locations supervised by federal agencies like the National Park Service or the United States Forest Service. If a territory becomes independent before quarter dollars are minted with its emblematic design, this subsection will no longer apply to that territory.
