    "content": "Violent crime by criminal organizations in Mexico has been a threat for over a decade, with a focus on drug trade routes and local markets. This has led to over 109,000 killings and 30,000 disappearances since December 2006. Organized crime violence in Mexico reached peak levels in the first quarter of 2017. U.S.-Mexican cooperation has increased through the M\u00e9rida Initiative, a partnership established by the George W. Bush Administration and Felipe Calder\u00f3n's government. Between FY2008 and FY2017, Congress appropriated over $2.8 billion for M\u00e9rida Initiative programs, with Mexico investing around $100 billion in security. President Pe\u00f1a Nieto aimed to reduce violence and adjust security efforts towards violence prevention. Mexico's operational approach, known as the kingpin strategy, targets top criminal leaders, criticized for fueling violence by sparking succession struggles and turf wars. The Pe\u00f1a Nieto Administration's struggles with resolving high-profile cases, protecting journalists and human rights defenders, and allegations of spying on reporters have raised international concerns. Congress is currently reviewing funding for the M\u00e9rida Initiative, with President Trump's FY2018 budget proposing a significant cut compared to previous levels. The report analyzes the progress of the M\u00e9rida Initiative, U.S. funds used for Mexico's police and judicial reform, and the alignment of U.S. programs with counterdrug efforts. It also addresses the need for support in opium poppy eradication due to the rise in heroin, fentanyl, and methamphetamine production in Mexico. The framework discusses security challenges, funding evolution, and policy issues for Congress to consider. The main policy issue facing Congress is the continued funding and oversight of the M\u00e9rida Initiative and U.S.-Mexican security cooperation. Mexico is a major supplier of heroin, methamphetamine, and marijuana to the U.S. market, as well as a transit country for cocaine and fentanyl. Methamphetamine seizures at the southwest border have increased significantly in recent years. The availability of Mexican-produced heroin in the United States has increased, with heroin seizures along the U.S.-Mexico border more than doubling from 2010 to 2015. Surging U.S. demand has led to higher opium cultivation and heroin production in Mexico, fueling drug trafficking-related violence. Mexican transnational criminal organizations, in alliance with U.S. gangs, dominate the U.S. drug market, with six major Mexican TCOs operating in the United States. Mexican TCOs, including the Sinaloa organization, have a strong presence in the United States, competing for control of drug routes and distribution networks. These criminal organizations are diversifying into activities like oil theft and human trafficking. Fuel theft has become a significant national security threat in Mexico, costing up to $1 billion annually and leading to violent conflicts. Organized crime-related homicides have been on the rise, with escalating violence in 2017. In 2017, there has been a significant increase in organized crime-related killings, with fragmentation and infighting among criminal groups intensifying. The rise of the CJNG cartel has led to succession battles within Sinaloa and emboldened other TCOs to challenge its dominance. President Pe\u00f1a Nieto initially focused on economic reforms but later emphasized violence reduction and respect for human rights in his security strategy. President Pe\u00f1a Nieto's security strategy focused on planning, prevention, protection of human rights, coordination, institutional reform, and monitoring. He implemented a national crime prevention plan, unified criminal procedures, and increased funding for transitioning to an accusatorial justice system. Efforts to target the Zetas were successful, but operations against the CJNG were not. Violence increased by 2014, with human rights abuses by security forces drawing international attention. President Pe\u00f1a Nieto's security strategy focused on planning, prevention, protection of human rights, and institutional reform. However, rising insecurity, social protests, and a lack of new strategies to address violence have raised significant concerns. The government's reactive approach of deploying federal forces instead of focusing on police reform has been criticized. Fiscal austerity has also impacted the justice sector, with reduced funding for intelligence collection and crime prevention. Despite criticism, the government has continued its approach. The Pe\u00f1a Nieto government has relied on the Mexican military for public security efforts, with debates ongoing about establishing a legal framework for military involvement. Human rights groups and academics advocate for transparency, accountability for military actions, and a transition to police involvement. The capture of \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n in 2014 was a highlight of the government's security strategy. The Pe\u00f1a Nieto government's \"kingpin\" strategy targeted top criminal figures, leading to the arrest or death of many. Critics argue that the strategy has caused turf battles and the rise of new crime groups. Some suggest focusing on dismantling the middle layer of criminal organizations. Federal interventions in states facing crime surges have not always resulted in sustained violence reduction and have led to human rights abuses. In Michoac\u00e1n, clashes between armed civilian groups and criminals prompted a federal intervention with mixed results in 2013. In 2013, federal intervention in Tamaulipas and Guerrero by Mexican military and federal police forces aimed to combat crime groups but yielded mixed results. Allegations of federal police involvement in disappearances and killings of students in Guerrero in 2014 raised concerns. Reports of human rights abuses by Mexican military and federal police in Tlatlaya and Michoac\u00e1n further highlighted the challenges faced in addressing violence in Mexico. In May 2017, Mexico launched an investigation after a video leaked showing a soldier killing a detained civilian. The Pe\u00f1a Nieto government allocated over $1.2 billion to support judicial reforms enacted in 2008, transitioning to an adversarial system in June 2016. Concerns remain about sustaining support for the system's success and ensuring transparency and impartiality. Significant work remains to ensure successful implementation of judicial reforms in Mexico, including training police to gather court-worthy evidence, capacity-building for justice sector actors, and monitoring the system. Civil society groups urge the selection of an independent leader for the new prosecutor general's office to replace the problematic attorney general's office. The new prosecutor general in Mexico will serve for nine years, longer than the presidential term. President Pe\u00f1a Nieto proposed 10 actions to improve the rule of law, including sending federal troops to Guerrero and enacting a law against torture. Other measures like legislation against enforced disappearances are still pending. Police reforms have been debated but not enacted. The federal police force has been accused of misconduct despite efforts to increase its size, training, and equipment. The federal police in Mexico have been accused of serious crimes despite efforts to increase their size, training, and equipment. There is support for a constitutional reform called unified command (mando \u00fanico) to centralize control of police forces at the state level. Vetting of police officers has increased, but many states still retain officers who failed exams. Protocols on the use of force have been implemented for federal police, with recommendations for similar protocols for all security forces in Mexico. President Pe\u00f1a Nieto launched a National Crime and Violence Prevention program upon taking office. Mexico's Pronapred program provided $485 million in subsidies for interventions in high-crime municipalities with social risk factors from 2013 to 2016. Criticized for lack of rigorous methodology, funding for Pronapred was not included in the 2017 budget. Experts hope states and municipalities will continue prevention efforts through public-private partnerships or other federal programs. Mexico maintains a prohibitionist drug policy with recent efforts to eradicate opium poppy and heroin. In recent years, Mexico has intensified efforts to combat drug production and trafficking, particularly targeting opium poppy, heroin, fentanyl, and methamphetamine labs with support from the United States. However, there have been changes in marijuana policy, with the government legalizing its medical use in 2017. Despite calls for further liberalization, public opinion remains divided on recreational marijuana use following a Supreme Court ruling in 2015. In December 2006, Felipe Calder\u00f3n became the Mexican president amidst rising drug-related violence. He sought U.S. assistance in combating organized crime, leading to the M\u00e9rida Initiative in October 2007, with a focus on shared responsibility between Mexico and the U.S. for addressing crime, corruption, drug demand, and illicit trafficking. Mexico received $36.7 million in U.S. antidrug aid in FY2007. The M\u00e9rida Initiative, established in 2007, aimed to address crime, corruption, drug demand, and illicit trafficking between Mexico and the U.S. U.S. assistance provided equipment worth $590.5 million to support Mexican federal security forces, focusing on counternarcotics, border security, counterterrorism, public security, law enforcement, and institution building. Congress withheld 15% of certain U.S. assistance until Mexico met human rights reporting requirements. Mexico has taken steps to meet human rights reporting requirements, with security forces subject to vetting under Leahy laws. The M\u00e9rida Initiative strategy was revised in 2011 to focus on institution building, economic development, and community-based programs. Funding for building the rule of law and protecting human rights has exceeded assistance for other pillars since FY2011. Cooperation intensified from 2013 to 2016, with commitments reaffirmed by Presidents Obama and Pe\u00f1a Nieto. During President Obama's trip to Mexico, the U.S. and Mexican governments reaffirmed their commitments to the M\u00e9rida Initiative's four-pillar strategy. The fifth Security Cooperation Group meeting in November 2016 focused on justice sector reform, money laundering, police professionalization, border security, and addressing root causes of violence. The Trump Administration has proposed a more narrow, security-focused approach with less foreign assistance. The Trump Administration has proposed a security-focused approach with less foreign assistance in partnering with Mexico to disrupt criminal organizations. Congress has appropriated nearly $2.8 billion for Mexico under the M\u00e9rida Initiative from FY2008 to FY2017. Congress has provided funding for Mexico under the M\u00e9rida Initiative, with a decline in foreign military financing from FY2011 onwards. Human rights conditions have been placed on assistance to combat abuses and impunity, with reprogramming of funds in FY2014 due to concerns. No human rights conditions were placed on M\u00e9rida Initiative accounts in FY2017. In FY2017, there are no human rights conditions on M\u00e9rida Initiative accounts in the Consolidated Appropriations Act. Congress has shown bipartisan support for sustaining funding for the initiative, with $139 million provided in the 2017 Act, exceeding the Obama Administration's request by $10 million. The International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INCLE) funds provided for the M\u00e9rida Initiative are aimed at combating organized crime, reducing corruption, increasing border security, and reducing the flow of illicit narcotics into the United States. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget request suggests a reduction in U.S. assistance to Mexico for a more security-oriented strategy. Congress is likely to support the $85 million requested for the M\u00e9rida Initiative in FY2018, a decrease from previous funding levels. Congress is likely to set its own level of funding for the M\u00e9rida program in Mexico, which aims to address violence, corruption, and human rights abuses. Deliveries of equipment and training accelerated in 2011, with over $500 million worth provided. By the end of President Calder\u00f3n's term in 2012, $1.1 billion in assistance had been given, including aircraft and inspection equipment. Implementation delays in 2013 were mainly due to the transition to the Pe\u00f1a Nieto administration. In 2013, delays in implementing the M\u00e9rida Initiative were due to the Pe\u00f1a Nieto government developing its security strategy and processing requests for funds. By November 2013, a new process was agreed upon, leading to over 100 new projects with deliveries totaling $1.6 billion by March 2017. U.S. assistance focused on strengthening Mexican institutions through training for customs, corrections, canine teams, and police. U.S. assistance under the M\u00e9rida Initiative focused on training customs personnel, corrections staff, canine teams, and police in Mexico. The training included a \"train the trainer\" model to build capacity within Mexican institutions. Equipment worth $590.5 million, including aircraft, helicopters, and forensic equipment, was provided to support federal security forces. Nonintrusive inspection equipment and 400 canine teams were also funded to help Mexican forces combat transnational criminal organizations. Mexico has received equipment worth over $125 million and 400 canine teams to help combat illicit drug, weapon, and money flows. There is a rise in opium cultivation and heroin production due to increased U.S. opioid demand. Efforts are being made to improve Mexico's crop eradication, detect and destroy drug labs, and schedule fentanyl and precursor chemicals. The focus is also on disrupting criminal proceeds used to finance drug trafficking operations. In 2010, Mexico imposed limits on U.S. dollar exchanges to combat drug trafficking. In October 2012, Mexico approved an anti-money laundering law establishing a financial crimes unit and imposing new reporting requirements on industries vulnerable to money laundering. Despite efforts, Mexico struggles with prosecuting money-laundering offenses. M\u00e9rida assistance has provided $22 million in equipment and training to the financial intelligence unit to analyze suspicious transactions. Drug trafficking organizations have evolved into poly-criminal organizations. Trafficking organizations have evolved into poly-criminal organizations due to interdiction efforts and border security impacting their profits. Progress has been made in combating human trafficking, with increased data gathering and cross-border cooperation. Analysts suggest focusing on combating other organized crimes like kidnapping and human smuggling. Cross-border law enforcement operations and partnerships between the U.S. and Mexican governments are recommended for increased cooperation. U.S.-Mexican law enforcement partnerships, including participation in initiatives like the Border Enforcement Security Task Force (BEST), already exist. In September 2015, ICE launched a Transnational Criminal Investigative Unit with Mexican federal police to combat alien smuggling and human trafficking. The U.S. and Mexican governments collaborate on intelligence-sharing efforts, use drones for information gathering, and support joint intelligence task forces. A $75 million M\u00e9rida program aims to develop a biometrics system for agencies to collect and store data. Mexico has developed an automated biometrics system to collect, store, and share information on criminals and migrants. A $13 million telecommunications system funded by the M\u00e9rida Initiative facilitates cross-border information-sharing among law enforcement along the U.S.-Mexican border. Additionally, a $75 million telecommunications project is underway to improve secure communication capabilities among Mexican agencies in eight southern states. The country receives over $100 million in U.S. equipment and training to secure its southern borders with Guatemala and Belize, leading to a need for regional partnerships. Mexico's law enforcement and judicial institutions are overwhelmed by violence and criminality, with high impunity rates. Mexico faces challenges with high impunity rates, particularly in homicide cases. Experts emphasize the need for judicial reforms and tackling corruption in government. Human rights abuses by authorities and the lack of accountability are also major concerns. The police are adapting to the new adversarial justice system, which requires better investigation techniques and testimony in court. Corruption, abuse of power, and reliance on confessions rather than forensic evidence are ongoing issues. The Calder\u00f3n Administration in Mexico implemented reforms to improve police effectiveness, including increasing budgets, raising standards, and enhancing training and equipment. They also established a national database for information sharing and accelerated the implementation of a national police registry. Two laws in 2009 created federal police forces with investigative functions. These efforts were supported by the M\u00e9rida Initiative. The Pe\u00f1a Nieto government has reformed the federal police and the SSP, creating a new gendarmerie and investigative agency. State and local police reform lags behind federal efforts, with vetting and certification procedures established for them. Federal subsidies support units meeting standards, with $24 million in U.S. assistance for equipment and training. The U.S. is aiding Mexican police institutions in implementing codified standards, vetting law enforcement, and centralizing personnel records. Many municipal and state police officers have failed vetting exams. Some Mexican states have not met requirements under the 2009 law. The debate over unified state police commands continues, with a failed constitutional reform proposal by the Calder\u00f3n government. The Calder\u00f3n government proposed unified state police commands, supported by President Pe\u00f1a Nieto and Mexico's interior minister. Despite calls for constitutional adoption, the Mexican Congress has not legislated on the matter. U.S. initiatives through M\u00e9rida funding have provided training for state and local police in various areas to improve law enforcement capabilities. The State Department trained preventive and investigative police in the new accusatorial justice system. Analysts suggest supporting civil society and NGOs to monitor police conduct. Citizen participation councils, internal controls, and citizen observatories can improve police performance and relations with the community in Mexico. The Mexican judicial system is criticized for being opaque, inefficient, and corrupt, with long case backlogs and a high pretrial detention rate. Drug trafficking-related arrests often do not result in successful prosecutions, and high-profile cases involving politicians collaborating with organized crime face challenges in securing charges. Mexican prisons, especially at the state level, require significant reforms due to an increase in arrests leading to prison population growth and the use of preventive detention without access to legal counsel for suspects of organized crime. The practice of \"arraigo\" in Mexico allows for precharge detention without access to legal counsel for up to 40 days, with a possible extension of another 40 days. This has led to serious abuses by authorities, although its usage has decreased by 90% in 2015 compared to 2012. Many inmates are awaiting trials rather than serving sentences, contributing to overcrowding in prisons. The country's prisons are at 25% over capacity, with prison breaks and riots being common. INL has provided assistance to reform federal and state penitentiary systems. Mexico has made significant reforms to its justice system, including replacing trial procedures with a public trial system. President Pe\u00f1a Nieto has allocated resources to support these efforts, including passing a unified code of criminal procedure in 2014. Over 42 prisons have received accreditation from the American Correctional Association since 2008. The Mexican government has made reforms to its justice system, including implementing a public trial system. Resources have been allocated for building new courtrooms, retraining legal professionals, and updating forensic technology. The State Department has equipped courtrooms with recording equipment, and the Department of Justice has provided technical assistance for judicial reform at the federal level. The PGR in Mexico is transitioning its personnel to the accusatorial system with the help of Diamante-certified instructors. OPDAT is providing specialized training programs for prosecutors in various cases. USAID is implementing a rule of law program in all Mexican states and the Federal District. Activities under the USAID rule of law program in Mexico aim to support the transition to the new criminal justice system by providing technical assistance, strengthening the legal framework, improving prosecutor and judicial capacity, raising public awareness, enhancing analytical capacity in justice sector institutions, and supporting victims' assistance. Progress has led to a decrease in pretrial detention rates in some states by 25% or more and increased use of alternative dispute resolution, freeing up resources for courts. The U.S. Congress supports continued U.S. assistance for judicial reform efforts in Mexico. Congress may consider funding allocation, coordination of support for key justice elements, monitoring of the new criminal justice system in Mexico, and measuring the effectiveness of U.S. programs. DHS CBP secures the border while facilitating legal flow of people and trade through U.S. ports of entry. CBP uses trusted trader programs like C-TPAT and FAST to manage risks at land ports of entry for commercial trade. U.S.-Mexican trade has increased since NAFTA, but investments in port infrastructure and customs staffing have been lacking until recently. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, there have been concerns about delays and unpredictable wait times at the U.S.-Mexican border. Recommendations have been made to improve U.S.-Mexican commerce, including enhanced trusted trader programs, faster throughput, and expanded port infrastructure. Collaboration between the United States and Mexico has been declared to enhance the border as part of the M\u00e9rida Initiative. The Twenty-First Century Border Bilateral Executive Steering Committee (ESC) has been meeting regularly to develop binational action plans focused on infrastructure, secure flows of goods and people, and security and law enforcement. Efforts have led to new facilities and programs such as the Cargo Pre-Inspection Program, aimed at minimizing double inspections of shipments. Mexico's 2015 law allows U.S. officials to bear arms in Mexico to enhance border security efforts. Concerns include southbound inspections to combat the illicit drug trade. Questions arise about the division of responsibility for northbound and southbound inspections to prevent illegal goods from crossing the border. The United States has implemented measures to enhance outbound/southbound screening procedures, including screening 100% of southbound rail shipments for illegal items and using automated license plate readers along the southwest border. CBP also utilizes nonintrusive inspection systems to aid in processing travelers and shipments. As part of the M\u00e9rida Initiative, CBP has helped establish a Mexican Customs training academy to support their role in performing inbound inspections. CBP is assisting Mexican Customs in developing training programs and providing canines for inspections. Mexico has increased investments in manpower and technology for southbound inspections, but large seizures have not been reported. Policymakers may need to address corruption among U.S. and Mexican border officials. Data shows CBP personnel stationed along the southwest border have been arrested for corruption-related activities. CBP has taken steps to increase transparency on personnel misconduct, including releasing a report with recommendations. The FBI and DHS have launched a campaign to raise awareness about border corruption. Congress may need to address corruption among border enforcement personnel funded by the M\u00e9rida Initiative. The Mexican government, with U.S. support, has implemented a security plan for its southern borders with Guatemala and Belize since 2013. This plan includes naval bases, security cordons, and increased enforcement efforts by the National Institute of Migration agents. The U.S. has praised Mexico's efforts in increasing immigration enforcement along migrant routes, providing $24 million in equipment and training assistance. However, human rights groups criticize Mexico for abuses against migrants and lack of access to humanitarian visas. The State Department has also obligated over $75 million in assistance and the Department of Defense has provided training and equipment to Mexican military forces. Observers recommend U.S. support for investigating and punishing crimes against migrants, conducting humanitarian screening, and assisting Mexico's asylum agency. Increased U.S. funding has been devoted to the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights to assist in humanitarian screening and support for Mexico's asylum agency. This pillar focuses on addressing the underlying causes of crime and violence, promoting security and social development, and building communities that can withstand the pressures of crime and violence. Pillar four involves Mexican and U.S. federal officials working together to design and implement community-based programs in high-crime areas, empowering local leaders and civil society representatives to lead crime prevention efforts. The U.S. and Mexican governments approved a binational strategy in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua in 2011 to strengthen civic planning capacity, support state and local governments in crime prevention, and engage with at-risk youth. U.S. funding for pillar four activities in Mexico exceeds $100 million, with USAID dedicating $90 million for crime and violence prevention programs. Funding is directed towards helping the federal government design prevention programs and developing best practices. The government in Mexico has implemented prevention programs in cities like Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Monterrey, and Tijuana, focusing on strategies like outreach to at-risk youth and citizen-police collaboration. These programs have successfully reached 35,000 at-risk youth, with 70% finding internships, jobs, or returning to school within six months. USAID has also provided grants to civil society organizations for innovative crime prevention projects, with plans to expand successful initiatives to other cities. The National Crime and Violence Prevention Program in Mexico has been defunded for 2017, raising concerns about federal support for prevention programs in states. The State Department is supporting drug demand reduction, lawfulness programs, and accountability efforts. U.S. assistance has helped train drug counselors, conduct research, and expand drug treatment courts in Mexico. The U.S. has supported drug treatment courts and anti-drug coalitions in Mexico, as well as culture of lawfulness education in schools. Assistance has also helped establish citizens' watch booths in district attorney's offices. Analysts debate how to evaluate the impact of the M\u00e9rida Initiative, with the effectiveness depending on defined goals. The U.S. and Mexican governments' goals for the M\u00e9rida Initiative may differ in the short term, with Mexico focusing on reducing drug-related crime and violence, while the U.S. emphasizes capturing TCO leaders and seizing illicit drugs. The GAO has urged outcome-based measures for U.S. agencies in Mexico, rather than just output measures like the number of police trained. The State Department has developed indicators to measure the effectiveness of M\u00e9rida Initiative programming in Mexico, including output, outcome, and crime perception variables. These indicators have been accepted by both governments and aim to assess the impact of training on police performance. Successes include cooperation leading to the capture of top criminal leaders like \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n. Mexico has made progress in capturing top criminal leaders like \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n, transitioning to an accusatorial justice system, improving infrastructure in correctional facilities, and apprehending thousands of migrants. However, the country still faces security challenges, with criticism towards the government's security policy failures, human rights record, corruption in the justice system, and reliance on military forces for public security functions. Mexico's attorney general's office has struggled to solve high-profile cases, such as the abduction and killing of 43 students in Ayotzinapa in 2014. There are allegations of the government using Israeli spyware to surveil critics. Critics question the effectiveness of U.S. security programs compared to Mexico's large security budget. Mexico's security budget exceeded $15 billion in 2016, with $139 million in U.S. assistance for the M\u00e9rida Initiative. Extraditions to the U.S. were seen as a success indicator during the Calder\u00f3n government. During the Calder\u00f3n government, Mexico significantly increased extraditions to the United States, with over 100 individuals extradited annually. Under President Pe\u00f1a Nieto, extraditions initially dropped to 54 in 2013 but rose to 79 in 2016. The extradition of \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n in 2017 marked a shift in Mexico's willingness to approve U.S. extradition requests, following his escape and recapture. The United States may increase pressure on Mexico for extraditions due to concerns about security and corruption in its criminal justice system. Mexico is a major producer of opium poppy, methamphetamine, and cannabis. Opium production has surged while cannabis production has fallen. Mexican poppy cultivation was reported at 32,000 hectares in 2016. Methamphetamine production continues despite Mexican government efforts to restrict precursor chemicals. The Mexican government has increased eradication efforts of drug crops, particularly poppy, with 14,000 hectares eradicated from January to May 2016. Discussions have been held with the US and Canada on enhancing cooperation to combat heroin production and trafficking. The Mexican government has not traditionally supported alternative development in drug-producing regions, where few job opportunities exist. Alternative development programs aim to incentivize farmers to stop cultivating drug crops and switch to other crops or employment options. It takes time to see results from these programs and requires a long-term commitment to rural development. While Mexico prioritizes arresting drug kingpins, there is now a focus on increasing drug seizures with support from the State Department for interdiction efforts at borders and ports. Mexico has increased seizures of methamphetamine and cocaine at its borders and ports of entry, with a 74% and 183% increase respectively. Mexican authorities seized 272 clandestine laboratories in 2014-2015, up 90% from the previous year. The Mexican marines have taken control of the country's ports to intercept precursor chemicals. Mexico's human rights record has been criticized for unlawful killings, torture, and enforced disappearances by security forces. Enforced disappearances by security forces are a major human rights issue in Mexico, with many crimes going unpunished due to corruption and impunity in the justice system. President Pe\u00f1a Nieto initially showed support for human rights but has faced criticism for the handling of high-profile cases. Military and police officials have not been held accountable for past abuses. Mexico revised its military justice code in 2014 to comply with international rulings. Mexico revised its military justice code to comply with international rulings, allowing civilian courts to try cases of military abuses against civilians. Civilian courts have started holding military officials accountable for past abuses, with several convictions since 2015. Despite efforts to protect vulnerable groups like journalists, Mexico remains one of the most dangerous countries for journalists, with seven killed in 2017, including Javier Valdez. Since 2017, seven journalists, including Javier Valdez, have been killed in Mexico. Concerns about human rights conditions have grown as the government has been accused of using spyware to monitor critics. Congress is monitoring adherence to the \"Leahy laws\" regarding U.S. security assistance to Mexico. The State Department withheld support for Mexican security forces due to human rights concerns, leading to reprogramming of funds to Peru and withholding of military financing for Mexico. In FY2015, human rights groups urged the State Department not to submit a human rights progress report for Mexico as required by P.L. 113-235. However, in September 2016, the State Department did submit a report certifying that Mexico was making efforts to improve respect for human rights. The FY2016 and FY2017 Consolidated Appropriations Acts included conditions related to human rights for FMF aid to Mexico. The State Department also established a high-level human rights dialogue with Mexico. The State Department has established a high-level human rights dialogue with Mexico and provided human rights training for Mexican security forces. USAID is supporting a $5 million program by Freedom House to protect Mexican journalists and human rights defenders, with plans to extend and increase funding. Additionally, USAID is allocating $25 million through 2018 for human rights programs in Mexico, focusing on developing a national human rights strategy, assisting victims of abuse, and implementing legislation to prevent human rights violations. Congress may consider increasing funding for human rights programs under the M\u00e9rida Initiative, including training for military and police and support for human rights organizations. The M\u00e9rida Initiative in Mexico focuses on human rights conditions and compliance with assistance, without active US military presence due to Mexican sovereignty concerns. The Department of Defense oversees equipment procurement but does not provide assistance directly. Military cooperation between the two countries is increasing despite DOD's limited role in the initiative. The M\u00e9rida Initiative involves increasing military cooperation between the US and Mexico, with DOD providing training, equipment, and intelligence support to the Mexican military. DOD assistance aims to improve security, track criminal operatives, strengthen border security, and disrupt illicit activities. Funding for DOD programs comes from various sources, including State Department appropriations and International Military Education and Training funds. The FY2018 budget request would eliminate the FMF account, but DOD provides additional training and support to Mexico through its Drug Interdiction and Counterdrug Activities account. DOD programs in Mexico are overseen by U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) and totaled $64.2 million in FY2016. Funding is subject to the Leahy Law, which prohibits assistance to foreign security forces with human rights violations. Counternarcotics funding from NORTHCOM has enabled training and equipping of Mexican military personnel in various areas. Policymakers should receive briefings on DOD efforts to ensure coordination with the M\u00e9rida Initiative and compliance with vetting requirements. The M\u00e9rida Initiative complements domestic efforts to combat drug-related issues in Mexico. Domestic counter-drug initiatives are funded through U.S. agencies. The M\u00e9rida Initiative has expanded to include efforts to build a more modern border, with policymakers considering the balance of funding between Mexico and domestic initiatives. Some argue for more federal support for states and localities dealing with crime and violence from Mexico, while others believe efforts on the U.S. side of the border are insufficient. There is a debate on whether combating transnational criminal enterprises should focus solely on the U.S. side or include domestic programs. Mexican officials are concerned about border fencing and enforcement's impact on migrant deaths. U.S. counterdrug assistance programs in the Western Hemisphere are shifting, with aid to Colombia declining and funding for Mexico decreasing after the M\u00e9rida Initiative peak. Funding for antidrug programs in the Western Hemisphere has shifted, with decreases in aid to Colombia and Mexico after the M\u00e9rida Initiative peak. Support for Central America and the Caribbean has increased due to regional security initiatives. The FY2018 budget request proposes substantial cuts to these programs, despite efforts to coordinate U.S.-funded initiatives with partner governments. Challenges persist in addressing the violent effects of the drug trade, prompting discussions on drug policy reform in Latin America. The 114th Congress was involved in debates on counternarcotics goals in the region. The Obama Administration's counternarcotics goals in the Western Hemisphere were evaluated, including budget plans for foreign aid and drug control funding. Congress enacted P.L. 114-323 to establish a drug policy commission to review U.S. efforts in combating drug trafficking. The M\u00e9rida Initiative in Mexico has bipartisan support in Congress, despite funding declines.
