    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Open Fuel Standard Act of 2008\" or the \"OFS Act.\" The purpose of the Act is outlined in Section 2. The Act, known as the \"Open Fuel Standard Act of 2008\" or the \"OFS Act,\" highlights the findings of Congress regarding oil as a strategic commodity. It emphasizes the need for fuel competition and consumer choice to reduce oil's monopoly in the transportation sector and strip it of its strategic status. The closed fuel market has allowed a cartel of petroleum exporting countries to inflate fuel prices. The petroleum exporting countries inflate fuel prices, imposing a harmful tax on the US economy of nearly $500 billion per year. Alcohol fuels like ethanol and methanol could provide additional supplies produced in the US and friendly countries in the Western Hemisphere. Alcohol fuels can contribute to US energy independence if a substantial portion of vehicles can operate on them. Existing technology allows flexible fuel vehicles to operate on conventional gasoline or alcohol fuels, providing a platform for fuel competition in the United States. The development of a distribution system for alcohol fuels is crucial for energy independence. The United States has a substantial number of vehicles capable of running on alcohol fuels. Establishing a vehicle fleet and distribution system for these fuels would create a large market, advancing technology and production. There is a national security interest in developing alcohol fuels technology quickly. New cars should be flexible fuel vehicles to allow for fuel competition, and diesel cars should be able to run on biodiesel. An open fuel standard would help protect the environment. An open fuel standard would protect the US economy from oil price fluctuations, global threats, and natural disasters. SEC. 32920. OPEN FUEL STANDARD FOR TRANSPORTATION. In this section, definitions are provided for terms like E85, flexible fuel automobile, fuel choice-enabling automobile, and light-duty automobile. The term 'light-duty automobile manufacturer's annual inventory' refers to the number of light-duty automobiles manufactured or imported for sale in the US in a given year. 'M85' is a fuel mixture containing 85% methanol and 15% gasoline. The Open Fuel Standard for Transportation requires a certain percentage of fuel choice-enabling automobiles in a manufacturer's annual inventory. The Open Fuel Standard for Transportation mandates that manufacturers have at least 80% fuel choice-enabling automobiles in their annual inventory starting in 2015. Manufacturers can request exemptions by submitting applications to the Secretary for evaluation. The Secretary can temporarily exempt a light-duty automobile from the fuel choice-enabling requirement if unavoidable events disrupt production volume due to component supply issues or installation challenges. Manufacturers can submit consolidated exemption applications. The Secretary may grant exemptions for light-duty automobiles if production is disrupted due to component supply issues. Manufacturers can submit consolidated exemption applications, which will be conditioned upon the commitment to recall the exempted vehicles for component installation within an approved timeframe. The Secretary will publish notice of each manufacturer's application in the Federal Register. Each manufacturer granted a temporary exemption for light-duty automobiles must label each exempted vehicle according to regulations set by the Secretary. The label can only be removed after recall and installation of required components. Delivery of exempted vehicles to dealers and first purchasers must be accompanied by notice of the exemption. The manufacturer must label each exempted vehicle according to regulations set by the Secretary. Delivery of exempted vehicles to dealers and first purchasers must be accompanied by notice of the exemption. The Secretary of Transportation must promulgate regulations within one year of the enactment of this Act."
