Acquisition involves acquiring assets or stock, while merger involves combining entities under common control. Control is defined as owning more than 10% of ownership, voting rights, or pecuniary interest in another entity. Passenger enplanements refer to the average annual number of passengers boarding flights, as determined by the Department of Transportation for statistical purposes.

Findings and recommendations will be reported to Congress within 30 days after the 2-year study period."
