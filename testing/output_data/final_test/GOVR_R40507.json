    "content": "Since the fall of the Duvalier dictatorship in 1986, Haiti has struggled with authoritarianism, poverty, and underdevelopment. Progress has been made in governance, but democratic institutions are weak. Poverty and economic disparity persist. Political turmoil, including a military coup in 1991 and the re-election of President Aristide in 2001, has hindered stability in Haiti. Since 2004, Haiti has shown remarkable progress towards political stability and economic stabilization, with democratic elections, wide-ranging reforms, and improved security. Crime and violence still pose challenges, but the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti is shifting its focus. The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) is transitioning its focus from security to development. Despite efforts, Haiti remains the poorest country in the hemisphere. The U.S. Congress is concerned about Haiti's stability and is committed to improving conditions. President Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val aims to build institutions and attract private investment to create jobs. President Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val's Administration published its Poverty Reduction Strategy in November 2007 to meet IMF requirements for debt relief. International donors pledged over $1.5 billion in economic assistance to Haiti. With support from MINUSTAH, security conditions have improved, and police force reform has begun. Former President George W. Bush praised Pr\u00e9val for his efforts to improve economic conditions and establish the rule of law. Pr\u00e9val pledged to cooperate with U.S. counternarcotics efforts, and both President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed strong support for development in Haiti. The government updated its poverty reduction strategy to address hurricane damage and reconstruction efforts. The government of Haiti received $353 million in new aid commitments at a donors' conference in April 2009 to support reconstruction efforts after hurricanes and storms. Despite facing political and climatic challenges, including a food crisis and violent protests in 2008, a new Prime Minister, Michele Pierre-Louis, was confirmed in September 2008 to address the crisis and work towards stability. In September 2008, Prime Minister Michele Pierre-Louis worked for Haitian poor and youths to respond to natural disasters caused by major storms. Political parties in the legislature were positioning themselves for upcoming elections, complicating governability. Student protests in June demanded the departure of UN forces and an increase in the minimum wage. President Pr\u00e9val faced criticism for delaying the implementation of the minimum wage law. The Congress passed a bill without a transition phase, despite pressure from textile manufacturers to delay implementation due to the new minimum wage. The Haitian parliament, reestablished in 2006 after the collapse of the Aristide government, comprises a Senate and Chamber of Deputies. Elections were delayed for two-thirds of the Senate due to unrest, hurricanes, and divisions with the electoral council. The provisional electoral council, with support from MINUSTAH and donors, completed election preparations, including voter registration and ballot printing. Controversy arose when former President Aristide's party was barred from participating due to technical reasons. The council rejected candidate lists from rival factions, causing political tensions. Some felt the decision was politically motivated to prevent Aristide's party from gaining more seats. The UN Security Council delegation praised the Lavalas party for seeking a reversal of the decision to bar them from running in the elections. Despite efforts to maintain order, low voter turnout of 11% was recorded, with only one candidate winning a majority of the vote, leading to a runoff election. A clash between the ruling party and the opposition party, OPL, resulted in one death, raising concerns about election violence. Opposition parties allege voting fraud and plan to vote against seating the winners. President Pr\u00e9val's coalition, Lespwa, could gain a majority in the Senate with potential runoff wins. Lingering election disputes may affect support for constitutional reforms and economic agenda. Lingering disputes over elections could affect support for constitutional reforms and economic agenda in Haiti. Poverty is widespread, with over half the population living in extreme poverty, according to the World Bank. Haiti faces extreme poverty and hunger, with 69% of rural dwellers living on less than $1 a day and 86% on less than $2 a day. 81% of the national population and 87% of the rural population do not meet the minimum daily food ration. Children in remote areas are dying of malnutrition. Haiti's GDP would need to grow by 3.5% annually to eradicate extreme poverty by 2015, a goal deemed unlikely by the IMF. Despite some economic growth since 2004, per capita real GDP has declined by 30% in the past 40 years. Economic growth is not expected to reduce poverty significantly, with forecasted growth for FY2008-2009 at only 1.9% due to recent storms. The forecasted growth for FY2008-2009 is only 1.9% due to recent storms and the global economic crisis, leading to a 10% drop in remittances from Haitians abroad. Haiti's income distribution gap is significant, with the wealthiest 20% accruing over 68% of the national income, while the poorest 20% only accumulate less than 1.5%. The capacity of economic growth to reduce poverty in Haiti is minimal due to its high level of inequality. The government issued a \"Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper\" to qualify for debt relief. The strategy focuses on three pillars: areas for growth, human development, and investment in democratic governance. The implementation cost is just under $4 billion for 2007-2010, with half pledged by the international community. In August and September 2008, Haiti was hit by four major hurricanes or tropical storms, causing widespread devastation and flooding. Nearly 500 people died, exacerbating the country's existing food crisis. The hurricanes in 2008 caused significant damage in Haiti, including the destruction of one-third of the rice crop and other agricultural losses. The World Bank called for short-term recovery and long-term development efforts, with damages estimated at nearly $900 million. The hurricanes in 2008 caused extensive damage in Haiti, with estimated losses of almost $900 million. The most affected sectors were agriculture and housing, with needs assessed at $763 million for relief and reconstruction efforts. Priorities include food security, social welfare, and infrastructure rebuilding to foster economic development and reduce disaster risks. Analysts suggest the need for an economic stimulus package to ensure long-term security and aid for Haiti. Haiti requires $3 billion over the next two to three years for recovery from hurricanes, with calls for extraordinary international assistance from the UN, Inter-American Development Bank, and World Bank. The IDB offered an additional $50 million in assistance for 2009, while the World Bank approved $25 million in emergency grants for infrastructure rebuilding and water works in November 2008. Haiti, designated as one of the 50 \"least developed countries\" by the United Nations, requires $3 billion for recovery from hurricanes. The international community is implementing an assistance strategy to address Haiti's developmental needs, focusing on short-term projects to boost confidence and long-term plans to improve living conditions. Challenges include rising food and gasoline prices. The challenges in Haiti have been exacerbated by rising food and gasoline prices, internal political crises, and natural disasters. President Pr\u00e9val has criticized the slow dispersal of funds by international donors. There are frustrations regarding foreign assistance, with the government wanting more accountability from NGOs and donors concerned about Haitian capacity. President Pr\u00e9val faces challenges in Haiti due to rising food and gasoline prices, political crises, and natural disasters. International donors are concerned about Haitian capacity and corruption. Pr\u00e9val's leadership style is seen as a mixed blessing, with a lack of forceful leadership hindering progress. International donors requested an updated Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy reflecting post-hurricane conditions at a conference in 2009. The Haitian government presented its new two-year plan, \"Haiti: a New Paradigm,\" at a donors conference in 2009. The plan focuses on investing in infrastructure, improving economic governance, providing basic services, ensuring environmental sustainability, and creating jobs through agriculture and trade opportunities. Donors pledged $353 million in aid over the next two years to support these initiatives. The Haitian government received $83 million in support for FY2008 to FY2010, with the United States pledging $68 million in new FY2009 assistance. Prime Minister Pierre-Louis expressed gratitude for the funds, which exceeded expectations given the global economic crisis. Donors agreed to coordinate assistance more effectively and urged better tracking of results and accountability. One immediate priority was to bridge a $125 million budget gap. Some analysts stress the importance of involving the Haitian government and civil society in designing development strategies for sustainability. They highlight the need for job creation in both urban and rural areas to reduce urban migration, dependence on imported food, and environmental degradation. Economic growth alone may not alleviate poverty in Haiti, requiring a long-term commitment from donors. Development strategies should target improving living conditions for the poor and addressing inequalities and prejudices in the country. Despite current economic and social challenges in Haiti, analysts are optimistic about the progress made and potential for sustainable development. The UN Security Council noted improvements in security and judicial reform during a visit in 2009, although poverty and vulnerability to natural disasters remain. The government has made strides in macroeconomic management, voter registration, and job creation, despite setbacks from natural disasters. The UN Security Council delegation noted progress in security and judicial reform during their visit to Haiti in 2009. Despite setbacks from natural disasters, the government has made strides in macroeconomic management, voter registration, and job creation. A report commissioned by the UN Secretary-General recommends a strategy for economic security and sustainable development in Haiti, highlighting the country's favorable opportunities for economic development. The UN report recommends modest and focused actions to build economic security in Haiti, focusing on creating jobs in the garment and agricultural sectors, providing basic services, enhancing food security, and promoting environmental sustainability. Collier and other analysts are optimistic about Haiti's potential for reducing poverty, citing the country's peaceful and prosperous region and capable leadership. Haiti has an important resource in its diaspora, with 1.5 million Haitians abroad providing funds, skills, and political lobbying. Remittances from the diaspora totaled $1.65 billion in 2006, double Haiti's national budget. The world economic recession has caused a 10% drop in remittances in 2009. Haiti also benefits from advantageous access to the U.S. market for apparel through the HOPE II Act, which supporters believe will create jobs and stimulate the economy, while critics fear exploitation of cheap labor. Critics worry that the HOPE II Act in Haiti may exploit Haitians as cheap labor for foreign manufacturers and harm the agricultural economy. The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) was established after former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's government collapsed in 2004. MINUSTAH has worked with the interim government and President Pr\u00e9val to maintain order, despite calls for the removal of foreign troops. President Pr\u00e9val supports the presence of foreign troops in Haiti under MINUSTAH's mandate, which includes creating a secure environment, supporting democratic governance, and promoting human rights. The mission has also been involved in emergency responses to natural disasters and campaigns against gangs and drug-trafficking. MINUSTAH, led by Major-General Carlos Alberto Dos Santos Cruz of Brazil, has 9,055 total uniformed personnel from 17 countries, with a budget of $601.58 million. Brazilian troops will focus on development work as security improves. The mission's mandate has been extended to October 2009. The main priorities for U.S. policy towards Haiti are to strengthen democratic processes, improve security, and promote economic development. Concerns include the cost and effectiveness of U.S. aid, protecting human rights, combating trafficking, addressing migration, and alleviating poverty. The Obama Administration has called for a full review of policy towards Haiti, while Haitian officials have requested a change in the U.S. travel warning to encourage foreign investment. The current advisory warns U.S. citizens of the risks of travel to Haiti and recommends deferring non-essential travel until further notice due to ongoing security concerns. U.S. assistance for Haiti in FY2007 totaled $225 million, with estimated foreign assistance in FY2008 reaching approximately $234 million. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act stipulated that not less than $201.5 million in economic and military assistance be provided to Haiti, including funds for combating HIV/AIDS and urban crime. The previous Administration also contributed $45 million in emergency food aid. The previous Administration provided $45 million in emergency food aid in response to the April food crisis in Haiti. In FY2008 and FY2009, humanitarian assistance for the 2008 hurricanes totaled about $33.7 million. The estimate for FY2009 is $287 million, including funds for Global Health, Child Survival, Economic Support, food aid, Narcotics Control, Law Enforcement, Military Education, and Foreign Military Financing. The Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009 provides \"not less than $251.126 million\" in bilateral economic and international security assistance for Haiti, exceeding the original request by $41 million. In FY2010, Haiti requested $293 million in assistance, including funds for Global Health, Child Survival, Economic Support, food aid, Narcotics Control, Law Enforcement, Military Education, and Foreign Military Financing. The U.S. government provided $30 million in humanitarian assistance to Haiti after four major storms in 2008 caused $1 billion in damage. In response to hurricanes in Haiti in FY2008 and FY2009, the US provided $33 million in humanitarian assistance. Congress allocated $100 million for hurricane relief in the Caribbean in FY2009, with $96 million directed to Haiti. The storms worsened Haiti's existing food crisis, destroying a third of the rice crop and impacting livestock and other crops. Farmers will struggle to reinvest in future crops due to the loss of capital from the destroyed harvest. Some observers fear that food shortages and price increases in Haiti could lead to riots, similar to those in April 2008. Haitians have requested Temporary Protected Status in the US to avoid deportation, citing instability and inadequate services. President Pr\u00e9val asked for TPS for Haitian migrants after hurricanes, but the request was denied by the Bush Administration. Over 30,000 Haitians are currently facing deportation. The Obama Administration was considering granting Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to Haitians due to Haiti's inability to absorb deportees and dependence on remittances. There were concerns about TPS potentially encouraging more immigrants, but Clinton stated it would only apply to Haitians in the U.S. before Obama's election. Bipartisan support in Congress led to the passing of the HOPE Act to assist the Pr\u00e9val government in response to the food crisis. The HOPE Act, part of the 2008 farm bill, expands trade preferences for U.S. imports of Haitian apparel. Congress also amended the Merida Initiative to include counternarcotics funds for Haiti. The 111th Congress may consider financial support for democracy building, security enhancement, counternarcotics, development assistance, police and judicial reform, and disaster recovery and prevention. Some Members have requested Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitians in the U.S. due to the disastrous conditions in Haiti. The Bush Administration did not grant Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to Haitians in the U.S. despite the disastrous conditions in Haiti. Deportations of Haitians continued under the Obama Administration. The Haitian Protection Act of 2009 was introduced to designate Haiti for TPS. Congress is concerned about ensuring free and fair elections in Haiti. The House passed an amendment recommending cancellation of Haiti's debts to multilateral institutions.
