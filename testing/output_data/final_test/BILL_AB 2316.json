The school district must prepare a request for sealed proposals from qualified proposers, including project price estimate, preconstruction services description, facilities to be constructed, key award elements, proposal format, evaluation standards, proposal due date, and review timetable. The school district must notify the request for sealed proposals as per Section 20112 of the Public Contract Code and in a trade paper published in the county where the project is located, with the latest notice at least 10 days before the proposal deadline. A proposer must be prequalified according to Section 20111.6 of the Public Contract Code to submit a proposal. Electrical, mechanical, and plumbing subcontractors must also meet the same prequalification requirements. This includes completing a standardized prequalification questionnaire and financial statement verified under oath. These requirements will be included in an instrument created as specified. The school district's request for sealed proposals will outline evaluation criteria such as relevant experience, safety record, and price proposal. The price proposal may include a lump-sum price or proposed fee for services. Criteria will be evaluated pass-fail or scored for best value, with minimum qualification scores specified for award consideration. The school district outlines evaluation criteria in the request for sealed proposals, including methodology, weighting system, and minimum acceptable score for each criterion. Proposals are evaluated based on set criteria, with best value scores assigned and ranked from highest to lowest by the school district. The governing board of the school district awards the instrument to the proposer with the best value score. If the selected proposer refuses, it may be awarded to the next highest scoring proposer in the best interest of the school district. Upon contract award, the school district must publicly announce the recipient and basis of the award. The governing board has the option to reject proposals and request new ones. Upon award of an instrument, the successful proposer must provide verifiable cost information, select subcontractors, and finalize the price with the school district.

For preconstruction services, a school district can enter into an instrument before approval by the Department of General Services\u2019 Division of the State Architect, as long as no work requiring a licensed contractor or State Architect approval is performed without the necessary approvals.

Payment to the contractor should not exceed their costs or lease payments minus profit. Legal challenges to the public works contract award are not affected by this subdivision.
