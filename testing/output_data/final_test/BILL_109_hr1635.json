    "content": "The \"Veterans' Employment Transition Support Act of 2005\" or the \"VETS Act of 2005\" provides a credit for employers hiring military service personnel who served in a combat zone or a hazardous duty area under section 45J of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The military service personnel employment credit under section 38 provides a 40 percent credit for qualified first-year wages, or a higher percentage for disabled qualified veterans. Qualified wages are those paid to qualified veterans, and qualified first-year wages are wages for service within the first year of employment. The term 'wages' is defined as per section 51(c) without paragraph (4). A 'qualified veteran' is someone certified by the local agency as a combat zone veteran and honorably discharged. The 'hiring date' is also defined in this section. The term 'hiring date' is defined as per section 51(d) for disabled qualified veterans with a service-connected disability rated at 10 percent or more. The 'applicable percentage' is determined based on a table. The applicable percentage for disability ranges from 41 to 50 percent, increasing in increments of 1 percent. Rules similar to section 52 and subsections of section 51 apply for the military service personnel employment credit. Section 38 of the Code is amended to include the credit as part of the general business credit. Technical amendments are made to exclude wages eligible for employment credits. The text discusses amendments to the tax code regarding employment credits. It excludes certain wages from being considered for the credit under sections 45J and 51. Coordination with other employment credits is also addressed, specifying that qualified wages do not include wages used for credits under section 45J or 51. Additionally, section 280C is amended to include reference to section 45J(a). The text amends section 1396(c) of the tax code to exclude certain wages from the credit under sections 45J and 51. It also coordinates with other employment credits, reducing the $15,000 amount in paragraph (2) for wages used in determining credits under sections 45J and 51. Additionally, a clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code. The text introduces a credit for employers hiring military service personnel who served in a combat zone or hazardous duty area. The amendments apply to individuals starting work for the employer after the enactment of the Act."
