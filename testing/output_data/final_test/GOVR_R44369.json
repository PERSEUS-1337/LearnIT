Meetings are allowed when the Senate is in session or adjourned, with restrictions on timing. Committees must designate a regular meeting day and announce hearings at least one week in advance, with exceptions for \"good cause.\" Special meetings can be requested by three committee members.

Table 2 focuses on committee rules regarding hearing and business quorums, and requirements for filing amendments before a markup. Some committees require a minority party member to be present for conducting business at meetings. Senate Rule XXVI, paragraph 7(a) requires a majority of the committee to be physically present to report out a measure, known as a \"reporting quorum.\" Committees can set lower quorum requirements, but not less than a third of membership for other business.

Testifying under oath for nominees varies by committee. Some Senate committees do not have specific rules for investigations or issuing subpoenas, but this does not prevent them from conducting investigations or issuing subpoenas.
