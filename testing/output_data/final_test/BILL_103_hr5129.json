The Secretary of Defense will reduce the European end strength level of military personnel in fiscal years 1996-1999 if the allied contribution level is below the specified goal, with a 10% reduction over four years. The Secretary of Defense will reduce the European military personnel in fiscal years 1996-1999 if the allied contribution level is below the specified goal, with a 10% reduction over four years. The allied contribution level is determined by calculating nonpersonnel costs for US military installations in European NATO member nations assumed by those nations, considering only cash and in-kind contributions that replace Secretary's expenditures. The Secretary of Defense will reduce European military personnel if allied contribution levels are below the specified goal, with a 10% reduction over four years. The President is urged to have European NATO member nations assume an increased share of nonpersonnel costs for US military installations according to a specific timetable. By September 30, 1995, 15% of costs should be assumed by nations, increasing to 50% by September 30, 1998. Exceptions include maintaining a minimum end strength of 25,000 members and waiver authority for national security threats. The President or Secretary can waive force reductions for national security reasons and must inform Congress. Reductions in European forces will be split, with half reducing active duty personnel and half increasing deployments in the US or other nations. The term \"European end strength level of members of the Armed Forces\" refers to the number of US military personnel stationed in European NATO nations. \"Nonpersonnel costs\" for US military installations in Europe are expenses excluding those paid from military personnel accounts."
