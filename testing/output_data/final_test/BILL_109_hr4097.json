    "content": "The \"Family Education Reimbursement Act of 2005\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Family Education Reimbursement Accounts are established under this Act. The Secretary of Education, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall establish a Family Education Reimbursement Account Program to provide reimbursement for displaced students to attend their parent's chosen school or preschool program. Administrative expenses for fiscal year 2006 shall not exceed one third of one percent of the total amount available, and a nongovernmental entity will administer the program. The Secretary will allow parents to choose the school for displaced students in the 2005-2006 school year and provide reimbursement quarterly. Reimbursement amounts will be based on the number of students attending the school or preschool program. The reimbursement for displaced students in the 2005-2006 school year will be based on the number of weeks attended, with a maximum reimbursement of $6,700 per student. Reimbursement will not exceed the actual cost of education for non-displaced students. The Secretary may provide reimbursement for displaced students for the 2005-2006 school year, with a maximum of $6,700 per student. Reimbursement will cease once the student returns to their pre-August 29, 2005 school. Funds must be used for educational services, not for construction or renovation. An accounting of funds must be provided for each school or program receiving payments. To participate in the program for displaced students, parents must register online, by phone, or using a paper form. Upon registration, each student is assigned an account number which is provided to the parent. If a parent has multiple displaced children, they can register them all at once under the same account number. The Secretary will develop a web-based system to register displaced students in the program and facilitate timely payments to schools. The system will include an Internet site, toll-free telephone number, and paper form options for registration. Each child will be assigned the same account number for registration. The Internet site and toll-free telephone number developed for displaced students shall be integrated, operational within 2 weeks, include privacy controls, and be accessible for registration purposes. The Internet site and toll-free telephone number developed for displaced students shall be integrated, operational within 2 weeks, include privacy controls, and be accessible for registration purposes. The purpose of determining the amount expended and remaining for expenditure on the student's behalf shall be accessible to schools and preschool programs for facilitating reimbursement. It shall also support non-English speaking parents by providing information and registration in an understandable format. The Secretary shall ensure that the payment system for displaced students includes controls to prevent fraud, technical support services for families and schools, and integration with existing Federal grant management systems. The Secretary must ensure the payment system is operational within 4 weeks of enactment, with disbursements made within 5 weeks. The contract for this system must be awarded to a nongovernmental entity with experience in meeting requirements and expertise in IT infrastructure. The contractor must have experience in IT infrastructure, payment management systems for Federal agencies, and operate help desk services in the United States. The Secretary will provide reimbursement for displaced students transferring schools during the 2005-2006 school year. An exception applies if the student attends a school for less than 2 consecutive weeks. An additional 1 percent of the reimbursement amount will be included for administrative expenses. (h) Procurement.--Certain provisions of Federal acquisition law shall not apply for the contract required by subsection (a)(3), including Title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, The Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, The Competition in Contracting Act, and Subchapter V of chapter 35 of title 31. The Federal Acquisition Regulation and other laws authorize regulations in the procurement protest system. The Secretary may reimburse schools for displaced students if they agree to audits. Reimbursement is contingent on schools not discriminating based on race, color, national origin, religion, or sex. The prohibition of sex discrimination does not apply to schools operated by religious organizations if it conflicts with their beliefs. Parents can choose single-sex schools, classes, or activities despite other laws. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act is not affected by the allowance for single-sex schools, classes, or activities. Religious schools receiving reimbursement can follow employment practices consistent with the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Funds available for displaced students do not require schools to change their teaching mission or remove religious symbols. Religious schools can maintain their religious identity in various aspects without losing funding. Reimbursement for displaced students is considered assistance to the student, not the school. The Secretary must report on program implementation and results quarterly, including the number of children served and funds allocation. Definitions are provided in this section.
