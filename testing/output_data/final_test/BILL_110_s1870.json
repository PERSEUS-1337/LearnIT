    "content": "The \"Clean Water Restoration Act of 2007\" aims to restore and maintain the integrity of the waters of the United States as originally intended by Congress in 1972. It seeks to clearly define the waters subject to the Clean Water Act and provide protection to these waters to the fullest extent of Congress's legislative authority under the Constitution. Congress recognizes the importance of water as a vital resource for sustaining life and various activities. It aims to restore and maintain the integrity of the waters of the United States through national water quality standards to protect aquatic ecosystems. The structures and functions of aquatic ecosystems in the United States are defined by regulations to protect waters under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Water pollution can impact the integrity of interconnected aquatic systems, emphasizing the need to protect intrastate waters to maintain the overall integrity of all waters in the country. The regulation of discharges into intrastate waters is crucial for the clean water program in the US. Small streams play a vital role in reducing pollution, providing drinking water, and supporting aquatic life cycles. Pollution in US waters significantly impacts interstate commerce. Protection of intrastate waters is essential to prevent harm to interstate commerce and sustain a robust system in the future. Draining or filling intrastate wetlands and streams can cause flooding, leading to billions of dollars in damages annually. Millions of people rely on these waters for filtering and drinking water, protecting health, and creating economic opportunities. Source water protection areas with small or intermittent streams supply water to over 110 million Americans. Recreational activities like hunting, bird watching, fishing, and photography generate billions of dollars annually. Activities leading to water pollution are mainly commercial or economic in nature, with over 14,000 facilities holding individual permits under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. States have the right to manage programs to prevent water pollution and establish more protective standards than federal regulations. Protecting water quality is crucial for implementing treaties and preserving species. Protecting the quality of and regulating activities affecting the waters of the United States is crucial for preserving Federal land and waters from pollution and degradation. This includes hundreds of millions of acres of parkland, refuge land, and other Federal-owned land, along with the various waters within that land. The definition of \"Waters of the United States\" is outlined in Section 4. Section 502 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1362) is amended to redefine \"Waters of the United States\" to include various bodies of water subject to the legislative power of Congress. SEC. 5. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to replace \"navigable waters of the United States\" with \"waters of the United States\" in various sections. SEC. 6. SAVINGS CLAUSE. The Act does not affect the authority of the EPA or the Army Secretary under specific provisions of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act related to discharges from agriculture, stormwater runoff from certain operations, and dredged/fill materials from farming activities. Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act allows for discharges of dredged or fill materials for various purposes such as maintenance of structures, construction of farm ponds or irrigation ditches, temporary sedimentation basins on construction sites, farm or forest roads, and temporary roads for mining equipment. Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act allows for discharges of dredged or fill materials for various purposes, including moving mining equipment in accordance with best management practices. This includes activities in states with approved programs meeting specific requirements."
