    "content": "The \"Better Oil Spill Response Plan Act of 2010\" requires the President to estimate worst case discharges every 5 years and revise the National Contingency Plan. The President must revise the National Contingency Plan within 270 days of the enactment of the Act, considering the response to the Deepwater Horizon explosion and recommendations from the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill. The President must revise the National Contingency Plan within 270 days of the Act's enactment, based on the response to the Deepwater Horizon explosion and recommendations from the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill. Executive Order 13543 mandates the revision or amendment of the Plan when worst case discharge estimates change, allowing for revisions at any time as deemed necessary. SEC. 4. REVISION OF AREA CONTINGENCY PLANS. Updating of Worst Case Discharge and Area Contingency Plan Revision required under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Each Area Committee must revise its plan within 18 months of the Act's enactment. The Water Pollution Control Act requires revisions to the Area Contingency Plan, taking into account the adequacy of the plan, revisions to the National Contingency Plan, findings from the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, and worst case discharge estimates provided by the President. The President must review and approve the Area Contingency Plan within 180 days of submission. Amendments are required if the plan does not meet specified requirements. The plan must be consistent with the National Contingency Plan Dispersant Schedule. Periodic revisions of the Area Contingency Plan are also mandated. The Area Contingency Plan must be periodically updated by the Area Committee, especially when there are significant changes in worst-case discharge estimates or revisions to the National Contingency Plan. SEC. 5. TANK VESSEL, NONTANK VESSEL, AND FACILITY RESPONSE PLANS. The President must revise regulations to ensure response plans are based on worst-case discharge scenarios and accurate assessments of the operating area's characteristics for tank vessels, nontank vessels, and facilities. The President must revise regulations to ensure response plans for tank vessels, nontank vessels, and facilities are based on worst-case discharge scenarios and accurate assessments of the operating area's characteristics. The response plan must include a demonstration of the owner or operator's capacity to fully implement the plan and meet other requirements prescribed by the President. Approval of the response plan is required as per Section 311(j)(5) of the Act. The amendment made under paragraph (1)(A) does not affect any waivers issued before the enactment of this Act. Section 311(j)(6) is amended to include requirements for periodic inspection of equipment used to mitigate discharges and vessels carrying oil on navigable waters. The President requires vessels carrying oil or hazardous substances to have removal equipment using best technology feasible for safe operation. Owners must demonstrate capacity to respond annually with necessary equipment and personnel. The President can revoke the approval of a response plan if an owner or operator fails to demonstrate the capacity to implement it within a specified time period. Regulations to enforce this provision must be issued within 180 days of the Better Oil Spill Response Plan Act of 2010. SEC. 6. SAFE DISPERSANTS. The amendment to Section 311(d)(2)(G) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act now includes a schedule for the use of dispersants, chemicals, and spill mitigating devices in spill response plans, with criteria for safety and efficacy. The President will require manufacturers of dispersants, chemicals, and spill mitigating substances to submit data on efficacy and safety for known and anticipated uses. The President will require manufacturers to submit data on the chronic effects of sustained use on marine environments, effects on aquatic species at various ocean depths, and effects on marine life from subsurface application. The President will require manufacturers to submit data on the chronic effects of sustained use on marine environments, effects on aquatic species at various ocean depths, and effects on marine life from subsurface application, including details on early life stages of aquatic organisms, constituent ingredients, and material safety data sheets for potential health impacts on humans involved in application activities. The President may place restrictions on the quantities and conditions of use of dispersants, chemicals, and spill mitigating substances during activities. This includes specifying safe waters for their use and regulating the quantities used. The President may restrict the use of dispersants, chemicals, and spill mitigating substances in safe waters, specifying quantities and conditions of use. The President or designee can identify specific dispersants, chemicals, and substances for use on a case-by-case basis. The President must ensure that manufacturers of dispersants, chemicals, or spill mitigating substances publicly disclose the ingredients used in response plans for significant spills. SEC. 7 amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to enforce compliance with response plan requirements for offshore facilities under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act."
