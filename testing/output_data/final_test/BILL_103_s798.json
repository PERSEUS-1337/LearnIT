    "content": "The \"Arson Prevention Act of 1993\" may be cited as the official title of this Act. Congress recognizes that arson is a significant problem in the United States, responsible for 25% of all fires, leading to 700 deaths annually, and causing $2 billion in property losses. The underreporting of arson incidents highlights the need for improved training programs for arson investigators. Improved training programs for arson investigators and volunteer firefighters are needed to detect and prosecute arson crimes effectively. Only a third of suspicious fires are confirmed as arson, highlighting the importance of enhancing the skills of arson investigators to identify and prosecute offenders. SEC. 25. ARSON PREVENTION GRANTS are added to the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 to provide funding for improved training programs for arson investigators and volunteer firefighters. The Office of Fire Prevention and Arson Control defines arson as incendiary and suspicious fires. The Administrator will award grants for arson research, prevention, and control programs to States or consortia of States. Grants will focus on improving training for arson investigators to meet certification standards. The grants awarded by the Administrator aim to provide resources for arson task forces, combat fraud as a motive for arson, advance research on arson prevention, and manage arson squads through training and preparation of management guides. To combat various causes of arson, including civil unrest, juvenile arson, drug-related arson, and domestic violence. This includes developing public education materials, counseling programs, and research initiatives at the State and local levels. To combat arson, efforts include addressing domestic violence as a cause, improving firefighters' capabilities in rural areas, and expanding training programs. The Administrator will assist grant applicants in structuring their applications to ensure grants are awarded for each goal. States must meet qualification criteria, including obtaining 25% of program costs from non-Federal sources and maintaining prior spending levels on arson programs. The Administrator will provide technical assistance and ensure cooperation with other agencies to enhance program effectiveness and avoid duplication. Grants awarded under this section may be extended, subject to availability of funds. The Administrator will conduct regular meetings with other Federal agencies to address arson concerns and improve the national arson profile. Within 18 months, a report identifying grants, grantees, goals, and effectiveness will be submitted to Congress. Regulations for grant applications will be issued within 90 days. The Administrator will directly administer the grant program and will not contract out its administration. SEC. 4 amends the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act to emphasize the need for improved arson training courses for volunteer firefighters. SEC. 5 authorizes appropriations. Section 17 of the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 is amended to authorize appropriations for various purposes including basic research on arson prevention, expansion of arson investigator training programs, and carrying out specific sections of the Act for fiscal years 1994 and 1995. For fiscal years 1994 and 1995, $250,000 is allocated for salaries and expenses to carry out section 25 of the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974."
