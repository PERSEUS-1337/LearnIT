    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Telecommunications Services Enhancement Act of 1994\". The Congress finds that competition in telecommunications and cable services will encourage infrastructure development, benefit the price, availability, variety, and quality of services, and improve the economy, culture, and political system. All providers should have equal opportunities and be subject to equivalent regulation to ensure public interest. The Congress finds that competition in telecommunications and cable services will encourage infrastructure development, benefit the price, availability, variety, and quality of services, and improve the economy, culture, and political system. It is not in the public interest to remove barriers to entry for intrastate telecommunications services such as telephone exchange service, intraLATA telecommunications services, and exchange access services. Removing these barriers will create new jobs and eliminate restrictions on existing providers. The advancement of telecommunications services can boost economic development, job creation, and international competitiveness. Improvements in the nation's telecommunications infrastructure will enhance public welfare by speeding up the delivery of services like telemedicine, distance learning, and health information distribution. Telemedicine services can help provide healthcare to all Americans and reduce healthcare costs. Allowing all providers to offer telecommunications services will greatly enhance infrastructure improvements. The telecommunications industry should be regulated based on Antitrust Laws by the Department of Justice and the Commission for interstate telecommunications services and the States for intrastate telecommunications services. Regulatory asymmetries need to be addressed to ensure all providers can offer advanced services in rural areas. Existing regulatory devices are no longer effective in competitive marketplaces. Amendments to the Communications Act of 1934 are needed to address regulatory asymmetries and ensure all providers can offer advanced services in rural areas. Existing regulatory devices are no longer effective in competitive marketplaces. Amendments to the Communications Act of 1934 include new definitions for terms like 'local exchange carrier', 'telephone exchange access service', and 'telecommunications service'. These changes aim to address regulatory issues and allow all providers to offer advanced services in rural areas. The new definitions in the Amendments to the Communications Act of 1934 include terms like 'telecommunications service' and 'Bell operating company'. The term 'telecommunications service' refers to the offering of telecommunications facilities to the public or eligible users, excluding information services. 'Bell operating company' includes specific companies listed in the Modification of Final Judgment decree. In United States v. Western Electric, Civil Action No. 82--0192, the definition of 'Telecommunications' was clarified as the transmission of user-selected information without alteration, using electromagnetic transmission mediums. This definition excludes cable or information services. Additionally, Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 was amended to include new sections. SEC. 230 of the Act prohibits State or local statutes from hindering entities from providing telecommunications services, while also preventing unreasonable discrimination among carriers. SEC. 231 addresses interLATA telecommunications services. SEC. 231 allows Bell operating companies or affiliates to provide interLATA telecommunications services once barriers to entry are removed. The term 'LATA' refers to local access and transport areas. SEC. 232 addresses regulatory parity. The FCC prohibits cable operators from offering telephone services in areas where they provide video programming if the local exchange carrier is barred from offering video programming. The Commission must regulate all competitive telecommunications services equally and adjust regulations to reflect a competitive environment. Competitive telecommunications services are defined as comparable or better services offered by unaffiliated entities. Amendment to Title VI allows local exchange carriers to provide video programming directly to subscribers through their own facilities or affiliates, and offer rental arrangements for communication channels to entities related to the carrier. Amendment to Title VI expands jurisdiction under the Communications Act of 1934 to include sections 230, 231, and 232."
