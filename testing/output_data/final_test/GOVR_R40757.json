    "content": "The eligibility for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) for survivors is based on the circumstances of the veteran's death and the survivor meeting certain criteria related to relationship, age, or income. DIC is paid to eligible survivors of veterans who died on active duty, due to service-connected disabilities, or from non-service-related causes not as a result of willful misconduct. The Veterans' Benefits Act of 2010 expanded criteria for survivors of veterans eligible for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) based on specific conditions related to the veteran's death and disability ratings. The VA determines veterans' eligibility for disability compensation based on military service records and circumstances of death. Dependents may be eligible for certain benefits if criteria are met. Survivors of deceased veterans must also meet specific criteria for DIC eligibility, categorized into spouses, children, and dependent parents. Spouses are eligible if married to the veteran for at least one year before death, have a child with the veteran, or married within 15 years of discharge due to a service-connected disability. Surviving spouses, children, and dependent parents of deceased veterans must meet specific criteria for DIC eligibility. Spouses must have been married to the veteran for at least one year before death, have a child with the veteran, or married within 15 years of discharge. Children must be independent, unmarried, and below 18 years old, or pursuing education between 18 to 23 years old. Parents must show financial dependence on the deceased veteran. Surviving spouses receive monthly benefits at a base rate of $1,254.19 in 2015. Spouses of deceased veterans may receive monthly benefits based on the veteran's pay grade at the time of death, with a current base rate of $1,254.19 in 2015. Additional amounts may be provided for various reasons, such as disability compensation, dependent children, disabilities requiring aid, or being permanently housebound. Surviving children under 18 (or under 23 if students) are also entitled to benefits. Children who are independent of the surviving spouse are entitled to Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) in varying amounts. One child receives $310.71 per month, with each additional child receiving the same amount. If the surviving spouse has children under 18, an additional $270 per month is provided for two years as a transitional benefit. Children permanently incapable of self-support before 18 receive $529.55 per month, while those in school between 18 and 23 receive $263.23 per month. Under current law, the maximum allowable DIC for surviving dependent parents is reduced for countable income above $800, or $1,000 if both parents are a married couple. Monthly benefits received by parents fluctuate by income, ranging from $5 to $621 for a sole surviving parent, $5 to $422 for parents who are still married or have remarried, and $5 to $449 for parents who are not living together. To claim DIC benefits, a survivor must submit VA Form 21-534a and DD Form 1300 to the local VA office. The effective date of DIC entitlement depends on when the claim is filed. In FY2013, 376,979 spouses, children, and parents of veterans received over $5.8 billion in DIC, with spousal survivors receiving $15,744 annually on average and child recipients receiving $7,094. Policy issues include the DIC offset of Survivor Benefit Plan payments, adequacy of payments compared to other systems, remarriage age, disabled rating time for non-service-connected deaths, and maximum DIC payment for parents based on income levels. The Survivor Benefit Plan is a form of insurance for military retirees. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) is a form of insurance for military retirees that provides monthly payments to survivors after the retiree's death. The SBP payment is reduced dollar for dollar if the survivor also receives Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC). There is a concern about the adequacy of DIC payments, as the basic benefit for eligible surviving spouses is just under 41% of the compensation rate for a 100% disabled veteran. The adequacy of DIC payments for surviving spouses of military retirees is questioned due to the variance in pension plans and benefits. Private pension plans typically pay 50% to surviving spouses, while SBP recipients receive 55% of the retiree's pay. Federal employee pension plans provide 55% or 50% with a lump-sum payment. Low-income elderly or disabled veterans may be eligible for the Improved Disability Pension, with a maximum annual rate of $12,868 in 2015. Surviving spouses may be eligible for the Improved Death Pension Benefit. The surviving spouse may be eligible for the Improved Death Pension Benefit, with a maximum annual rate of $8,630 in 2015. They could receive about 67.1% of the veteran's Improved Disability Pension. DIC payments for surviving spouses are structured differently from pension benefits, with the potential for a higher DIC payment than the veteran's disability compensation while alive. The Veterans Benefits Act of 2003 allowed surviving spouses aged 57 or older to remarry and keep DIC benefits. However, those who do not remarry will have their military Survivor Benefit Plan reduced by DIC benefits. Remarriage age for retaining benefits varies: 55 for military and federal employees, 60 for Social Security beneficiaries. This could result in a remarried surviving spouse losing some benefits. A remarried surviving spouse may lose benefits if the veteran's death was not service-connected and the veteran was not 100% disabled for at least 10 years prior to death. The 10-year disability requirement is seen as a measure of the survivor's dependence on the veteran's disability compensation. The Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) program provides benefits to survivors of veterans, with income not affecting eligibility except for dependent parents. The maximum DIC amount for parents is $800 for a single parent and $1,000 for a married couple, set in 1968 and not adjusted for inflation. Over time, dependent parents may see reductions in DIC as their incomes increase. DIC has been paid to survivors since the Revolutionary War, with women and children receiving pensions based on the officer's entitled pay. During the Civil War, survivor compensation expanded to cover all servicemembers at a rate payable to disabled veterans. Changes to survivor compensation were made for servicemembers with service-connected disabilities under the Act of July 14, 1862. In 1917, the War Risk Insurance Act was passed to eliminate non-service pensions and adjust payments for death and disability. The Servicemen's Indemnity Act of 1951 replaced the previous life insurance system. The Servicemen's Indemnity Act of 1951 replaced the previous life insurance system with a new system providing monthly payments to eligible survivors, including spouses, children, parents, and siblings. The compensation was set up to reach a maximum of $10,000, with adjustments for inflation. Congressional and executive committees were formed to streamline the administration of dependency and indemnity compensation. In 1956, the Bradley Report recommended death compensation for veterans' survivors regardless of income. In 1969, Congress implemented fixed rates for survivor compensation based on pay grade, adjusting for cost-of-living increases. Years of service were no longer a factor in determining compensation. No significant changes occurred until 1993. In 1993, changes to DIC legislation included eliminating rate tables for surviving spouses and reinstating one flat monthly rate. In 2003, surviving spouses who remarried after age 57 were allowed to retain DIC."
