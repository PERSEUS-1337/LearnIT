    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the complex history of the Los Angeles River, from its natural state to the construction of flood control measures in the 1930s. Efforts by various government entities, including the city, county, and federal government, have been made to restore and develop the river, with projects like the county's master plan and the city's revitalization plan. The recent approval of \"Alternative 20\" by the Corps of Engineers marks a significant step towards the restoration of the Upper Los Angeles River. The City of Los Angeles was granted responsibility for managing the river's resources through a charter by the King of Spain in the 18th century. The federal government, specifically the United States Army Corps of Engineers, took over infrastructure projects after serious floods in the 1930s to reduce flood risks. The county collaborates with the city in managing the Upper Los Angeles River, where the city has \"pueblo\" water rights granted by the King of Spain's charter. The city does not have authority over the Lower Los Angeles River. The State of California has authority over the Los Angeles River but has not actively managed it due to the Army Corps of Engineers' dominance. The county's outdated master plan for the river, especially the Lower Los Angeles River, lacks resources and development. None of the cities along the Lower Los Angeles River have the means to invest in its restoration, creating an opportunity for the state to assist in implementing the county's Master Plan. In 2014, California voters approved $60 million for the Los Angeles River under the Water Quality, Supply, and Infrastructure Improvement Act. The funding was allocated to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and the San Gabriel and Lower Los Angeles Rivers and Mountains Conservancy for water quality, supply, and watershed projects. Chapter 6 was added to Division 22.8 of the Public Resources Code to establish the Lower Los Angeles River Working Group. The Secretary of the Natural Resources Agency will appoint a local working group, the Lower Los Angeles River Working Group, to develop a revitalization plan for the Lower Los Angeles River watershed. The working group may include representatives from various organizations and elected officials from cities along the Los Angeles River. The Lower Los Angeles River Working Group will develop a revitalization plan for the Lower Los Angeles River and its communities by March 1, 2017. The plan will focus on watershed education programs and enhancing the County of Los Angeles's Master Plan for the entire Los Angeles River. The conservancy will provide staffing support for the working group. The Lower Los Angeles River Working Group will develop a revitalization plan for the Lower Los Angeles River, eligible for funding from various sources including state funding. A special law is deemed necessary due to the river's complex history and unique challenges faced by local governments in managing the area."
