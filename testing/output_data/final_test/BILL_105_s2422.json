The \"Measures to Encourage Results in Teaching Act of 1998\" emphasizes the importance of well-educated teachers for student success in a knowledge-based society. Knowledgeable and skillful teachers play a crucial role in student learning. The Federal Government established the Dwight D. Eisenhower Professional Development Program in 1985 to ensure teachers have access to high-quality professional development, including the ability to demonstrate and judge performance. States should evaluate teachers based on demonstrated ability in subject matter knowledge, teaching knowledge, and teaching skill. States should develop a test for teachers and instructional staff to assess their subject knowledge every 3 to 5 years. Evaluating and rewarding teachers with a compensation system based on expertise, meeting student needs, and performance against teaching standards will enhance education for all students. The purposes of this Act include providing incentives for States to implement teacher testing and merit pay programs. The Act aims to administer teacher testing and merit pay programs for elementary and secondary school teachers to encourage States to establish impactful merit pay programs that recognize and reward the best teachers. State incentives for teacher testing and merit pay are being amended under Title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to encourage the establishment of impactful merit pay programs for teachers. The Secretary shall award funds to States that test teachers every 3 to 5 years and have a merit-based compensation system. The available funding is 50% of excess funds appropriated for Title II, with no funds available if appropriations are insufficient. The amount appropriated for awards under this section exceeds $600,000,000 or each State is eligible for an award. States receive awards based on the total available amount and can use funds for activities described in section 2207. The definition of \"State\" includes all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The effective date for these amendments is October 1, 1999. The section allows states to use federal education funds for teacher testing and merit pay programs for elementary and secondary school teachers. The terms \"elementary school\" and \"secondary school\" are defined in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965."
