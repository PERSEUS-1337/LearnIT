Provisional protected status is granted to aliens whose DACA grant has ended, providing them with employment authorization until their relief application is denied or removal is canceled by the Secretary.

An alien with provisional protected presence is not considered unlawfully present unless deemed a threat to national security or public safety by the Secretary. An alien may fail to maintain continuous presence in the United States if they depart for more than 90 days without authorization. However, an exception applies to aliens who left the U.S. after a certain date. States will not be considered to have failed to maintain continuous presence in the United States if an alien's absences are brief, casual, and innocent, even if not authorized by the Secretary. The Secretary of Homeland Security can extend time periods if the alien shows exceptional circumstances, such as serious illness or death in the family. SEC. 4. AVAILABILITY OF IMMIGRANT VISAS. Beginning in the first fiscal year when an immigrant visa is needed for an alien with an approved relief application under section 3, certain visas will be reallocated for this purpose.
