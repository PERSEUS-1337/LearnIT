    "content": "The National Security Agency (NSA) conducted a secret Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP) leading to a national debate on its legality under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). The program involved warrantless surveillance of international communications involving individuals believed to be associated with al Qaeda. The Bush Administration defended the program citing constitutional and statutory support. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) provides a framework for electronic surveillance and physical searches to acquire foreign intelligence information. The Bush Administration argued that FISA lacked the speed to combat terrorism effectively. Attorney General Gonzales informed the Senate Judiciary Committee about FISA court orders authorizing government surveillance. The FISC judge issued orders allowing the Government to target international communications involving suspected terrorists. All surveillance previously conducted under the TSP will now require FISC approval. The President decided not to reauthorize the TSP when the current authorization expires. Intelligence Committees were briefed on the classified details of the FISC orders. The NSA program faced legal challenges, with a court ruling it unconstitutional for violating various laws and amendments. The decision was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The Sixth Circuit stayed Judge Taylor's judgment and permanent injunction on the NSA program pending appeal. Bills were introduced in Congress to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in response to concerns about the Terrorist Surveillance Program. The Electronic Surveillance Modernization Act was passed by the House in September 2006. The 110th Congress may explore different approaches to issues related to the Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP) or choose not to take legislative action due to new FISC orders and the expected end of the TSP. This report summarizes H.R. 5825 from the 109th Congress, discussing its impact on current law if similar legislation is enacted. The bill addresses amendments to definitions in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The bill amends definitions in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), specifically adding a new category for individuals who are expected to possess foreign intelligence information while in the United States. This new definition does not require a connection with a foreign power, unlike other definitions in FISA. The proposed amendment to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) broadens the definition of an \"agent of a foreign power\" to include individuals who are expected to possess foreign intelligence information while in the United States, without requiring a connection to a foreign power. This expansion does not necessitate any action or intent to benefit a foreign power or harm the United States, significantly widening the scope of the term. Additionally, the bill amends the definition of \"electronic surveillance\" in FISA. The proposed amendment to FISA broadens the definition of \"electronic surveillance\" to include intentional acquisition of communication contents with a reasonable expectation of privacy and warrant requirement for law enforcement purposes. The proposed amendment to FISA broadens the definition of \"electronic surveillance\" to include intentional acquisition of communication contents with a reasonable expectation of privacy and warrant requirement for law enforcement purposes. It blends elements of current subsections 101(f)(1) and (f)(4) while eliminating certain aspects, focusing on surveillance device use for intercepting communications of targeted U.S. persons in the United States. The proposed amendment to FISA broadens the definition of \"electronic surveillance\" to include intentional acquisition of communication contents with a reasonable expectation of privacy and a warrant requirement for law enforcement purposes. It does not explicitly distinguish between interception of communications of U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons, and requires a reasonable belief that the person being surveilled is in the United States. Unlike current subsection 101(f)(4), the proposed definition does not have an express requirement for the surveillance device to be installed or used in a specific location. The proposed amendment to FISA expands the definition of \"electronic surveillance\" to include intentional acquisition of communication contents with a reasonable expectation of privacy and a warrant requirement for law enforcement purposes. It involves intentionally directing surveillance at a known person and does not require the surveillance device to be installed in a specific location. The proposed provision applies to the intentional acquisition of any communication, not limited to radio communications. The proposed amendment to FISA expands the definition of \"electronic surveillance\" to include intentional acquisition of communication contents with a reasonable expectation of privacy and a warrant requirement for law enforcement purposes. It involves intentionally directing surveillance at a known person and does not require the surveillance device to be installed in a specific location. The current provision requires that \"both the sender and all the intended recipients are located in the United States,\" while the bill's provision requires that both the sender and all intended recipients be reasonably believed to be located within the United States. Sec. 2(c)(3) of H.R. 5825 amends the definition of \"minimization procedures\" in section 101(h), 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801(h), to delete subsection (4). The proposed amendment to FISA expands the definition of \"electronic surveillance\" to include intentional acquisition of communication contents with a reasonable expectation of privacy and a warrant requirement for law enforcement purposes. It involves directing surveillance at a known person and does not require the surveillance device to be installed in a specific location. Sec. 2(d) of the bill outlines procedures for handling communication contents involving a United States person, emphasizing the need for court orders or Attorney General approval. Sec. 2(e) of H.R. 5825 amends the definition of \"surveillance device\" and sec. 3 expands the scope of information covered under FISA. Sec. 3 of H.R. 5825 amends section 102 of FISA to allow the President, through the Attorney General, to authorize electronic surveillance without a court order for up to one year, targeting foreign powers or agents of foreign powers for acquiring foreign intelligence information. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) defines a \"foreign power\" as a foreign government, faction of a foreign nation, or entity controlled by a foreign government. An \"agent of a foreign power\" is someone who acts in the U.S. on behalf of a foreign entity, as outlined in FISA. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) defines a \"foreign power\" as a foreign government, faction of a foreign nation, or entity controlled by a foreign government. An \"agent of a foreign power\" is someone who acts in the U.S. on behalf of a foreign entity, engaging in clandestine intelligence activities contrary to U.S. interests. Proposed minimization procedures for surveillance must meet defined criteria. The proposed subsection 102(a) of FISA, as amended by H.R. 5825, requires the Attorney General to report minimization procedures to congressional intelligence committees. Immediate action can be taken if necessary. Unlike current FISA requirements, the new section 102 does not mandate certification that surveillance will not acquire U.S. person communications. Sec. 3(a) of H.R. 5825 does not require certification that surveillance will not acquire U.S. person communications in the new section 102 of FISA. Both current section 102(a)(2) and proposed subsection 102(b) of FISA mandate electronic surveillance to be conducted in accordance with the Attorney General's certification and minimization procedures. The Attorney General is also required to assess compliance with minimization procedures and report to congressional intelligence committees. Additionally, both current section 102(a)(3) and proposed subsection 102(c) of FISA require the Attorney General to transmit a copy of his certification to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court under seal. The Chief Justice of the United States, with the concurrence of the Attorney General and in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, has established security procedures. The Attorney General's certification must remain sealed unless needed for a court order under FISA or to determine the legality of surveillance. H.R. 5825 creates a new section allowing the President, through the Attorney General, to authorize the acquisition of foreign intelligence information for up to one year under certain criteria. The certification for acquiring foreign intelligence information must meet specific criteria, including not constituting electronic surveillance, involving assistance from communication service providers, having a significant purpose of obtaining foreign intelligence, and implementing minimization procedures. Proposed section 102A of FISA requires the Attorney General to transmit a certification to the FISC for acquiring foreign intelligence information, maintaining it under seal unless needed for legality assessment. Compliance with minimization procedures and reporting to congressional intelligence are also mandated. The Attorney General's certification under proposed section 102A of FISA for acquiring foreign intelligence information parallels current and proposed section 102 of FISA. The government can direct communication carriers to provide necessary assistance for electronic surveillance while maintaining secrecy and compensating carriers for their cooperation. The government can direct communication carriers to provide assistance for electronic surveillance under new section 102B of FISA, compensating them at prevailing rates. The Attorney General may require immediate provision of information, facilities, and assistance to protect the secrecy of surveillance and minimize interference with customer services. The Attorney General may require a person to maintain records related to electronic surveillance under approved security procedures. Compensation can be provided by the government for assistance in surveillance. Non-compliance with directives may result in a petition to compel compliance by the FISC, with contempt of court as a possible punishment. A person receiving a directive under section 102B(a) may challenge its legality by filing a petition under seal before the FISC petition review pool. The judge assigned to the petition must conduct an initial review within 24 hours. If deemed frivolous, the petition will be denied, otherwise, the judge has 72 hours to make a determination. A petition to modify or set aside a directive may only be granted if the judge finds it necessary. A directive under section 102A can be modified or set aside if found unlawful by a judge. Otherwise, it remains in full effect. Appeals can be made to the Court of Review within seven days, and further to the U.S. Supreme Court if needed. All petitions under this section are filed under seal, and the court may review ex parte and in camera upon government request. Upon government request, the court shall review ex parte and in camera any submission containing classified information. Compliance with a directive under section 102B cannot be subject to legal action. Information obtained under this directive regarding a U.S. person can only be used and disclosed by federal officers in accordance with minimization procedures. Privileged communications obtained under proposed sections 102, 102A, or 102B of FISA retain their privileged status. Information from electronic surveillance or foreign intelligence acquisition can only be used or disclosed as specified. Under proposed section 102A of FISA, intelligence information can only be used by federal officers for lawful purposes. Information obtained under section 102B can only be disclosed for law enforcement purposes with authorization from the Attorney General. If the government plans to use information from electronic surveillance or acquisition in a federal trial against an individual, they must notify the individual and the court beforehand. H.R. 5825 requires notification to aggrieved persons, courts, and the U.S. Attorney General before using information from electronic surveillance in legal proceedings. The individual can move to suppress evidence if unlawfully obtained. The motion to suppress evidence can be made if information was unlawfully acquired or not in conformity with FISA authorization. Review mechanisms are provided if notification is made regarding the use of obtained information or if a motion is filed to suppress evidence. The Attorney General can file an affidavit under oath to protect national security interests in cases related to electronic surveillance or acquisition of foreign intelligence information. The U.S. district court will review the application and relevant materials in camera and ex parte to determine the lawfulness of the surveillance or acquisition. The court may disclose portions of the directive or materials related to the acquisition to the aggrieved person if necessary to determine legality. Evidence obtained unlawfully shall be suppressed, while lawfully obtained evidence will not be. The court will grant the aggrieved person's motion if due process requires disclosure or discovery. Decisions under section 102B regarding electronic surveillance or acquisition are final and binding on federal and state courts, except for the U.S. Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court. Proposed subsections 102B(i) to (p) are similar to current subsections 106(c) to (h) of FISA. Federal officers acquiring foreign intelligence information may coordinate with law enforcement personnel under proposed subsection 102B(q). The curr_chunk discusses the coordination efforts to investigate or protect against various threats by foreign powers or their agents, including attacks, terrorism, sabotage, and intelligence activities. It also mentions the retention period of directives or orders under new section 102B of FISA. Additionally, there are conforming amendments to the table of contents of FISA and amendments to section 103 of FISA in H.R. 5825. Sec. 4 of H.R. 5825 amends FISA to require written authorization from the President for electronic surveillance orders. Sec. 5 amends requirements for court orders for electronic surveillance under FISA. The bill amends FISA to require written authorization from the President for electronic surveillance orders, including a summary description of the information sought and certifications by designated officials for foreign intelligence purposes. The bill amends FISA to require written authorization from the President for electronic surveillance orders, including a summary description of the information sought and certifications by designated officials for foreign intelligence purposes. The application for a FISC order would also include a summary statement of the means by which the surveillance will be effected, previous applications made, and the period of time for which the surveillance is required. The bill amends FISA to require written authorization from the President for electronic surveillance orders, including a summary description of the information sought and certifications by designated officials for foreign intelligence purposes. Current subsections 104(c) through (e) would be redesignated subsections 104(b) through (d) by Sec. 5(3) of H.R. 5825. Current subsection 104(e), redesignated subsection 104(d) by Sec. 5(3) of H.R. 5825, directs the Attorney General to personally review applications for a FISC order authorizing electronic surveillance of a target who acts in the United States as an officer or employee of a foreign power, or as a member of a group engaged in international terrorism. Sec. 6 of H.R. 5825 expands the list of officials who can trigger personal review by the Attorney General for electronic surveillance orders under FISA. It amends the necessary findings for FISC judges to issue ex parte orders for electronic surveillance, including redesignating subsections of FISA. The bill amends FISA to remove a requirement for specifying coverage of surveillance devices and minimization procedures in electronic surveillance orders. This change aligns with a similar deletion in a previous bill. The bill amends FISA by removing requirements for specifying surveillance device coverage and minimization procedures in electronic surveillance orders. It also redesignates certain subsections of FISA related to the duration and extension of orders for electronic surveillance. The bill amends FISA by removing requirements for specifying surveillance device coverage and minimization procedures in electronic surveillance orders. It also redesignates certain subsections of FISA related to the duration and extension of orders for electronic surveillance, including provisions for different time periods based on the target of the surveillance. The current law allows for extensions of up to one year for electronic surveillance orders under FISA targeting foreign powers or international terrorism groups not composed mainly of U.S. persons. Amendments to FISA permit extensions to be granted on the same basis as the original order upon application for an extension and new findings. The bill amends FISA to allow the Attorney General to authorize emergency electronic surveillance in specific situations where obtaining a court order is not immediately feasible. The requirements include determining the existence of an emergency situation, the factual basis for surveillance, informing a FISC judge, and making the necessary notifications. The bill amends FISA to allow emergency electronic surveillance authorized by the Attorney General in urgent situations. The Attorney General must determine the emergency, provide factual basis for surveillance, inform a FISC judge, and apply for a FISC order within 168 hours. The bill amends FISA to allow emergency electronic surveillance authorized by the Attorney General in urgent situations. The surveillance must follow minimization procedures and terminate when information is obtained, application is denied, or after 168 hours. If no order is issued approving the surveillance, no information obtained can be used in any proceeding. The bill amends FISA to allow emergency electronic surveillance authorized by the Attorney General in urgent situations, with strict termination guidelines. Surveillance must end when information is obtained, application is denied, or after 168 hours. Review of denied applications can be done as per section 103 of FISA. The bill amends FISA to allow emergency electronic surveillance authorized by the Attorney General in urgent situations, with strict termination guidelines. Surveillance must end when information is obtained, application is denied, or after 168 hours. The redesignated subsection 105(h) of FISA bars court action against any provider of electronic communication services or other specified persons who assist in accordance with court orders or requests for emergency assistance under FISA. Sec. 6(8) of H.R. 5825 proposes adding a new subsection 105(i) to FISA, requiring a FISC judge to authorize the use of pen registers and trap and trace devices for electronic surveillance. This provision allows for the acquisition of dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling information related to communications without being subject to minimization procedures. Sec. 7 of the bill would also amend subsection 106(i) of FISA, addressing the destruction of information unintentionally acquired through surveillance devices. The bill H.R. 5825 proposes amendments to FISA regarding the acquisition and retention of communication contents. It allows for the acquisition of unintentionally acquired information from any communication, not just radio communications, under certain circumstances. The Attorney General can permit retention of this information if it contains significant foreign intelligence or indicates a threat of harm. Section 8 of H.R. 5825 amends congressional oversight provisions in FISA and the National Security Act of 1947. It requires the Attorney General to inform specific committees about electronic surveillance under Title I of FISA on a semiannual basis. The amendment adds additional requirements for the contents of these reports. The bill would amend FISA to require the Attorney General to report on electronic surveillance authority semiannually to specific committees. This includes analysis and recommendations on FISA amendments, repeal, or continuation without changes. The bill amends the National Security Act of 1947 to require the Attorney General to report on electronic surveillance authority semiannually to specific congressional intelligence committees. This includes informing members and staff on a bipartisan basis as necessary. The bill amends the National Security Act of 1947 to require reporting on intelligence activities to congressional intelligence committees, including informing members and staff as necessary. The bill proposes amending the National Security Act of 1947 to allow the Chair of congressional intelligence committees to inform members and staff of reports on covert actions. Additionally, it includes amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to ensure surveillance orders remain in force even if the target is absent. The bill proposes amending the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to ensure surveillance orders remain in force even if the target is absent, limiting liability for those assisting the government during a specific period. The bill proposes amending the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to ensure surveillance orders remain in force even if the target is absent, limiting liability for those assisting the government during a specific period. No legal action can be taken against individuals providing information to the intelligence community related to a communications intelligence program aimed at protecting the United States from terrorism between September 11, 2001, and 60 days after the enactment of the Act. The bill proposes amending the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to ensure surveillance orders remain in force even if the target is absent, limiting liability for those assisting the government during a specific period. No legal action can be taken against individuals providing information to the intelligence community related to a communications intelligence program aimed at protecting the United States from terrorism. This section applies to all actions pending on or after the effective date of the Act, with subsection 10(b) allowing certain cases to be removed to federal court. Additionally, the Director of the National Security Agency must submit a report on minimization procedures applied to information concerning United States persons. The bill proposes amending the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to ensure surveillance orders remain in force even if the target is absent, limiting liability for those assisting the government during a specific period. Subsection 11 of the bill requires reports on procedures to minimize acquisition of information on US persons by the NSA, including violations and descriptions of such violations. Information on US persons should not be retained solely for reporting purposes. The bill proposes amending the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to allow electronic surveillance without a court order for up to 90 days following an armed attack on the US, with notification to congressional intelligence committees. The bill proposes amending FISA to allow physical searches without a court order for up to 90 days following an armed attack on the US, with notification to congressional intelligence committees. Sec. 13 of H.R. 5825 proposes adding a new section 112 to FISA, allowing the President to authorize electronic surveillance for up to 90 days following a terrorist attack on the US without an FISC order, with notification to congressional intelligence committees and a judge. Under Sec. 13 of H.R. 5825, Subsection 112(b) of FISA would give the President the authority to continue electronic surveillance for 90-day periods after a terrorist attack with certifications to intelligence committees and a judge. Proposed subsection 112(c) focuses on electronic surveillance of individuals, allowing surveillance if there is a reasonable belief. Proposed subsection 112(d) requires approval from the Attorney General for electronic surveillance if there is a reasonable belief of communication with a terrorist organization. Subsection 112(e) limits electronic surveillance of a US person under FISA to 60 days without FISC approval, unless certified by the President and Attorney General. The President, through the Attorney General, must certify to congressional intelligence committees that continued electronic surveillance of a US person is crucial for national security. Certification must detail reasons for inability to obtain a surveillance order, connection to a terrorist organization, and intelligence gathered from the surveillance. Subsection 112(f) allows information from electronic surveillance to be used for obtaining subsequent surveillance orders under FISA. The President must report to congressional intelligence committees every 30 days on surveillance conducted under this section. H.R. 5825 proposes a new section 113 for authorization of electronic surveillance for up to 90 days to acquire foreign intelligence information. The proposed legislation allows for electronic surveillance without a court order for up to 90 days in cases of imminent threat. The President must notify congressional leadership and intelligence committees. Extensions can be granted based on new certifications. Amendments to the table of contents of FISA would be made. The proposed legislation allows for electronic surveillance without a court order for up to 90 days in cases of imminent threat. The President must notify congressional leadership, intelligence committees, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The notification must specify the threat, reason for broader authority, and details of the surveillance. The proposed legislation allows for electronic surveillance without a court order for up to 90 days in cases of imminent threat. The President may submit subsequent notifications every 90 days to continue surveillance. New subsection 113(c) permits the President to authorize electronic surveillance of an individual under this section. The President can authorize electronic surveillance without a court order for up to 60 days in cases of imminent threat, with approval from the Attorney General. Surveillance must be related to foreign intelligence information and minimization procedures must be followed. Surveillance of a U.S. person requires an FISC order under Title I of FISA if it exceeds 60 days. The Attorney General must certify to congressional intelligence committees that continued electronic surveillance of a US person is vital to national security, describe reasons for inability to obtain a court order, explain affiliation with a threat entity, and detail intelligence obtained. Amendments to FISA are made for technical and conforming purposes. Section 15 of FISA includes technical and conforming amendments related to earlier changes. It amends various sections to reflect redesignation under H.R. 5825, ensuring consistency in the affected sections."
