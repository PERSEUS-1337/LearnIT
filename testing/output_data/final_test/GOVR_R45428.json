    "content": "This report introduces key issues related to sub-Saharan Africa and U.S. policy towards the region, covering economic challenges, governance trends, peace and security issues, and U.S. engagement. It aims to inform Congress on funding for foreign aid and military activities in Africa. Many African countries experienced high economic growth in the early 2000s. In the 2000s, many African countries saw economic growth due to high commodity prices and domestic demand. Some countries experienced middle class expansion, improved access to digital communications, and progress towards U.N. Millennium Development Goals. However, outcomes varied across the region, with resource-rich states showing higher growth but limited poverty alleviation. Economic challenges emerged after 2014 due to weak global commodity prices and poor agricultural conditions, leading to a drop in regional GDP growth. Africa's economic outlook improved moderately due to global growth, leading to rising demand for commodities. The IMF predicts regional growth to reach 4.5% by 2023, with some countries exceeding 6% growth in 2018. Nigeria is recovering from a recession, while South Africa entered one in 2018. Some countries saw declines in per capita income in 2018. Many African economies rely on commodity exports and remain undiversified. The economic situation in Africa is concerning as many countries heavily rely on commodity exports, leading to high debt levels and weak fiscal policies. Despite some improvements in poverty rates, a significant portion of the population still lives below the poverty line and suffers from malnutrition. Only one sub-Saharan African country, the Seychelles, shows signs of economic stability. 21% of sub-Saharan Africans were undernourished in 2016. Only Seychelles is classified as \"high income\" by the World Bank. Six other countries are \"upper-middle-income,\" but wealth distribution and human development indicators are poor. Economic turbulence, poor agricultural conditions, and conflict have hindered progress since 2013. Lack of institutional capacity, corruption, and insecurity further impede socioeconomic improvements. Africa lags behind in human development compared to other regions, with high maternal mortality rates. Africa faces challenges in human development, with high maternal mortality rates, child mortality, stunted growth, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria prevalence. Lack of access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities further impairs health. The region also lags in primary education, with a significant number of children not attending school, especially girls. The labor market struggles to absorb the growing population. Africa's labor market faces challenges in absorbing a growing working-age population, with 79% of Africans unemployed or in vulnerable employment. In 2017, 61% of African workers were in poverty or extreme poverty. The region has a disproportionately youthful population, with 62% of sub-Saharan Africans aged 24 or younger in 2018. Population growth projections estimate roughly 5.3 billion people will live in Africa by 2050. Realizing the economic potential of the youth population presents governments with challenges in delivering social services, political enfranchisement, and jobs. Since the early 1990s, African countries have transitioned to multiparty political systems, with some experiencing peaceful electoral transfers of power while others exhibit autocratic regimes. Some leaders have altered constitutional term limits to stay in power. Recent changes in leadership in The Gambia, Angola, and Ethiopia may present opportunities for reform, although entrenched elites could hinder progress. Africa has seen subregional divergence in democratic governance since the mid-1990s, with Southern and coastal West Africa showing improvements while East and Central Africa have suffered setbacks. Progress in West and Southern Africa remains fragile, with some states dominated by single parties from liberation struggles. In Africa, many countries are still dominated by single parties from liberation struggles, hindering the development of accountable democratic institutions. Accountability for high-level crimes is rare, with state weakness and violence impeding progress in conflict-affected countries. State institutions often fail to meet citizens' needs due to corruption and mismanagement. Sudan, Guinea-Bissau, and Equatorial Guinea rank low on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index. Corruption also affects economic powerhouses like Nigeria, Kenya, and Angola. Weak justice systems in Africa are often influenced by politics, leading to a lack of public trust and incidents of vigilante justice. Human rights conditions vary across the continent, with challenges including security abuses, poor prison conditions, violence against women and children, discrimination, and human trafficking. Multiple African countries restrict citizens' right to dissent through protest bans and violent repression. Media and civil society in authoritarian countries face state intimidation. Violence against civilians, including by state security forces, is a major concern in several countries. Police in various nations have been accused of using excessive force and mistreating detainees. Local populations in some countries face attacks by Islamist extremist groups and abuses by national militaries. Internal conflicts and state repression in certain countries have featured high levels of violence. Internal conflicts and/or state repression in Burundi, DRC, and South Sudan have seen high levels of violence and widespread abuses that may amount to war crimes or crimes against humanity. Armed conflict and instability continue to threaten regional security in Africa, contributing to human suffering. The region also faces transnational threats from terrorist groups, illicit trafficking, wildlife crime, and maritime piracy. Violent Islamist extremist groups in Northwest and East Africa have caused humanitarian crises and instability. Mass casualty attacks on various targets have highlighted their ability to carry out complex operations. Factors such as family circumstances, religious ideology, economic pressures, and government actions contribute to extremist recruitment in Africa. State repression and internal conflicts in countries like Burundi, DRC, and South Sudan have led to high levels of violence and human rights abuses. Maritime Security in Africa's coastal waters, including the Gulf of Guinea, Gulf of Aden, and western Indian Ocean, faces challenges such as illegal fishing, trafficking, piracy, and smuggling of people, drugs, and weapons. The Gulf of Guinea has high rates of piracy and armed robbery, while international efforts have reduced pirate attacks off the Somali coast. Other transnational threats in Africa include porous borders, corruption, and weak law enforcement allowing for criminal activities. Transnational crime networks operate in Africa due to porous borders, corruption, and weak law enforcement. U.S. policymakers are concerned about links between drug traffickers and armed groups, as well as illegal poaching and wildlife trafficking. Some African countries have made progress in curbing these activities, while others lack capacity or political will. The United States is the top funder of U.N. peacekeeping operations in sub-Saharan Africa and provides training and equipment to peacekeeping personnel. The United States supports African stability operations through funding Peacekeeping Operations and International Narcotics Control. African states, such as Ethiopia, Rwanda, Ghana, and Tanzania, contribute significantly to peacekeeping missions. In the Lake Chad Basin region, Boko Haram and IS-West Africa have caused a humanitarian crisis, particularly affecting civilians in Nigeria's northeast. In the Muslim northeast and border areas of Cameroon, Chad, and Niger, violence has killed over 15,500 people since 2011. 2.4 million people are internally displaced, with 220,000 refugees. A U.S.-backed regional force led by Nigeria has limited Boko Haram's control but struggles to subdue the groups. In Mali, Islamist armed groups have expanded their reach despite international interventions. Violence between herders and farmers in Nigeria has also escalated. The conflict in South Sudan has caused significant concern for U.S. policymakers, with attempts to negotiate peace failing to bring sustainable results. A peace deal signed in 2018 has reduced violence in some areas, but continues in others. The war has resulted in nearly 400,000 deaths and displaced over 4 million people, with acute food insecurity affecting millions. In late 2018, 6 million South Sudanese, including 47,000 facing famine-like conditions, required humanitarian aid. Conflict persists in Sudan, particularly in Darfur, Southern Kordofan, and Blue Nile states. The peace process in Darfur remains stalled, exacerbating dire humanitarian needs. In mid-2018, 7.1 million Sudanese needed humanitarian assistance. Al Shabaab continues to pose a threat in Somalia, targeting Somali state, AMISOM, and international entities. In Somalia, Al Shabaab poses a threat to Somali state, AMISOM, and international targets, killing thousands of civilians. A small Islamic State faction in northern Somalia also poses a threat. In DRC, instability has persisted since the mid-1990s, leading to a protracted humanitarian crisis with 4.5 million internally displaced people as of early 2018. In DRC as of early 2018, there are twice as many internally displaced people compared to 2015, with 800,000 Congolese refugees and 13.1 million in need of humanitarian assistance. In CAR, conflict and state collapse since 2013 have led to widespread violence against civilians and the disintegration of state institutions. In Cameroon, protests over the marginalization of English speakers have escalated into a separatist insurgency with government forces and rebel groups committing abuses against civilians. In Burundi, President Pierre Nkurunziza's reelection to a third term in 2015 sparked a violent political crisis, leading to widespread abuses against civilians and a displacement crisis. Nearly 400,000 Burundians were refugees, while 160,000 were internally displaced. National Security Advisor John Bolton outlined the Trump Administration's policy approach toward Africa, focusing on expanding trade, countering terrorism, and imposing stricter conditions on aid and peacekeeping missions. The Trump Administration's policy towards Africa aims to counter China and Russia's influence on the continent through bilateral engagement, fair trade agreements, and economic deregulation. This approach contrasts with the expanding roles of other foreign actors in Africa. The Trump Administration's policy towards Africa focuses on economic deregulation, streamlining U.N. peacekeeping missions, promoting U.S. trade preferences under AGOA, responding to infectious diseases, advancing democracy, strengthening states, and taking unilateral action for national security interests. Other goals include normalizing relations with Sudan, resolving conflicts in South Sudan, facilitating electoral transition in DRC, and implementing reforms in Ethiopia. Officials are also urging African states to cut ties with North Korea. The Trump Administration has proposed the Africa-focused trade initiative \"Prosper Africa\" and maintained existing initiatives like PEPFAR, FTF, YALI, and Power Africa. PEPFAR combats HIV/AIDS, FTF improves food access, and YALI supports young African leaders. The Trump Administration has proposed changes to foreign assistance in Africa, including aid cuts based on government corruption and actions against U.S. interests. This could impact U.S.-Africa relations and the administration aims to direct aid to countries with democratic governance. The Trump Administration's proposed changes to foreign assistance in Africa focus on aiding countries with democratic governance. This policy could impact aid programs in conflict-affected or authoritarian countries. Immigration policies have also influenced U.S.-Africa relations, with executive orders affecting entry from certain African countries. The Trump Administration's foreign assistance changes in Africa focus on aiding countries with democratic governance, impacting aid programs in conflict-affected or authoritarian countries. Immigration policies have also influenced U.S.-Africa relations, with restrictions on visas for nationals of African countries. African leaders reacted negatively to derogatory remarks attributed to President Trump. Assistant Secretary of State Tibor Nagy challenges perceptions of U.S. indifference, while National Security Advisor Bolton prioritizes countering Chinese and Russian influence in Africa. Bolton accused both countries of engaging in predatory practices on the continent. China's influence in Africa is criticized for engaging in corrupt and exploitative practices, dominating extractive industries, and creating unsustainable debts. The region's potential as a growth market raises concerns over competition with Chinese and Russian actors. China became Africa's largest trading partner in 2009 and has been involved in constructing infrastructure projects across the continent. China's involvement in Africa includes constructing infrastructure projects using Chinese state financing and goods, tied to access to African resources. China's \"One Belt, One Road\" initiative expands these activities, raising concerns for the United States. In 2017, China established its first overseas military base in Djibouti, extending its armed forces' reach and influence. The proximity of Chinese and U.S. bases in Djibouti has led to tensions, with reports of Chinese lasers being directed at U.S. aircraft. Russia has also increased its presence in Africa, signing military cooperation deals with African states since 2014. Russian engagement focuses on arms sales, military training, intelligence exchanges, and access to minerals. The Central African Republic has seen over 200 Russian military and private security personnel deployed since 2017. The Horn of Africa is gaining strategic importance, with various countries like UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey, Russia, and China increasing their involvement and establishing military bases in the region. Foreign powers like China, Russia, and Gulf actors have established military bases in the Horn of Africa region. The United States has a goods trade deficit with Africa, importing $24.9 billion and exporting $14.1 billion in 2017. U.S. exports are diverse, while imports are mainly primary products, with oil accounting for over 40%. The United States has a goods trade deficit with Africa, with motor vehicles and apparel being significant exports. U.S. trade with the region is mainly with Nigeria and South Africa. Foreign direct investment is concentrated in countries like Mauritius, South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, and Tanzania. U.S. policy aims to promote economic growth through trade in the region and internationally. The U.S. government aims to enhance trade and investment opportunities for U.S. firms in Africa. Concerns have risen over China's increasing trade with Africa surpassing U.S. trade, leading to questions about lost export opportunities and foreign policy influence. Despite improving economic and political climates in some African countries, many U.S. businesses remain hesitant about investing in the region. U.S. businesses are hesitant to invest in Africa due to economic governance challenges, difficulty of doing business, and political instability. U.S. efforts to boost trade with Africa focus on improving local economic conditions through trade preferences like AGOA and aid for trade capacity building. The U.S. aims to enhance international trade with Africa by providing trade capacity building funds and promoting U.S. business activity in the region. Efforts include establishing trade hubs to increase export competitiveness and advancing initiatives like the Trade Africa Initiative and the President's Advisory Council on Africa. The Advisory Council on Africa provides recommendations to facilitate U.S. commercial engagement in the region. OPIC offers loans, guarantees, and insurance for U.S. private investment in developing economies. The BUILD Act creates a new U.S. International Development Finance Corporation combining OPIC and certain USAID components. The new International Development Finance Corporation (IDFC) has expanded authority and capacity compared to current U.S. development finance activities, with a $60 billion exposure cap. This reorganization is seen as a tool to counter China's economic influence in developing countries, including Africa. Other agencies promoting U.S. exports to Africa include the Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank) and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA). The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) promotes export opportunities for U.S. businesses in Africa by providing access to finance and supporting trade-expanding efforts. It is part of U.S. trade and investment policy tools in place with African countries, including Trade and Investment Framework Agreements (TIFAs) and bilateral investment treaties. The United States encourages African participation in multilateral efforts to reduce trade barriers through Trade Capacity Building (TCB) support. AGOA is a U.S. trade preference program that promotes African development and strengthens U.S.-African trade ties. It provides duty-free tariff treatment on imports from eligible sub-Saharan African countries, covering a wider range of products than the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). The program was first passed in 2000 and has been extended multiple times, most recently in 2015. The Extension Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-27) extended AGOA's authorization for 10 years to September 2025. Thirty-nine sub-Saharan African countries were eligible for AGOA benefits in 2018. The 18th AGOA Forum in July 2018 focused on U.S. interest in reciprocal trade agreements in the region. Congress directed the executive branch to pursue such agreements with interested countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Negotiations for a U.S.-Southern African Customs Union (SACU) FTA began in 2003 but were halted in 2006. The issue resurfaced during the 2015 AGOA reauthorization debate, with concerns about U.S. exporters facing disadvantages in African markets. AGOA was reauthorized for 10 years, with a focus on seeking reciprocal agreements in Africa. Total U.S. imports under AGOA were $13.5 billion in 2017, with energy products, mainly crude oil, being the top import. In 2017, U.S. imports under AGOA totaled $13.5 billion, with energy products, particularly crude oil, being the top import. Nonenergy trade under AGOA has also seen growth, with South Africa accounting for over half of the $4.3 billion in nonenergy imports. Other major beneficiaries include Kenya, Lesotho, Mauritius, and Madagascar, primarily exporting apparel products. The Trump Administration has focused on U.S. trade policy, including the trade deficit, foreign trade barriers, and import competition on U.S. manufacturing. The Trump Administration has focused on U.S. trade policy, including the trade deficit, foreign trade barriers, and the effects of import competition on U.S. manufacturing. U.S. trade with Africa may be of less concern, but changes in trade policy could significantly impact trade with countries like South Africa, especially with increased tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. South Africa was a significant supplier of affected U.S. steel and aluminum imports in 2017. The Administration has granted product exclusions for some imports from South Africa, but a Section 232 investigation on U.S. motor vehicle imports could lead to increased tariffs. The Trump Administration's focus on U.S. trade policy, including the trade deficit and foreign trade barriers, could impact trade with countries like South Africa. U.S. imports of motor vehicles from South Africa totaled $1.1 billion in 2017. The Administration has discretion in determining country eligibility for preference programs like AGOA, which could be affected by the focus on the trade deficit. AGOA eligibility has been revoked for Rwanda and Mauritania for protectionism and human rights concerns. Previous Administrations also revoked eligibility for issues related to governance and labor rights. The Trump Administration's focus on U.S. trade policy, including trade deficit and foreign trade barriers, may impact trade with countries like South Africa. Congress may consult with the Administration on enforcement of eligibility criteria for preference programs like AGOA. The Administration prioritizes reciprocal trade negotiations with Africa, facing challenges similar to past FTAs. The Administration prefers bilateral agreements over regional blocs, showing flexibility in negotiations with limited-scope agreements with the EU and Japan. The Trump Administration prefers bilateral trade agreements over regional blocs, which contrasts with the push for regional integration in Africa. U.S. policymakers use diplomacy and reporting to promote democracy and human rights in Africa, including publicly criticizing undemocratic actions and human rights violations. Congress plays a role in determining the scope of new U.S. agreements in the region. The State Department publishes annual reports on human rights globally, documenting violations and influencing U.S. policy actions. Congress imposes human rights-related restrictions on aid. U.S. aid programs support African electoral institutions, political parties, civil society organizations, and journalists, focusing on governance reforms and capacity-building. Some U.S. security assistance programs in Africa aim to improve human rights records and advance the rule of law through legal and medical aid, as well as funding programs to address specific human rights challenges. Congress imposes human rights-related restrictions on aid to certain African countries. The International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, the Child Soldiers Prevention Act, and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act are key legislation addressing human rights issues in Africa. Countries like Sudan, Eritrea, DRC, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Burundi, Comoros, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Mauritania, and the Republic of Congo are subject to potential restrictions or sanctions under these laws. Sanctions can be imposed on individuals involved in human rights violations or undermining democratic processes. The Trump Administration lifted economic sanctions on Sudan in 2017, citing progress by the Sudanese government. They also issued a new Executive Order targeting global human rights abuses and corruption, imposing financial sanctions on key individuals. The United States has funded special tribunals for human rights violations in Sierra Leone, Rwanda, and Chad, but is not a state party to the International Criminal Court. The United States is not a member of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and has laws prohibiting cooperation with the Court. The Trump Administration has stopped supporting ICC prosecutions and instead focuses on charging human rights abusers in African countries under U.S. immigration laws. U.S. aid for Africa primarily targets health challenges like HIV/AIDS and malaria. The United States provides aid to address health challenges such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, maternal and child health, and nutrition in Africa. Aid programs also focus on economic growth, development, humanitarian needs, good governance, and security. USAID administers much of the aid, while the State Department and MCC support various programs and projects to bolster health, rule of law, counter trafficking, and improve infrastructure in African countries. In recent years, sub-Saharan Africa has generally received between 20% and 25% of total U.S. bilateral aid administered by the State Department and USAID. In FY2017, $7.03 billion in total bilateral State Department- and USAID-administered funds were allocated specifically to African countries. Top recipients included Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Mozambique, Zambia, Uganda, Ethiopia, Somalia, and DRC. Many countries receive additional globally or functionally allocated aid. The United States channels substantial aid to Africa through various means, including multilateral bodies like the World Bank. In FY2019, the Administration proposed $5.28 billion specifically for Africa, a 25% decrease from FY2017. Funding for Africa through the Food for Peace program reached $1.32 billion in FY2017, with $1.02 billion for emergency humanitarian purposes. The Trump Administration proposed reducing and reallocating U.S. aid funding for Africa in FY2019, with $1.02 billion allocated for emergency humanitarian purposes. Congress did not largely adopt the Administration's proposals for foreign aid appropriations in FY2018 and FY2019. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request aimed to balance U.S. national security interests with domestic fiscal needs. It proposed reducing aid funding for Africa, including ending Food for Peace aid to African countries. Additionally, the Administration suggested merging Development Assistance and Economic Support Fund accounts into a new Economic Support and Development Fund. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget proposed reducing aid funding for Africa, including ending Food for Peace aid. It suggested merging Development Assistance and Economic Support Fund accounts into a new Economic Support and Development Fund. Congress did not adopt these proposals in the FY2018 omnibus appropriations act. Pending appropriations bills would maintain global funding levels for security assistance in Africa, focusing on counterterrorism efforts. The largest share of security assistance in Africa in the past decade, totaling over $2 billion, has supported African forces fighting Al Shabaab in Somalia. The State Department and DOD administer various types of security assistance authorized by Congress, primarily through the Peacekeeping Operations account. This funding supports counterterrorism, maritime security, and security sector reform in Africa, including programs like TSCTP and PREACT. H.R. 6018, passed by the House during the 115th Congress, aimed to establish TSCTP in law with new notification and reporting requirements. State Department programs in Africa focus on law enforcement, military professionalization, security forces' capacity, and antitrafficking activities. Funding for these programs comes from various accounts, including PKO, INCLE, and NADR. DOD implements some State Department programs like IMET and also funds certain initiatives. The DOD administers security cooperation programs to build foreign partner states' capacity, including the global train and equip program under Section 333. Top African recipients of this assistance include Kenya, Uganda, Niger, Chad, Somalia, Mauritania, and Cameroon. DOD is also authorized to assist in countering wildlife crime and cooperative threat reduction. The expanding U.S. military presence in Africa has drawn attention following attacks on U.S. Special Operations Forces in Niger and Somalia. Approximately 7,200 DOD personnel are in Africa, with the majority in Djibouti at Camp Lemonnier. Niger has the second-largest deployment, with 730 troops engaged in various activities, including constructing a new airfield in Agadez. There are an estimated 1,200 SOF members in Africa, involved in training and other operations. The U.S. military presence in Africa includes around 1,200 Special Operations Forces (SOF) members engaged in various missions. The 2018 Posture Statement of U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) outlined efforts to enhance security in East Africa, combat extremist groups in the Sahel and Maghreb regions, contain Boko Haram and ISIS-West Africa, interdict illicit activities, and build African peacekeeping capacities. Enduring tasks include protecting personnel and facilities, maintaining access, and building partner capacity. The U.S. military presence in Africa involves around 1,200 Special Operations Forces engaged in missions to enhance security, combat extremist groups, contain Boko Haram and ISIS-West Africa, interdict illicit activities, and build African peacekeeping capacities. AFRICOM's \"By, With, and Through\" framework emphasizes supporting local partners and the European Union to degrade terrorists and counter various threats with limited outside assistance. The U.S. military provides training, equipment, intelligence, logistical support, and advisory support to African partner forces, as well as logistical and intelligence support to French forces in the Sahel. The U.S. military provides training, equipment, intelligence, logistical support, and advisory support to African partner forces, as well as logistical and intelligence support to French forces in the Sahel. In Somalia, the number of U.S. military personnel increased significantly in 2017 to assist Somali and AU counterterrorism missions, including direct action against terrorist threats. The U.S. military expanded its operations in Somalia to counter Al Qaeda and Al Shabaab, supporting Somali and AMISOM forces. President Trump authorized lethal action against Al Shabaab in a defined area of hostilities. Some airstrikes were conducted in self-defense. Operation Observant Compass, a U.S. military advisory mission, was ended in 2017. Compass (OOC) is a U.S. military advisory mission deployed in 2011 to support African-led efforts against the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in CAR, South Sudan, and DRC. AFRICOM noted progress in degrading the LRA and transitioning some personnel to broader security activities in Central Africa. U.S. military also conducts exercises with African militaries, shares skills in disaster response, humanitarian aid, and maritime security. U.S. military personnel are deployed in U.N. peacekeeping operations and at U.S. Embassies in Africa. The Trump Administration has broadened U.S. military involvement in Somalia, including lethal action against Al Shabaab. There has been an increase in U.S. air strikes and the use of military advisors in Africa. Military commanders are reevaluating some missions after the deadly ambush in Niger. The administration has shifted focus to inter-state strategic competition as the primary concern in national security. The U.S. national security focus has shifted to strategic competition over terrorism. The Department of Defense plans to reduce military forces in Africa Command by about 10% and reorient missions towards great power competition. The implications of the downsizing and its impact on specific missions are unclear. Counterterrorism activities will be de-emphasized overall, with operations in Somalia, Djibouti, and Libya remaining largely the same. The 115th Congress has influenced U.S. engagement with Africa through legislation. The 115th Congress influenced U.S.-Africa policy through legislation, including acts like the African Growth and Opportunity Act and the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Amendment Act. They also responded to humanitarian crises in specific countries. The 115th Congress influenced U.S.-Africa policy through legislation, responding to humanitarian crises in Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, and Yemen. They also addressed human rights violations and undemocratic governance in Ethiopia, DRC, and Zimbabwe, as well as U.S. military engagement in Africa. Significant challenges and opportunities in Africa, including civil rights issues, China's role, and U.S. military engagement. Congress may consider issues like shifting politics in the Horn of Africa, ongoing conflicts in South Sudan, Somalia, DRC, and other regions, armed Islamist extremist threats, and expanding democracy in Africa. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges and opportunities in Africa, including expanding democracy, upcoming presidential elections in various countries, U.S.-Africa trade and investment issues, and U.S. military deployments in the region. It also mentions U.S. foreign assistance to African countries in the context of the Trump Administration's policies. The focus of U.S. foreign assistance to African countries in the context of the Trump Administration's forthcoming FY2020 aid budget proposal and FY2019 country allocations decisions, as well as the involvement of foreign powers like China, Russia, and Gulf states in Africa. Congress may use various tools to shape U.S.-Africa policy, including foreign aid and defense legislation, direct engagement with the Administration and African leaders, and oversight activities. The 115th Congress maintained a focus on U.S. trade and investment, humanitarian crisis response, human rights, democracy, and military activities in Africa. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges of balancing U.S. diplomacy, development, economic engagement, and defense priorities in Africa in response to emerging developments in the region."
