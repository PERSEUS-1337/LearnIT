    "content": "The Act titled \"Haiti Economic Recovery Opportunity Act of 2002\" provides trade benefits to Haiti under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act. A new section, \"Special Rule for Haiti,\" is added to the existing legislation. The Haiti Economic Recovery Opportunity Act of 2002 grants duty-free entry to apparel articles from Haiti if they meet specific criteria regarding their assembly and origin of materials from certain countries. The text outlines the criteria for countries to receive preferential treatment under free trade agreements with the United States, including specific designations and conditions related to fabric and yarn availability. The preferential treatment under free trade agreements with the United States includes specific criteria for apparel articles imported into the country, with increasing percentages allocated annually based on previous import data. Haiti is eligible for preferential treatment under free trade agreements with the United States if it meets criteria such as establishing a market-based economy, protecting private property rights, and ensuring the rule of law and political pluralism. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of protection under the law, eliminating barriers to trade and investment, economic policies to reduce poverty and improve healthcare and education, and promoting private enterprise and capital markets. The curr_chunk emphasizes the need for a system to combat corruption and bribery, protection of worker rights, and not engaging in activities that undermine US national security or foreign policy interests. The amendment made by subsection (a) applies to goods entered on or after October 1, 2002, and allows for retroactive application to certain entries upon proper request filed within 90 days of the enactment of this Act. The goods described in the amendment made by subsection (a) can be liquidated or reliquidated if they were entered between October 1, 2002, and the date of the enactment of this Act, and would have had no duty under the new amendment."
