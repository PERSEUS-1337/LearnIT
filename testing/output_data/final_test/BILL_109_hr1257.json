The US Department of Agriculture has spent over $100 million searching for alternatives with limited success. The critical use exemption of the Montreal Protocol allows for its use if no alternatives are available, to prevent market disruption. In 2001, the US EPA and USDA began documenting methyl bromide needed for critical uses in domestic agriculture. EPA assembled experts to review applications, reducing requested amounts by 22%. This was confirmed by the Parties to the Montreal Protocol. After extensive research and technical review, the United States State Department and the Environmental Protection Agency have determined that the critical use methyl bromide qualifies as \"critical\" due to the significant market disruption that would occur without its availability. After extensive research and technical review, the United States State Department and the Environmental Protection Agency have concluded that there are no feasible alternatives for the critical use of methyl bromide requested in the nomination. Their findings align with the criteria for approving critical use requests under the Montreal Protocol. The United States 2006 CUE request for methyl bromide represents a small percentage of ozone depletion potential. Legislation is needed to ensure a smooth transition for agriculture to phase out methyl bromide, as suitable alternatives are currently lacking. Authorization of the critical use exemption amounts identified by the State Department is necessary. In 2007, critical use exemptions for methyl bromide were discussed in the Montreal Protocol meeting. Critical use exemptions for methyl bromide were discussed in the Montreal Protocol meeting in 2007. The Clean Air Act is amended to establish critical use exemptions for the years 2006 and 2007 for methyl bromide, based on decisions made in the Montreal Protocol meetings. The Administrator is required to issue a final rule authorizing these exemptions within 90 days of enactment. Table 1 below allocates amounts for critical-use exemptions for 2006 and 2007. The Critical Use Exemptions for 2006 and 2007 approved by the Parties to the Montreal Protocol are 6897.68 tonnes and 8425 tonnes respectively. Deplete the Ozone Layer, Critical Use Exemptions Annex, Section III, for a total of 9092.263 tonnes."
