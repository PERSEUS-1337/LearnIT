Amendment to section 408(d) of the Internal Revenue Code exempts qualified charitable distributions from gross income. The \"Public Good IRA Rollover Act of 2007\" allows tax-free distributions from individual retirement accounts for charitable purposes. Qualified charitable distributions are exempt from gross income and are subject to age restrictions. The \"Public Good IRA Rollover Act of 2007\" allows tax-free distributions from individual retirement accounts for charitable purposes, with restrictions on who can hold an income interest in the split-interest entity receiving the distribution. Contributions must be deductible for the distribution to be considered a qualified charitable distribution. The \"Public Good IRA Rollover Act of 2007\" allows tax-free distributions from individual retirement accounts for charitable purposes, with restrictions on who can hold an income interest in the split-interest entity receiving the distribution. Contributions must be deductible for the distribution to be considered a qualified charitable distribution. Distribution to a split-interest entity is qualified only if a deduction for the entire value of the interest for the use of a charitable organization would be allowable under section 170. In determining if a distribution is a qualified charitable distribution, the entire amount shall be included in gross income if it does not exceed the aggregate amount that would be included if all amounts were distributed from individual retirement accounts. Adjustments will be made for other distributions in the taxable year and subsequent years, with special rules for split-interest entities like charitable remainder trusts. Distributions from charitable remainder trusts and pooled income funds are treated as ordinary income for beneficiaries. Qualified charitable distributions to pooled income funds are not included in gross income. Qualified charitable distributions are treated as ordinary income to the beneficiary and are not considered an investment in a charitable gift annuity. These distributions are not deductible under section 170 and a split-interest entity is defined as a charitable remainder annuity trust or unitrust. The amendment applies to distributions made after December 31, 2006, and includes charitable remainder unitrusts, pooled income funds, and charitable gift annuities."
