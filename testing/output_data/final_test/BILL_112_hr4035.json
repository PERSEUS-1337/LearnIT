The \"Philanthropic Enterprise Act of 2012\" exempts private foundations from excess business holding tax if the business enterprise meets ownership, distribution, and operation requirements. The \"Philanthropic Enterprise Act of 2012\" exempts private foundations from excess business holding tax if the business enterprise meets ownership, distribution, and operation requirements. The private foundation must hold all ownership interests in the business enterprise and acquire them under a will or trust. The business enterprise must distribute its net operating income to the private foundation within 120 days after the close of the taxable year to meet the minimum distribution requirement. The net operating income of a business enterprise for a taxable year is its gross income reduced by deductions, taxes, and a reasonable reserve for working capital. Independent operation requirements are met if certain conditions are fulfilled throughout the year. Requirements for a private foundation include ensuring no substantial contributor or their family member holds key positions in a business enterprise, the majority of the foundation's board members are not also involved in the enterprise, and no loans exist between the enterprise and a substantial contributor or their family member. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2011, and exclude certain deemed private foundations. SEC. 3 amends the Internal Revenue Code to exempt certain payments from unrelated business tax for philanthropic controlled entities. Effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2011."
