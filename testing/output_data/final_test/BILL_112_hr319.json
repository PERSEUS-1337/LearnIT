    "content": "The \"Veterans Day Off Act\" is the short title of this legislation. It includes definitions for key terms. In this Act, an \"eligible employee\" is defined as a veteran who has been employed for at least 12 months by the employer requesting leave. Exclusions apply to individuals employed by a public agency. The terms \"employ\" and \"employee\" have the same meanings as defined in the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. The term \"employer\" refers to any person engaged in employment. The term \"employer\" in this Act refers to any person engaged in commerce or industry affecting commerce with 50 or more employees, including successors in interest. The term \"person\" has the same meaning as in the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, and \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Labor. SEC. 3. LEAVE REQUIREMENT. Employees are entitled to unpaid leave on Veterans Day, unless it negatively impacts public health or safety, or causes significant economic disruption. Paid leave can be substituted with accrued vacation or personal leave. Employees requesting leave on Veterans Day must provide written notice and documentation of their veteran status at least 30 days before the requested leave. Employers must notify employees of their leave decision at least 10 days before Veterans Day, specifying if the leave will be paid or unpaid. If an employer denies leave requests from multiple eligible employees, they should deny leave to the minimum number of employees possible. SEC. 4. PROHIBITED ACTS. Interference with Rights: Employers cannot interfere with employees taking leave under this Act or discriminate against them for opposing unlawful practices. Interference with Proceedings: It is unlawful to discriminate against individuals for filing charges or providing information related to leave under this Act. Employees cannot be discriminated against for testifying in inquiries or proceedings related to leave provided under this Act. The Secretary has investigative authority under this Act similar to the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. Enforcement of the Act will follow the same terms as the Family and Medical Leave Act. Each employer must post a notice approved by the Secretary, containing information on filing charges under this Act. Willful violation may result in a civil penalty of up to $100 per offense."
