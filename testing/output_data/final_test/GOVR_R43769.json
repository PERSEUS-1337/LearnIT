    "content": "Virtually every federal criminal statute holds helpers and hands-on offenders equally responsible under 18 U.S.C. 2. This secondary liability is similar to conspiracy, as society fears the crimes of multiple individuals. At common law, felonies were punishable by death, with different degrees of guilt including principals and accessories. The common law distinguished between principals and accessories in felony cases, with accessories being those who aided or assisted the felon after the crime. The first Congress outlawed piracy and related crimes, merging the concepts of principal in the second degree and accessory before the fact in piracy cases, imposing the death penalty for those who knowingly aided or commanded such crimes. The piracy provision in federal law was extended in 1909 to cover a wider range of offenses. The 1909 provision eliminated the common law distinctions between principals and accessories before the fact. Congress carried this provision forward in its 1948 recodification, adding a clause to hold individuals accountable for assisting in illegal activities even if they did not directly commit the act. Section 2 of the U.S. Code holds individuals accountable for aiding and abetting in the commission of a crime. A defendant must associate themselves with the criminal venture and actively seek to make it succeed. Aiding and abetting means assisting in someone else's crime, requiring the defendant to embrace the criminal act of another. Section 2(a) of the U.S. Code requires a defendant to knowingly contribute to the success of another person's crime to be convicted of aiding and abetting. The defendant does not need to assist in every aspect of the crime, and even minimal assistance can suffice. However, mere knowledge or assistance without intent is not enough. Additionally, aiding and abetting under \u00a72(a) necessitates that someone else commits a federal offense. The Supreme Court in Standefer rejected the argument that aiding and abetting a principal who has been acquitted of the charged offense is not possible. A completed offense is required for conviction of aiding and abetting, with the offender not needing to be named or convicted. Assistance must be given before or at the time of the offense, as aiding after the crime is a separate offense. Accomplices may sometimes avoid federal principles of secondary criminal liability in conspiracy and aiding and abetting cases, especially when there is a significant culpability gap. This typically involves three types of accomplices: victims, customers, and subordinates. Not all victims qualify for exceptions, as culpability matters. For example, a victim involved in corrupting a public official may be convicted for bribery or as an accomplice to extortion. Customers who have not been convicted as co-conspirators or accomplices are also mentioned. Customers who have escaped conviction as co-conspirators or accomplices include drinkers, bettors, johns, and drug addicts. Supreme Court cases like United States v. Farrar and Rewis v. United States illustrate this, where customers of illegal establishments were not prosecuted as aiders and abettors. Congress did not intend mere bettors to be covered under certain statutes, such as the federal gambling business statute. The same logic may apply to a prostitute's customer. The federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA) reinforces the view that a drug trafficker's customers cannot be prosecuted as co-conspirators or aiders and abettors. Federal law punishes the trafficker severely for possession with intent to distribute, but punishes the customer for simple possession. In Gebardi, the Supreme Court ruled that a woman transported for immoral purposes could not be charged with conspiracy under the Mann Act. Later courts continued to follow this interpretation. Federal courts upheld the Gebardi interpretation of the Mann Act, limiting it to cases where the prostitute only acquiesced to interstate transportation. OSHA does not prosecute employees of offenders as aiders and abettors. Subordinates of federal gambling business offenders can be prosecuted, but treatment of drug kingpin subordinates is unclear. Willfully causing an offense makes one punishable as a principal. The 1948 report clarified that Section 2(b) applies to defendants who use intermediaries, whether knowingly or unknowingly. It doesn't matter if the intermediary is aware of their actions or not, as long as their actions, combined with the defendant's, constitute an offense. The 1951 amendment changed \"causes\" to \"willfully causes\" without much explanation. The 1951 amendment to Section 2(b) changed \"causes\" to \"willfully causes\" without much explanation. Speculation suggests that \"willfully\" was added to address a mental element observed by Judge Learned Hand. Courts interpret \"willfully\" as intending the commission of a crime and using someone else to commit it. Liability can be incurred under \u00a72(b) even if the individual is unaware of the underlying conduct. In aiding and abetting cases, withdrawal may not be a defense like in conspiracy cases. To establish withdrawal, the defendant must show they took affirmative action, such as confessing to authorities or communicating withdrawal to coconspirators. Liability under \u00a72(a) is avoided if the necessary assistance is withdrawn before the offense is committed. Aiding and abetting requires a completed offense, making the question of liability more complex in cases where the crime is not fully carried out. In cases of aiding and abetting, the question of withdrawal as a defense is unsettled. Courts have varied in their interpretation of the withdrawal defense in federal accomplice liability cases. Proponents of a withdrawal defense point to recent dicta in Rosemond, where the Supreme Court suggested that an accomplice may be able to withdraw and avoid liability before the crime is fully committed. In cases of aiding and abetting, withdrawal as a defense is unsettled. The defendant's knowledge of a firearm must be advance knowledge to show intent to aid an armed offense. If an accomplice knows beforehand of a confederate's plan to carry a gun, they can attempt to alter the plan or withdraw from the enterprise. However, if the accomplice only learns of the gun at the scene, they may have already completed their acts of assistance with no opportunity to quit the crime, thus lacking the intent to assist a crime. The defendant must have advance knowledge of a firearm to show intent to aid an armed offense. If an accomplice only learns of the gun at the scene, they may lack the intent to assist a crime involving a gun. The Government disagrees with the strict view on when a defendant must acquire this knowledge. The Government argues that an accomplice in a \u00a7924(c) violation case must have \"foreknowledge\" of a gun's presence to be convicted, even if they learned of the firearm after they could have opted out of the crime. This approach, however, may diminish the requirement that the defendant must intend to further an armed drug deal. For example, if an accomplice agreed to a drug sale with the condition of no guns present but later notices a confederate with a concealed firearm, the Government would still seek conviction. The Government argues that an accomplice in a \u00a7924(c) violation case must have \"foreknowledge\" of a gun's presence to be convicted. However, a jury may find that the defendant only intended a drug sale and not to facilitate a deal involving a gun. The defendant incurs greater liability when knowingly participating in a drug transaction involving a firearm, but not when that knowledge comes too late for them to act upon it. The holding in this case is based on the intent standard for aiding and abetting someone else's act, specifically in relation to a \u00a7924(c) offense. It is argued that a defendant cannot be charged with aiding and abetting if they learn of a gun's presence only after they can realistically walk away. Congress has not enacted a general civil aiding and abetting statute, so there is no presumption that aiders and abettors can be sued along with the primary defendant. Courts have determined that aiders and abettors do not face civil liability for violations of various acts such as the Anti-Terrorism Act, Electronic Communications Privacy Act, Stored Communications Act, or RICO."
