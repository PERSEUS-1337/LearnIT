Section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding a new section, SEC. 7706, which determines worker classification. This section outlines that if specific requirements are met by a service provider, the provider, service recipient, and payor will not be considered as employees or employers, and the compensation for the service will not be treated as employment income. The new section SEC. 7706 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 sets out requirements for worker classification. Service providers must meet specific criteria to be considered independent contractors, not employees, and their compensation will not be treated as employment income. The requirements include incurring significant unreimbursed expenses or facing income fluctuations unrelated to expenses incurred while performing the service. The new section SEC. 7706 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 outlines criteria for independent contractor classification, including significant unreimbursed expenses, non-exclusive service provision, and no prior employment with the service recipient in the past year. The requirements for independent contractor classification include being compensated primarily on a commission basis and having compensation directly related to sales of goods or services. The service provider must also meet the place of business or own equipment requirement. The independent contractor classification requirements include being compensated on a commission basis and having compensation tied to sales. The service provider must have a principal place of business or bear financial responsibility for equipment used. Additionally, services must be performed under a written contract meeting specific criteria. The contract for services must be reported to the IRS, and the service provider is responsible for taxes on compensation. The contract is intended to be considered as described in this subsection and can be renewed for up to one year. The contract for services must be reported to the IRS, and the service provider is responsible for taxes on compensation. Renewals of the contract can be up to 1 year, with updated information required. The contract must be signed when payments exceed $600 for the year. Reporting requirements must be met to determine liability for the service recipient or payor. The liability of the service recipient or payor for taxes on the service provider is determined by meeting reporting requirements. An exception is made for services provided by the owner of the service recipient or payor. The Secretary has limitations on reclassifying services for tax purposes. The Secretary can determine that a service provider should be treated as an employee for tax purposes, effective from the notice date, if certain conditions are met by the service recipient or payor. These conditions include having a written contract, meeting reporting requirements, and demonstrating a reasonable basis for the determination. The service provider should not be considered an employee for tax purposes if the taxpayer can show a reasonable basis for this decision and cooperates with the IRS. The burden of proof then shifts to the IRS. The taxpayer must have a reasonable basis not to treat an individual as an employee for tax purposes. If the IRS determines that a service provider should have been treated as an employee, it will be effective from the notice date if certain conditions are met. The service recipient must meet reporting requirements for relevant taxable years or demonstrate in good faith that the service provider is not an employee. The \"notice date\" is defined as the 30th day after the first letter of proposed deficiency is sent, allowing for administrative review. The Office of Appeals sends notices related to deficiency or determination dates. No restrictions on administrative or judicial review. Definitions include service provider as a qualified person performing services for another qualified person. The term 'person' refers to a natural person or entity. A 'service recipient' is the person or entity for whom services are provided under a written contract. A 'payor' is the person or entity who pays for the services. The Secretary may issue regulations as necessary. This section does not expand the circumstances for treating a service provider or recipient as an employee or employer. The section applies to service regardless of trade or business. Reporting rules for non-employees include aggregate compensation and deductions. The section applies to service regardless of trade or business, including reporting rules for non-employees. It requires a statement with specific information about compensation and contracts, and terms used have the same meaning as in section 7706. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for chapter 79 of the Code. The amendments made by this section regarding worker classification will apply to services performed after December 31, 2016."
