    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commercial Driver Compliance Improvement Act\" and includes provisions for electronic on-board recording devices. The Commercial Driver Compliance Improvement Act includes amendments to define 'driving time' and 'electronic on-board recording device' in the context of regulations for driver duty hours and duty status. The Commercial Driver Compliance Improvement Act requires all commercial motor vehicles in interstate commerce to have electronic on-board recording devices to improve compliance with hours of service regulations. Data retrieval limitations apply to the information recorded by these devices. The Commercial Driver Compliance Improvement Act mandates electronic on-board recording devices for commercial motor vehicles to enforce hours of service regulations. Data from these devices is only admissible in proceedings related to compliance with Federal hours-of-service rules. The owner must consent to information retrieval, or it can be accessed by government agencies for enforcing hours of service regulations under part 395 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations. The amendments made under subsection (a) regarding vehicle data retrieval without owner consent will take effect on the effective date of final regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Transportation. SEC. 3. RULEMAKING. The Secretary of Transportation must establish regulations within 18 months to implement section 31137 of title 49, US Code. These regulations will set performance and design standards for electronic on-board recording devices, including linking to the vehicle's engine control module, identifying drivers, recording driving time accurately, real-time tracking, enabling law enforcement access, and being tamper resistant. The regulations prescribed by the Secretary under this section define a standardized user interface, establish secure processes for data access and transfer, set security levels for electronic on-board recording devices, and approve eligible systems for all motor carriers. Beginning three years after the enactment of this Act, all motor carriers, commercial motor vehicles, and operators must comply with the hours of service and record of duty status requirements under part 395 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations."
