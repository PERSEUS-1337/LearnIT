    "content": "CCC export credit guarantees assure payments for commercial financing of U.S. agricultural exports, with the CCC assuming debt if a foreign buyer defaults. The 2002 farm bill authorized $5.5 billion for guarantees, plus an additional $1 billion for emerging markets. Four programs were authorized, including GSM-102 for short-term financing, GSM-103 for longer-term financing, SCGP for very short-term financing, and FFGP for financing of agriculture-related facilities in emerging markets. In 2006, FAS suspended operation of GSM-103. In 2006, FAS suspended the GSM-103 program and the SCGP due to defaulted obligations and fraud. The Administration requested Congress to repeal legislative authorities for GSM-103 and SCGP, and lift the 1% cap on loan origination fees for GSM-102. The 2008 farm bill repealed authority for SCGP, GSM-103, and the 1% cap on loan origination fees for GSM-102. The new farm bill sets a $40 million annual credit subsidy cap for the GSM-102 program, expected to finance $4 billion in export credit guarantees. It extends authority for the FFGP to FY2012 and allows the Secretary of Agriculture to waive requirements for U.S. goods in construction if not available. The Secretary can provide guarantees for the program for up to 20 years. The 2002 farm bill authorized programs to promote U.S. agricultural products in overseas markets. Authorization of CCC funds for market development programs like MAP, FMDP, EMP, and TASC expired in 2007. The 2002 farm bill advocated for increased funding for export market development programs, specifically for specialty crops. MAP aims to expand exports through consumer promotions, technical assistance, and market research, jointly funded by the government and industry groups. Trade organizations, nonprofits, and private firms can submit projects. The USDA evaluates proposals from industry organizations, private firms, and non-represented firms for marketing activities. The 2008 farm bill extends funding for MAP, FMDP, and EMP through FY2012, with funding levels maintained. FMDP promotes generic commodity exports, while EMP funds technical assistance for U.S. agricultural exports to emerging markets. The Emerging Markets Program (EMP) aims to assist U.S. specialty crop exports by addressing barriers that prohibit or threaten exporters. Specialty crops are defined as cultivated plants produced in the U.S., excluding certain commodities. Funding for EMP was authorized at $10 million annually through FY2007 and reauthorized through FY2012 without change in the 2008 farm bill. The Trade Adjustment Assistance for Specialty Crops (TASC) program covers various activities for specialty crops, excluding certain commodities. The program was authorized $2 million annually through FY2007 and extended through FY2012 with increased funding. The 2002 farm bill also authorized export subsidies through the Export Enhancement Program (EEP) and the Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) to support agricultural exports when U.S. domestic prices were higher than international prices. The 2008 farm bill repealed legislative authority for EEP subsidies but extended DEIP subsidies through 2012. Agricultural export subsidies are a major issue in the Doha Round of trade negotiations, with plans to eliminate them by 2013. The bill also requires USAID to contribute up to $60 million over five years to the Global Crop Diversity Trust. The Global Diversity Trust is a funding mechanism for the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, administered by the FAO. It assists in funding gene banks for countries party to the treaty. The 2008 farm bill includes a provision for developing standards to certify agricultural products imported into the US were not produced with abusive child labor. The consultative group will develop recommendations for companies to monitor and verify if imported food products are free from child or forced labor."
