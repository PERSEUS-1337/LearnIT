    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Great Ape Conservation Act of 2000\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2 as findings and purposes. Congress finds that great ape populations are declining, endangering their long-term survival in the wild. Chimpanzees, gorillas, bonobos, orangutans, and gibbons are listed as endangered species. Conservation efforts are insufficient to address habitat loss and population decline due to human activities. Great apes are crucial for preserving tropical forest habitats. Conservation of great apes benefits other wildlife species. Threats include habitat loss, hunting, capture, and diseases. Great apes are vital for ecosystems and provide biological insights. Commercial trade of tropical species is harmful. Effective measures are needed to address these issues. The Act aims to sustain viable populations of great apes in the wild and support conservation programs in countries where great apes are located. The joint effort of countries, the United States, and the private sector is crucial for addressing threats to great apes' long-term viability.

In this Act, \"CITES\" refers to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, including its appendices. \"Conservation\" involves methods to sustain viable species populations, including habitat management, research, monitoring, and enforcement of CITES. The curr_chunk outlines various initiatives for wildlife conservation, including enforcement of CITES, implementation of domestic laws, operation of sanctuaries for rescued species, training of law enforcement officials, rehabilitation and release programs, conflict resolution, and community outreach and education. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to wildlife conservation, such as the Great Ape Conservation Fund, great ape species, Multinational Species Conservation Fund, and the Secretary of the Interior. The curr_chunk focuses on Great Ape Conservation Assistance. The Secretary will use funds from the Fund to provide financial assistance for approved great ape conservation projects submitted by eligible applicants, including wildlife management authorities, the CITES Secretariat, and individuals with expertise in great ape conservation. Project proposals must meet specific requirements. Project proposals for great ape conservation projects must include a concise statement of purposes, the responsible individual's name, qualifications of project conductors, project implementation methods, staff and community management, logistics, estimated funds and time needed, and evidence of support from relevant governmental entities. The Secretary reviews project proposals for great ape conservation projects to determine eligibility for funding under specified criteria within 180 days of receiving the proposal. Other Federal officials are consulted, and additional information may be requested for evaluation. The Secretary consults with Federal officials and countries involved, approves or disapproves project proposals, and notifies relevant parties. Projects enhancing great ape conservation by implementing programs and addressing human-ape conflicts may be approved. The curr_chunk focuses on promoting conservation efforts for great apes by addressing habitat competition, enhancing compliance with laws, developing scientific information for monitoring habitat and population trends, and promoting cooperative projects among various entities. The projects approved aim to ensure sustainability in great ape conservation efforts. The Secretary gives preference to conservation projects for great apes and their habitats, as well as projects with matching funds available. Recipients of assistance must submit periodic reports to evaluate project progress and success. The Secretary prioritizes conservation projects for great apes and their habitats, with a focus on assessing progress and fostering improvements. Reports and project documents must be made public. Grants under this Act have limitations on captive breeding, allowing it only for release into the wild when no other conservation method is feasible. A panel of experts is convened every 2 years to identify conservation needs for great apes. The Great Ape Conservation Fund is established under SEC. 5. It prioritizes conservation projects for great apes and their habitats, with a focus on assessing progress and fostering improvements. Reports and project documents must be made public. Grants under this Act have limitations on captive breeding, allowing it only for release into the wild when no other conservation method is feasible. A panel of experts is convened every 2 years to identify conservation needs for great apes. The Great Ape Conservation Fund is established as a separate account within the Multinational Species Conservation Fund. It consists of transferred amounts, appropriations, and interest earned on investments. The Fund allows for expenditures upon request by the Secretary for conservation assistance, with limitations on administrative expenses. The Secretary may allocate up to 3% or $80,000 per fiscal year for administrative expenses to implement the Act. The Treasury Secretary is responsible for investing any excess funds in interest-bearing US obligations, which can be acquired on original issue or through purchase at market price, and sold at market price when needed. The Secretary of the Treasury may sell obligations at market price, with interest and proceeds credited to the Fund. Transfers to the Fund are made monthly based on estimates, with adjustments for accuracy. Donations can be accepted and used for assistance under section 4. Donations received by the Secretary will be deposited into the Fund. Authorization of appropriations to the Fund is set at $5,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2001 to 2005."
