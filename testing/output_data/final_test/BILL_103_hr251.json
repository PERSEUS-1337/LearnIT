    "content": "The \"Monetary Policy and Treasury Finance Enhancement Act of 1993\" aims to help the Federal Reserve System and investors predict inflation, reduce inflation, and lower interest rates through the issuance of indexed obligations. The \"Monetary Policy and Treasury Finance Enhancement Act of 1993\" introduces a new section requiring at least 10 percent of longer-term public debt obligations issued in a fiscal year to be in the form of indexed obligations. If less than 10 percent of outstanding obligations with at least 5 years to maturity are indexed, the required amount increases. The new section requires a minimum of 2 percent of the aggregate face amount of outstanding obligations with at least 5 years to maturity to be in the form of indexed obligations. Indexed face amount is considered in determining the amount of indexed obligations permitted to be issued. Longer-term public debt obligations are defined as those maturing at least 5 years after the date of issue. The Secretary of the Treasury may issue obligations that mature at least 270 days but less than 5 years after the date of issue in the form of indexed obligations. The aggregate face amount of indexed obligations issued under sections 3102 or 3103 cannot exceed 50 percent of the total obligations maturing on any day. Indexed obligations are defined as obligations with a redemption value equal to their indexed face amount, a face amount between $1,000 and $5,000 at issuance, non-redeemable before maturity, and interest payable based on the indexed face amount. The indexed face amount is calculated by adding the face amount at issuance to the product of the face amount and a certain percentage. The selected index for indexed obligations is determined by multiplying the face amount by the percentage difference between the selected index for the date and the selected index for the issue date. The selected index for any date is the index for the second calendar month before that date, unless determined otherwise by the Secretary of the Treasury. The term 'selected index' generally refers to the CPI. The term 'selected index' for indexed obligations is typically the CPI, but another index can be used if recommended jointly by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The selected index for any obligation is based on the index as of the issue date. Indexed obligations are offered for sale with terms and conditions set by the Secretary of the Treasury. They can be purchased by individuals directly from the Department of the Treasury or through Federal Reserve System facilities. The Secretary consults with the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve on these matters. The Treasury consults with the Chairman of the Federal Reserve on the amounts, maturities, and timing of indexed obligations issuance. The Secretary considers benefits like improved monetary management and reduced interest costs on non-indexed obligations. The Secretary ensures liquidity and pricing reliability in indexed obligations to maintain competitiveness with nonindexed obligations. Expected issuance and maturity dates are announced in advance to allow for separate trading of interest on indexed obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury monitors ownership and trading activity of indexed and nonindexed obligations to ensure liquidity and pricing reliability. Reports on the program established under this section are submitted to Congress every 2 years. The Secretary of the Treasury monitors ownership and trading activity of indexed and nonindexed obligations to ensure liquidity and pricing reliability. Reports on the program established under this section are submitted to Congress every 2 years. The legislation was amended to include a new paragraph regarding the issuance of indexed obligations. The amendments made by this section regarding indexed obligations will apply to fiscal years after the enactment of the Act. Federal income tax changes affecting nonindexed obligations should also apply to indexed obligations, with symmetrical treatment for increases and decreases in the indexed face amount. Deductions for obligations as ordinary losses should be allowable."
