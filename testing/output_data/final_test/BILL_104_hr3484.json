    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"FAA Research, Engineering, and Development Reform Act of 1996\". Authorization of appropriations is also included. The FAA Research, Engineering, and Development Reform Act of 1996 authorizes appropriations for various projects and activities for fiscal year 1997, including system development, air traffic management technology, communications, navigation, surveillance, weather, and airport technology. The FAA Research, Engineering, and Development Reform Act of 1996 authorizes appropriations for various projects and activities for fiscal year 1997, including aircraft safety technology, system security technology, human factors and aviation medicine, environment and energy, and innovative/cooperative research. The FAA Research, Engineering, and Development Reform Act of 1996 authorizes appropriations for projects and activities related to aircraft safety technology, system security technology, human factors and aviation medicine, environment and energy, and innovative/cooperative research. SEC. 3 focuses on research priorities and budgeting. The FAA Research, Engineering, and Development Reform Act of 1996 amends section 48102 of title 49, United States Code, to establish research priorities and budgeting for research and development activities carried out by the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA Research, Engineering, and Development Reform Act of 1996 establishes research priorities and budgeting for the Federal Aviation Administration's research and development activities, including basic research, applied research, and development of prototypes. The President's annual budget request for the FAA must include all research and development activities in a single budget category. The FAA Research, Engineering, and Development Reform Act of 1996 amends section 44501(c) of title 49, United States Code by adjusting the time frame for planning from 15 years to 5 years and outlining requirements for the plan's schedule, cost, and estimates. Additionally, it introduces a new subparagraph (D) for annual review and recommendations on the allocation of research and development funds by the Administrator. The FAA Research, Engineering, and Development Reform Act of 1996 requires the FAA to provide estimates, goals, priorities, and resource allocation for research and development projects. The FAA is required to address specific recommendations from the research advisory committee and document any recommendations not accepted. Additionally, they must provide a description of how research results are disseminated to the private sector and any new technologies developed in the previous fiscal year. SEC. 4. PROGRAM GUIDANCE. The Congress finds that efforts to modernize the National Airspace System since 1981 have been limited, hindered by management issues at the Federal Aviation Administration leading to inefficiencies and lack of coordination between technology developers and operational sections. The Federal Aviation Administration lacks critical management education and competencies, leading to inadequate contractor oversight and poor risk management. Modernizing the National Airspace System requires fundamental changes in the acquisition management system and the orientation of officials implementing it. Definitions include \"affordable\" as costs in line with long-range plans and \"evolutionary acquisition\" as a method. The term \"evolutionary acquisition\" refers to an acquisition strategy where a core capability is fielded with a modular structure for future changes. \"Life-cycle costs\" encompass all costs of a system over its useful life. \"Nondevelopmental\" means not needing further development to be operational, while \"pre-planned product improvement\" defers difficult requirements to mitigate risks. The Federal Aviation Administration will establish an acquisition management system based on operational principles to meet the needs of the National Airspace System. This system will involve validating requirements, full life-cycle management, and budgeting, with the participation of both acquisition and operational personnel. The Federal Aviation Administration will establish an acquisition management system based on operational principles for the National Airspace System. This involves early involvement of stakeholders, assignment of officials based on leadership, event-driven acquisition strategies, cost-benefit analysis, and maximizing use of resources. The Federal Aviation Administration will establish an acquisition management system based on operational principles for the National Airspace System, involving stakeholders, leadership assignment, event-driven strategies, cost-benefit analysis, and resource optimization. Additionally, the FAA will consider using nonmaterial, nondevelopmental, or commercial solutions before lengthy research and development, implement evolutionary acquisition strategies, and utilize contemporary management techniques to assess program status, goals, risks, and affordability. The Congress recognizes the acquisition management system proposed by the Federal Aviation Administration in a document dated April 1, 1996, as compatible with specified principles. The FAA is authorized to implement the system with modifications that align with the stated principles."
