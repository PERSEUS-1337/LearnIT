An individual is considered 'economically disadvantaged' if at least 60 percent of households in their community have children eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. The term 'elderly' refers to individuals aged 65 or older. The definition of 'post office' includes branch post offices and post office stations. Limited mobility of an individual is determined based on their community. The accessibility of public transportation and the rate of highway motor vehicle ownership in an individual's community are factors used to determine their level of mobility. This information is crucial in assessing whether an individual is economically disadvantaged or elderly. The Postal Service will use the Internet Use Supplement from the Current Population Survey to assess internet access for individuals. They may also utilize data from local, state, or federal governments to gather statistical information for specific groups. These amendments apply to post offices slated for closure or consolidation under section 404(d) of title 39, United States Code. The Postal Service may use the Internet Use Supplement from the Current Population Survey to evaluate internet access. Amendments apply to post offices set for closure or consolidation under section 404(d) of title 39, United States Code. Additionally, the Postal Service may request an advisory opinion from the Postal Regulatory Commission for proposals that change postal services nationwide."
