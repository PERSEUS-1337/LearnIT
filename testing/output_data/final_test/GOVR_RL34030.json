    "content": "President George W. Bush has made comprehensive immigration reform a priority in his second term, focusing on increased border security, enforcement of immigration laws, and changes to worker visas and legal immigration. There is a proposal to implement a point system for legal permanent residents, similar to systems in Australia, Canada, Great Britain, and New Zealand. Point systems in countries like Australia, Canada, Great Britain, and New Zealand assign credits to prospective immigrants based on attributes like education, skills, work experience, language proficiency, and age range. Supporters argue that merit-based approaches align with economic needs and labor market objectives, making government selection of immigrants more acceptable to the public. Critics argue that individual employer judgement should be considered instead. Opponents of point systems argue that individual employer judgement is a better indicator of labor market needs and immigrant success. Concerns exist that a high volume of prospective immigrants would overwhelm a point system similar to those in Australia, Canada, Great Britain, and New Zealand, potentially leading to overly rigorous selection criteria. This could result in a system similar to the current first preference category for employment-based admissions, ultimately hindering meaningful reform in U.S. immigration policy. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) establishes principles for immigration, including family reunification, skilled immigrants, refugee protection, and diversity by country of origin. Each principle forms its own stream of immigrants, with separate queues for family-based and employment-based admissions. Prospective immigrants must meet eligibility requirements and adhere to numerical limits and preference categories based on visa category and country of origin. Immigrants under the INA are legal permanent residents (LPRs) living lawfully in the U.S. In FY2005, 1.1 million aliens became legal permanent residents (LPRs) in the United States, with 57.8% entering based on family ties. Other major categories included employment-based LPRs at 22.0% and refugees/asylees adjusting to LPR status at 12.7%. A point system is a criteria-based immigrant selection process where applicants must meet a predetermined number of points or fall within the top end of the point distribution. Three central elements in devising a point system are factors/criteria, scoring/scaling dimensions, and possibilities offered by the system. Points systems for immigrant selection are based on criteria like educational attainment, work experience, language proficiency, occupation, and age. Factors may also include ties to the destination country, such as job offers or family connections. These systems also consider scoring methods, like scaling education based on years of schooling. Points systems for immigrant selection are organized into tiers based on factors like educational attainment, work experience, language proficiency, and age. Each tier may have separate scoring mechanisms for factors such as shortage occupations, recent graduates in STEM fields, and family connections. Factors within each tier may be weighted differently, scaled, or scored within the overall point system. Points systems for immigrant selection are organized into tiers based on factors like educational attainment, work experience, language proficiency, and age. Theoretical approaches underlie the debate over immigrant selection systems, particularly in the context of point systems. Economic theories shape the discussion, with point values adjusted to favor immigrants with high-demand skill sets to maximize their contribution to the economy. The system aims to maintain a labor market equilibrium without potential adjustment costs or shocks. Classical economists argue that government efforts to determine labor market demand for skill sets may lead to inefficiency, favoring open borders for the free flow of individuals. Inefficiency can incentivize economic change like technological innovation and wage growth. Immigrant assimilation objectives may result in a point system valuing social factors like family ties and community linkages in the United States. A point system for immigrant selection may consider factors like age, education, and language skills for social assimilation and economic reasons. It could also prioritize immigrants from under-represented countries to increase diversity. Public support could be maximized by having elected officials establish priorities for choosing new immigrants. Point systems are seen as potentially inspiring public confidence through universal, data-driven, and objective selection processes. The four highest profile countries with merit-based point systems for skilled immigration are Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. These countries use a point system to assess candidates, with those having the most points immigrating first. They also have preference systems for family-based immigration and quotas for family and humanitarian immigration. The four highest profile countries with merit-based point systems for skilled immigration are Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. These countries use a point system to assess candidates, with those having the most points immigrating first. Family and humanitarian immigrants are placed in separate queues, with varying criteria such as language competence, educational qualifications, and age range. Meeting these qualifications may not be required in every country, for example, the UK requires English proficiency while skilled immigrants to Canada can qualify without knowledge of the official languages. In New Zealand, skilled immigration criteria require applicants to accumulate 140 points to qualify for permanent admission. Criteria include health, character, English language proficiency, and being under 56 years old. Evaluation is based on skilled employment, work experience, educational qualifications, and age, with a minimum of 50 points and a maximum of 95 points for skilled employment. Candidates applying for skilled immigration in New Zealand need to accumulate 140 points to qualify for permanent admission. Points are awarded based on skilled employment, work experience, educational qualifications, and age. Bonus points are available for various criteria, such as previous employment and higher qualifications. Despite the seemingly low qualifying point total, securing skilled immigration without an employment offer can be challenging. Candidates applying for skilled immigration in New Zealand need to accumulate 140 points to qualify for permanent admission. Bonus points are awarded for settling in low growth areas or having previous experience in New Zealand. Without bonus points, achieving a maximum score in non-employment offer categories will not be enough to pass skilled immigration requirements. An employment offer or existing New Zealand employment is essentially required for skilled immigration in New Zealand. In the United Kingdom, applicants need to accumulate 75 points out of 125 to qualify for permanent admission. In the United Kingdom, high skilled migrants must accumulate 75 points to qualify for permanent admission under the \"Highly Skilled Migrant Program\" (HSMP). Points are awarded for educational qualifications, past earnings, age, and previous work or educational experience in the UK. Additionally, applicants must meet health, character, and English language requirements, and be able to support themselves without public funds. The HSMP in the UK requires individuals to achieve a level six or above on the IELTS exam for English language proficiency. A special provision for MBA graduates from eligible programs grants them 75 points. The UK's immigration system is transitioning to a tiered point system with five tiers. The UK's immigration system is transitioning to a tiered point system with five tiers, including high skilled workers, medium skilled workers, low skilled workers, students, and temporary workers. Family reunification and humanitarian immigration are not affected by the point system. The new system will take effect in April 2008, with varying passing marks between 110-120 points for skilled immigration categories. Additionally, there is a reserve pool of applicants scoring between 70-120 points. Australia has a diverse point system for skilled immigration, with a pool of applicants scoring between 70-120 points. If quotas are not filled, applicants from the reserve pool may be selected. Applicants must meet health, character, age, English language, education, and work requirements. Points are assigned based on occupation, work experience, and skilled employment. Work experience in a skilled occupation can earn 5-10 points. Applicants for skilled immigration to Australia must meet various criteria to earn points towards a total score of 70-120. Points are awarded based on factors such as occupation, age, work experience, and involvement in Australia. Additional points can be earned for regional study or residence, capital investment, Australian work experience, or fluency in a community language. Applicants for skilled immigration to Australia can earn points based on factors like occupation, age, work experience, and involvement in Australia. Additional points can be earned for regional study or residence, capital investment, Australian work experience, or fluency in a community language. Educational training in Australia can also earn points, as well as a spouse's qualifying marks. Competency in the English language is crucial, with higher levels receiving more points. In Canada, skilled immigration applicants must accumulate 67 points out of 100 to qualify for permanent admission. Criteria include health, character, financial independence, and meeting selection criteria like education, language, and experience in an approved occupation. These factors are crucial for integrating into Canadian society and the economy. In Canada, skilled immigration applicants must accumulate 67 points out of 100 to qualify for permanent admission. Points are awarded for factors like employment offer, age, adaptability, and language skills. Competence in official languages is important, with up to 24 points available for fluency in both languages. However, even without language qualifications, applicants can still qualify if they have a confirmed job offer and adaptability points. Applicants for skilled immigration in Canada must accumulate 67 points out of 100 to qualify for permanent admission. Language skills are crucial, with up to 24 points available for fluency in official languages. Quebec has its own immigration requirements under the Canada-Quebec Accord, where potential migrants must apply directly to the Quebec government for a Certificat de s\u00e9lection du Qu\u00e9bec before applying for permanent residence with the Canadian government. Applicants for skilled immigration in Canada must accumulate 67 points out of 100 to qualify for permanent admission. Language skills are crucial, with up to 24 points available for fluency in official languages. Quebec has its own immigration requirements under the Canada-Quebec Accord, where potential migrants must apply directly to the Quebec government for consideration. Points for qualifying for skilled employment immigration vary across different countries, with Canada placing a greater emphasis on work experience. Most countries use a point system for skilled immigration, with key categories including employment offer, work experience, education, age, language proficiency, and other criteria. The United Kingdom does not give points for work experience directly but considers previous earnings. Canada and Australia prioritize language competency, with Australia having additional language requirements. Each country has a different point distribution, reflecting varying preferences for applicant attributes. Australia, for instance, allocates 53% of points to employment offers. Australia allocates 53% of points to employment offers, with 20% for age. Canada's skilled immigration system grants 25% for education, 24% for language proficiency, and 21% for work experience. New Zealand and the United Kingdom have point distributions falling between Australia and Canada. The United Kingdom allocates 41.7% of points for education and 16.7% for age in its current point system. An additional 37% is for past earnings, and 4.2% for UK qualifications or work experience. The distribution of points across categories is crucial for filtering applicants, but the passing mark also impacts immigrant eligibility. For example, Australia requires 73.3%-80% of points for skilled immigration, ensuring high qualifying marks in most categories. New Zealand requires 48.2% of all points, with bonus points for rural employment making it harder to pass. Canada needs 67% of points in three categories, while the UK requires 62.5%. The US has considered a point system but has not implemented one yet. The 1980s saw debates on points systems for immigration reform. The policy debates of the 1980s focused on legal immigration and the Immigration Act of 1990. The Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy did not endorse a point system due to difficulties in deciding criteria and administering it. The Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy did not endorse a point system for selecting independent immigrants due to difficulties in comparing educational achievements among different societies. However, interest in devising a point system continued, with options appearing in immigration reform bills in the 1980s. The Immigration Act of 1990 considered a 150-point system for selecting immigrants, with the Immigration and Naturalization Service proposing 100,000 visas based on this system. The Immigration Act of 1990 proposed a point system for selecting immigrants based on characteristics like arranged employment, English proficiency, age, education, and occupational demand. The legislation allocated 55,000 visas according to this point system, with debates on the selection criteria during the Senate Committee on the Judiciary consideration. The Senate debated the selection criteria for the Immigration Act of 1990, with a notable discussion on removing points for English language knowledge. The proposed point system allocated 54,000 visas annually based on factors like age, education, occupational demand, and pre-arranged employment. The proposed point system for the Immigration Act of 1990 allocated visas based on factors like age, education, occupational demand, and pre-arranged employment. The House-passed version of S. 358 differed from the Senate bill and did not include the point system in the final Immigration Act of 1990. Instead, the Act established a 5-tiered employment-based preference system. The Immigration Act of 1990 established a 5-tiered employment-based preference system, allocating visas based on factors like age, education, and occupational demand. Certain priority workers, outstanding professors, researchers, and executives are exempt from labor market tests. Up to 28.6% of the 140,000 employment-based LPR visas are allocated for these categories. Additionally, individuals with advanced degrees or exceptional abilities in specific fields can enter without labor market tests if it is in the national interest, with up to 28.6% of the LPR visas allocated for this second preference category. The U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform recommended selecting immigrants based on their economic skills but did not endorse a point system for selection. The Senate immigration reform bills in the mid-1990s did not include a point system. Senate action on comprehensive immigration reform legislation stalled in June 2007. The bipartisan legislation proposed a \"merit-based\" point system to replace the current employment-based preference system. This proposal included two tiers for legal permanent residents and unauthorized workers who qualified for a new Z visa. The failed Senate immigration reform bill in June 2007 proposed a \"merit-based\" system with worldwide ceiling levels. The bill allocated visas for exceptional Y visa holders and reducing employment-based backlog. The merit point system would drop to 140,000 in the sixth year, with priority dates set at May 1, 2005. The proposal in S. 1639 aims to address the employment-based backlog and implement a merit-based point system with a worldwide level of 380,000. It includes provisions for Z-to-LPR adjustments outside of the worldwide level, setting aside 10,000 visas for exceptional Y visa holders. The point system factors in multiple dimensions, with some factors like \"employment\" being multidimensional based on the applicant's qualifications. The legislative proposal in S. 1639 introduces a merit-based point system for immigrants, with a total of 100 points divided into four factors: employment experience, education, English proficiency, and family ties in the US. A Standing Commission on Immigration and Labor Markets would adjust the weighting scheme and passing mark for applicants. The proposal prioritizes skills in STEM fields and includes sub-factors like age within the employment category to capture applicants at their peak human capital. The merit-based immigration proposal in S. 1639 introduces a point system where individuals can earn points for STEM education, Department of Labor Registered Apprenticeship, employment factors, education level, English proficiency, and family ties in the US. Points are awarded based on occupation, employer endorsement, experience with US firms, age, national interest criteria, education level, field of study, English and civics proficiencies, and extended family in the US. The proposed point system in S. 1639 for individuals applying for LPR status under a Z visa includes a supplemental schedule with additional qualifying factors such as recent agricultural work experience, authorized U.S. employment experience, home ownership, and medical insurance. These factors would add fifty points to the existing merit-based LPR schedule, totaling 150 points. Points for legal U.S. employment experience and home ownership are based on qualifying years, while agricultural work experience is scored based on the number of years worked in the field. The point system in S. 1639 for LPR status under a Z visa includes factors like agricultural work experience, U.S. employment experience, home ownership, and medical insurance. Points are allocated based on years of experience, with different weightings for merit-based immigrants and Z visa applicants. The comprehensive immigration reform proposal in S. 1639 includes a point system for LPR status under a Z visa, with factors like agricultural work experience, U.S. employment experience, home ownership, and medical insurance. The point system is controversial, with different weightings for merit-based immigrants and Z visa applicants. Points are allocated based on years of experience, aiming to recruit immigrants who can benefit the economy. The challenge for policy makers is adapting a point system to manage high-demand migration in the United States. The current preference system for selecting LPRs is based on personal relationships, but a point system could shift towards standardized criteria based on national priorities. The debate over immigration policy in the United States revolves around the implementation of a point system for selecting immigrants. This new system could either augment or replace existing selection methods, sparking objections from various stakeholders. The shift to a point system may reduce employer control over the selection process and bypass labor market protections for U.S. workers, leading to contentious debates among policy makers and observers. The challenge in designing an immigration system is to align it with a country's values, priorities, and needs. Point systems offer a transparent way to determine merit-based immigrant eligibility but can also be politically charged. Debate arises over what qualities prospective immigrants should bring to a country. Principal applicants under the Skilled Migrant Category are assessed against health, character, and English language requirements, employability and capacity building factors, and settlement and contribution requirements. Approval is based on meeting health, character, and English language requirements, qualifying for points based on employability factors, being under 56 years old, and demonstrating the ability to settle in and contribute to New Zealand. To qualify for immigration to New Zealand under the Skilled Migrant Category, the principal applicant must demonstrate the ability to settle in and contribute to the country. The applicant must also meet health, character, and English language requirements, be under 56 years old, and score a minimum of 140 points. Additionally, the applicant must show the ability to work in their chosen field in the United Kingdom, support themselves without public funds, intend to make the UK their main home, and have no history of bankruptcy. The United Kingdom has a provision for graduates of top MBA programs to stay for up to 12 months to seek employment for permanent residence. Skilled overseas students studying in the UK also have a 12-month transitional opportunity. To qualify for immigration, the applicant must meet certain criteria, including being under 45 and proficient in English. To qualify for skilled immigration in Canada, the applicant must meet specific criteria such as being under 45, having English proficiency at a vocational level, post-secondary education, a nominated occupation on the skilled occupations list, and relevant work experience. The passing mark for points distribution is 110-120 points, with a reserve pool of 70-120 points. Additionally, applicants without a job offer must show sufficient funds based on household size. Proposed Point System in S. 1639: 6 persons C$24,170, 7 persons or more C$26,910."
