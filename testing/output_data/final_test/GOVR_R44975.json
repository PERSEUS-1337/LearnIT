A positive response allows the nomination to proceed, while a negative or unreturned blue slip can block the nomination from advancing. The blue slip process in the confirmation of federal judges involves the Senate Judiciary Committee sending blue forms to home state Senators for their approval of nominees. This policy, not codified in the committee's rules, has been used during various presidencies to prevent nominees from being routinely blocked by Senators not belonging to the President's party. The chairman of the committee sets the blue slip policy, which has generally required the support of both home state Senators for judicial nominees to be confirmed by the full Senate. The blue slip policy set by the chairman of the committee can differ in practice from what is stated. Determining the policy can be complex due to its implementation. This report relies on Senators' statements and public news accounts for information on the blue slip policy. Data on whether home state Senators return negative or positive blue slips is limited. Nominees who receive at least one negative blue slip are a small percentage of those nominated to the federal bench. During the 115th Congress, Senators discussed potential changes to the blue slip policy for judicial nominations, including issues like moving forward with a nomination despite a negative blue slip, consultation between the President and Senators, and applying blue slips to circuit court nominations. This report provides historical information on the use of blue slips for judicial nominations. The report discusses the history and potential changes to the blue slip policy for judicial nominations, dating back to the 1910s. It does not take a stance on modifying the current policy requiring two positive blue slips for a nomination. The blue slip policy for judicial nominations dates back to the 1910s when Senator Culberson may have created it during his time as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. The blue slip became a standard part of judicial nominee files from the 65th Congress onwards, with no prior evidence of its use. The historical and political context of tension between the White House and Senate in 1917 may have influenced the early use of the blue slip. The blue slip policy for judicial nominations dates back to the 1910s when Senator Culberson may have created it during his time as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. The first known use of a blue slip to oppose a nomination was in 1917 when Senator Thomas W. Hardwick objected to President Woodrow Wilson's nominee, U.V. Whipple. Despite the negative blue slip, Whipple's nomination was reported to the full Senate but ultimately rejected without a recorded vote. The blue slip was initially used to request senators' opinions regardless of political party from 1917 to 1955. Since 1979, the blue slip policy used by the Judiciary Committee has varied. Previously, under Senator James O. Eastland's chairmanship from 1956 to 1978, nominees needed two positive blue slips from home state Senators for consideration. A single negative response or withheld blue slip could halt nomination proceedings. The blue slip policy used by the Senate Judiciary Committee has varied since 1979. In recent years, a negative or withheld blue slip from a home state Senator could prevent a nomination from moving forward unless the Senator changed their stance. During the Obama presidency, Senators Leahy and Grassley followed this policy. The blue slip policy used by the Senate Judiciary Committee varied from 2009-2016. It required two positive blue slips from home state Senators for a nomination to be considered. During unified party control (2009-2014), 11 nominees faced negative or withheld blue slips. In divided party control (2015-2016), 9 nominees were affected. During the Obama presidency, 18 nominees faced blue slip issues, representing 4.6% of all judicial nominations. Only 2 nominees were confirmed after Senators withdrew their opposition. Senator Leahy also enforced the blue slip policy during the George W. Bush presidency. During the George W. Bush presidency, there were instances where home state Senators either returned negative blue slips or withheld blue slips for nominees, leading to committee action being stopped on the nominations. Senator Arlen Specter enforced the policy of requiring two positive blue slips for nominations to move forward during the 109th Congress. In total, there were 37 known nominees affected by blue slip issues during this period. During the George W. Bush presidency, 37 nominees faced blue slip issues, with 15 eventually confirmed after Senators withdrew opposition, while 22 were not confirmed. Positive blue slips didn't always guarantee nomination advancement. During the Obama and George W. Bush presidencies, 30% of nominees with blue slip issues were ultimately confirmed by the Senate, often as part of agreements or compromises between the White House and Senators. The Judiciary Committee has allowed consideration of nominees with negative or no blue slips in some instances, as long as the President consults with the nominee's home state Senators. During the George W. Bush presidency, the Judiciary Committee allowed consideration of nominees with negative or no blue slips, giving weight to home state Senators' concerns but still allowing for committee hearings and votes on contested nominations. During the George W. Bush presidency, the Judiciary Committee allowed consideration of nominees with negative or no blue slips, giving weight to home state Senators' concerns but still allowing for committee hearings and votes on contested nominations. In a two-year period, 13 nominees faced blue slip issues, with 5 receiving committee hearings and votes despite opposition from home state Senators. This occurred during unified party control with a Republican President and Senate majority. Prior to this, there were instances of nominees being considered without home state Senator support, such as in 1989 during the George H.W. Bush presidency and divided party control. The Judiciary Committee chairman's policy letter on blue slips for U.S. court nominations states that a negative blue slip will be considered but won't prevent nominee evaluation unless Senators weren't consulted. During George H.W. Bush's presidency, Senator Biden proceeded with nominations despite negative blue slips, with examples of rejected circuit and district court nominations. During Senator Strom Thurmond's chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee from 1981-1986, judicial nominations with negative blue slips were sometimes considered and approved by the committee and full Senate. Thurmond advanced four nominations with blue slip issues, confirming two. During Senator Strom Thurmond's chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee from 1981-1986, judicial nominations with negative blue slips were sometimes considered and approved by the committee and full Senate. Thurmond advanced four nominations with blue slip issues, confirming two. Under Senator Edward Kennedy's chairmanship from 1979-1980, the blue slip policy was altered to no longer prevent committee action on a nomination not supported by a home state Senator, in order to increase gender and racial diversity among judicial nominees. Kennedy moved forward on one known nomination that had received a negative blue slip, holding a hearing but taking no further action. The Judiciary Committee's hearing on a nomination with a negative blue slip was a rare occurrence since the 1950s. There have been three cases since 1979 where nominees were approved by the Senate despite a negative blue slip from one home state Senator. The specific blue slip policy has varied over the years, but consultation between the President and the Senate has always been important. The importance of consultation between the President and the Senate in the judicial selection process, especially regarding potential nominees for U.S. circuit and district court vacancies, has been emphasized by past Judiciary Committee chairmen and Senators. Senator Biden highlighted the need for serious consultation as part of the Senate's advice and consent responsibility under the Constitution. Senator Hatch emphasized the importance of genuine consultation between the administration and home state senators before judicial nominations are made. Senator Leahy also noted that the support of home state senators is crucial to encourage meaningful consultation. Lack of consultation has led to nominees not being considered by the Judiciary Committee. Other Senators have also stressed the significance of consultation, as seen in a letter from 41 Republican Senators to President Obama in 2009. Republican Senators emphasized the Senate's constitutional responsibility in federal appointments and the importance of senatorial consultation in providing valuable insights into nominees' qualifications. This principle dates back to George Washington's administration and has been acknowledged by both Democrats and Republicans. The letter emphasized the need for consultation between the White House and minority Senators, especially with an evenly divided Senate. Coordination with Democrats, including those from potential nominees' home states and the Judiciary Committee, was deemed crucial. Senator Hatch previously outlined important factors for the consultative process during the Clinton presidency. Senator Hatch outlined five circumstances that would show a lack of good faith consultation by the White House in communicating with home state Senators regarding potential nominees. These included failure to consider nominees proposed by Senators, not providing enough time for feedback before formal clearance, and neglecting to seek a Senator's objections after identifying a prospective nominee. Senator Hatch identified five circumstances that demonstrate a lack of good faith consultation by the White House in communicating with home state Senators regarding potential nominees. This includes not giving enough time for feedback before formal clearance, failure to consider nominees proposed by Senators, and neglecting to seek a Senator's objections to a prospective nominee. Senator Leahy recommended consultative procedures for judicial nominees, including giving serious consideration to nominees proposed by home state Senators and consulting with Senators and the Judiciary Committee in advance. The Administration must provide a meaningful response to home state Senators and the Judiciary Committee before initiating a formal clearance process for a nominee. If a Senator objects to a nominee, the Administration must notify them and the Judiciary Committee before starting the clearance process. Home state Senators and the Judiciary Committee must be given at least one week's notice before a formal nomination is made. Supporting documentation for the nomination must be sent to the Senate simultaneously with the nominee. The nominee must cooperate fully with Senators seeking information about the nomination. Senator Leahy, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, implemented a strengthened blue slip policy requiring positive blue slips from both home state Senators for a nomination to be considered. Senator Grassley also stressed the importance of consultation between the President and home state Senators, particularly in states with two Democratic Senators. Senators have less influence over circuit court nominees compared to district court nominees. The President plays a more independent role in selecting circuit court nominees. Senators of the President's party expect judgeships on federal courts of appeals to be cleared by them, while home state Senators not of the President's party also have expectations based on the Senate Judiciary Committee's blue slip policy. The role of home state Senators in recommending circuit court nominees to the President is distinct from their role after the nomination is formally submitted to the Senate, determined by the chairman's blue slip policy. The chairman's blue slip policy determines how a nomination is submitted. In the past, Senators Leahy and Grassley used a blue slip policy to oppose circuit court nominations they found objectionable. There has not been a formal distinction between U.S. circuit and district court nominations in past blue slip policies. Some past chairmen have suggested that a negative blue slip may not be as consequential for circuit court nominations. Senator Hatch stated in 2003 that he would give weight to negative blue slips, but emphasized that one senator should not hold up circuit court nominations. Some Senators suggest that the blue slip policy should differentiate between circuit and district court nominations, arguing that circuit court nominees have less senatorial influence. Others believe the policy should not make this distinction. The committee's blue slip policy should not distinguish between circuit and district court nominations to avoid giving too much power to the President. Treating the nominations differently could lead to more influence from interest groups and infringe upon bipartisan processes. The blue slip policy has evolved over time and may change during the current presidency. The blue slip policy has evolved over time and may change during the current presidency, potentially reducing the role of home state Senators in the judicial nomination process. This could have consequences for the Senate and the confirmation process, with some viewing the changes as adverse and others as beneficial. The blue slip process used by the Judiciary Committee may diminish consultation between a President and home state Senators during the pre-nomination stage of selecting a nominee for a vacancy. Without a blue slip policy, there is little incentive for a President to consult with the Senate, potentially leading to the submission of ideologically extreme nominees. The reinterpretation of Senate Rule XXII and potential changes in the blue slip policy could further reduce meaningful consultation with home state Senators. The blue slip process allows home state Senators to block nominations they deem extreme or lacking support. Changes in Senate Rule XXII in 2013 altered the cloture vote threshold for circuit and district court nominations. The cloture vote threshold for U.S. circuit and district court nominations was changed in 2013 to a simple majority, reducing the power of home state Senators to block objectionable judicial nominees. This could result in more nominees receiving lifetime appointments without home state Senator support, marking a significant shift in the confirmation process. A slip policy diminishing the role of home state Senators could increase partisan approval of President's nominees in the Senate. Partisanship may affect votes on judicial nominees, potentially leading to more partisan confirmation processes. Confirmation could also become lengthier if a Senator withholds unanimous consent. Changing the blue slip policy could lead to a more efficient nomination and confirmation process for U.S. circuit or district court nominees by potentially eliminating the role of home state Senators in blocking objectionable nominees. This could benefit Presidents and their supporters in the Senate, making the process quicker and more streamlined. Changing the blue slip policy to lessen the role of home state Senators in blocking nominees could expedite the nomination process and increase the number of confirmed judicial nominees by the Senate. This change may prevent individual Senators from obstructing nominees for personal or political reasons, ultimately benefiting Presidents and their supporters in the Senate. Some Senators and the President may see the blue slip policy as infringing on the President's power to select judges. Limiting the role of home state Senators in the blue slip process could increase the number of confirmed judicial nominees by the Senate and decrease long-lasting vacancies. The blue slip policy allows home state Senators to block a President's judicial nominees, leading to political and institutional stalemates that can last for years. Limiting the Senators' role in the blue slip process could reduce these stalemates and decrease long-lasting vacancies."
