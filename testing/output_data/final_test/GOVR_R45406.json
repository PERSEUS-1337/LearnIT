    "content": "The USDA administers various agricultural conservation programs to assist private landowners with natural resource concerns. These programs include working land, land retirement, easement, watershed, and technical assistance programs. The main agencies involved are the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and the Farm Service Agency (FSA). Funding for most conservation programs comes from the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) and omnibus farm bills, with additional discretionary spending for technical assistance programs. The FY2018 and FY2019 Agriculture appropriations acts did not include reductions to mandatory conservation programs. The FY2018 act saw a slight increase in discretionary conservation program funding from FY2017 levels, while the FY2019 act included a decrease from FY2018 levels and redirected funding to the new Farm Production and Conservation Business Center. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized and amended funding for many mandatory conservation programs. NRCS administers all discretionary conservation programs. The largest program funding most NRCS activities is Conservation Operations (CO), primarily funding Conservation Technical Assistance (CTA) for conservation planning and implementation. The enacted FY2018 appropriation provided $874 million, increasing from FY2017. FY2019 appropriation decreased CO funding to $819 million, redirecting funds to the new Farm Production and Conservation Business Center. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request was $699 million, proposing consolidation of accounts for conservation technical assistance. The USDA has proposed consolidating funding for conservation technical assistance, a proposal that has been suggested by multiple Administrations but never adopted by Congress. The FY2018 and FY2019 Agriculture appropriations acts allocate funding for various conservation programs, including $150 million annually for Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations (WFPO) to prevent erosion, sedimentation, and flood damage. This funding level has remained consistent since FY2017, which was the first year funding was allocated for the WFPO program since FY2010. The Trump Administration did not request funding for WFPO in FY2018 and FY2019, but Congress directed some Conservation Operations funds to WFPO activities. The enacted appropriations for FY2018 and FY2019 included $10 million annually for the Watershed Rehabilitation program, a decrease from the previous year. The 2018 farm bill authorized permanent mandatory funding of $50 million annually for WFPO. The 2018 farm bill authorized permanent mandatory funding of $50 million annually for WFPO or Watershed Rehabilitation activities, in addition to discretionary funding. Congress has historically used annual agriculture appropriations acts to reduce mandatory conservation programs through changes in mandatory program spending (CHIMPS) from FY2003 to FY2017, but the FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act did not include CHIMPS, allowing full funding utilization in FY2018. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized mandatory funding for conservation programs, including EQIP extended to FY2019. The FY2019 appropriations bill did not include reductions to mandatory conservation programs. USDA created the Farm Production and Conservation (FPAC) mission area in 2017, which includes NRCS, FSA, RMA, and a new FPAC. The Farm Production and Conservation (FPAC) mission area was created in 2017, which includes NRCS, FSA, RMA, and a new FPAC Business Center responsible for various operations. The FY2019 Administration budget request included funding for the Business Center and a transfer of funds from other accounts. The FY2018 appropriation included about $1 million for the FPAC Business Center. The FY2018 appropriation included $1 million for the Business Center, with USDA submitting a spending plan to Congress for the new FPAC mission area. The FY2019 appropriations increased funding for the Business Center, directing a transfer of funds from other accounts. Funding for NRCS and FSA was reduced accordingly as dictated in the FY2019 explanatory statement. The FY2019 explanatory statement dictates shifts in funding for the new Business Center, with a $16.2 million effective increase to NRCS. The $60.2 million mandatory conservation program funding is authorized to be transferred to the FPAC Business Center. The FY2019 appropriations act authorized the transfer of $60.2 million in mandatory conservation program funding to the FPAC Business Center from programs under 16 U.S.C. 3841(a), including EQIP, CSP, and ACEP. The transfer did not include other mandatory conservation programs like CRP. The impact of this transfer on the implementation and financial assistance of EQIP, CSP, and ACEP is uncertain. The FY2019 funding gap from December 22, 2018, to January 25, 2019, affected agencies funded by Agriculture appropriations, potentially leading to furloughs. During a shutdown, agencies determine which activities and personnel are exempt from furlough, with exceptions for law enforcement and protection of life or property. USDA estimated that 61% of its employees funded by Agriculture appropriations were exempt, totaling 37,860 staff out of 62,288. Each agency published contingency plans supervised by the Office of Management and Budget. During the shutdown, USDA exempted 61% of its staff, totaling 37,860 out of 62,288. NRCS initially claimed 100% of its 9,342 staff as exempt using mandatory conservation program funding. Plans to furlough some employees were not implemented as the shutdown ended. Congress uses authorization and appropriations acts to establish agencies. Authorization acts establish, continue, or modify agencies and programs, while appropriations acts provide discretionary funding. The Agriculture appropriations bill can be used for amendments that permanently alter or create programs, with the force of law by amending the U.S. Code. This is different from policy-related provisions, which direct how the executive branch should carry out appropriations. Amendments made in the 2018 farm bill further amended conservation programs from the FY2018 appropriations act. The FY2018 agriculture appropriations act included amendments to the WFPO program, increasing the congressional approval threshold for projects needing federal contributions over $25 million. Additionally, a new section was added to Title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985 exempting farm bill conservation programs. The 1985 farm bill added a new section exempting farm bill conservation programs from certain reporting requirements for federal grant recipients. Concerns were raised when some programs were designated as grants, triggering the need for a DUNS number and SAM registration for entities with a Taxpayer Identification Number or Employee Identification. Individuals or entities using a Social Security number were not affected by these requirements. The amendment exempts producers and landowners participating in farm bill conservation programs from the DUNS number and SAM registration requirement. It originated in the FY2018 Senate-reported bill (S. 1603, \u00a7740) and was expanded to include programs administered by NRCS, FSA, and APHIS. The Agriculture appropriations bill may include policy provisions directing how funds should be used, with limited effect beyond the current fiscal year. The FY2018 and FY2019 enacted appropriations include a policy provision waiving project limits in the WFPO program for projects with primary purposes other than flood prevention. This provision does not amend the WFPO authorization and is effective only for the funds provided during the appropriation year. Table 3 compares policy provisions in Farm Production and Conservation Programs and General Provisions titles of the FY2018. The FY2018 and FY2019 Agriculture appropriations bills include policy provisions related to conservation programs. The explanatory statement and committee reports provide policy instructions for agencies to follow, although they do not have the force of law. Table 4 compares some of the identified policy provisions in the FY2018 and FY2019 Agriculture appropriations related to conservation. The FY2018 and FY2019 Agriculture appropriations bills contain policy provisions for conservation programs. The report language includes references to House and Senate reports, as well as explanatory statements and conference reports. Some provisions address conservation programs not funded within the annual appropriation."
