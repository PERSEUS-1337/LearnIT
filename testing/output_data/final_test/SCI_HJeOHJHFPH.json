However, these methods often struggle with facial structures and identity information, especially in images with large pose variation and misalignment. A novel face super-resolution method proposed in this paper incorporates 3D facial priors to capture sharp facial structures. The algorithm includes a 3D face rendering branch to obtain priors and a Spatial Attention Mechanism to exploit hierarchical information for better super-resolution results. Extensive experiments show that this method outperforms existing techniques. The proposed algorithm achieves superior face super-resolution results, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Face images are crucial for human observation and computer analysis, but tasks like face recognition suffer from low-resolution images. Face super-resolution, or face hallucination, aims to restore low-resolution images to high-resolution. Deep learning methods have been successful in this area, but super-resolving arbitrary facial images at high magnification factors remains a challenge. Super-resolving arbitrary facial images at high magnification factors is a challenging problem due to the ill-posed nature of the SR problem. Recent research has focused on incorporating face priors to assist neural networks in capturing more facial details. Different approaches, such as using identity priors and facial component heatmaps, have been proposed to improve the quality of super-resolved faces. However, extracting identity priors only from multi-scale up-sampling results may not provide enough guidance for the network to achieve better results. Heatmaps can offer global component regions but may not effectively learn all facial details. In contrast to previous methods, a novel face super-resolution approach embeds 3D face structures and identity priors. A deep 3D face reconstruction branch explicitly obtains 3D face render priors, incorporating rich hierarchical information like sharp edges, illumination, and identity. The Spatial Attention Mechanism integrates the 3D facial prior into the network using Spatial Feature Transform (SFT). The paper introduces a novel face super-resolution model that utilizes 3D facial priors and a Spatial Attention Mechanism to enhance feature extraction and integration. The model focuses on spatial interdependencies between 3D facial components and input images, achieving better super-resolution results, especially at low input resolutions. The proposed network for face super-resolution achieves better criteria and visual quality compared to existing methods. Recent research on super-resolution and face hallucination using neural networks has shown significant improvements in results. Many CNN architectures with residual blocks have been developed for super-resolution, with EDSR removing unnecessary batch normalization to enhance performance. In our work, we decrease training parameters while achieving superior performance in super-resolution criteria (SSIM and PSNR) and visible quality. We exploit facial priors to enhance the network for face super-resolution, surpassing existing methods. Facial prior knowledge is crucial in face hallucination for better super-resolution of LR faces. Various methods have been used, such as learning subspaces from LR and HR face images, setting up Markov Random Field to reduce artifacts, interweaving spatial transformer networks with deconvolutional layers, and leveraging PixelCNN framework. These methods aim to handle large pose variations and misalignments in LR images. In face super-resolution, prior knowledge is essential. Different methods have been used to improve the resolution of low-resolution faces, including leveraging PixelCNN framework, using a multi-task CNN for structural information, and incorporating identity priors in the super-resolution network. Additionally, 3D face reconstruction is employed to extract facial structure, edges, illumination, and identity priors explicitly. The 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) is utilized for restoring 3D shapes from 2D images. The paper employs the 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) to reconstruct 3D facial priors, extracting facial features and generating high-resolution facial images for face super-resolution. The 3D rendering branch extracts 3D face coefficients containing hierarchical knowledge, facilitating the super-resolution process. The proposed framework consists of two branches: the 3D rendering network and the Spatial Attention. The paper introduces a 3DMM-based model to localize precise facial structures and address face pose variations using a face rendering network based on ResNet-50. This approach aims to extract facial priors and enhance face super-resolution by generating high-resolution facial images. The paper presents a face rendering network using ResNet-50 to regress a face coefficient vector representing identity, facial expression, texture, illumination, and face pose. The face coefficients are transformed into a 3D shape and texture based on the Morphable model. A modified L2 based loss function is used for 3D face reconstruction with a paired training set. The proposed face super-resolution architecture consists of two branches: a ResNet-50 Network to extract 3D facial coefficients and restore a sharp face rendered structure, and a bottom block dedicated to face super-resolution guided by the facial coefficients and rendered sharp face structures. The generated 3D face rendered reconstructions show clear spatial knowledge and good visual quality of facial components, closely resembling the ground-truth information. The 3D priors effectively capture pose variations and skin color. The proposed Spatial Attention Mechanism (SAM) utilizes 3D face priors to improve accuracy and stability in face images with large pose variations. It includes a spatial transform block, an attention block, and an upscale module to enhance facial components and identity. The Spatial Attention Mechanism (SAM) incorporates 3D face priors to enhance facial components and identity through a spatial transform block, attention block, and upscale module. The 3D face priors are integrated into the Spatial Attention Transform Block after a convolutional layer, involving a feature transformation process that includes reshaping coefficients, zero-padding, scaling, and concatenation with rendered face images. The Spatial Feature Transform (SFT) learns a mapping function to modulate parameters based on the priors, such as segmentation probability. The Spatial Feature Transform (SFT) layer utilizes a modulation parameter pair (\u00b5, \u03bd) based on priors \u03c8, like segmentation probability, to adaptively control outputs. It applies an affine transformation spatially to intermediate feature maps, modifying them through scaling and shifting according to transformation parameters (\u00b5, \u03bd). This spatial-wise transformation guides the allocation of processing resources towards informative components. The channel module explores informative components and interdependency between channels using residual channel attention blocks. The performance of the algorithms is evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively against state-of-the-art methods. Two models, VDSR+ and another, are proposed and trained on the same dataset for a fair comparison. Our proposed models, VDSR+ and SR network with Spatial Attention Mechanism, incorporate facial priors for super-resolution. The training phase uses CelebA dataset with 162,080 images, while testing includes 40,519 CelebA test set images and Menpo dataset's large-pose-variation test set. HR ground-truth images are obtained by resizing facial images to 128\u00d7128 pixels. The network uses LR face images downscaled to 32\u00d732 pixels and 16\u00d716 pixels for training. ADAM optimizer with a batch size of 64 is used, and input images are center-cropped as RGB channels. The training process takes 2 days with an NVIDIA Titan X GPU. Results show improved performance in PSNR and SSIM scores for CelebA test set. Case results for different face poses are also analyzed. The proposed method, VDSR+, shows better results compared to other methods, with a 1.8dB improvement over basic VDSR. The addition of 3D face priors contributes to improved performance in face super-resolution, reducing visual artifacts and enhancing details on key face components. The effectiveness and stability of the method are verified through PSNR and SSIM results for face poses, showing superior performance compared to other methods. The VDSR+ method achieves a 1.8dB improvement over basic VDSR in magnification factors. Results show clearer faces with finer details and no artifacts with the addition of 3D face priors. Ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of each module in the proposed network. The proposed network with 3D face priors and Spatial Attention Mechanism (SAM) improves visual quality, generating clearer and sharper facial structures. Quantitative comparisons show the effectiveness of these additions. Model size analysis reveals that VDSR+ and SAM are lightweight yet achieve the best performance compared to other methods. The proposed network incorporates 3D facial priors and a Spatial Attention Mechanism to improve visual quality and reduce artifacts compared to state-of-the-art methods with fewer parameters. The 3D rendered branch uses face rendering loss for clear spatial locations of facial components, while the Spatial Attention Mechanism considers channel correlation between priors and inputs. The proposed network incorporates 3D facial priors and a Spatial Attention Mechanism to improve visual quality and reduce artifacts compared to state-of-the-art methods with fewer parameters. For semi-frontal facial pose visualization, incorporating rendered face priors helps avoid ghosting artifacts. For left and right facial poses, the high-resolution results of the proposed method outperform others, especially with the addition of facial structure priors. High magnification factor \u00d7 8 visualization also shows significant improvements. The proposed method incorporates 3D facial priors and a Spatial Attention Mechanism to improve visual quality and reduce artifacts for large magnification factors. Different ablation configurations were tested to show the effectiveness of the priors and attention mechanism. The 3D facial priors and Spatial Attention Mechanism significantly enhance accuracy and convergence of algorithms. Quantitative results show a performance boost of 1.6db and 0.57db, respectively. Qualitative evaluation demonstrates improved sharpness and reduced artifacts in facial structures with the incorporation of these priors and attention mechanism."
