    "content": "The goal of generative models, particularly using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), is to model the data distribution of a sample dataset. The size of the latent space is crucial for accurate reconstruction of the training data, linking to compression theory and Autoencoders (AE). A small latent space results in low-quality outputs from AE and high-quality outputs from GAN, similar to the perception-distortion tradeoff. The latent space dimensionality affects the quality of outputs in generative models like GAN and AE. Increasing the dimensionality reduces distortion for both models, but only improves perceptual quality for GAN. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been successfully applied to various tasks such as style transfer, superresolution, and semi-supervised learning. However, the understanding of what GANs actually learn remains limited. Recent research has used GANs for solving inverse problems like image completion, MRI reconstruction, and anomaly detection. It is crucial to determine if the generator network accurately describes the distribution for these applications. Previous studies have shown that faithfully reconstructing images from a generator network is challenging. The convergence proof for generator networks is complex, with adaptations to converge to different divergences or distances on probability distributions. Techniques like Gradient Penalty and Spectral Norm have improved stability in training, but the accuracy of neural networks in approximating distances remains uncertain. GANs are used to transform a low dimensional distribution to a high dimensional unknown distribution by playing a min-max game between two NNs. The paper focuses on estimating probability distribution precision from a dataset X and determining an adequate capacity for a generator network using AE to reconstruct the dataset. The paper discusses the impact of the dimensionality of the latent space on the generated manifold, showing that the fit of the data heavily depends on it. Autoencoders can quickly be trained and have been extensively researched, while hyperparameter search on GAN networks can lead to various issues. The study also explores the perception-distortion tradeoff. The paper explores the impact of latent space dimensionality on the generated manifold, relating it to the perception-distortion tradeoff. It investigates using compression tools via deep learning to determine a suitable dimensionality for the latent space and examines the limitations of the generated manifold in producing shifted or noisy images. The paper is organized into sections discussing related work, theory behind pseudo inverting NNs, methodology, results, and conclusions. GANs were introduced by Goodfellow et al. (2014). The paper discusses the use of Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty for image synthesis and evaluation using Inception Score and Fr\u00e9chet Inception. The Inception Score and Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance are commonly used metrics in GAN evaluation. Shmelkov et al. proposed training a new classifier to combat bias from ImageNet. FID score is preferred due to its prevalence. AEs were first proposed by Rumelhart et al. and have various uses in GAN frameworks. The inversion of generator networks in GANs has been explored by various researchers, with works on improving methods by adding heuristics like stochastic clipping. However, the authors opted against stochastic clipping to avoid adding more randomness to the results. Generalization of GANs through detecting overfitting has also been proposed recently. The weights in the weight matrix and convolutional layers of a trained WGAN-GP exhibit characteristics similar to those drawn from a normal distribution. In this work, the authors investigate the ability of GANs to memorize training data and generalize, focusing on the dimensionality of the latent space and the capacity of the generator network. They propose using compression techniques to estimate the memorization capability of GANs. The study also explores the invertibility of neural networks, highlighting challenges due to the nonconvex and non-bijective nature of NNs with ReLU activations. The function induced by neural networks is not always injective or surjective, but if weights are gaussian distributed, the network can be invertible with high probability. Previous research has shown that trained neural networks exhibit random-like properties, allowing for the use of Random Matrix Theory to study them. Recent studies have proven that 2-layer neural networks can be inverted with high probability, and this holds true for multi-layer and GAN networks as well. Glorot initialization was used for training these networks. The Glorot initialization method was used to train neural networks, with different standard deviations for each layer. All layers converged to a similar gaussian distribution, indicating potential success in the optimization process. A visualization technique by Li et al. (2018) showed an optimization path from a starting point to a specific data point, validating claims made by Lipton & Tripathi. In experiments validating claims by Lipton & Tripathi, it was found that an accurate reconstruction of the generator manifold is possible using first order methods. By ensuring \u03b2 is orthogonal and varying a, b \u2208 [\u22122, 2], benign structures were consistently produced. The progress in GANs has been minimal despite running hyperparameter searches on plausible combinations. The progress in GANs has been minimal and overstated, relying heavily on hyperparameters. Non-saturating loss with spectral norm showed good but not the best results. The goal is to map high dimensional image distribution to a lower dimensional noise distribution using a generator network. This compression allows for reconstruction of the training set with less capacity than the entire manifold. The usage of an AE is proposed to gauge the necessary capacity of the generator network for reconstructing the entire dataset. AEs with small latent spaces tend to output blurry approximations of the training images. Once a suitable AE is found, its decoder is used as the generative model. The objective function of the AE is defined as ||d(e(x)) \u2212 x|| 2 without regularization to closely fit the data and assess generator capacity. The encoder part serves as the discriminator with different objectives, and the study focuses on the GAN's ability to memorize the training dataset. The inverse optimization problem for a function g is solved using a gradient method, with constraints added to restrict the search space for plausible latent vectors. The norm of the vector z is restricted to ensure plausibility, following the 3-sigma rule for the multivariate gaussian distribution.

The norm of the vector z is restricted to ensure plausibility, following the 3-sigma rule for the multivariate gaussian distribution. The final objective function is solved using a projected ADAM optimizer. Experiments are conducted on medium-sized datasets like CIFAR-10 and CelebA, using a standard DCGAN with convolutional layers and resize operations to avoid checkerboard artifacts. The visual quality of the resulting samples is measured by FID and is comparable to existing work. This study does not aim to enhance the visual quality of GAN-generated samples. The GAN algorithms are trained using default hyperparameters, with AE networks acting as a lower bound for GAN complexity. The latent space dimension affects the number of parameters, but this was not considered for simplicity. Visual quality of generated images is evaluated using FID. The visual quality of GAN generated images remains consistent regardless of latent dimensionality, while AE reconstructions improve in quality and sharpness with larger latent spaces. GAN reconstructions may only resemble actual images with sufficiently large latent spaces. In experiments with GAN and AE models, the visual quality of GAN reconstructions remains consistent across different latent space sizes, while AE reconstructions improve in quality with larger latent spaces. GAN reconstructions may resemble other people instead of the original images with smaller latent spaces. Webster et al. (2019) observed a WGAN-GP trained on CelebA. The impact of translation on GAN networks' reconstruction ability is shown in experiments with translated training images. Increasing latent space dimension improves reconstruction precision. Another experiment involves reconstructing CIFAR-10 images using the CelebA trained model, showing successful reconstruction with a large enough latent space. The study demonstrates successful image reconstruction using a compression approach, with better results for CIFAR-10 images compared to CelebA images. Lower latent spaces show some facial structure in reconstructions, indicating a strong prior on face features. The norm of latent vectors is smaller than random vectors, suggesting base face features refined with larger latent vectors. Further validation is needed for this hypothesis. In this work, a compression approach is used to estimate the required capacity and latent space dimensionality of the generator network for distribution estimation. The encoder and discriminator NNs share the same architecture, which works well for both tasks. The perceptual image quality is independent of the latent space size, unlike autoencoders where visual quality improves with increased dimensionality. However, the ability to reconstruct the training set correctly depends on the initial latent space. The ability of the generator to reconstruct deviations from the original dataset, like a validation set or shifted images, depends on the initial latent space. For smaller latent spaces, face-like features can still be observed. The reconstruction ability for arbitrary noise images is independent of the initial latent space unless it is chosen very large, indicating that the generator has learned realistic natural image features. GANs are skilled at generating natural images by learning primitives that can be combined to construct arbitrary images. Future work aims to search for better and more reliable generators for images using this setup. For experiments, a standard CNN with 5x5 kernels was used. In CIFAR-10 experiments, one layer was removed, starting with 1024 feature maps. ADAM optimizer with learning rate 1E-4 and \u03b2 values similar to WGAN-GP were used. Training involved 80,000 generator iterations and 5 discriminator iterations per update. AE was trained for 80,000 iterations with default hyperparameters. Generator network inversion was done with 10,000 ADAM steps. Initial MNIST experiments validated the approach without visual quality metrics. In contrast to previous work, we demonstrate that a large latent space is necessary for successful reconstruction in GANs. An inverse optimization procedure was conducted on CIFAR-10 with dim(z) = 1000, showing reconstructions likely to appear in the generative model. The resulting latent vector norm of the reconstructions is visualized in Fig 10, with blue representing vectors likely in training, red for training set reconstructions, and test set reconstructions. The overlap between training set and test set reconstructions is minimal, leading to the use of a projected gradient method. Comparing GAN's ability to reconstruct CIFAR-10 images from CelebA images, GAN outperforms AE. Visual results show GAN producing sharper images closer to the actual ones compared to AE. The GAN reconstructions are of high quality even in low dimensional space, but correspond to other people, unlike the autoencoder reconstructions which show increasing image quality as the latent space is increased."
