    "content": "The Act titled \"Veterans' Toxic Wounds Research Act of 2014\" establishes a comprehensive research program on toxic exposures faced by veterans during military service. The \"Veterans' Toxic Wounds Research Act of 2014\" mandates the establishment of a master registry by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs within 180 days to track veterans exposed to toxins during their military service, including Agent Orange and Persian Gulf War-related toxins. The \"Veterans' Toxic Wounds Research Act of 2014\" requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish a registry to track veterans exposed to toxins during military service, including those related to Gulf War Illness, deployments in Iraq, Bosnia, Somalia, the Philippines, and exposure at contaminated military installations like Camp Lejeune and Fort McClellan. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will collaborate with the National Academy of Sciences to review scientific studies on the health effects of toxic exposures for a registry. The report will include a review of studies linking toxic substance exposures to specific diseases. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will collaborate with the National Academy of Sciences to review scientific studies on the health effects of toxic exposures for a registry, including research on the effects of toxic exposure on second and third generations. The report will focus on the association between toxic substance exposures and specific diseases in children and grandchildren of veterans. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will use reviews to inform research decisions and report to Congress on the selection process for conducting or funding research related to toxic exposures and their effects on children and grandchildren of veterans. SEC. 3. PRESUMPTIONS OF SERVICE CONNECTION FOR ILLNESSES ASSOCIATED WITH TOXIC EXPOSURES DURING MILITARY SERVICE. Section 1119 of title 38, United States Code, establishes presumptions of service connection for illnesses associated with toxic exposures. This includes any diagnosed or undiagnosed illness that the Secretary determines warrants a presumption of service connection due to a positive association with exposure to a toxic substance listed in the master registry. The Secretary shall prescribe regulations for a presumption of service connection for illnesses associated with toxic exposures in veterans who served in locations recognized as sources of exposure, unless there is conclusive evidence to the contrary. The Secretary will make determinations based on medical evidence of a positive association between exposure to toxic substances and diagnosed or undiagnosed illnesses in humans or animals. This includes considering reports from the National Academy of Sciences and other medical and scientific information available. The Secretary evaluates reports for statistical significance, replication capability, and peer review. An illness-toxic substance association is positive if evidence outweighs against it. Within 60 days of receiving a National Academy of Sciences report, service connection presumption for covered illnesses is determined. The Secretary evaluates reports for statistical significance, replication capability, and peer review to determine if a presumption of service connection is warranted for covered illnesses. If warranted, proposed regulations are issued within 60 days; if not warranted, an explanation is published in the Federal Register. If an illness already presumed to be service connected is reevaluated, regulations may be proposed to remove the presumption. The Secretary evaluates reports to determine if a presumption of service connection is warranted for covered illnesses. Proposed regulations are issued within 60 days if warranted, and if not, an explanation is published. If the presumption of service connection for an illness is removed, veterans and survivors will still receive compensation. The term 'master registry' is defined as the registry of veterans who experienced toxic exposures. A new item is added to the table of sections in the chapter. SEC. 4. INCLUSION OF CERTAIN INFORMATION IN ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must ensure that each individual's electronic health record includes details such as whether they served in the Armed Forces, the specific Armed Force they served in, locations of deployment, dates of service, military occupational specialty, and results of various health assessments. The electronic health record must include information on blood glucose test, body mass index, bone density, cancer screenings, preventive immunizations, spirometry, smoking, mental health evaluation, substance abuse, and infectious diseases. The electronic health record should contain information on infectious diseases or parasites endemic to where the individual served in the military."
