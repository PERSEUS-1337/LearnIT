    "content": "The \"Working Capital Express Act of 2010\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The Act establishes the Working Capital Express Program. The Working Capital Express Program guarantees loans for working capital under the Express Loan Program to small businesses that have been operating for at least 2 years. The Administrator may guarantee a loan of up to $750,000 with an 80 percent guarantee rate for eligible lenders under the Working Capital Express Program. The Administrator will establish underwriting standards for loans guaranteed under this program, requiring income tax returns for verification of business income. The Administrator will set maximum default and delinquency rates for loans under this program, and lenders with rates higher than the established limit will lose eligibility to offer guaranteed loans. Penalties for fraud in connection with small business loans guaranteed under this program include fines up to $500,000, imprisonment for up to 5 years, or both for lenders making false statements about a borrower's qualifications. Lenders designated under this program have authority for underwriting and liquidation similar to those in the Certified Lenders Program. The Administrator will pay a lender's claim on a guaranteed loan unless fraud or a material error is detected. The Administrator will establish a self-screening website for loan guarantees under this program, with restrictions on the total amount and default rate of loans guaranteed. The Administrator will create a website for small business owners to check their eligibility for guaranteed loans. Amendments to the Small Business Act will exclude certain loans and repeal specific subparagraphs by December 1, 2011. Amendments to the Small Business Act will repeal subparagraph (G) in paragraph (31) and penalties will still apply to loans guaranteed under section 7(a)(31)(G) after December 1, 2011."
