    "content": "Medicare is the nation's health insurance program for individuals aged 65 and over and certain disabled persons. In FY2008, it will cover an estimated 44.6 million people at a total cost of $456.3 billion. Federal costs will amount to $389.7 billion. Medicare is an entitlement program that covers four distinct parts: Part A (Hospital Insurance), Part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance), Part C (Medicare Advantage), and Part D (prescription drugs). Medicaid is a means-tested entitlement program that finances medical services for over 63 million people at a cost of roughly $317 billion. Each state administers its own version of Medicaid with variability in eligibility, covered services, and reimbursement. Federal Medicaid spending is a large share of mandatory spending and is open-ended in the federal budget. Federal Medicaid spending is a large share of mandatory spending, with total outlays dependent on state Medicaid programs. SCHIP, authorized under Title XXI of the Social Security Act, covers low-income children with no health insurance. States can enroll children in an SCHIP-financed Medicaid expansion or create a separate SCHIP program. States must provide mandatory benefits and follow Medicaid cost-sharing rules. SCHIP, like Medicaid, is a federal-state matching program that covers low-income children without health insurance. States must adhere to specific coverage and benefit options outlined in SCHIP law, with cost-sharing limited to 5% of total income annually. Funding for SCHIP was approximately $5.7 billion in FY2007, allocated based on the number of low-income children and uninsured children in each state. In FY2007, the SCHIP program had an enhanced FMAP ranging from 65% to 83.12% across states. Approximately 6.7 million children were enrolled in SCHIP during that year, with 12 states also enrolling about 700,000 adults. This provision also modifies physician payment updates and extends quality reporting systems to avert fee schedule reductions. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 authorized funds for physician payment and quality improvement initiatives. It mandates a 0.5% increase in the physician fee schedule for the first six months of 2008 and modifies the PAQI Fund availability and spending. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 authorized funds for physician payment and quality improvement initiatives, including a 0.5% increase in the physician fee schedule for the first six months of 2008. The Appropriations Act of 2008 affects the PAQI Fund, depleting funds for 2008-2012 but leaving $4.96 billion available in 2013. This provision requires the 2013 funds to adjust the conversion factor. Additionally, funds not used for physician services before January 1, 2013, will be deposited into the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund. The Physician Quality Reporting System is extended and modified for FY2008 and FY2009, with $25 million authorized for the CMS Program Management Account. The CMS Program Management Account is authorized $25 million for FY2008 and FY2009 for the Physician Quality Reporting System. A 5% bonus payment for certain physicians in scarcity areas is extended through June 30, 2008. Medicare payment for physician services is based on fee schedule with factors like relative value, geographic adjustment, and national conversion factor. Geographic adjustments reflect cost variances compared to the national average. The geographic adjustments in 89 payment localities compare expenses to the national average. A value below 1.00 indicates expenses below the average. Current law temporarily increases values below 1.00 to 1.00 for services from 2004 to 2008. The provision extends through June 30, 2008, for independent laboratories billing hospitals directly for services agreed upon before July 22, 1999. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 set payment limits for outpatient therapy services, exempting hospitals. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 required an exceptions process for medically necessary therapy services, extended through June 2008. MMA mandated separate payments for brachytherapy sources under Medicare's outpatient prospective payment system. The TRHCA mandates separate payments for specified brachytherapy sources under Medicare's outpatient prospective payment system. Hospitals' charges will be adjusted to costs until January 1, 2008. Cost reimbursement for brachytherapy services is extended until July 1, 2008. Therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals will be paid using this methodology for services between January 1, 2008, and July 1, 2008. Hospitals with under 50 beds in qualified rural areas receive 100% of reasonable cost reimbursement for clinical diagnostic laboratories provided as outpatient services under Part B. This provision extends reimbursement for clinical laboratory services by qualified rural hospitals through June 30, 2008. Special Needs Plans (SNPs) in Medicare Advantage (MA) exclusively serve special needs beneficiaries defined as eligible enrollees who are institutionalized, entitled to Medicaid, or would benefit from SNP enrollment. This provision allows SNPs to restrict enrollment until January 1, 2010, and imposes a moratorium on new SNP plans until then. Cost-based Medicare plans are reimbursed for actual costs of services to beneficiaries, with restrictions on plans operating within certain MA service areas after January 1, 2008. The provision extends the operating time for cost-based plans in areas with two local or two regional MA plans from January 1, 2008, to January 1, 2009. A stabilization fund was to be established for MA Regional Plans, with funding of $1.6 billion in 2012 and $1.79 billion in 2013. This provision eliminates the $1.6 billion in funds available for the stabilization fund in 2012. Medicare is the primary payer, but in some cases, other insurance may fill in gaps. The Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) rules prohibit Medicare from making payments when a third-party payer is expected to pay. Insurers must provide information to identify when they are the primary payer, and recover incorrect Medicare payments. The provision requires insurers and third-party administrators to comply with sharing Medicare Part A and Part B information. Failure to comply will result in a $1,000 per day penalty. Applicable plans must determine if a claimant is entitled to Medicare benefits and submit required information to the Secretary. The provision mandates insurers and third-party administrators to share Medicare Part A and Part B information for coordination of benefits and recovery claims. Non-compliance results in a $1,000 per day penalty. The Secretary can disclose information as needed. Additionally, the Secretary will transfer $35 million to the CMS Program Management Account for fiscal years 2008-2010 to ensure appropriate Medicare payments. MMA revised Part B drug payments to be based on average sales price, with the Secretary having authority to adjust payments if market prices differ significantly. Beginning in 2006, Medicare offers physicians the choice between receiving payment based on the average sales price (ASP) methodology or obtaining drugs through the competitive acquisition program (CAP). The ASP payment equals 106% of the price for multiple or single source drugs, with prices derived from manufacturer data reported under the Medicaid program. Prices for multiple source drugs are the volume-weighted average of ASPs by National Drug Code (NDC) for each quarter, while prices for single source drugs are the lesser of the volume-weighted ASP or wholesale acquisition cost. MMA specifies the calculation of volume-weighted ASP. The MMA specified how to calculate a volume-weighted ASP based on manufacturer-reported data, using the NDC as the reporting unit. However, the Secretary had the discretion to change the reporting unit to the amount of the drug represented by the NDC. In 2006, the OIG reported that CMS did not consistently use billing units in calculating ASPs across NDCs, leading to inaccuracies in standardizing sales volume. The HCPCS code standardizes health care procedure codes for insurance claims. The ASP calculation requires constant volume weighting using a specific formula. The numerator for the volume-weighted average includes the manufacturer's average sales price for multiple source drugs. This provision applies to drugs furnished on or after April 1, 2008. The provision defines the \"billing unit\" as the identifiable quantity associated with a billing and payment code, as established by the Secretary. Beginning on April 1, 2008, for each multiple source drug or biological, the payment amount will be the lowest price option available to the Secretary. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is used to monitor blood glucose control. The Medicare payment rate for HbA1c tests is tied to HCPCS codes 83036 and 83037. Code 83037 was created in 2006 for FDA-approved home testing devices, while 83036 is the default code for most tests. Starting April 1, 2008, the payment rate for 83037 will be the same as 83036. LTCHs are acute care hospitals with longer stays paid under their own system since 2002. The LTCH-PPS provisions, established in 1999 and 2000, are not part of the Social Security Act. LTCH base rates are updated annually, and LTCHs are not explicitly allowed to be units of other facilities. A new policy was implemented in 2007 to determine if freestanding LTCHs were acting as units of independent host hospitals, limiting the proportion of patients admitted from a host hospital. The LTCH-PPS policy sets a threshold for admissions from host hospitals, with exceptions for rural and urban HwHs. Short-stay outliers are discharged earlier than the average length of stay for a long-term care DRG. Recent policy changes in the LTCH-PPS system added a new class of short-stay outliers, allowing Medicare to pay less for cases with shorter stays. The Secretary may adjust payment rates to prevent discrepancies between actual and estimated payments, ensuring fair payment for LTCH services to Medicare beneficiaries with complex medical conditions. The LTCH must meet specific criteria, including physician supervision, long hospital stays for Medicare beneficiaries with complex conditions, and patient validation within 48 hours of admission. It must have active physician involvement, organized medical staff, and interdisciplinary teams for individualized patient treatment plans. The Secretary is required to conduct a study on national LTCH facility and patient criteria, submitting a report to Congress within 18 months. During a three-year moratorium period, the Secretary will not apply the 25% rule to freestanding LTCHs or certain LTCH HwHs. Admission thresholds for HwHs in rural areas or co-located with urban hospitals will increase. The new short-stay outlier policy and prospective payment adjustments are also on hold during this period. During a three-year moratorium period, the Secretary will impose a temporary moratorium on the certification of new LTCHs, satellite facilities, and long-term care hospital beds. Exceptions include existing LTCH bed increase requests due to closure or significant decrease in LTCH beds in a state with only one other LTCH. No administrative or judicial review is allowed for the Secretary's decisions on these exceptions. This provision establishes 1886(m) of the SSA entitled \"Prospective Payment for Long Term Care Hospitals.\" The LTCH-PPS provisions under the BBRA and BIPA include a base rate for RY 2008, with reviews for medical necessity of LTCH admissions starting October 1, 2007. The Secretary will conduct annual reviews to identify and recover overpayments, with a requirement to establish an error rate for further review. These reviews will cease after October 1, 2010, unless specified otherwise. The provision includes funding for medical necessity reviews for LTCHs, with $35 million appropriated from the Treasury in FY2008 and FY2009. Costs will be covered by recouped overpayments, not exceeding 40%. Payments to IRFs are under a discharge-based system with annual updates based on market basket index. The IRF update factor is set at 0% in FY2008 and FY2009. Starting July 1, 2007, the IRF compliance threshold is set at 60% with comorbidities included. The Secretary will submit a report within 18 months on access to rehab services and alternatives to the threshold. Medicare may pay a physician for services provided by a second physician to the first physician's patients, not exceeding 60 days. P.L. 110-54 allowed reciprocal services before January 1, 2008. The provision enacted on August 3, 2007 allowed reciprocal billing for services provided before January 1, 2008, in cases where the first physician was called to active duty as a reserve member. This accommodation was extended through June 30, 2008. Hospitals can increase Medicare payments through administrative reclassification to areas with higher wage index values under IPPS. Section 508 of MMA provided $900 million for a three-year geographic reclassification of certain hospitals. The TRHCA extended Section 508 reclassifications until September 30, 2008, exempt from budget neutrality requirements. Hospitals reclassified under the Secretary's authority in FY2005 will also have their reclassification extended. Group reclassification of eligible hospitals in FY2008 is not prevented by Section 508 reclassifications. Hospitals with lower wage index during the extension period will have the higher wage index applied for the entire FY2007 period. Additional Medicare payments will be made accordingly. State Health Insurance Assistance Programs (SHIPs) and State Area Agencies on Aging provide information and assistance to Medicare-eligible individuals. The Secretary is required to transfer funds to provide grants to state SHIP programs for FY2008. The Secretary is transferring $5 million from the CMS program management account to provide grants to Area Agencies on Aging and Aging and Disability Resource Centers for FY2008 and FY2009. SCHIP appropriations for FY2008 remain at $5.0 billion for states and territories, with an additional $40 million for territories. Funding is allocated based on the number of low-income children and uninsured children in each state, adjusted by a geographic cost factor. Unspent funds after three years are redistributed to other states. S. 2499 appropriates $5.04 billion for FY2008 and FY2009. Under S. 2499, $5.04 billion is appropriated in FY2008 and FY2009 for SCHIP allotments, with funds unspent after three years redistributed to other states. The methodology for redistributing unspent FY2005 federal SCHIP funds is specified in the Continuing Resolutions. The Continuing Resolutions make permanent the redistribution of unspent FY2005 federal SCHIP funds. Under S. 2499, FY2006 funds unspent by the end of FY2008 will be redistributed to states facing shortfalls in FY2009. Congress allocated $283 million in FY2006 to eliminate states' SCHIP fund shortfalls, with additional appropriations made in FY2007 not to exceed $650 million. Under S. 2499, appropriations not exceeding $1.6 billion in FY2008 aim to cover states' SCHIP fund shortfalls and provide 1.05% of projected shortfall amounts to territories. An additional $275 million is appropriated in FY2009 for the same purpose. In FY2009, $275 million is appropriated to cover states' SCHIP fund shortfalls and provide 1.05% of projected shortfall amounts to territories. Unspent funds are not available for redistribution. Eleven states are considered \"qualifying states\" for using SCHIP funds for some children enrolled in Medicaid. In FY2009, $275 million is appropriated to cover states' SCHIP fund shortfalls and provide 1.05% of projected shortfall amounts to territories. Eleven states are considered \"qualifying states\" for using SCHIP funds under \u00a72105(g) to pay the difference between SCHIP's enhanced FMAP and the Medicaid FMAP for children above 150% of poverty enrolled in Medicaid. Under S. 2499, qualifying states can use their FY2008 and FY2009 SCHIP allotments for expenditures under \u00a72105(g) permanently and until March 31, 2009, respectively. States must provide transitional medical assistance (TMA) to low-income families losing Medicaid coverage due to income changes. Federal law mandates four months of TMA for families losing eligibility for various reasons, with work-related TMA requirements expanded in 1988 and since 2001. Since 2001, work-related TMA requirements under Section 1925 have been funded by short-term extensions, most recently through December 31, 2007. The Title V Abstinence Education block grant, established by P.L. 104-193, provided $250 million in federal funds for abstinence education over five years. States must match federal funds for this program, with a minimum annual funding requirement of $87.5 million. The latest temporary extension continues funding for the Title V Abstinence Education block grant. The block grant has been extended through June 30, 2008, with $200 million allocated for the QI program. Medicaid pays Medicare part B premiums for low-income individuals. State Medicaid programs must consider hospitals serving low-income patients with special needs when setting payment rates. The federal reimbursement for Disproportionate Share Hospitals (DSH) payments is capped at a statewide ceiling, known as the state's DSH allotment. Under TRHCA, special allotments for Tennessee and Hawaii were raised for 2007 but would revert to lower amounts. S. 2499 extends these provisions for FY2008, setting Tennessee's DSH allotment at three-quarters of the 2007 level and Hawaii's at $7.5 million. In FY2008, S. 2499 increases SCHIP funding to $20 million for estimating low-income children numbers. Medicaid covers school-based health services, transportation, and rehabilitation. Proposed rules by the Bush Administration in 2007 affect rehabilitation and school-based services. S. 2499 prohibits further restrictions on Medicaid coverage or payments. The moratorium prohibits the Secretary of HHS from restricting Medicaid coverage for rehabilitation services and school-based activities until June 30, 2008. MedPAC advises Congress on Medicare payments and access to care. The provision establishes MedPAC as a congressional agency. Research into Type I diabetes prevention and cure is mandated with $150 appropriations. Research into the prevention and cure of Type I diabetes is mandated with $150 million appropriations per year from FY2004 to FY2008. Grants are provided for services targeting diabetes prevention and treatment among American Indians and Alaskan Natives. Additionally, $150 million is allocated for these grant programs in FY2009."
