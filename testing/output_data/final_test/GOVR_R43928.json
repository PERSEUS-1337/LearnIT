    "content": "Recent legal events involving Vietnam-era servicemembers with \"other than honorable\" discharges have prompted Congress to address the impact on veterans' benefits eligibility. A class action lawsuit was filed by veterans assisted by Yale Law School, alleging violations in the review process for discharge status upgrades. An upgrade to an honorable or general discharge would allow some Vietnam-era servicemembers with OTH discharges to establish eligibility for veterans' benefits. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel issued guidance for the BCM/NR to give \"liberal consideration\" to petitions for changes in discharge status, particularly for PTSD-related cases. The Department of Veterans Affairs plays a separate role in assessing entitlement to benefits for individuals with different discharge statuses. Assessing entitlement to veterans' benefits for individuals with discharges that do not meet basic eligibility criteria involves establishing \"veteran\" status through active duty service requirements and a discharge under conditions other than dishonorable. This determines access to benefits like disability compensation, healthcare, education assistance, pension, burial benefits, housing, and vocational rehabilitation. Former servicemembers not meeting these criteria are generally denied benefits. The report discusses how the VA assesses character of service to determine veteran status based on discharge or separation requirements. Military discharge characterization can impact entitlement to VA benefits, with honorable or general discharges typically granting access. If discharge characterization may hinder benefits, the VA evaluates service records and evidence. A hypothetical example is included in the report. The report discusses the complexities of making character of service determinations for VA benefits. To file a claim, a former servicemember can submit an application online or by mail to a local VA office. The VA accepts informal claims indicating an intent to apply for benefits. The VA is required to assist claimants in obtaining necessary evidence for their claims. Former servicemembers can receive free assistance in filing claims through a certified veterans service organization (VSO). The Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) requires the VA to notify claimants of needed evidence and give them the \"benefit of the doubt\" in adjudicating claims for benefits. The VA must give the claimant the \"benefit of the doubt\" when there is an approximate balance of evidence for any claim. If the claimant does not respond within one year, the application becomes invalid, and they must re-file for benefits. Veteran status is essential for accessing VA benefits, requiring former servicemembers to meet specific criteria. To be considered a veteran for most VA benefits, an applicant must have active duty military service, 24 months of continuous service, and a discharge under conditions other than dishonorable. Active service refers to full-time service in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, or as a commissioned officer. Active service for VA benefits includes full-time service in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, or as a commissioned officer of certain organizations. It also covers periods of active duty training or inactive duty for training where injury or death occurs in the line of duty. Additional circumstances of service are outlined in statute to determine active military service eligibility. The determination of active service for VA benefits may require scrutiny of service records to ensure eligibility, especially for individuals with multiple periods of service. Prior to September 8, 1980, there was no minimum length of service required to be considered a veteran for most VA benefits, but post-September 7, 1980, certain minimum length-of-service requirements must be met. After September 7, 1980, minimum length-of-service requirements must be met for VA benefits. Exceptions include service-connected disability compensation, VA life insurance benefits, hardship discharges, and retirements due to service-related disability. If not meeting the 24 months of active duty or full period requirement, claimants may not have completed the minimum active duty period. The statutory definition of a veteran requires completion of a minimum period of active duty and an honorable discharge. The military character of discharge is categorized as honorable, general, other than honorable, bad conduct, or dishonorable. This information is typically found in the former servicemember's DD-214 or discharge paperwork. The character of a former servicemember's discharge impacts eligibility for VA benefits. An honorable or general discharge usually results in benefits being awarded, while bad conduct or dishonorable discharges bar individuals from receiving benefits. The VA assesses the character of service to determine eligibility. Former servicemembers are only eligible for veterans' benefits if the VA determines they were insane at the time of the offense or if eligibility can be established based on a prior period of service other than dishonorable. The VA cannot change a military discharge but reviews evidence to determine eligibility for benefits. The VA determines eligibility for veterans' benefits based on whether the record of service is other than dishonorable or dishonorable. Factors such as insanity and mitigating circumstances are considered in character of service determinations, which are case-by-case and not always predictable. Certain military discharge characterizations may preclude former servicemembers from receiving VA benefits. Congress has delegated authority to the Secretary of the VA to establish criteria for awarding benefits. Legal bars to veterans' benefits may apply in certain circumstances, but exceptions exist. For example, benefits may be barred for servicemembers with an Other Than Honorable discharge due to various reasons like conscientious objection or desertion. However, if the VA determines the former servicemember was insane at the time of the offense, they may still qualify for benefits. Additionally, prior periods of service under conditions other than dishonorable may also make a servicemember eligible for benefits. Statutory and regulatory bars may prevent servicemembers from receiving VA benefits, including those with an Other Than Honorable discharge for certain reasons. Exceptions exist, such as if the VA determines the individual was insane at the time of the offense. Certain conditions may still make a servicemember eligible for benefits. The VA may grant veterans' benefits to individuals with an Other Than Honorable discharge if they were found to be insane at the time of the offense. Insanity does not need to be directly linked to the misconduct that led to the discharge. The VA will investigate evidence of insanity and consider whether the misconduct was a result of the mental condition. The VA may grant veterans' benefits to individuals with an Other Than Honorable discharge if they were found to be insane at the time of the offense. Insanity must be proven through facts, circumstances, and evidence surrounding the case. The VA is obligated to develop evidence to support the claim of insanity, including obtaining medical opinions on the servicemember's sanity at the time of the offense. Claimants are not required to demonstrate insanity through medical or legal determinations. Under 38 C.F.R. \u00a73.13, a former servicemember may be entitled to certain VA benefits based on a prior period of honorable service, even if their most recent discharge is dishonorable. The VA may consider a servicemember's prior honorable service when awarding benefits like the Post-9/11 GI Bill, even if their most recent discharge is Other Than Honorable. If a former servicemember's discharge is questioned during the claims process, the VBA regional offices are responsible for evaluating the character of service. The VA's Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) evaluates the character of service to determine eligibility for benefits by reviewing personnel files, service records, court-martial proceedings, and other relevant information. The VA has a duty to assist claimants throughout the claims process. The VA has a duty to assist claimants throughout the claims process, including ensuring file completeness, seeking evidence, and providing medical examinations. A team at a VA Regional Office handles character of service determinations, providing advance notice and explaining the criteria and regulations. Claimants have rights to legal representation, an in-person hearing, and to submit evidence. The VA notice explains claimants' rights to legal representation, an in-person hearing, and submitting evidence. Claimants have 60 days to respond with additional evidence or request more time. The VA considers all available evidence to determine the character of service for veterans. The VA determines the character of service for veterans, which can impact their eligibility for benefits. A favorable finding bestows \"veteran\" status and full VA benefits, while an unfavorable finding of dishonorable service can result in the loss of benefits pending appeals. Claimants have rights to legal representation, hearings, and submitting evidence within 60 days. The VA determines the character of service for veterans, impacting their eligibility for benefits. Former servicemembers can seek a review of their discharge through the military department, which plays a role in determining eligibility for VA benefits. Factors affecting VA determinations include service records, advocacy, and willingness to appeal decisions. The Veterans Health Administration operates the nation's largest integrated health care system. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) of the VA operates the largest integrated health care system for eligible veterans, providing services through various medical facilities. Enrolled veterans have access to a comprehensive medical benefits package, managed based on priority categories. Enrollment is not required for readjustment counseling services at Vet Centers. Eligibility for VA health care is determined similarly to other benefits and services provided by the VA. Eligibility for VA health care is primarily based on veteran status, which is established by meeting three criteria: full-time active duty military service, minimum 24 months of service, and discharge under conditions other than dishonorable. VA accepts honorable discharges. For VA benefit purposes, VA accepts discharges characterized as honorable or general (under honorable conditions) as other than dishonorable. Veterans meeting these criteria may enroll in the VA health care system. Even if a veteran does not receive an honorable or general discharge, they may still receive health care services from the VHA. An OTH discharge does not necessarily deprive a veteran of all benefits, and they may still be eligible for care for service-related disabilities or illnesses. Veterans with discharges falling under a statutory bar for VA benefits or bad conduct discharge are not eligible for VA health care during that period. However, VHA may provide treatment based on prima facie eligibility, even if discharge status is in question. If authorized, VHA prepares VA Form 10-7131 and forwards it to the Veterans Service Center for further action. Upon receipt of VA Form 10-7131, the VSC determines claimant's discharge status and eligibility for VA health care. The rating activity prepares a memorandum rating, indicating if the individual is entitled to health care for service-connected disabilities. There is an exception for servicemembers who have experienced military sexual trauma (MST). The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 broadened VHA policy on military sexual trauma (MST) eligibility, defining an \"Eligible individual\" as someone without veteran status who experienced sexual trauma while on active duty or active duty for training. The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 expanded eligibility for MST-related care to include individuals without veteran status who experienced sexual trauma while on active duty or active duty for training. This benefit also extends to Reservists and National Guard members activated to full-time duty status. Additionally, former servicemembers who experienced sexual trauma while on inactive duty training are now eligible for free MST-related health care. The VA provides free MST-related health care to veterans, regardless of VA enrollment or service-connected disability rating. The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 extends MST-related health care benefits to active-duty servicemembers and individuals without veteran status. Appeals for dishonorable character of service determinations are handled similarly to other veteran appeals. The VA handles appeals for dishonorable character of service determinations similarly to other veteran appeals. Each VA regional office has a decision review officer (DRO) who reviews appeals before they reach the Board of Veterans' Appeals. The DRO conducts a de novo review and can only revise the initial decision if there is clear and unmistakable error. The DRO can find clear and unmistakable error in an appeal. Claimants can request DRO review or go directly to the BVA. The BVA, located in Washington, DC, makes final decisions on appeals within the VA. Board members are appointed by the VA Secretary. If unsatisfied with the BVA decision, claimants have options. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) is an Article I court that reviews appeals from the BVA. The CAVC is separate from the VA and has up to nine judges who review BVA decisions. If dissatisfied with the CAVC's determination, claimants can appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which has limited scope of review on veterans' appeals. The Federal Circuit is the last appeal of right for claimants appealing decisions made by the BVA. If the claimant is still unsatisfied, they may petition the Supreme Court for certiorari, but there is no guarantee the Supreme Court will hear the appeal. Any decision provided by the Supreme Court is final."
