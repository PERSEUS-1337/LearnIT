    "content": "The \"Holocaust Rail Justice Act\" is the short title of this Act. Congressional findings are outlined in the Act. Congress finds that during World War II, over 75,000 Jews and others were deported from France to Nazi concentration camps on trains operated by SNCF. US citizens, including servicemen shot down over France, were among those deported. Lawsuits have been filed against SNCF in the US seeking redress for these actions. The complaint alleges that SNCF, a separate entity during WWII, operated deportation trains for profit, collaborating with the Nazi regime. SNCF provided rolling stock, scheduled departures, and charged ordinary passenger fares for deportations to concentration camps. The plaintiffs accuse SNCF of cramming people into train cars without food, water, or sanitation, cleaning out corpses after each trip, and transporting deportees to camps for extermination or forced labor, violating Nuremberg Tribunal principles. SNCF, accused of aiding war crimes and crimes against humanity, has not compensated deportees or their heirs for deportations. SNCF's records on deportation trains are inaccessible, and it claims sovereign immunity in a lawsuit. SNCF, one of the 500 largest corporations globally, earns millions in the US but claims sovereign immunity in a lawsuit. The US District Court initially dismissed the case, but on appeal, the Second Circuit granted immunity, citing the railroad's infamous past conduct. The lawsuit against SNCF for transporting people to Nazi concentration camps during World War II was dismissed in Federal court due to sovereign immunity. The case is of significant importance to US citizens and veterans seeking redress, many of whom are elderly and unable to travel abroad for legal proceedings. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 plays a role in this lawsuit. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 did not prevent a lawsuit against SNCF for its actions during World War II. Access to United States courts for Holocaust deportees is addressed in Section 3. The United States district courts have jurisdiction over civil actions for damages related to deportation to Nazi concentration camps between 1942 and 1944, brought against railroads that owned or operated the trains. Other laws do not apply to these cases. The United States district courts have jurisdiction over civil actions for damages related to deportation to Nazi concentration camps between 1942 and 1944, brought against railroads that owned or operated the trains. Sections 1330 and 1601 through 1611 of title 28, United States Code, or any other law limiting the jurisdiction of the United States courts, shall not preclude any action under this section. An action described in this section shall not be barred by a defense that the time for bringing such action has expired under a statute of limitations. This section applies to any action pending on January 1, 2002, and to any action commenced on or after that date. The Secretary of State must report to Congress within one year of this Act's enactment on the public's access to records of railroads involved in deporting individuals to Nazi concentration camps between 1942 and 1944."
