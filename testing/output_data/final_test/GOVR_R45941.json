    "content": "The Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse through legislation granting federal agencies budget authority to spend federal funds. Budgetary resources consist of newly enacted budget authority and unspent balances from prior years. Discretionary spending, which makes up 30% of federal spending, is subject to annual congressional decision-making, while mandatory spending accounts for the remaining 70%. Mandatory spending, also known as direct spending, flows directly from multiyear authorizing laws and includes entitlement programs, supplemental nutrition assistance, and multiyear highway bills. Sequestration, a budgetary mechanism established in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, enforces fiscal policy goals through automatic budget cuts. The Budget Control Act of 2011 set discretionary spending caps and established a Joint Committee process for broader budgetary savings. The Budget Control Act of 2011 placed limits on discretionary spending from FY2012 to FY2021, aiming to save $917 billion. A Joint Committee was tasked with finding an additional $1.5 trillion in savings, but when they failed to reach an agreement, $1.2 trillion in automatic spending reductions were triggered. These reductions were meant to achieve budgetary savings by cutting both discretionary and mandatory spending through FY2021. The Budget Control Act of 2011 aimed to save $917 billion by placing limits on discretionary spending from FY2012 to FY2021. An additional $1.2 trillion in savings was to be achieved through reductions in discretionary spending caps and across-the-board cuts in nonexempt mandatory spending. The automatic reductions have been fully implemented and extended through FY2029. The Act includes detailed directions for calculating and implementing these reductions annually. The Budget Control Act of 2011 aimed to save $917 billion through limits on discretionary spending from FY2012 to FY2021. An additional $1.2 trillion in savings was to be achieved through reductions in discretionary spending caps and across-the-board cuts in nonexempt mandatory spending. OMB must calculate annual spending cap reductions to arrive at mandatory spending cuts. The required $1.2 trillion deficit reduction is divided over nine years, with $109.3 billion annual reduction split evenly between defense and nondefense spending. Under the Budget Control Act of 2011, each category must be reduced by $54.667 billion annually through FY2021, with reductions allocated between discretionary and mandatory spending. The reductions in discretionary spending were achieved by lowering spending limits, while mandatory spending cuts were implemented through automatic across-the-board cuts. In the defense category, reductions must be proportionally allocated between discretionary and mandatory spending based on calculations by OMB. The Budget Control Act of 2011 requires annual reductions of $54.667 billion in each category through FY2021, with cuts allocated between discretionary and mandatory spending. For the defense category, the discretionary-to-mandatory ratio is 98.46% to 1.54%. This results in a defense discretionary reduction of $53.825 billion and a defense mandatory reduction of $842 million. The defense discretionary spending cap is lowered to $576.175 billion, superseded by the revised level of $666.5 billion in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019. The Budget Control Act of 2011 mandates annual reductions in both defense and nondefense categories. The defense category faces an 8.6% across-the-board cut in nonexempt mandatory spending, resulting in a reduction of $842 million. Sequestration must be applied equally to all programs within affected budget accounts. The nondefense category must be reduced by $54.667 billion, with cuts in discretionary and mandatory spending, including a significant portion from the Medicare program. The Budget Control Act of 2011 mandates annual reductions in both defense and nondefense categories. The nondefense category must be reduced by $54.667 billion, with cuts in discretionary and mandatory spending, including a significant portion from the Medicare program. For FY2020, the Medicare program is subject to a 2% across-the-board cut, resulting in a reduction of $15.310 billion. The remaining reduction of $39.357 billion is allocated proportionally between nondefense discretionary appropriations and nondefense mandatory spending. The BCA calculates the discretionary-to-mandatory ratio for the nondefense category to be 88.44%. The Budget Control Act of 2011 mandates reductions in both defense and nondefense spending categories. For FY2020, nondefense discretionary spending is reduced by $34.807 billion, while nondefense mandatory spending is reduced by $4.550 billion. The reduction in nondefense discretionary spending is implemented by lowering the spending cap to $543.193 billion. The remaining reduction in nondefense mandatory spending is achieved by applying a 5.9% uniform percentage reduction and increasing student loan fees by the same percentage. The Budget Control Act of 2011 mandates reductions in both defense and nondefense spending categories. For FY2020, nondefense discretionary spending is reduced by $34.807 billion, while nondefense mandatory spending is reduced by $4.550 billion. The reduction in nondefense discretionary spending is implemented by lowering the spending cap to $543.193 billion. The remaining reduction in nondefense mandatory spending is achieved by applying a 5.9% uniform percentage reduction and increasing student loan fees by the same percentage. Sequestration is required for PPAs within affected budget accounts, with automatic budgetary savings triggered by the BCA. The Budget Control Act of 2011 mandates reductions in both defense and nondefense spending categories. Various amendments have been made to the act through legislation such as the BBA of 2013, 2015, 2018, and 2019, which increased discretionary spending limits for specific fiscal years and added years to the Joint Committee mandatory sequester. The BBA of 2019 (H.R. 3877, P.L. 116-37) amended BBEDCA to increase discretionary limits for FY2020 and FY2021 and added two years to the Joint Committee mandatory sequester (FY2028 and FY2029). The Joint Committee mandatory sequester requires saving $109.3 billion annually from FY2013 to FY2021, split evenly between defense and nondefense programs. After FY2021, there is no longer a specific savings target for defense and nondefense spending. The statutes extend the Joint Committee mandatory sequester for FY2022-FY2029, tying defense and nondefense savings to percentage reductions calculated by OMB for FY2021. Sequestration cancels budgetary resources in nonexempt programs and accounts, with exemptions for some programs. The Joint Committee sequester impacts over 200 budget accounts, including various programs like Medicare payments, Affordable Care Act subsidies, farm supports, crime victim services, immigration services, and more. The curr_chunk discusses various exempt programs and activities from sequestration under Section 255 of BBEDCA, including student loan origination fees, highway performance, school construction bonds, and more. Three-quarters of all mandatory spending is exempt from the mandatory sequester. Additionally, Medicare has a 2% limit on sequestration reductions. Medicare, a mandatory spending program, is subject to a 2% sequestration limit, affecting payments to healthcare providers for various services. While beneficiaries may not see direct impacts, there are indirect effects on providers and beneficiaries, especially for Medicare Advantage and Part D coverage. Medicare Advantage and Part D coverage are more complex due to the 2% sequester reduction applied to provider payments. Private health plans receive capitated monthly payments to provide Medicare-covered benefits, and the reduction affects how payments are distributed among providers, administrative expenses, risk adjustments, and plan rebates to beneficiaries. Medicare Part D also faces reduced capitated payments due to the sequester. The 2% Medicare sequester reduces monthly direct subsidy payments to private plans, impacting non-Medicare mandatory programs. Special rules exempt certain Medicare subsidies from sequestration, while administrative expenses are subject to the full 5.9% mandatory sequester. Medicare sequestration in FY2029 is subject to a special rule\u20144% during the first six months and 0% for the second six months of the order. Sequestration impacts federal student loans differently than other programs, with sequestration applied to student loan origination. Sequestration is applied to federal student loan origination fees, which are paid by borrowers to offset loan issuance costs. The fee is a percentage of the loan amount, with Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans having a fee of about 1% and Direct PLUS Loans having a fee of about 4%. Special sequestration rules for student loans increase the origination fee to achieve budgetary savings. Sequestration affects federal student loan origination fees by increasing the fee percentage, reducing the loan amount going to the school. Community and migrant health centers receive funding under the Affordable Care Act, with spending reductions limited to a 2% sequester. Indian Health Service provides health services to American Indians and Alaska Natives, with most funding coming from discretionary appropriations. The Indian Health Service (IHS) receives mandatory appropriations for programs like diabetes treatment, with spending reductions limited to a 2% sequester. Federal administrative expenses, defense unobligated balances, and intragovernmental payments are also subject to sequestration. The funds in revolving, trust, and special fund accounts are exempt from sequestration according to Section 255(g)(1)(A) of BBEDCA. Budgetary resources reduced by a sequester are not available for obligation in the fiscal year it occurs but can be used in subsequent years. OMB released a report on the Joint Committee Reductions for FY2020, detailing the sequester calculations and programmatic impacts. The report details the upcoming fiscal year's sequester calculations, including reductions for mandatory spending accounts such as Medicare, defense, and nondefense. The FY2020 mandatory sequester reductions of $20 million or more are listed in a table for illustrative purposes. The Appendix of the OMB Report to Congress provides a complete list of mandatory spending accounts subject to sequester for FY2020. President Trump issued an order on March 18, 2019, to reduce direct spending budgetary resources for fiscal year 2020 in non-exempt budget accounts on October 1, 2019. The reductions will be made in accordance with the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act. The Office of Management and Budget will calculate the amount to be reduced, as detailed in their report to Congress. The OMB report explains the Joint Committee reductions for FY2020 and how mandatory sequester percentages are calculated. It details the reductions to discretionary spending limits for FY2020 and lists the required reductions through sequestration for each nonexempt budget account with direct spending. The OMB report outlines the Joint Committee reductions for FY2020, including lower discretionary caps for security and nonsecurity categories. Sequestration reductions are required for Medicare and other mandatory programs. Automatic reductions in FY2020 are triggered if deficit reduction legislation is not enacted. The total deficit reduction required is $1.2 trillion for FY 2013 through FY 2021, with annual reductions of $109 billion split evenly between defense and nondefense functions. Reductions are further allocated between discretionary and direct spending within each function group. Different methods are used to implement reductions for discretionary appropriations and direct spending. Reductions for discretionary appropriations and direct spending are implemented by lowering spending limits for defense and nondefense categories. Direct spending reductions are based on sequestrable budgetary resources in FY 2020. Estimates are equal to the current law baseline amounts in the President's FY 2020 Budget. The FY 2020 Budget includes direct spending unobligated balances in the defense function and Federal administrative expenses. The majority of unobligated balances in defense are in Department of Defense accounts. Administrative expenses for Government programs are defined as personnel compensation, travel, communication, and other services. The reductions to direct spending are implemented through sequestration of nonexempt budgetary resources, with most direct spending exempt from sequestration. Defense Function Reduction Steps 1 and 2 calculate the reduction required for discretionary appropriations and direct spending within the defense function. Steps 3 and 4 reflect the implementation of the reductions through adjustments to the discretionary spending limit and sequestration of direct spending in the defense function. The reduction calculation involves allocating $54.667 billion proportionately between discretionary appropriations and direct spending in the defense function. Discretionary appropriations make up 98 percent of the total base. Total defense function spending needs to be reduced by $54.667 billion, with $53.825 billion allocated based on the ratio of discretionary spending limit to the total base. The reduction calculation involves allocating $54.667 billion proportionately between discretionary appropriations and direct spending in the defense function. This yields a $53.825 billion reduction required for discretionary appropriations, with the remaining $0.842 billion for budget accounts with direct spending. The discretionary defense cap for FY 2020 is set at $576.175 billion. Additionally, a 8.6 percent sequestration is applied to budget accounts with nonexempt direct spending. The reduction calculation for nondefense spending involves a complex process due to limits on Medicare and special rules for student loans. Steps 1 and 2 show the reduction required for discretionary appropriations and direct spending in nondefense functions. Steps 3 and 4 reflect the implementation of these reductions through adjustments to discretionary spending limits and sequestration of direct spending. Total spending in the nondefense function must be reduced by $54.667 billion, with a two percent limit on Medicare spending. The reduction calculation for nondefense spending involves a complex process due to limits on Medicare and special rules for student loans. A two percent limit is estimated to have combined FY 2020 and FY 2021 outlays of $765.495 billion from FY 2020 budgetary resources. A reduction of $15.310 billion would come from a two percentage point reduction, leaving $39.357 billion to be taken from discretionary appropriations and other direct spending in the nondefense function. The remaining reduction of $39.357 billion is allocated proportionately between discretionary appropriations and other direct spending in the nondefense function. The reduction calculation for nondefense spending involves a complex process. Discretionary appropriations account for 88.44% of the base, while direct spending accounts for 11.56%. The reduction for discretionary appropriations is $34.807 billion, and for direct spending is $4.550 billion. The discretionary nondefense cap for FY2020 is $543.193 billion. The remaining reduction of $4.550 billion in direct spending is applied as a 5.9 percent uniform reduction to budget accounts with sequestrable direct spending and student loan fees. This results in outlay savings of $0.059 billion in the direct student loan program and $4.491 billion from other budget accounts. Many programs and activities are exempt from the mandatory sequester under Sections 255 and 256(d)(7) of BBEDCA. Three-quarters of all mandatory spending is exempt, including Social Security benefits, Veterans' compensation, and Net interest payments. Other exempt programs include Refundable income tax credits, Federal Reserve Bank Reimbursement Fund, and National Credit Union Administration funds. The Reserve Bank Reimbursement Fund, National Credit Union Administration funds, Federal retirement and disability programs, low-income programs, Child Care Entitlement, Child Nutrition Programs, Children's Health Insurance Program, Family support programs, Federal Pell Grants, Medicaid grants to states, Medicare Part D subsidies, foster care payments, SNAP, SSI, TANF, economic recovery programs, Federal-Aid Highways, Unemployment compensation, and Postal services are exempt from mandatory sequester. Certain programs such as Unemployment compensation, Postal Service Fund, Salaries of Article III judges, and various trust accounts are not exempt from sequestration. Other obligations like Credit liquidating accounts and Federal Crop Insurance Corporation Fund are also affected. Additional resources on sequestration are available in CRS reports. CRS reports on Budget Sequestration and its impact on various programs are available, including information on exemptions and special rules, budget enforcement process, and the impact on unemployment insurance benefits."
