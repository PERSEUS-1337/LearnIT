    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Corporate Welfare Reduction and Job Preservation Act of 1996\". Congressional findings are also included in the Act. The Congress finds that corporations pay lower tax rates due to deductions and subsidies, leading to job losses for the middle class. Between April 3, 1975, and January 31, 1996, the relocation of manufacturing operations led to over 4,500,000 workers seeking adjustment assistance under the Trade Act of 1974. A higher priority should be given to preserving American jobs, closing loopholes in the tax system, and balancing the Federal budget by 2002 while maintaining Medicare and Medicaid levels. SEC. 386.
