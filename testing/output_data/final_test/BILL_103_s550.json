    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Tribal Self-Governance Demonstration Project Technical Amendments Act of 1993\". It pertains to tribal funding shares. Title III of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act is amended to require the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate and provide a tribal share of funds and resources for services to tribes and their members. The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Health and Human Services are required to negotiate and provide a tribal share of funds and resources for services to tribes and their members. The Director of the Office of Self-Governance is designated as the Federal negotiator for agreements with Secretaries, with the authority to execute agreements. The Director determines Federal program residual and tribe's tribal share after considering both parties' positions. The negotiated agreement is then approved by the Secretary and tribe, and forwarded to Congress for review. The tribe or affected Federal agency can appeal the Director's determination of Federal program residual or tribe's tribal share to the Self-Governance Policy Council within 10 days. The Council will make a final decision within 15 days, with no vote from the Director. The tribal share is determined unless agreed otherwise in negotiations. A residual amount for programs directly related to tribal resources or agency functions shall be subtracted from total funds estimated for the next fiscal year. This amount supports core Federal activities required by tribes under agreements authorized by this title. The tribal share of funds from Federal agencies is determined through negotiations using specific factors related to the budget account. A tribe may choose to receive $45,000 per year instead of negotiating. The base budget presented for annual agreements is the minimum amount to be negotiated with the tribe. The base budget for annual agreements with tribes is calculated based on the prior year's negotiated amount, pay cost adjustments, and inflation increases. The affected Secretary must ensure that contract support costs are fully funded by estimating costs using the tribe's indirect cost rate. The total amount of funds in an annual funding agreement with a tribe is fixed, regardless of the source or purpose of the funds. Contract support costs are calculated separately for direct funds to intertribal organizations. Adjustments are made based on the tribe's final approved indirect cost rate. Upon request, 80% of a tribe's estimated annual contract support cost funds can be made available at the beginning of the year. The tribe's contract support cost funds are provided at the beginning of the funding year, with the remainder given later or upon approval of the final indirect cost rate. If a tribe's indirect cost rate remains stable, a lump sum of funds can be negotiated based on the tribe's recent rate. Section 106 of the Act applies to agreements under this title. The provisions of subsections (c) and (d) of section 102 of this Act (25 U.S.C. 450f (c) and (d)) apply to agreements under this title. An Indian tribe and its employees carrying out an agreement under this title are considered part of the Bureau of Indian Affairs or the Indian or Public Health Service. The tribe's employees are deemed employees of the Bureau or Service while acting within the scope of their employment in carrying out the agreement. The Federal Procurement Policy Act and Federal acquisition regulations do not apply to agreements under this title or to a tribe's activities and contracts funded by such agreements. The Secretary of the Interior or Health and Human Services must approve a tribe's request to waive a Federal regulation within 60 days, unless a specific waiver declination finding is made within 30 days. The Secretary must approve a tribe's request to waive a Federal regulation within 60 days, unless specific language in the regulation sought to be waived is mandated by law. If declined, objections must be stated in writing, assistance provided for revision, and a hearing with appeal opportunity granted within 60 days.
