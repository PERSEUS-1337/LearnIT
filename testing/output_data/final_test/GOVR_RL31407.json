    "content": "The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) signed into law in 2002, introduced new requirements for student assessments under Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. This report provides background information on state assessment programs, ESEA Title I-A assessment requirements, and the potential need for amendments to the ESEA by the 111th Congress. The report focuses on state-mandated assessments for public K-12 schools, as required by the NCLB. It analyzes related issues likely to be addressed by the 111th Congress and will be regularly updated with legislative developments. State-mandated assessments are required by almost every state for students in public schools, with variations in the number of grades and subjects tested. Tests are typically not administered to students below grade 3 or in grade 12, with a focus on grades 3-8 for standardized testing. State-mandated assessments in grades 3-8 are administered by 15 states and the District of Columbia in mathematics and reading. These assessments are developed by states themselves, commercial test publishers, or multi-state consortia. State-mandated tests in grades 3-8 are either criterion-referenced tests (CRTs) or norm-referenced tests (NRTs) designed to assess students' mastery of specific curriculum content and skills. Some states administer only NRTs, some only CRTs, and others use both types of tests in different grades and subject areas. Six states use NRTs as primary assessment instruments, while six others have state tests producing achievement results linked to state standards and nationally normed results. Information on costs for state-mandated student testing programs is incomplete, with debates over estimating direct and indirect costs at state, LEA, and school levels. A survey by the Pew Center on state-level expenditures for assessment programs was conducted in 2001. According to a survey by the Pew Center on the States in 2001, state-level direct expenditures for K-12 student assessment programs in FY2001 totaled $422.8 million. Expenditures per state varied from zero for Iowa to $44.0 million for California. Per pupil costs ranged from $1.46 in West Virginia to $82.55 in Alaska. States relying on commercially-published NRTs tend to have lower per pupil costs. Per pupil costs for K-12 student assessment programs vary across states, with lower costs seen in states using commercially-published NRTs like West Virginia and Alabama, and higher costs in states relying on state-specific CRTs such as Alaska and Wyoming. A study on assessment costs in Kentucky and North Carolina showed total five-year state-level costs for Kentucky at $9.55 million and total three-year costs for North Carolina at $33.3 million. The total three-year state-level costs for North Carolina were $4.0 million for test development and $27.5 million in total. These costs may vary for states depending on how they develop or contract tests. The ESEA Title I-A, as amended by the NCLB, outlines student assessment provisions that build upon previous legislation. The IASA and NCLB standards and assessment provisions are tied to receiving financial assistance under ESEA Title I-A. Title I-A is a significant federal K-12 education program, funded at $14.5 billion for FY2010. The IASA of 1994 aimed to improve instructional standards and academic expectations for participating students by aligning Title I-A instruction with state-selected curriculum content and academic achievement standards. The NCLB legislation aimed to make Title I-A tests more meaningful by using state assessments to measure schools' progress towards meeting state standards. States were given time to meet the new assessment requirements, with full implementation required by the 2000-2001 school year. Congress debated the expanded assessment requirements proposed by the Bush Administration in 2001. The ESEA requires states to develop curriculum content standards, academic achievement standards, and assessments tied to the standards to remain eligible for Title I-A grants. States without the authority to establish statewide standards may adopt either statewide standards for Title I-A students or require each LEA receiving grants to adopt standards applicable to all students served. State systems of standards and assessments must meet Title I-A requirements, including developing standards and assessments in math, reading, and science by specific deadlines. Local variation in assessments may be allowed for some grade levels. The standards and assessments for Title I-A eligibility must align with state standards, specify student expectations, and establish performance levels. Assessments in math, reading, and science must be administered annually in specific grade ranges. All students in grades 3-8 must participate in assessments aligned with state standards and performance levels. LEP and students with disabilities are to receive reasonable accommodations during assessments. The assessment system for students must involve multiple approaches with measures of student performance, including higher order thinking skills. Assessments must be valid, reliable, and meet professional standards. Individual student reports should be provided to parents, teachers, and principals promptly after assessments are administered. The assessment system must enable itemized score analyses to be reported to LEAs and schools for identifying specific academic needs. Results must be disaggregated by gender, racial groups, English proficiency, migrant status, disabilities, and economic status. Assessments should objectively measure academic achievement and skills without assessing personal beliefs or disclosing identifiable information. The assessment system must provide itemized score analyses to LEAs and schools for identifying academic needs. Results must be disaggregated by various demographics. Assessment results must be given to LEAs, schools, and teachers before the next school year. States must annually assess the English language proficiency of LEP students. States receiving grants under ESEA Title I-A must participate in biennial state-level administrations of the National Assessment of Educational Progress in 4th and 8th grade reading and mathematics. States were required to adopt content and performance standards, plus assessments linked to these, at three grade levels in mathematics and reading. States were required to annually assess the English language proficiency of LEP students and participate in biennial NAEP administrations. They were also mandated to publish annual report cards on school systems, administer standards-based assessments in grades 3-8, and report progress to ED on meeting assessment requirements under NCLB. States were required to adopt content and achievement standards in science for grades 3-8 by the end of the year, with statutory constraints limiting federal control over specific instructional content and assessments. States must submit their standards to the U.S. Secretary of Education or have them approved by the federal government to receive funds under the ESEA. No state plan can be disapproved based on specific content or achievement standards. Annual grants are authorized to help cover the costs of meeting the Title I-A standard and assessment requirements. The state assessment grants, totaling $490 million for FY2002 and varying amounts for FY2003-FY2008, are crucial for assessment administration and improving assessments of LEP students. Failure to appropriate the minimum annual amounts could result in delays in grade 3-8 and science assessments under NCLB requirements. If less than $400 million is appropriated for state assessment grants for FY2005, the deadline for state tests in reading and math for grades 3-8 would move to 2006-2007. Each state will receive $3 million initially, with the remaining funds allocated based on the state's school-age population. The ESEA also allows competitive grants for enhanced assessment development. The ESEA authorizes competitive grants to states for enhanced assessment instruments, including improving quality, validity, and reliability of assessments. Funds for assessment enhancement grants have varied annually, with amounts ranging from $4.5 million to $17 million. Additionally, NCLB authorizes a study on the impact of expanded assessment requirements. The Secretary of Education can use up to 15% of total appropriations for Title I, Part E or $1.5 million per year for an independent study on assessments used for State accountability. This study includes correlations between assessments and student achievement, instructional practices, dropout rates, effects on different student groups, and relationships between accountability systems and exclusion of students from state assessments. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) assesses academic performance of elementary and secondary students in the US. NAEP tests are given to public and private school students in grades 4, 8, and 12 in various subjects. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) assesses public and private school students in grades 4, 8, and 12 in subjects like reading, math, science, writing, and occasionally geography, history, civics, social studies, and the arts. NAEP has been conducted since 1969 by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and overseen by the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) within the U.S. Department of Education. The assessment is developed in cooperation with the Educational Testing Service (ETS) since 1983, with test administration handled by Westat, Inc., and scoring by National Computer Systems and American Institutes for Research. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) consists of two groups of tests: the main assessment and the long-term trend assessment. The main assessment includes revised test items and performance levels based on score thresholds set by NAGB. The long-term trend assessment monitors trends in math and reading achievement. The long-term trend assessment in NAEP monitors math and reading achievement trends. The tests have remained unchanged since 1969 for consistent year-to-year comparison. Concerns have been raised about the relevance of the assessment questions over time. NAEP tests are administered to a sample of students to minimize costs and test burdens, with each student only taking part of the test. Individual student results are not reported. NAEP tests are administered to a sample of students to monitor math and reading achievement trends. Individual student scores are not reported, as no student takes the entire test. The frameworks for the tests are developed through a national consensus approach involving various stakeholders. Background questionnaires are filled out by students and school staff. The NAEP statute limits background information collected to data directly related to academic achievement and demographic data on student characteristics. Assessment results are provided at various levels depending on the sample group tested, including the nation as a whole, states, LEAs, or schools. NAEP conducts state-level assessments in math, reading, and science for 4th and 8th graders. State science assessments have been administered to 4th and 8th grade students in 1996, 2000, and 2005. The main NAEP, not the long-term trend assessment, is administered at the state level. Participation in NAEP was voluntary for states until the enactment of NCLB. State NAEP scores are reported with respect to performance levels\u2014basic, proficient, and advanced. Approximately 40 states participated in each state-level NAEP assessment between 1990 and 2000. Between 1990 and 2000, 40 states participated in state-level NAEP assessments, with all states except South Dakota taking part at least once. In addition, the FY2002 appropriations allowed for a Trial Urban District Assessment in reading and writing, which was conducted in large urban LEAs such as Atlanta, Chicago, and New York City. Trial urban assessments were also carried out in 2003, 2005, and 2007, with 18 metropolitan school districts participating in 2009. The NCLB requires states to participate in state NAEP tests in 4th and 8th grade reading and math every two years, with federal funding covering the costs. The purpose is to confirm trends in student achievement. Results from the initial assessments were released in 2003, with subsequent rounds in 2005 and 2007. The NCLB required states to participate in state NAEP tests in 4th and 8th grade reading and math every two years, with federal funding covering the costs. The authorizing statute for NAEP was rewritten in the NCLB, with provisions for limited public access to NAEP questions, complaints review, and restrictions on federal government influence on state instructional programs. States may choose not to allow release of state NAEP tests, except for those required for Title I-A purposes. There are conflicting provisions regarding participation in NAEP tests by LEAs and schools. Participation in NAEP tests is voluntary for students and schools, but there are conflicting provisions for LEAs. The NAEP authorization statute states that participation is voluntary for LEAs, but ESEA Title I-A requires LEAs receiving aid to participate in state NAEP tests if selected. The U.S. Department of Education regulations require LEAs and schools receiving Title I-A grants to participate in NAEP if selected. The NCLB authorizes funds for state NAEP tests, with an authorization level of $107.5 million for all NAEP activities. Title III of P.L. 107-279 extended the general NAEP authorization through FY2008. The Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002 (ESRA) did not directly amend provisions but increased funding for NAEP and NAGB activities. The total appropriations for FY2002 were $111.6 million, with subsequent appropriations of $94.8 million for FY2003 and FY2004, $94.1 million for FY2005, $93.1 million for FY2006 and FY2007, $104.1 million for FY2008, $138.8 million for FY2009, and $138.8 million for FY2010. Peer reviewers and ED staff review state systems of standards and assessments. The Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002 increased funding for NAEP and NAGB activities. Peer reviewers and ED staff review state standards and assessments by considering various forms of evidence submitted by states to ensure alignment with Title I-A requirements. Examples of evidence include alignment studies, validity evaluations, accommodations for LEP students and students with disabilities, reporting provisions, and participation data. On July 5, 2002, ED published regulations on this process. The Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002 increased funding for NAEP and NAGB activities. On July 5, 2002, ED published regulations on the Title I-A assessment requirements under the NCLB, including a \"negotiated rulemaking\" procedure involving representatives of various organizations. The NCLB requires representatives from all regions of the US to discuss and make changes to proposed regulations. The Department is encouraged to follow recommendations from the negotiated rulemaking panel, but not required to do so. The negotiated rulemaking panel provides input on proposed regulations beyond the Federal Register comments. The Department's final regulations clarify content and achievement standards, high school expectations, assessment types, and the use of CRTs or NRTs. State assessment systems may include either CRTs or NRTs, with NRTs needing to align with state content standards. Assessments must be consistent across grades and subjects, and LEA-selected assessments must be equivalent to state assessments. LEP, migrant, and homeless students must be included in the assessment system. States determine the minimum number of students required for assessment. The assessment system requires states to determine the minimum number of students from specific demographic groups for public reports. Dissemination of \"itemized score analyses\" does not require releasing individual test items. Assessment requirements apply only to public schools, not private schools. Private school students participating in Title I-A must be assessed in some manner. States must develop achievement and content standards. The curr_chunk discusses the development of achievement standards in science by states, the timeline for implementing assessments, and the inclusion of students with disabilities in assessments. The Education Department published detailed guidance on these requirements. States were required to include academic content standards in reading/language arts and mathematics for grades 3-8, along with a timeline for assessments in these subjects and science by May 1, 2003. Recent regulations address participation rates, treatment of limited English proficient students and students with disabilities in assessments, and flexibility in calculating AYP. Schools were allowed to meet the 95% student participation requirement. The new guidance allows schools to use average participation rates over the last two or three years to meet the 95% participation requirement for assessments. Students who miss assessments due to a \"significant medical emergency\" can be excluded from participation rate calculations. States have the authority to determine make-up test options for missed assessments and the minimum size for demographic groups in AYP determinations. According to the new guidance, states can use average participation rates over the last few years to meet the 95% requirement for assessments. Schools failing to make AYP may do so based on assessment participation rates alone, with up to 20% affected. The new policies for LEP students require participation in English proficiency and math tests, with optional participation in reading tests and inclusion of scores in AYP calculations. The new guidance allows schools to exclude first-year LEP students from AYP calculations but still consider them for test participation. Formerly LEP students can be included in the LEP category for up to two years after proficiency, but not for AYP size thresholds or report cards. These options aim to improve test scores for LEP students and reduce AYP failures based on this group. The Secretary of Education formed a working group in August 2005 to assess the achievement of LEP students for NCLB accountability. Regulations were published in December 2003 to clarify standards and assessments for students with significant cognitive disabilities. States and LEAs can use alternate assessments for these students based on alternate achievement standards. States and LEAs can use alternate assessments based on alternate achievement standards for a limited percentage of students with disabilities, with a maximum of 1.0% of all tested students at the state and LEA level. SEAs may request exceptions to exceed the 1.0% cap statewide, with some states receiving waivers to go slightly above the limit. The new policy announced by the ED in April 2005 and finalized in April 2007 focuses on students with disabilities who are capable of achieving high standards but may not reach grade level at the same pace as their peers. These students would be assessed using alternate assessments based on modified achievement standards, with a short-term and long-term implementation plan. The short-term policy allows states to use alternate assessments based on modified achievement standards for students with disabilities. Schools in eligible states can include a certain percentage of these students in the proficient group to meet AYP standards. Currently, 28 states are utilizing this flexibility. The long-term policy allows states to count proficient scores for students with disabilities, with a 2.0% cap at the LEA and state levels. Final regulations published in 2007 permit the development of modified academic achievement standards and alternate assessments for students unlikely to achieve grade level proficiency. These standards must align with grade-level content but may reflect reduced breadth or depth. The standards for students with disabilities allow for modified academic achievement standards and alternate assessments, aligning with grade-level content but with reduced breadth or depth. There is a 2.0% cap on proficient scores for these students at the state or LEA level. The 2.0% cap on proficient scores for students with disabilities at the state or LEA level does not apply to individual schools. States cannot exceed the 2.0% cap unless they did not reach the 1.0% limit for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities. Additionally, states are no longer allowed to request a waiver of the 1.0% cap for these students. States and LEAs can use the highest score for students who take state assessments multiple times. Former students with disabilities' test scores can be included in the disability subgroup for up to two years after they exit special education. Up to 1.0% of all tested students can be counted as \"proficient or above\" on alternate assessments based on alternate achievement standards, and an additional 2.0% on alternate assessments based on modified achievement standards. Individual schools do not have a limit on the percentage of students in these groups. The October 2008 regulations clarify that assessments required under Title I-A may include multiple formats and multiple assessments within each subject area. There is no limit on the percentage of students in disability subgroups for individual schools. The regulations for Title I-A assessments allow for multiple formats and assessments in reading, math, and science. States must include the latest NAEP results in their performance reports. ED policies on growth models for AYP are now in regulations. States must provide a detailed rationale for their AYP policies. States must explain how their AYP policies provide reliable information while minimizing exclusion of student groups. Regulations also establish the National Technical Advisory Council to advise on technical aspects of state standards and assessments. States must submit modified Accountability Workbooks for peer review and technical assistance. State educational agencies (SEAs) must ensure their assessments meet NCLB requirements for testing students in grades 3-8 in reading, math, and science. Ongoing peer reviews are conducted to assess technical quality. A letter from the Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education outlines categories of state assessment results as of January 7, 2009. As of January 7, 2009, state assessments for mathematics and reading have received Full Approval from 39 states and Approval Pending from 11 states, including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Peer reviews are ongoing for states with assessment systems that do not meet all requirements. As of January 7, 2009, state assessments for reading and mathematics have received Full Approval from 39 states and Approval Pending from 11 states, including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Peer reviews are ongoing for states with assessment systems that do not meet all requirements. Only 11 states have had their science assessments approved. The ESEA authorizes sanctions for states failing to meet standards and assessments deadlines. States that do not meet the 1994 requirements may face sanctions such as withholding state administration funds and limitations on flexibility requests. Funds withheld would be distributed to LEAs. Persistent failure to meet standards could result in the elimination of Title I-A grants. Implementation of new requirements for state participation in NAEP has been ongoing since the NCLB enactment. The schedule for state participation in NAEP has been revised to administer tests in 4th and 8th grade reading and math every two years starting in 2002-2003. Results were released in 2003, with subsequent tests in 2005 and 2007. Changes to NAEP policies have been made to support its expanded role under NCLB. The expanded role of NAEP under NCLB has led to changes in test questions to measure performance gaps among student groups. Efforts are being made to adjust sampling strategies and reduce required student sample sizes, while increasing samples in small states for more precise results. Administrative adjustments are being implemented to combine state and national student samples for the first time. Efforts are being made to enhance the precision of results in sparsely populated states. Special issues arise with Puerto Rico's participation in NAEP tests, especially regarding test comparability in different languages. NAEP tests in mathematics were administered to 4th and 8th-grade students in Puerto Rico in 2003 and 2005. State NAEP tests are now administered by contractors, with a full-time NAEP coordinator in every state. The NCLB includes criteria for state assessments to comply with ESEA Title I-A requirements, but does not address whether state assessment systems must only include CRTs or a mix of CRTs and NRTs. It also does not specify if assessments must be the same statewide or can vary. State assessments under NCLB must be the same academic assessments used for all children, but the requirement is ambiguous when a state lacks assessments for certain grades. Criterion-referenced assessments are most aligned with Title I-A requirements as they measure student achievement against specific standards. The NRTs are primarily designed for ranking students, not for determining if they meet state achievement levels. It is uncertain if modified NRTs can meet Title I-A requirements for linking with state standards. Some states have tried using modified NRTs to meet assessment requirements, but none have been fully approved by ED yet. Statewide assessments would best fulfill Title I-A purposes. Statewide assessments are crucial for meeting Title I-A requirements, especially in determining if schools or LEAs meet state standards of adequate yearly progress. Using the same assessments throughout the state ensures consistency and equivalence in measuring student achievement. While establishing equivalence among local tests is possible, it is challenging. According to a National Research Council report, linking different tests may be feasible under limited conditions, but various factors affect the validity of inferences drawn from them. Multiple factors affect the validity of inferences drawn from linked test scores, including context, format, and margin of error. There is no precedent for states to use different assessments in different LEAs to meet Title I-A requirements. Articulation between tests used in different grades and coherence of the overall assessment system are important concerns. The regulations published by ED for mixed state assessment systems are demanding, requiring NRTs to accurately measure the state's academic content standards and have results expressed in terms of the state's achievement standards. LEA-selected assessments must be equivalent in content coverage, difficulty, and quality, with comparable validity and reliability for aggregation of results. Opponents of proposals for mixed state assessment systems are concerned about the strictness of ED's review process, fearing approval of systems not aligned with state standards. Proponents argue for state flexibility to minimize federal influence and recognize state primacy in selecting assessment systems. Proponents argue for state flexibility in selecting assessment systems that meet their needs and goals, emphasizing the differences between NRTs and CRTs in test result analysis rather than test items themselves. Several states currently use mixed assessment systems, indicating that they meet important educational needs as perceived by the states. Peer reviewers and ED staff conduct rigorous reviews of evidence for assessment systems. The ED staff conducts detailed reviews of evidence submitted by states to determine if their assessment systems meet ESEA requirements, focusing on testing, score reporting, and inclusion for LEP students and those with disabilities. Complex issues are addressed, not solely due to Title I-A requirements, but also under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In the context of Title I-A requirements, the scrutiny of state assessments is necessary to ensure compliance with statutory obligations and accountability for disadvantaged student groups like LEP students and those with disabilities. Enforcement of appropriate accommodations and inclusion in assessments is crucial to determine overall student performance. Inclusive assessment and disaggregated score reporting are crucial for determining if state performance goals are being met, especially with the shift towards outcome measures for accountability in federal aid funds. Title I-A programs are now often conducted in a schoolwide format, raising concerns about federal influence over state assessment systems. However, there are statutory limitations on federal involvement in mandating standards, assessments, or curriculum at the state level. The federal influence over state student assessment systems has increased under the NCLB, with parameters such as grades, subject areas tested, and reporting of results being impacted. The rigor of ED's assessment review process and flexibility of assessment regulations will affect state compliance with expanded requirements. Factors influencing state compliance with Title I-A assessment requirements include state leaders' efforts and coordination between different agencies. The NCLB has increased federal influence over state student assessment systems, impacting grades, subjects tested, and result reporting. Compliance with Title I-A assessment requirements involves state leaders prioritizing compliance, coordinating between agencies, obtaining buy-in from stakeholders, and accessing state-level expertise. States have had to increase expenditures for standard and test development due to new assessment requirements. The GAO published a report in 2003 discussing the costs of meeting NCLB assessment requirements based on a survey of assessment practices in all states and examination of costs in seven states. State costs for assessment development and administration depend on the types of test questions used. The GAO estimated that meeting NCLB assessment requirements using multiple-choice tests would cost states $1.9 billion, while a mixture of multiple-choice and open-ended test items would cost $5.3 billion. This study only considered state-level costs for developing standard assessments in reading, math, and science, excluding costs for alternate assessments for students with disabilities or English language proficiency assessments. The NCLB authorizes funding for state assessment development and administration grants, with possible delays in assessment administration if minimum amounts are not appropriated. State-level expenditures for testing programs align with estimated costs, including assessments for students with disabilities and English language proficiency. The costs of meeting expanded assessment requirements have varied widely from state to state due to differences in test administration and development costs. Some states have reduced assessment development costs through cooperative arrangements. The NCLB provides funds for test development and administration among states, with a formula that allocates funds equally to each state and the remainder based on the number of children and youth. This formula does not consider the variation in assessment program costs among states, potentially rewarding states with extensive assessment programs. The NCLB requires states to assess the English language proficiency of LEP students annually, separate from general assessment requirements. This includes valid assessments in English for students who have been in U.S. schools for three or more years. The NCLB requires states to annually assess the English language proficiency of LEP students separately from general assessments. However, there is a lack of specificity in the requirements, with no details on the technical characteristics of the tests or clear policy guidance from ED. It is unclear whether states or LEAs are primarily responsible for implementing this requirement. Despite the potential for little change in current activities, there is evidence that LEAs already assess LEP students' English proficiency for placement and accommodations. Assessment methods, including formal English language proficiency tests, are used by LEAs for various purposes such as placement in instructional programs, determining needed accommodations, evaluating programs for LEP students, and transitioning students to mainstream instruction. Policy guidance from ED's Office for Civil Rights emphasizes the importance of these assessments for assigning students to instructional programs, determining transition timing, and evaluating program effectiveness, although specific assessment types are not specified. The guidance on assessment methods for English Language Acquisition programs lacks specificity. LEAs must report student English proficiency annually using a valid assessment. NAEP program characteristics include independent content frameworks and low stakes. The NCLB's requirement for states to participate in NAEP has potential implications for the characteristics of NAEP. Previously, state participation in NAEP had symbolic stakes, but under NCLB, state involvement will change significantly with relatively low stakes. Under the NCLB, state participation in NAEP will have relatively low stakes, with results serving as confirmation of test score trends but no direct impact on state eligibility for federal assistance. Provisions for state bonuses and sanctions based on NAEP scores were eliminated, with states evaluated on meeting AYP goals and provided technical assistance if goals are not met. State NAEP scores may be considered in this review process, but there are no bonuses or sanctions, only publicity and technical assistance. The NCLB sets low stakes for state participation in NAEP, with results confirming test score trends but not directly impacting federal assistance eligibility. Despite restrictions on using NAEP to influence state standards, there are concerns about potential indirect influences on curriculum content standards. The NAGB released a \"White Paper\" policy statement in 2002 to clarify the distinction between active attempts to persuade others to adopt NAEP policies (prohibited) and influence by good example (allowed). There may be a conflict between the requirement for NAEP participation by states under ESEA Title I-A and the voluntary nature of participation for students, schools, and LEAs. Previous federal law allowed voluntary participation, but states or LEAs could require participation. Conflicting statutory and regulatory provisions exist regarding NAEP participation. Conflicting statutory and regulatory provisions exist regarding participation in NAEP tests by LEAs and schools, which may lead to difficulties in maintaining the quality of the national sample of tested students and producing valid assessment results. Some states have struggled to recruit enough LEAs, schools, and students to participate in NAEP in the past. The policies regarding voluntary participation in NAEP have changed only modestly, with participation already being voluntary at all levels. Little may have changed in practice, as states or LEAs previously could have mandated participation but generally avoided doing so. Concerns arise with the expansion of NAEP to states that have not previously participated, with the implicit purpose being to confirm trends in student achievement. Some question the validity of using results from one assessment to confirm results from another. State assessments vary widely in content, format, and skills assessed. With the use of CRTs, modified NRTs, and local assessments, some state tests may align more closely with NAEP than others. This variation impacts the significance of comparing trends in NAEP versus state assessment scores. If a state test aligns closely with state curriculum standards different from NAEP, the significance of similarities or differences in student achievement trends may vary. State assessments can differ significantly from NAEP frameworks, leading to potential differences in scores. Variations include the content covered, timing of tests, achievement level cut scores, stakes involved, and test format. Some states align closely with NAEP, while others have minimal overlap. The NAGB report discusses using NAEP scores to confirm trends in state test results, cautioning against strict statistical validation. Comparing average raw scores and achievement levels may overlook important score distribution changes. The report recommends a new method of comparison for state test results, focusing on changes in overall achievement score distribution rather than just averages or cut scores. It highlights the benefits of consistent standards-based tests for providing timely performance information on students, schools, and LEAs in elementary and middle school grades. The report suggests using consistent standards-based tests for state assessments, which would provide valuable diagnostic and accountability information. This would lead to more coherent and well-articulated state assessment systems, emphasizing the importance of meeting state standards. The strategy for state accountability in education focuses on performance assessments and increased flexibility in federal education funding. Accountability is now based more on student outcomes rather than prescribed procedures or resource targeting. High-quality, current, and widely disseminated student achievement data is crucial for accountability policies. The ED publication emphasizes the importance of annual standards-based assessments in providing data to parents, educators, and policymakers. The tests will help teachers diagnose student needs and inform decision-making at all levels of education. Testing is crucial for improving student achievement and identifying areas for growth. Expanded Title I-A assessment requirements may lead to increased federal influence on state and local education policies, impacting standards, assessments, and accountability for all students. This represents a significant shift in federal involvement in K-12 education policy. Some states may not conduct annual assessments in grades 3-8 due to cost or time constraints, or because they believe it may not be educationally beneficial. High-stakes assessment policies could lead to an overemphasis on test preparation and may not fully assess all necessary knowledge and skills. A study suggests that the more a quantitative social indicator influences decision-making, the more likely it is to distort the social process. Increased federal influence in standards and assessments is limited, with states having the authority to select their own standards and assessments. The NCLB does not allow the Education Department to review state standards, and state plans cannot be disapproved based on specific content or achievement standards. The increase in federal influence in standards and assessments under NCLB is balanced by less federal control over certain aspects of state and local use of federal aid funds."
