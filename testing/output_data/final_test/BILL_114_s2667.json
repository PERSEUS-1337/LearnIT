    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Gulf States Protection and Restoration Coordination Act\". Congress finds that the Gulf of Mexico is a valuable national and international resource, but its productivity and water quality have been diminished by pollution, population growth, economic development, and natural events. The protection of the Gulf ecosystem has been historically neglected compared to other US water bodies. The Gulf of Mexico region contributes 17% to the US GDP, ranking as the 7th largest economy globally. Congress aims to coordinate protection and restoration efforts in the Gulf through the Gulf of Mexico Alliance to enhance efficiency. The Act's purposes include expanding voluntary efforts, increasing federal support for monitoring and restoration activities, and committing to a comprehensive approach. The Gulf of Mexico Alliance aims to improve water quality and productivity of living resources in the Gulf region through a comprehensive cooperative program. It also seeks to coordinate federal and state authorities with voluntary efforts to reduce duplication and maximize restoration support opportunities. SEC. 3. GULF STATES PROTECTION AND RESTORATION COORDINATION. The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 is amended to include SEC. 120 for Gulf States Protection and Restoration Coordination. The Gulf of Mexico Alliance is a collaborative organization established by the 5 Gulf States in 2004 to address environmental issues in the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem. The Alliance Management Team consists of designated members representing the Governors of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. The Gulf of Mexico Alliance is designated as a Regional Coordination Partnership of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It is headed by a Director with expertise in Gulf of Mexico issues and is located in a Gulf Coast state. The Alliance's functions include developing plans and programs for Gulf of Mexico issues. The Gulf of Mexico Alliance promotes coordination among State agencies, Federal agencies, and local authorities to develop strategies for improving water quality, protecting living resources, enhancing habitats, and increasing coastal resilience in the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem. They also work with various authorities to develop and implement plans for Gulf of Mexico issues. The Gulf of Mexico Alliance works with state, federal, and local authorities to develop and implement action plans for regional protection and restoration goals. They coordinate priority projects, facilitate research and monitoring activities, implement outreach programs for public education, and provide information through various means. The Gulf of Mexico Alliance focuses on improving water quality and living resources in the Gulf ecosystem by coordinating protection and restoration programs to avoid duplication and maximize resources. They also serve as a liaison with Mexican counterparts and can provide grants to nonprofit organizations, state, and local governments. Grants are available to various entities for monitoring, researching, developing strategies, and implementing programs to address water quality and living resource needs in the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem. Grants are available for creating, restoring, protecting, or enhancing Gulf of Mexico habitat and reducing nonpoint pollution sources. Administrative costs for projects funded by these grants cannot exceed 25%. Reports are required. The Director of the Alliance must submit an annual report to the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, detailing funded projects, goals, objectives, and net benefits. Additionally, an assessment must be conducted every three years starting in 2019. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in coordination with the Alliance Management Team, will assess the Gulf of Mexico Alliance's coordination of regional priorities and submit a comprehensive report to Congress. The assessment will evaluate the status of restoration and protection efforts in the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem, the effectiveness of management strategies, and the extent to which regional needs are being met. The Gulf of Mexico Alliance, in coordination with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, will assess regional priorities and make recommendations for improved coordination among regulatory and nonregulatory programs. The Administrator of NOAA will include a funding request for the Alliance in the annual budget submission to Congress, with no new regulatory authority established. The Gulf of Mexico Alliance, in coordination with NOAA, will assess regional priorities and recommend improved coordination among programs. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2017-2022 is provided."
