SEC. 4. COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS. For fiscal year 2005 and beyond, Federal funds for surface transportation projects can be used by government agencies for private contracts over $100,000 for architectural, engineering, and related services, but only after conducting a cost-benefit analysis as required. The analysis must include a description of services, cost estimates, and negotiation expenses. The cost to the government agency of negotiating, awarding, inspecting, supervising, monitoring, and overseeing the contract, along with an estimate of the cost of having the services performed by the government agency. This includes a determination of whether the services would be procured more quickly through a private contract or by the government agency. (5) Government agency's decision on providing equipment and materials under private contract with estimated cost.\n(6) Estimated cost of unemployment compensation and benefits for displaced government agency employees.\n(7) Estimated cost for government agency to resume service under private contract. SEC. 5. MATERIALS TO ACCOMPANY COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS. After conducting a cost-benefit analysis for a private contract, if the benefits outweigh the costs, a government agency must prepare materials for the contract. These materials include a performance history of the private contractor, detailing work done for the agency or other government agencies in the past 5 years and the funds committed for each contract. The government agency must provide documentation for private contracts, including funds committed, deadlines, violations of laws, and employee qualifications. The private contractor must have employees with expertise equal to government agency employees for services. The contractor's political contribution history and a performance bond certification are required. SEC. 6. DISCLOSURE OF RESULTS OF COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS.\n\nGovernment agencies must disclose cost-benefit analysis results for private contracts before entering into them. Results must be reviewed by the Secretary, shared with registered individuals or entities, and made publicly available, including online.\n\nSEC. 7. COMMENTS. SEC. 7. COMMENTS.\n\nWithin 15 days of a cost-benefit analysis for a private contract being published by a government agency, employees and interested parties can submit written comments disputing the accuracy of the results. Additionally, agency employees can submit competitive bids to provide the services outlined in the contract. The Secretary may waive the application of this Act for private contracts at the request of a government agency if the work is of an emergency, specialty, or intermittent nature and cannot be performed by government employees."
