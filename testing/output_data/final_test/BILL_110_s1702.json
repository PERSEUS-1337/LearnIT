    "content": "The \"Employer Work Incentive Act for Individuals with Severe Disabilities\" aims to promote employment opportunities for individuals with severe disabilities by providing incentives to Government contractors and subcontractors who hire significant numbers of individuals with severe disabilities. Congress finds that only 26.1 percent of the 9.4 million people with severe disabilities in the US are employed, the Disability Trust Fund will be exhausted by 2029, and modernizing federal disability programs is a high-risk area requiring urgent attention and transformation for more efficient functioning. If one percent of severely disabled individuals receiving Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income were employed, the Treasury could save $45 billion over 10 years. The Federal Government should provide incentives to contractors hiring individuals with severe disabilities. SEC. 43 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act encourages contractors to hire individuals with severe disabilities. The Administrator annually sets a Government-wide target of at least 2.5 percent for procurement contracts awarded to businesses employing individuals with severe disabilities. Each executive agency must also establish an annual procurement target to maximize opportunities for these businesses to participate in contracts. The Administrator ensures that procurement targets for executive agencies meet or exceed the annual Government-wide target. A database of eligible nonprofit and for-profit businesses employing individuals with severe disabilities is established. Regulations are promulgated to provide incentives for the employment of individuals with severe disabilities in federal contracts. Regulations require businesses employing individuals with severe disabilities to be considered in contract evaluations by executive agencies. The Administrator ensures this factor is weighted sufficiently to meet the 2.5 percent contracting targets. Businesses must provide documentation to be evaluated as employing individuals with severe disabilities. Businesses must provide documentation to show they currently qualify as employing individuals with severe disabilities, have a history of hiring such individuals, or currently employ at least one individual with severe disabilities. Businesses awarded a contract must commit to meeting employment criteria for individuals with severe disabilities within one year, or face contract termination unless a one-time waiver is approved. The Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employment and Training is responsible for obtaining input from agencies and groups on the effectiveness of the employment and contracting program. Regional Assistance Centers will help businesses qualify for incentives under the program. The Secretary has authority over businesses employing individuals with severe disabilities, defined as those with integrated employment settings similar to non-disabled employees. The Secretary has authority over businesses that employ individuals with severe disabilities, ensuring they are integrated into the workforce. Businesses must meet specific employment quotas based on their size and pay fair wages to these individuals. The Secretary oversees businesses employing individuals with severe disabilities, ensuring integration into the workforce. Businesses must meet employment quotas, pay fair wages, and contribute to health insurance premiums for employees with severe disabilities. The term 'individual with a severe disability' refers to a disabled beneficiary or someone who would qualify as such but exceeds income or asset limits under the Social Security Act. 'Individuals with severe disabilities' includes more than one person meeting this criteria. SEC. 5. REPORTING. The Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employment and Training must submit an annual report to Congress by August 31 on progress towards targets set under section 43 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act."
