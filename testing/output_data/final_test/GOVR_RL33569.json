    "content": "The sunset concept allows programs and agencies to automatically terminate unless renewed by law. Developed in the 1970s by Common Cause, it includes an \"action-forcing\" mechanism and a framework for review. Sunset bills have been introduced in every Congress, with Representative Kevin Brady supporting a federal sunset commission. In 2006, plans were announced to bring sunset legislation to the House floor. In 2006, plans were announced to bring sunset legislation, including the creation of a \"Commission on the Accountability and Review of Federal Agencies\" and \"Federal Review Commissions,\" to the House floor for consideration. These commissions aimed to improve the operations, effectiveness, and efficiency of Federal programs and agencies. The House Government Reform Committee held a hearing on H.R. 3282 and H.R. 5766, with both bills going to markup the following day. The committee voted along party lines, with Democrats voting against both bills and one Republican voting with the minority on each bill. Supporters of H.R. 5766 and H.R. 3282 argue that the bills aim to address overlapping federal programs, improve Congress's oversight function, and reduce fraud. Critics fear the bills would give too much power to the executive branch, burden Congress with reauthorization tasks, and potentially eliminate vital safety net programs. H.R. 3282 proposes the creation of a Federal Agency Sunset Commission (FASC) to review and potentially abolish federal agencies. The Federal Agency Sunset Commission (FASC) would consist of 12 members appointed by the Speaker of the House and the Senate Majority Leader, with four Members of Congress. The commission would review all federal agencies and advisory committees every 12 years and abolish those not reauthorized by Congress. It would use 19 criteria to evaluate each agency's efficiency and public need. The Federal Agency Sunset Commission (FASC) would review all federal agencies and advisory committees every 12 years, evaluating efficiency and public need. By September 1 of each subsequent year, the commission would report to the President and Congress, recommending abolishment or reorganization of agencies. Agencies not reauthorized by Congress would be abolished within one year, unless granted an extension. Congressional approval and potential presidential veto would determine the fate of the program or agency. The bill H.R. 3282 proposes a significant transfer of power from Congress to the executive branch by allowing the President, with support from one-third of the House and Senate, to eliminate popular programs or agencies. A super majority of Congress could extend the deadline for abolishing an agency by two years. The Comptroller General and other officials would prepare an inventory of Federal programs within each agency to assist Congress and the commission. The bill H.R. 5766, approved by the House Committee on Government Reform, would add a new chapter 10 to Title 5 of the U.S. Code, addressing potential constitutional concerns raised by previous sunset commission bills. The bill H.R. 5766 proposes the establishment of a Federal Review Commission to review federal agencies and programs. The commission would consist of seven members appointed by the President, with qualifications in the specific areas to be reviewed. The President would submit a schedule to Congress for the establishment of additional review commissions within one year of enactment. The bill proposes the establishment of review commissions to assess federal agencies and programs. Commissions would consider effectiveness, efficiency, duplication, conflicts, and potential reorganization to better achieve government goals. Agency rule making would also be a factor in the review process. The bill proposes the establishment of review commissions to assess federal agencies and programs for efficiency, duplication, conflicts, and potential reorganization. The commissions would report to the President within one year and may submit legislative proposals for changes. The President would then transmit the assessment and proposals to Congress for consideration. H.R. 5766 mandates fast track legislative procedures for congressional consideration of commission recommendations. The bill specifies procedures for the House of Representatives but is silent on the Senate. Members can introduce legislation during a two-year Congress, but under H.R. 5766, the majority leader or designee would be required to. H.R. 5766 mandates fast track legislative procedures for congressional consideration of commission recommendations. The majority leader of the House or his designee must introduce the bill within five legislative days after receiving the draft implementing measure from the President. If a committee does not report the implementing legislation within 30 legislative days, a privileged motion can be made to discharge the panels. The Speaker has discretion on scheduling a vote on the motion, which must occur within the next two legislative days. Upon report or discharge, the implementation bill would be placed on the House calendar. H.R. 5766 mandates fast track legislative procedures for congressional consideration of commission recommendations. Once the House chooses to take up the implementing legislation, it becomes the unfinished business of the chamber until disposed of. Debate in the House is typically under the one-hour rule, while in the Senate, it is usually unlimited unless limited by unanimous consent, cloture, or other special procedures. H.R. 5766 mandates fast track legislative procedures for congressional consideration of commission recommendations. The bill limits House debate on the implementing bill to 10 hours and restricts Members' ability to delay consideration by barring amendments and motions. After the specified debate time, the House would immediately vote on passage of the legislation. The bill does not include automatic \"hookup\" procedures after House passage, leaving open the possibility of further steps being needed. The \"hookup\" procedures in H.R. 5766 may require resolving differences between the House and Senate during the legislative process. Fast track procedures, like those in the bill, have the same effect as chamber rules and can be changed through various means. The House can change its rules more easily than the Senate. The House can change its rules more easily than the Senate, making it difficult to change Senate rules without widespread support. Expedited procedures in H.R. 5766 could bind the Senate more dramatically, removing the right to filibuster legislation. Without strong Senate expediting provisions in the bill, the \"fast track\" procedures may have little value. The House can change its rules more easily than the Senate, making it difficult to change Senate rules without widespread support. Expedited procedures in H.R. 5766 could bind the Senate more dramatically, removing the right to filibuster legislation. The bill would require the President to submit a schedule for establishment of FRCs to review all federal agencies and programs, while H.R. 3282 stipulates a review schedule to Congress within a year of enactment. H.R. 5766 is silent on the number of commissions that might be established for the reviews. H.R. 3282 and H.R. 5766 propose different structures for the Federal Review Commissions (FRCs). H.R. 3282 envisions an ongoing institutional body with rotating membership, while H.R. 5766 proposes a seven-member commission appointed by the President. Both bills aim for bipartisan commissions, but the party of the President may have a majority on the FRCs. H.R. 3282 includes an action-forcing mechanism, unlike H.R. 5766. H.R. 3282 includes an action-forcing mechanism where agencies would be abolished a year after the sunset review unless extended by law. It also provides for a program inventory to assist in the sunset review process. In contrast, H.R. 5766 lacks expedited congressional procedures and guidance for the President in devising purviews and review schedules for FRCs. The bills H.R. 3282 and H.R. 5766 propose different sunset provisions for review commissions, with H.R. 5766 terminating 90 days after submission of its assessment to the President, while H.R. 3282 would end on December 31, 2030 without reauthorization. There is a possibility that both bills could be enacted separately or combined into a single measure. Some may see the bills H.R. 3282 and H.R. 5766 as potentially redundant in terms of commission provisions and concerns about power transfer from Congress to the executive branch. Funding for two ongoing commission frameworks could face resistance due to administrative expenses."
