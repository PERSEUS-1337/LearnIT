    "content": "In late June, Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung visited Washington, DC to meet with President Bush, marking a significant step in U.S.-Vietnam relations. The White House aims to encourage reforms in Vietnam through these high-level meetings. Dung also met with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates at the Pentagon, resulting in various agreements and increased engagement between the two governments, including the establishment of a \"Security Dialogue\" on political-military issues. The United States and Vietnam have engaged in high-level discussions on various issues, including the launch of bilateral investment treaty negotiations, exploring GSP program inclusion, introducing a Peace Corps program, establishing an Education Task Force, and announcing new initiatives on various topics. Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte's visit in 2008 marked increased engagement between the two countries since the Paris Peace Accords in 1973. The Bush Administration announced a review of Vietnam's eligibility for GSP status, aimed at promoting economic growth through exports. The Senate's Vietnam Human Rights Act would require labor rights improvements for GSP entry. US and Vietnamese trade officials met under the TIFA in 2008. The bilateral Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) was signed in June 2007. In the first TIFA meeting in December 2007, Vietnam's compliance with WTO commitments and intellectual property protection were discussed. U.S.-Vietnam trade rose over 30% after Vietnam joined the WTO in January 2007. U.S. firms are major investors in Vietnam, with Intel Corp's $1 million manufacturing plant set to open in 2010. Vietnamese officials are concerned about the United States potentially renewing its \"import monitoring program\" for clothing and textiles from Vietnam. They are also worried about the impact of certain provisions in the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 on Vietnamese fish farmers' catfish exports to the U.S. Vietnamese catfish exports to the U.S. could be disrupted by regulations requiring USDA approval of safety standards. This sector is vital to Vietnam's economy, with exports totaling $67.6 million in 2007. Economic difficulties since late 2007 have led to inflation and currency devaluation, causing social unrest. The economic difficulties in Vietnam have led to a significant rise in food prices, prompting factory workers to strike for higher wages. Despite a slight decrease in the inflation rate, prices are still up by over 20%. Concerns over trade and budget deficits persist, with credit agencies downgrading Vietnam's sovereign rating. The country's limited exposure to global financial crises has not shielded it from secondary effects, putting pressure on its trade and foreign investment-dependent economy. Vietnam's economy is vulnerable to global slowdown and commodity price collapse, with exports accounting for 80% of GDP. Oil revenue makes up 30% of government revenue. GDP growth for 2008 is expected to be just over 6%, with forecasts predicting lower growth in 2009. To stimulate growth, the government implemented a $6 billion stimulus package, lowered corporate tax rates, and allowed the dong to depreciate against the U.S. dollar. In March 2008, Vietnam imposed restrictions on rice exports to lower domestic prices. The U.S. criticized this move, but Vietnam later relaxed the restrictions. In October 2008, the U.S. and Vietnam held their first Security Dialogue, discussing military cooperation and peacekeeping operations. The Bush Administration's FY2009 budget included a request for $500,000 in foreign military aid. The Bush Administration's FY2009 budget request included $500,000 in foreign military financing for Vietnam, marking the first time Hanoi would be included in this program. There are concerns that reform-minded leaders in Vietnam, led by Prime Minister Dung, are losing ground to more conservative officials. The reformers have been dominant since 2000, pushing for economic reforms and closer integration with the global economy. This has also led to improved relations with the United States, discussions on human rights, and a more open Vietnamese press. The Vietnamese government is facing pushback from conservative officials due to its efforts to loosen press restrictions and combat corruption. Key indicators include the arrest of a journalist for reporting on corruption, a shift in authority over the economy to the Politburo, and a land dispute between the Catholic archdiocese and the Hanoi People's Committee. This has raised concerns about the direction of reforms in Vietnam. Vietnam's human rights record remains a contentious issue in its relationship with the government. The Vietnamese Communist Party (VCP) allows some personal and religious expression but cracks down on dissent and criticisms of the party's power monopoly. Despite some willingness to address U.S. criticisms since 2004, authorities have been increasingly suppressing signs of dissent since 2007. Vietnam has adopted a policy of cracking down on dissent more aggressively since the mid-2000s, leading to arrests of Vietnamese Americans supporting democratic change. The country's ambivalence towards China's influence could create opportunities for increased U.S.-Vietnamese cooperation. Vietnamese leaders must navigate carefully between Washington and Beijing, with Vietnam often aligning with China on the UN Security Council. In late May and October, Vietnamese leaders visited China, resulting in agreements on a hotline and border demarcation. Disputes over the Paracel and Spratly Islands persist, with anti-Chinese demonstrations in 2007. China warned oil companies against participating in Vietnamese projects. During Dung's visit to China in October, the two sides agreed to resolve maritime disputes. Vietnam was elected as the Asian group's non-permanent representative on the UNSC for 2008-2009. Vietnam opposed calls for international intervention in Burma after Cyclone Nargis. Vietnam traditionally supports the Burmese regime and has taken a stance on Kosovo's independence. Vietnam has expressed concerns about Kosovo's independence and voted to impose sanctions on Iran. In July, Vietnam opposed a Security Council measure against Zimbabwe. U.S.-Vietnam relations have been improving since the end of the Cold War. Growing trade is a key factor in the relationship. The relationship between the United States and Vietnam has been growing since 1975, driven by trade, investment, the Vietnamese community in the U.S., the legacy of the Vietnam War, and shared concerns about China. U.S. goals include improving relations, integrating Vietnam into the global community, opening markets, promoting human rights and democracy, and maintaining influence in Southeast Asia. Policy instruments used by the U.S. include trade incentives, foreign assistance, diplomatic pressures, and educational outreach. Vietnam has pursued a national strategy since the mid-1980s, with the U.S. playing a significant role. Vietnam has a three-pronged national strategy involving economic development, good relations with Southeast Asian neighbors, and strengthening ties with China while seeking a counterweight to Chinese ambition. The country seeks U.S. support for economic growth and to counterbalance China's influence in the region. Additionally, Vietnam aims to facilitate President Bush's visit to Hanoi in 2006 for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit. Bush visited Hanoi in 2006 for the APEC summit, where Vietnam sought U.S. approval to join the WTO. Bilateral discussions on human rights improved, but progress was limited by factors like Hanoi's concerns about upsetting Beijing and U.S. scrutiny of Vietnam's human rights record. Congress played a significant role in normalizing relations with Vietnam. Congress has played a significant role in shaping U.S. relations with Vietnam by providing oversight, guidance, and funding. Key issues in the relationship include strategic and military ties, economic assistance, human rights improvement, and addressing legacy issues from the Vietnam war. Diplomatic and economic relations between the two countries were virtually nonexistent for over 15 years following the Vietnam war. Following North Vietnam's victory in 1975, the United States imposed a trade embargo and suspended foreign assistance to Vietnam. President Carter's Administration made efforts to improve relations by dropping the veto on Vietnam's U.N. membership and proposing diplomatic relations. Vietnam demanded postwar reconstruction aid before agreeing to establish relations and provide information on U.S. POW/MIAs. They later offered limited MIA information despite the lack of aid pledge from the U.S. In 1977, Congress opposed U.S. aid to Vietnam due to negative actions by Vietnam in 1978, including expelling citizens, aligning with the USSR, and invading Cambodia. China also conducted a military incursion in 1979. The Carter Administration halted improved relations with Vietnam and worked closely with ASEAN members. The Reagan and Bush Administrations opposed normal relations with Vietnam until a verified withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from Cambodia. Progress towards normal relations depended on Vietnam's cooperation in accounting for U.S. POW/MIAs. Contacts with Hanoi were sought in 1990 to assist in reaching a peace agreement in Cambodia. In 1987, General John Vessey visited Hanoi as President Reagan's Special Emissary for POW-MIA Issues, leading to the return of hundreds of sets of remains believed to be U.S. MIAs. Vietnam returned over 300 American remains from 1974 to 1992, with analysts noting that some remains were strategically released. In 1991, the U.S. outlined a plan for normalization with Vietnam, establishing a POW/MIA office in Hanoi and providing $1 million in aid. Travel restrictions on Vietnamese diplomats were also eased in 1991. In 1992, the United States improved cooperation with Vietnam on POW/MIA matters, provided $3 million in humanitarian aid, restored direct telecommunications, allowed commercial sales for basic needs, and lifted restrictions on NGO projects in Vietnam. The Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA affairs conducted a comprehensive investigation during this time. The Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA issues, chaired by John Kerry and vice-chaired by Bob Smith, conducted a thorough investigation from August 1991 to December 1992. Their report found no compelling evidence of live POWs after the U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam but highlighted government neglect in managing the issue. The committee's hearings helped pave the way for improved U.S.-Vietnam relations. Reagan and Bush Administrations also focused on humanitarian issues and made progress in negotiations with Vietnam. The U.S. worked with Vietnam to facilitate emigration, regulate immigration flow, address Amerasians' immigration, and release Vietnamese prisoners associated with the U.S. war effort. U.S. officials expressed concern about political prisoners in Vietnam. The Clinton Administration made efforts to improve relations with Vietnam, including allowing international financial aid and stationing U.S. consular officials in Hanoi. President Clinton renewed trade embargoes with a less restrictive version, allowing U.S. companies to bid on development projects in Vietnam. Additionally, $3.5 million in U.S. aid was approved for humanitarian purposes. In September 1993, the Administration approved $3.5 million in U.S. aid for humanitarian programs in Vietnam. President Clinton ended the U.S. trade embargo on Vietnam in February 1994 after high-level interactions and Senate urging. Bilateral diplomatic and property claims were settled between the United States and Vietnam in January 1995. In August 1995, the US and Vietnam opened embassies in Washington and Hanoi. President Clinton vetoed a bill in December 1995 that restricted full diplomatic relations with Vietnam. Controversy arose in 1995 and 1996 over legislation placing conditions on upgrading US relations with Vietnam and admitting more boat people to the US. President Clinton signed the Vietnam provisions in H.R. 2076 on April 26, 1996, as part of the Omnibus Appropriations bill. He issued Presidential Determination 96-28 on May 30, 1996, stating Vietnam's cooperation on POW/MIA issues. The Senate approved Pete Peterson as U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam in April 1997. Economic relations improved, leading to the U.S.-Vietnam bilateral trade agreement in 2000. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged economic reform and better human rights during a visit to Vietnam in June 1997. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger mentioned granting Vietnam a waiver from the Jackson-Vanik amendment in December 1997. President Clinton granted Vietnam a waiver from the Jackson-Vanik amendment, allowing support from OPIC and Export-Import Bank for U.S. business activities in Vietnam. Annual summits between Hanoi and Washington aimed to upgrade the bilateral relationship, with the White House using these meetings to encourage economic and political reforms in Vietnam. OPIC signed its first financing agreement for an American business in Vietnam in November 1999. Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai's June 2005 visit to the United States marked a significant improvement in relations between the two countries. During the visit, Khai and President Bush expressed their commitment to enhancing bilateral relations, with a focus on economic reforms and human rights issues. President Bush also showed support for Vietnam's accession to the WTO and pledged to attend the November 2006 APEC summit in Hanoi. During the APEC summit in Hanoi, President Bush and Vietnamese leaders discussed human rights and religious freedom issues, signed an agreement for military training, and agreed to resume U.S. adoptions of Vietnamese children. Protesters, mainly Vietnamese-Americans, appeared at every stop on Khai's trip. President Bush visited Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City in November 2006, meeting with various APEC leaders and Vietnam's leadership troika. During his visit to Vietnam, President Bush met with the country's leadership troika and visited various important sites, including an ecumenical church and the Joint P.O.W./M.I.A. Accounting Command. In Ho Chi Minh City, he engaged with business leaders, toured a government-run Pasteur Institute, and discussed economic ties and human rights issues with Vietnamese President Nguyen Minh Triet. The two countries signed a trade and investment framework agreement to expand trade and resolve disputes. During his visit to the United States, President Triet oversaw the signing of billions of dollars worth of private commercial deals and discussed human rights with President Bush. Both leaders had frank discussions on the importance of a strong commitment to human rights, freedom, and democracy, with President Triet defending Vietnam's human rights record and legal regime. President Triet defended Vietnam's human rights record during his visit to the United States. U.S. concerns over Vietnamese authorities' arrest of dissidents were addressed, leading to the extension of permanent normal trade relations status to Vietnam in December 2006. Economic ties are a mature aspect of the bilateral relationship. The extension of permanent normal trade relations status to Vietnam in December 2006 was debated in the context of Vietnam's bid to enter the World Trade Organization (WTO) in January 2007. The United States played a significant role in Vietnam's accession process, with Hanoi's bilateral WTO accession agreement with Washington being the last and most challenging of the 28 bilateral agreements Vietnam completed. Vietnam's entry into the WTO did not impose new obligations on the United States, but both countries were required to adhere to WTO rules. The United States and Vietnam had to adhere to WTO rules in their trade relations after Vietnam's accession. This required the US to end a quota program on Vietnam's clothing exports. Bilateral trade between the two countries increased significantly after a trade agreement went into effect in 2001. Total merchandise trade in 2006 was $9.4 billion, six times higher than before the agreement. Bilateral trade between the United States and Vietnam has significantly increased since the trade agreement in 2001, with trade flows exceeding $12 billion in 2007. The growth in imports from Vietnam accounts for over 80% of the increase in trade. U.S. firms are the largest source of foreign direct investment in Vietnam, and trade disputes have arisen over imports of clothing, catfish, and shrimp. Concerns have also been raised about Vietnam's currency policies regarding the Vietnamese dong. The State Bank of Vietnam maintains a \"managed float\" for the dong with a daily trading band of plus or minus 0.75%. Vietnam will remain a \"nonmarket economy\" until 2019 under WTO terms. Since 2002, Vietnam has had a current account deficit. U.S.-Vietnam trade has grown significantly, with clothing imports from Vietnam rising sharply. Vietnam was the third largest exporter of clothing to the U.S. in 2007. In 2007, Vietnam was the third largest exporter of clothing to the United States, providing nearly 6% of total U.S. clothing imports. The Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) allowed unrestricted Vietnamese clothing exports to the U.S., but the U.S. could impose quotas on textile imports in case of a surge. Vietnam's WTO accession agreement did not include a special safeguard provision. An import monitoring program was established by the Bush Administration for certain clothing and textiles from Vietnam, allowing antidumping investigations when necessary. The import monitoring program for clothing and textiles from Vietnam expired with the end of the Bush Administration. The Commerce Department found insufficient evidence to initiate antidumping investigations in both the first and second six-month reviews. Vietnam has been on the \"Special 301 watch list\" since 2002 for poor intellectual property rights protection. The BTA required Vietnam to align its IPR regime with WTO standards in 2003. Vietnam passed a new IPR law in 2005 to align with WTO standards, but its enforcement has been criticized. U.S. aid to Vietnam has increased significantly, with over $75 million in FY2006 and a request for nearly $100 million in FY2008, mainly for health-related programs. The largest component of the current U.S. bilateral aid program to Vietnam is health-related assistance, totaling over $70 million in FY2007. This includes funding for HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention, educational exchanges, de-mining activities, dioxin remediation programs, food assistance, and economic reform efforts. Some Members of Congress have tried to tie non-humanitarian aid increases to Vietnam's human rights record. Vietnam was not initially selected for the Millennium Challenge Account in May 2004. Vietnam has been consistently deemed ineligible for the Millennium Challenge Account due to low scores on political freedom indicators. Tensions between the United States and Vietnam over human rights issues have increased in recent years. The Vietnamese Communist Party has selectively repressed individuals and organizations deemed a threat to its power monopoly. Since Vietnam's economic reforms in 1986, there has been a gradual loosening of restrictions allowing private enterprise, religious freedom, and a moderately vibrant press. However, the government has cracked down harshly on anti-government activity, including arrests of political dissidents and breaking up protests by farmers in Ho Chi Minh City. The government in Vietnam has targeted ethnic minority groups and cyber dissidents, cracking down on protests and restricting internet freedom. Human rights were given a lower priority compared to economic ties and POW/MIAs by the US administrations in the 1990s. The Bush Administration took a more assertive stance on human rights in Vietnam in 2003, designating the country as a \"country of particular concern\" for religious freedom violations. The State Department lifted this designation in 2006 due to positive steps taken by the Vietnamese government. Despite some improvements, reports of repression and harassment continue to raise concerns. Despite some improvements, there is disagreement about the significance and pervasiveness of the improvements in Vietnam. The State Department and USAID are considering a small-scale aid initiative in the Central Highlands in response to the FY2006 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. In 2006, dissident groups called for democratic change, leading to arrests by the government. The dissident groups in Vietnam peaked between March and April 2007 as part of a strategy to target organizations with connections to Vietnamese Americans. Human rights organizations reported ongoing arrests and harassment of dissidents linked to the 2006 groups. The White House, State Department, and Members of Congress criticized the arrests, with Congressman Earl Blumenauer resigning in protest. In Vietnam, there are reports of increased restrictions on certain religious groups despite the freedom to worship. The government monitors and regulates religious organizations, requiring them to join officially recognized denominations. Many groups either refuse or are denied permission, making their activities technically illegal. The State Department designated Vietnam as a Country of Particular Concern (CPC) in 2004 due to reports of harassment of ethnic minority Protestants and Buddhists. After negotiations with the Bush Administration, an agreement on religious freedom was reached in May 2005, focusing on improving conditions for people of faith in the Central Highlands. Despite criticisms from human rights groups, Vietnam avoided sanctions by agreeing to take steps to address religious persecution. However, Vietnam was redesignated as a CPC in the 2005 and 2006 Religious Freedom Reports. In November 2006, Vietnam was removed from the CPC list by the State Department due to positive steps taken by the government since 2004, including a decline in forced renunciations of faith, release of religious prisoners, and new laws promoting religious freedom. As part of the U.S.-Vietnam human rights dialogue, prominent dissidents were released, and Vietnam agreed to repeal its decree allowing detention without trial. The U.S. Committee on International Religious Freedom disputes the decision to remove Vietnam from the CPC list, citing ongoing abuses and the lack of incentive for Vietnam to improve. Various measures like \"The Vietnam Human Rights Act\" have been introduced in Congress to link U.S. aid to Vietnam's human rights progress. H.R. 3096 proposes to cap non-humanitarian aid if substantial progress is not certified by the President. H.R. 3096 grants the President a national interest waiver to exempt programs promoting the act's goals or U.S. national interests. It includes an aid cap, requires annual reports on Vietnam's human rights, and funds for democracy promotion and Radio Free Asia. Supporters argue for pressure on Vietnam to improve human rights, while critics fear it could harm bilateral ties and domestic reformers. The bill establishes a two-part test for U.S. assistance programs. The bill H.R. 3096 establishes a two-part test for U.S. assistance programs to Vietnam, with a cap on aid and requirements for annual reports on human rights. Existing military-to-military programs with Vietnam may be frozen under the provisions of the bill. The House Foreign Affairs Committee approved the bill in July 2007. The House passed H.R. 3096 by voice vote after amending it to soften the provision on non-humanitarian assistance to Vietnam. A similar bill, S. 3678, was introduced in the Senate in October 2008, aiming to restrict U.S. assistance to Vietnam unless human rights conditions improve. The Senate bill would prohibit Vietnam's entry into the GSP program unless labor rights improve. Vietnam and the United States have been expanding political and security ties, with increased military cooperation and exchanges. The United States and Vietnam have been strengthening their political and security ties, with increased military cooperation and exchanges. This includes joint counter-narcotics training programs, modifications to International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) allowing trade in non-lethal defense items, and discussions on potential joint search and rescue exercises and military training programs. The Bush Administration requested $200 million in IMET funding in its budget request to Congress, double the FY2007 level. Admiral Timothy Keating visited Vietnam in December 2007, where Vietnamese leaders sought assistance in cleaning up dioxin from Agent Orange and providing medical care for victims. The Agent Orange issue may become a key topic in future bilateral discussions between the U.S. and Vietnam. Discussions on Agent Orange were held during a recent dialogue on human rights in May 2008. During a round of dialogue in May 2008, the U.S. and Vietnam discussed human rights issues, including the Agent Orange problem. The U.S. has not provided specific assistance for Vietnamese Agent Orange victims, but has supported mine-action programs and disability assistance through the Leahy War Victims Fund. The State Department mentioned $40 million for mine-action programs since 1993 and $43 million for disability assistance since 1989, including $2 million for Agent Orange projects. The State Department allocated $3 million for environmental remediation and health programs in Vietnam, with most funds used for technical and scientific activities. Assistant Secretary Christopher R. Hill mentioned the plan in 2008, but there have been no further updates on the utilization of the funds. The United States has shown willingness to help with the containment and removal of residual dioxin in identified \"hot spots\" near ex-U.S. military bases in Vietnam. This includes providing $400,000 for the clean-up of the Da Nang airbase, a joint operation involving Vietnamese Ministry of Defense, the U.S. EPA, and the U.S.-Vietnam Dialogue Group on Agent Orange/Dioxin. The Vietnamese government also supports a U.S. civil suit seeking compensation for victims of Agent Orange/Dioxin. The Vietnam Association for Victims of Agent Orange/Dioxin filed a lawsuit against Dow Chemical Co. for compensation, but the case was dismissed by the U.S. District Eastern District of New York. The Second Circuit Court upheld the decision, leading to strong reactions from the Vietnamese government and organizations. The decision was criticized as irrational and unfair, with concerns raised about the cooperation between the U.S. and Vietnam in resolving the consequences of Agent Orange/dioxin. The legacy of Agent Orange presents challenges and opportunities for the United States. Providing assistance for clean-up and medical care in Vietnam could yield \"soft power\" benefits. However, there are concerns about setting a precedent for post-conflict assistance. Vietnam was listed as a \"Tier 2\" country in the 2008 Trafficking in Persons Report. In 2007, Vietnam was upgraded to \"Tier 2\" in the Trafficking in Persons Report for making significant efforts to combat trafficking. The government established partnerships with neighboring countries but was criticized for lax investigation of exploitation complaints. The United States and Vietnam reopened the Orderly Departure Program for Vietnamese resettlement, limited to those who missed the previous application window. The omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 extends the application closing date for the Orderly Departure Program to 2009. Increased resources were devoted to POW/MIA research in the mid-1990s, leading to substantial understanding about the fate of American MIAs. The fate of over 2,000 Americans still unaccounted for in Indochina is unlikely to reveal any live Americans. Efforts to recover remains and identify them, including using advanced technology, have been discussed between the U.S. and Vietnam. In 2008, the House passed a resolution to continue pressing for a full accounting of military and civilian personnel missing from the Vietnam conflict. Vietnam has been struggling to balance ideological purity and economic development since the Vietnam conflict. The country adopted economic reforms in 1986 known as doi moi, giving farmers more control, abandoning central planning, and opening up to foreign investment. This led to Vietnam becoming one of the world's fastest-growing countries in the past twenty years. Vietnam's economy has experienced rapid growth since the launch of economic reforms in 1986. The country's GDP has been growing at around 7%-8% annually, with real GDP reaching 8.5% in 2007. Agricultural production has surged, making Vietnam the world's second-largest rice exporter and coffee producer. Poverty levels have also decreased significantly, from 58% in 1992 to less than 30% in 2002. Foreign investment has played a significant role in driving the country's growth, with the government directing funds into the state-owned sector. Despite some challenges, Vietnam aims to become a middle-income country by 2020. The momentum behind economic reforms stalled due to disagreement between reformers and conservatives after the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Real GDP growth fell to less than 5% in 1999. Signing the BTA in 2000 broke the policymaking logjam, leading to new reformist measures such as passing a new Enterprise Law and reducing red tape. Adhering to the BTA's deadlines helped galvanize the Vietnamese bureaucracy towards joining the WTO. The government's goal of joining the WTO has driven the Vietnamese bureaucracy to implement economic reforms, leading to GDP growth rebounding to 7% and increased FDI inflows. Demographic pressure, with over half the population under 25, necessitates job creation for 1 million new entrants annually. Vietnam's economy is now divided into state-owned, foreign-invested, and privately owned sectors, with FIEs and the private sector showing significant growth since the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Vietnam's economy has shown impressive growth since the 1997 Asian financial crisis, with the private sector now employing a quarter of the workforce. However, the country still faces challenges such as high levels of malnutrition among children and structural economic problems like unprofitable state-owned enterprises and bureaucratic corruption. Critics have raised concerns about the government's focus on heavy industries in its development plan. Vietnam's economy has shown impressive growth since the 1997 Asian financial crisis, with the private sector now employing a quarter of the workforce. However, the country still faces challenges such as high levels of malnutrition among children and structural economic problems like unprofitable state-owned enterprises. The government's previous plan emphasized lighter industries, but most of Vietnam's state-owned enterprises are functionally bankrupt and require significant government subsidies. Despite some privatization efforts, the government still owns substantial stakes in many small and medium-sized firms. The privatization of state-owned enterprises is set to be accelerated, with the goal of completion by 2009. Vietnam's political reform lags behind its economic changes, with the Vietnamese Communist Party maintaining a central role in politics and society. The Vietnamese Communist Party (VCP) sets policy direction, while implementation is handled by state bureaucracy, National Assembly, Vietnamese People's Army, and sanctioned associations. Decision-making bodies include the Central Committee and Politburo, with top leadership positions held by the VCP General Secretary, Prime Minister, and President. Consensus is key in major policy decisions since the death of Le Duan in 1986. The National Assembly in Vietnam has increased its influence over the past 15 years, no longer just a rubber stamp. With over 80% of members being VCP, they have vetoed Cabinet appointments, revised legislation, and gained more powers like reviewing the government's budget and holding no-confidence votes. The Communist Party held its 10th Party Congress in 2006. The 10th Party Congress of Vietnam's ruling Communist Party in 2006 resulted in few major changes to the country's current policy direction, indicating that economic reformers continue to hold sway. The 10th Party Congress of Vietnam in 2006 showed economic reformers still in control, aiming for a \"socialist-oriented market economy.\" Key goals included accelerating reforms, integrating into the global economy, and becoming industrialized by 2020. Major personnel changes saw the resignation of the Prime Minister and President from their Politburo positions. Confirmation of new government posts will be done by the National Assembly. During the 10th Party Congress in 2006, Vietnam's leadership endorsed economic reformer Nguyen Tan Dung as the successor to Prime Minister Khai. The new President, Nguyen Minh Triet, is also known for his efforts in fighting corruption and criminal activities. The Communist Party is facing challenges in attracting new members, especially among the youth, and combating official corruption remains a key issue for the VCP leadership. Vietnam's leadership, under Manh, is actively addressing official corruption, with the passage of a new anti-corruption law in 2005. Despite efforts, high-level corruption persists, as seen in a scandal involving embezzlement of foreign assistance funds by top officials in the Transportation Ministry. China's economic and diplomatic influence in Southeast Asia was a topic of speculation before the 10th Party Congress. Some in Hanoi are questioning Vietnam's \"omnidirectional foreign policy\" and its lack of warm relations with any specific country or group. Improvements in Sino-Vietnamese relations have accelerated since the late 1990s, with the signing of border treaties. Vietnamese leaders are ambivalent about maintaining friendly relations with China. Vietnam's relationship with China is fraught with ambivalence. Hanoi values stable relations with Beijing for economic development but is wary of China's increasing influence in Southeast Asia. The two countries have overlapping claims in the South China Sea, leading to military clashes in the past. ASEAN and China signed a treaty in 2002. In 2002, ASEAN and China signed a non-binding agreement to resolve disputes in the South China Sea diplomatically. Vietnam's efforts to include the Paracel Islands in the agreement were unsuccessful. Vietnam continues to expand its presence in the island chain and expresses concern about its trade deficit with China. Vietnam seeks regional counterweights to China by aligning with Indonesia and Singapore. Vietnam seeks regional counterweights to China by aligning with Indonesia and Singapore. In 2002, Cambodia accepted an offer from the United States to resettle over 900 Montagnards who fled unrest in the Central Highlands region. The majority of these refugees are entitled to asylum and are being resettled in the United States, Canada, or Finland. In 2005, some refugees returned to Vietnam under an agreement with UNHCR, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Vietnam agreed not to punish returnees, and UNHCR would monitor their well-being. Some refugees refused resettlement offers in third countries. Cambodia has been criticized for repatriating individuals forcibly in the past. In 2007, the US adopted a new policy towards Montagnards in Cambodia. The US adopted a new policy towards Montagnards in Cambodia, where individuals deemed not refugees by UNHCR will not be considered for resettlement in the United States. Approximately 100 Montagnards were accepted for resettlement in the year following the policy shift. The Senate Appropriations Committee requested a report on the estimated number of Montagnard refugees in Cambodia, but the language was not included in the final legislation signed into law in 2007. H.Res. 243 called for the release of political prisoners in Vietnam. H.Res. 447 (Blumenauer) condemns convictions of Vietnamese pro-democracy activists. H.Res. 506 (Lofgren) condemns human rights abuses in Vietnam and calls for trade relations change. H.Res. 665 (Tom Davis) endorses freedom and democracy reforms in Vietnam. H.Res. 986 (Boehner) seeks accountability for U.S. military and civilian prisoners. H.Res. 1048 (Lofgren) condemns the detention of Dr. Nguyen Quoc Quan by Vietnam and calls for the release of over 1,700 U.S. military and civilian personnel missing from the Vietnam conflict. H.Res. 1089 (Loretta Sanchez) urges Vietnam to release prisoners who signed the April 2006 Manifesto on Freedom and Democracy and directs the Secretary of State to establish a list condemning countries with severe human rights violations. H.R. 275 (Christopher Smith) introduced the Global Online Freedom Act of 2007 to designate Internet-restricting countries like Vietnam and impose restrictions on U.S. business activities.
