    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Kosova Peace and Democracy Act of 1994\". The Congress finds that the political rights of the Albanian majority in Kosova were curtailed in 1989 when the Yugoslav Government illegally revoked Kosova's autonomous status. A referendum in September 1990 showed overwhelming support for independence, and Dr. Ibrahim Rugova was elected President in 1992. The new Kosovar government has been prevented from assembling on Kosovar territory, and there are reports of Serbian \"ethnic cleansing\" in the region. Since 1990, ethnic Albanians in Kosova have faced discrimination, including job dismissals, brutal beatings by Serbian police, restricted access to education, and media control. Serbian leader Milosevic has called for the transfer of Albanians from Kosova to be replaced by Serbs. The government in Belgrade controls media in Albanian language, suppresses dissenting views, undermined judiciary in Kosova by replacing Albanian judges with Serbs, and jailed/tortured political opponents. OSCE observers expelled in 1991. Observers sent to Kosova in 1991 were expelled by the Belgrade government in July 1993. Subsequently, international human rights organizations reported an increase in humanitarian abuses in Kosova. The economy in Kosova is suffering due to the closure of small businesses by Serbian authorities and international sanctions. Radio Free Europe started broadcasting to the former Yugoslavia in Serbian and Croatian, but not in Albanian. Congress approved the opening of a United States Information Agency cultural center in Prishtina, Kosova. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993, has provisions for establishing a center, but security conditions have hindered it. The closure of the airport in Prishtina, Kosova, hinders humanitarian aid delivery and normalcy. The President warned Belgrade of military action in Kosova and Serbia in case of conflict caused by Serbian actions. SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. The Congress emphasizes the immediate need to stop ethnic cleansing and repression in Kosova, allow elected officials to fulfill their mandate, reinstate those fired based on ethnicity, reopen education to all residents regardless of ethnicity, and reverse decrees undermining Kosovar autonomy. The Congress calls for the reversal of the character of the Kosovar bar and judiciary, respect for freedom of expression in the media, readmission of expelled observers, dispatch of UN observers to monitor human rights, reopening of the airport in Prishtina, and the establishment of a cultural center in Prishtina by the United States Information Agency. The Congress calls for expanding the no-fly-zone to cover Kosova, reiterating warnings to Belgrade about military conflict in Kosova, and developing NATO plans to prevent Balkan conflict spread to Kosova. Prohibition on lifting sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro until certain conditions are met. The sanctions imposed on Serbia and Montenegro by the executive branch directives listed in the Act will remain in effect until the President certifies to Congress that specified conditions have been met. The Department of Transportation Order 92-5-38 of May 20, 1992 and the Federal Aviation Administration action of June 19, 1992 prohibit the use of funds for the governments of Serbia and Montenegro until specified conditions are met. The Secretary of the Treasury is instructed to oppose assistance from international financial institutions to these governments, except for basic human needs, until the President certifies to Congress that the conditions have been met. Conditions described in subsection (d) include substantial progress towards restoring the independent identity and autonomy of Kosova, improvement in human rights, allowing international human rights observers to return, and permitting the elected government to carry out its mandate. The President has the authority to waive or modify sanctions described in subsection (a) or (b). The President can waive or modify sanctions in subsections (a) or (b) upon certification to Congress that it is necessary for emergency humanitarian needs or to achieve a negotiated settlement in Kosova. The Chairman of the Board for International Broadcasting must submit a plan and budget for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to establish a surrogate home service in Albanian language for populations in Kosova and other areas of the former Yugoslavia, broadcasting at least one hour per day."
