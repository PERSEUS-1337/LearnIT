    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Student Dropout Prevention and Recovery Act of 2000\". Congress acknowledges the challenges of lowering the student dropout rate, citing the lack of federal focus and resources hindering local educational agencies. The National Dropout Prevention Network emphasizes the importance of local efforts in improving schools and increasing graduation rates. Efforts to increase graduation rates should focus on strategies like systemic renewal, community collaboration, professional development, family involvement, early childhood education, reading and writing programs, individualized instruction, instructional technologies, mentoring and tutoring, service learning, learning styles, violence prevention, career education, and workforce readiness. The National Dropout Prevention Network has found that strategies for dropout prevention have been successful in all school levels and settings. Developing model programs based on effective strategies is crucial for schools nationwide to implement similar programs. A nationwide dropout prevention program should be based on successful model programs to lower dropout rates. These programs need to be disseminated to school and community leaders for adaptation and support. SEC. 3. SCHOOL DROPOUT PREVENTION GRANT PROGRAMS.
