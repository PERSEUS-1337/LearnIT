    "content": "The modern relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom was solidified during World War II and the Cold War, with both countries collaborating within NATO to counter the Soviet Union. They are key members of the UN Security Council and NATO. The UK has been a significant ally in various military operations, including the Gulf War, Iraq invasion, and Afghanistan mission. Currently, they continue to work together on global security challenges like terrorism, the Islamic State, and Russia's actions in Crimea. The UK is a key ally in countering global security challenges like terrorism, the Islamic State, and Russia's actions in Crimea. The US and UK share a strong trade and economic relationship, consult frequently on global issues, and often support each other in multilateral institutions and times of crisis. Cultural similarities and cooperation habits shape their foreign policy debates. The special relationship between the US and UK is characterized by mutual trust, close intelligence-sharing, and cooperation in nuclear and defense matters. Prime Minister Theresa May leads the UK government, taking office in July 2016 after David Cameron's resignation following the Brexit referendum. May, a member of the Conservative Party, previously served as the longest-serving home secretary in modern times, overseeing counterterrorism and policing efforts. Theresa May, the UK's second female prime minister, remained in office after the 2017 election resulted in a hung parliament. The Conservative Party won 318 seats, losing its majority, while the Labour Party gained 30 seats. May's decision to call a snap election backfired as the outcome was unexpected, with polls initially showing a significant Conservative lead. Polls initially showed a 20-point Conservative lead over Labour before the 2017 election (termed Brexit). Prime Minister May aimed to strengthen her mandate for Brexit negotiations and delay the next general election to 2022. However, her lead decreased as the election approached. Critics found her campaign uninspiring, with voter unease about Brexit evident in higher turnout among young voters. Labour effectively focused on Conservative policies, leading to a hung parliament. In 2017, Conservative Prime Minister May formed a minority government with support from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) in a \"confidence and supply\" arrangement. The DUP, a socially conservative party in Northern Ireland, holds 10 seats in Parliament and campaigned strongly for Brexit. They have a pivotal role in passing legislation and determining the fate of certain bills. The DUP, a socially conservative party in Northern Ireland, holds 10 seats in Parliament and campaigned strongly for Brexit. They have a pivotal role in passing legislation and determining the fate of certain bills. Since 2007, the DUP has led Northern Ireland's devolved regional government in a power-sharing arrangement with Sinn Fein. The Conservatives granted the DUP more budgetary resources for Northern Ireland as part of their parliamentary support deal, and the DUP remains a significant factor in Brexit negotiations related to Northern Ireland. Other outcomes from the June 2017 election included the SNP losing 21 seats, impacting their aspirations for a second vote on Scottish independence. Following the 2014 referendum favoring staying in the UK, the Liberal Democrats gained seats by positioning themselves as pro-Remain. The Conservatives suffered losses despite progress in Scotland and from UKIP's decline. Labour also saw gains from former UKIP voters. The 2016 EU membership referendum saw 52% voting to leave, driven by economic dissatisfaction and antiestablishment sentiments. The UK's reluctance to join the EU in the 1950s stemmed from concerns about sovereignty and influence. The UK joined the precursor of the modern-day EU in 1973 for economic benefits and political voice, but has been historically skeptical. They opted out of elements like the euro and Schengen Area, with a focus on boosting economic priorities. Brexit remains the main issue in UK politics, with withdrawal negotiations with the EU being the government's top concern. Prime Minister May is managing a debate on the terms of Brexit, balancing market access and free trade with curbing immigration and EU influence. The government's strategy in February 2017 opted for a \"hard Brexit,\" meaning a complete departure from the EU single market and customs union to restore British sovereignty. The UK's strategy for controlling immigration involves negotiating a free trade agreement with the EU for market access. Divisions over a \"soft Brexit\" approach, retaining EU market elements and a transition period, exist within Parliament, the public, and the Conservative Party. The \"divergers\" advocate for a hard Brexit, led by key figures like Boris Johnson and David Davis, while the \"aligners\" push for a more moderate approach, led by Philip Hammond. The government is facing challenges in delivering a Brexit deal that satisfies both hard Brexit advocates and those pushing for closer ties with the EU. Prime Minister May's leadership is questioned after the 2017 election, and managing tensions within her party is a central challenge. In December 2017, Parliament voted in favor of requiring any Brexit deal to be approved by a separate act of Parliament before implementation. The government faced challenges with a \"meaningful vote\" in Parliament on the withdrawal agreement, with concerns over ministerial power. Passage of an amendment was welcomed by advocates of a softer Brexit. Meanwhile, Prime Minister May also grapples with domestic issues like the strain on the NHS and calls for a new Conservative Party identity. On March 29, 2017, Prime Minister May invoked Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, formally giving notice of the UK's intention to leave the EU. David Davis was named as the UK's lead negotiator, while Michel Barnier led talks for the EU. The EU's negotiating guidelines adopted a two-phase approach, focusing on withdrawal agreement terms initially. The EU and UK focused on key topics like citizens' rights, financial settlement, and the Irish border in the first phase of Brexit negotiations. The EU delayed discussing future relations until progress was made on withdrawal terms, leading to tensions. Discord in the UK over Brexit details hindered negotiations in 2017. The lack of clarity and unity on the British side hindered the progress of withdrawal negotiations, but after seven months and six rounds of discussions, an agreement in principle was reached covering main aspects of the three priority topics. A joint report was released on December 8, 2017, outlining their common understanding and joint commitments. The European Council determined on December 15, 2017, that sufficient progress had been made to open the second phase of negotiations. The EU leaders approved the second phase of negotiations, focusing on the transition period and future relations. The European Commission released a draft withdrawal agreement, which some observers criticized for being too maximalist. The agreement proposed that EU nationals in the UK and UK citizens in EU countries retain their rights under EU law for life. The UK initially proposed that EU free movement rights would not carry over after withdrawal, but the December joint report stated that EU and UK citizens will retain the right of free movement until the withdrawal agreement takes effect. This includes the ability to apply for permanent residency and receive equal treatment in various aspects. The draft withdrawal agreement guarantees rights for EU citizens in the UK, including settled status and family reunification rights. There are concerns about clarity on registration requirements. The \"divorce bill\" is a contentious issue in the negotiations. The Brexit negotiations have been contentious, with the \"divorce bill\" being a key issue. The agreement suggests the UK will likely pay around \u20ac40-\u20ac45 billion, covering EU budget contributions, financial commitments, liabilities, and pensions for British EU civil servants. Payments will be made in euros as they fall due. The Brexit negotiations have focused on the \"divorce bill\" of around \u20ac40-\u20ac45 billion to be paid in euros as costs fall due. The issue of Northern Ireland and the border with the Republic of Ireland has been a complex sticking point, with concerns about a harder border affecting customs tariffs and free movement. Special arrangements are being negotiated to avoid harm to Northern Ireland's economy and peace process. In the December joint report, the EU and the UK commit to protecting the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, avoiding a hard border with physical infrastructure, and preserving North-South cooperation. Northern Ireland residents can choose Irish or British citizenship, with Irish citizens retaining EU rights. The UK aims to protect North-South cooperation and avoid a hard border through the overall EU-UK relationship. If necessary, specific solutions will be proposed, and full alignment with EU rules will be maintained to support cooperation and the 1998 agreement. The UK aims to protect North-South cooperation, the all-island economy, and the 1998 agreement. The UK will ensure no new regulatory barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, unless agreed by the Northern Ireland Executive. Some experts suggest a soft Brexit for Northern Ireland to remain aligned with both the EU and the UK, but the British government disagrees. The British government disagrees with the EU's proposal for Northern Ireland to remain in the EU customs union and regulatory area while the rest of the UK does not. Prime Minister May reiterated that this arrangement is unacceptable to her government. The European Council called on the UK to clarify its positions regarding the future relationship. Prime Minister May outlined her vision for a custom-tailored economic relationship with the EU, emphasizing the need for a partnership that is broader and deeper than any existing Free Trade Agreement. She rejected the EU's proposal for Northern Ireland and called for a border that is as frictionless as possible. The prime minister outlined a vision for a frictionless border, no new tariffs or quotas, mutual recognition of regulatory standards, and a customs partnership. She also proposed an independent arbitration mechanism and not the ECJ for dispute resolution. However, the EU draft guidelines suggested a free trade agreement with limited coverage of services and less regulatory cooperation. EU leaders are expected to adopt formal negotiating guidelines for phase two at a summit on March 22, 2018. Negotiating the future UK-EU trade and economic relationship will take time, with various issues like transition arrangements, regulatory responsibilities, intellectual property, and market access needing resolution. Negotiations in phase two of the UK-EU relationship will cover various aspects such as security cooperation, relocation of EU agencies from the UK, and approval of the withdrawal agreement by both sides. EU leaders will decide on guidelines for these negotiations at a summit in March 2018. The approval process for the withdrawal agreement involves a qualified majority vote in the Council of the EU and a simple majority in the European Parliament. In the UK, both Houses of Parliament will vote on the agreement or moving forward with no deal. Negotiations should be completed by October 2018 for approval by March 2019. If no agreement is reached within two years, the EU could decide to extend the negotiating period, but consensus would be required. During the transition period after Brexit, the UK is likely to follow EU rules without voting rights. The ECJ would maintain jurisdiction, and a \"no deal\" scenario is possible for March 2019. The UK faces the possibility of a \"no deal\" scenario for March 2019, where it could leave the EU without comprehensive arrangements. The government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to convert EU law into UK law to prevent legal uncertainties post-Brexit. The UK aims to preserve current trade agreements with EU countries, negotiate new deals with international partners, and replicate EU commitments in the WTO. The government is building up the Department for International Trade to handle negotiations post-Brexit. The UK may only formally negotiate trade deals after leaving the EU and may face challenges in concluding agreements during any transition period. After the transition period, the UK will need to renegotiate numerous international agreements post-Brexit, including trade, regulatory cooperation, fisheries, transport, customs, nuclear issues, and agriculture. Economists fear Brexit could lead to economic challenges like weaker growth, higher inflation, job losses, and currency depreciation. Proponents believe Brexit will allow the UK to establish new trade relationships and become a \"Global Britain.\" The UK economy has shown resilience with 1.8% growth in 2017 and expected 1.5% in 2018. Unemployment remains low at 4.4%. However, multinational corporations based in the UK are uneasy due to Brexit uncertainties, leading some to consider relocating their EU headquarters and operations. This poses risks for the financial sector, with many firms in London employing 1 million people. The UK's financial sector faces risks post-Brexit, with firms in London employing 1 million people. The Conservative-led coalition government initiated austerity measures in 2010 to reduce the budget deficit. The UK experienced economic growth from 1993 to 2008 but was hit hard by the global financial crisis in 2008, leading to a prolonged recession until 2012. The UK developed a large structural budget deficit during economic expansion, exacerbated by the financial crisis and recession. Public sector debt increased from 52% to 88% of GDP. The coalition government implemented austerity measures, including spending cuts and tax increases, reducing the budget deficit to 2.9% of GDP in 2017. Supporters view austerity as necessary for financial sustainability, while opponents criticize its impact. Critics argue that the UK government's austerity measures have disproportionately targeted the poor and disabled, leading to unequal and unfair societal impacts. They believe the aggressive measures have hindered economic growth and eroded public services. The recent budget slightly relaxed fiscal policy, increasing spending on the NHS, education, housing, and social welfare programs. The UK's close relationship with the US has been a key aspect of its foreign policy since the 1940s, enhancing its global influence. The United States has often enhanced its global influence with British support, adding international credibility to U.S. policies. The close U.S.-UK partnership serves common interests in various multilateral institutions. The UK looks to the United States for a close partnership, especially following Brexit. President Trump has a positive view of the UK, but there have been tensions in the relationship over the past year. In a postelection phone call, President Trump emphasized the importance of the relationship and his personal connections to the UK. President Trump has shown strong support for Brexit and a U.S.-UK free trade agreement. Despite negative sentiment in the UK, Prime Minister May emphasizes the stability of the UK's relationship with the United States in the context of Brexit. Positive indications of a future agreement with the U.S. could strengthen the UK's position in negotiations with the EU. Prime Minister May has extended an early invitation for President Trump to make a state visit to the UK. They have common ground on issues like counterterrorism and ending the conflict in Syria, but differ on the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate agreement. May emphasizes the importance of NATO for European security and deterrence of Russian aggression, while cautioning against closer ties with Russian President Putin. Prime Minister May criticized the Trump Administration's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and expressed concerns about tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Despite seeking a beneficial partnership, Trump remains controversial in the UK, with many criticizing May's outreach. Domestic critics of May's approach to Trump were countered by her assertion of the importance of the \"special relationship.\" Prime Minister May emphasized the importance of the \"special relationship\" with the Trump Administration, stating she will not hesitate to voice her concerns to President Trump. Several incidents during Trump's first year in office caused backlash in the UK, including disputes over wiretapping accusations and public feuds with London Mayor Sadiq Khan. In response to the June 2017 terrorist attack in London, President Trump faced criticism for retweeting anti-Muslim videos from a far-right British group. He initially resisted Prime Minister May's rebuke but later offered to apologize, claiming ignorance about the group. Speculation surrounds Trump's postponed state visit to the UK, with reports suggesting he is hesitant due to potential protests. In January 2018, Trump canceled a working visit to open the new U.S. embassy in London, citing its unfavorable location. Despite this, he expressed intentions to visit the UK in 2018, with a potential official state visit later in the year. President Trump plans to visit the UK in 2018, with a potential state visit in October. Despite concerns about opposition in the UK, Trump reassured the strong US-UK relationship at a meeting with Prime Minister May in January. The two countries have a close defense and intelligence-sharing partnership. The UK is seen as one of the most capable European allies by US defense planners. The UK is considered one of the most capable European allies by US defense planners, alongside France. The UK plays a strong role in NATO, leading multinational battalions in Estonia and Poland as part of efforts to deter Russian aggression. In 2017, the UK led NATO's Very High Readiness Joint Task Force. The UK plays a significant role in NATO, leading multinational battalions in Estonia and Poland to deter Russian aggression. In 2017, the UK led NATO's Very High Readiness Joint Task Force with about 3,000 personnel. UK armed forces also participate in U.S.-led coalition efforts against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, hosting about 8,700 U.S. military personnel and providing support such as airstrikes, surveillance, intelligence gathering, and training Iraqi forces. The U.S. Department of Defense announced in 2015 that U.S. personnel would pull out of three leased UK airbases as part of cost-saving measures. The U.S. is planning to divest from bases in the UK and Germany, with full divestment possibly delayed until 2024. The Joint Intelligence Analysis Complex is being consolidated at RAF Croughton, while personnel at RAF Lakenheath are expected to increase. The U.S.-UK Mutual Defense Agreement allows for cooperation on nuclear weapons, and the U.S. has sold equipment for submarine-launched strategic weapons to the UK. The United States has sold equipment and services to the UK for a submarine-launched strategic weapons delivery system, supporting the UK's nuclear deterrent with Vanguard class submarines armed with Trident missiles. The defense industry cooperation between the UK and the US includes joint programs like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. British defense companies in the US mainly supply components and niche equipment, with US foreign military sales agreements totaling $5.1 billion in FY2016. In FY2016, U.S. direct commercial sales to the UK totaled $1.76 billion, with shipments of $94.4 million. In 2007, a Treaty Concerning Defense Trade Cooperation was signed to address UK concerns about technology-sharing restrictions. The treaty eliminates individual licensing requirements for certain defense articles and services controlled under U.S. regulations, creating approved communities for companies and individuals with security clearances. Despite close cooperation between the US and UK on defense technology transfers, US officials have expressed concerns about cuts to UK defense spending and military capabilities. In 2016, the UK had the world's fifth-largest military expenditure at $52.5 billion, meeting NATO's defense spending benchmark of 2% of GDP. However, UK defense spending decreased by 8% in real terms from 2011-2015, leading to a 17% reduction in the size of the armed forces. The UK's defense spending decreased by 8% from 2011-2015, leading to a 17% reduction in armed forces size. The Strategic Defence and Security Review in 2015 committed the UK to maintaining a minimum defense spending level of 2% of GDP and increasing defense spending by 0.5% above inflation annually through 2021. Planned acquisitions include two new aircraft carriers, F-35s, new warships, and the renewal of the Trident nuclear program. The UK's defense spending commitments include two new aircraft carriers, F-35s, new warships, and renewing the Trident nuclear deterrent. However, the Strategic Defence and Security Review made more commitments than it could afford, leading to a \u00a320 billion funding gap for the next decade. The National Security Capability Review is expected to offer potential solutions such as scaling back acquisitions, delaying upgrades, or cutting personnel and capabilities. The UK's Ministry of Defence faces resistance from the Treasury in securing additional budgetary resources to address a funding gap. Despite being capable of expeditionary combat operations, defense constraints limit the UK's ability for full-spectrum combat against peer competitors like Russia. The focus has shifted to special forces, intelligence, counterterrorism, and cybersecurity to address security threats. The UK launched the National Cyber Security Centre in 2016 to enhance cybersecurity efforts. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) was established in 2016 as part of the GCHQ to provide cybersecurity expertise and services to the public and private sectors. The agency offers advice, consulting, incident response, and recovery services, working closely with law enforcement, intelligence agencies, and international partners. Counterterrorism remains a key focus for the UK, with several major terrorist plots disrupted in the past decade. Recent attacks by British citizens linked to the Islamic State group have raised concerns about the group's capacity to inspire or direct attacks in Europe. The UK's Counter-Terrorism and Security Act of 2015 enhanced the country's counterterrorism legislation, giving police and border officials more powers to combat terrorism. The act also required institutions to report extremism and develop policies to deal with radicals. Approximately 760 UK citizens have traveled to Syria and Iraq for training, with 350 individuals returning home. The concern over British citizens being involved in attacks in Europe has increased. Following the June 2017 attacks in London, UK officials have urged internet and technology companies to remove terrorism content. U.S.-UK intelligence and counterterrorism cooperation is close and effective, with agencies sharing information and working together on investigations. This cooperation has disrupted multiple terrorist operations in recent years, including plots against the New York Stock Exchange, transatlantic aviation, and a cargo airplane bomb plot. The US-UK intelligence and counterterrorism relationship is generally positive, but tensions have arisen over issues such as renditions, torture allegations, and extradition arrangements. Recent disputes include leaks during the Manchester bombing investigation in 2017 and reports of surveillance operations by NSA and GCHQ in 2013. The Tempora program allegedly involves tapping into undersea cables for international communications. The NSA and GCHQ collaborated on collecting data from transatlantic fiber-optic cables, raising concerns among UK civil liberty groups. In response, the UK passed the Investigatory Powers Act in 2016, criticized for granting the government broad surveillance powers. The US-UK bilateral investment relationship is the largest globally, with $682.4 billion in US foreign direct investment in the UK in 2016. In 2016, foreign direct investment (FDI) in the UK was $682.4 billion, with total U.S. corporate assets in the UK reaching $5 trillion. UK FDI in the United States was $555.7 billion, with total UK corporate assets invested in the U.S. exceeding $2 trillion. The investment relationship is affected by Brexit, with U.S. FDI flows to the UK decreasing by 50% in the first nine months of 2017. The UK is the seventh-largest trading partner of the United States, with significant trade in goods and services. The UK is the largest trading partner with the US in services, with exports totaling $65.7 billion and imports totaling $51.7 billion in 2016. There is support for a bilateral free trade agreement between the two countries, despite the UK's inability to negotiate until it leaves the EU. Close cooperation is expected to continue in areas such as counterterrorism, intelligence, economic issues, and NATO. The UK's commitment to NATO and partnership with the US in combating the Islamic State is emphasized despite Brexit. UK officials assure that Brexit does not mean isolationism and intend to remain a global leader in various areas. Concerns are raised about the impact of Brexit on US strategic interests, especially in relation to Europe and the EU. Some U.S. officials worry that the UK's withdrawal from the EU could weaken security and defense partnerships. Brexit may shift EU debates on sanctions against Russia and allow for easier military integration projects under the EU Common Security and Defense Policy. The UK has previously blocked initiatives to strengthen the CSDP, arguing it competes with NATO. The UK blocked a proposal to consolidate EU military missions under a single permanent operational headquarters. U.S. officials support EU initiatives to increase defense capabilities but stress the importance of complementing NATO. Brexit may lead to internal preoccupation, diverting resources from addressing shared external challenges like terrorism and instability."
