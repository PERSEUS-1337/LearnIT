    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Egg Research and Consumer Information Act Amendments of 1993\". The assessment rate is addressed in Section 2. The Egg Research and Consumer Information Act is amended to specify the assessment rate not exceeding 20 cents per case of commercial eggs. The order can be amended to increase the rate with Egg Board and producer approval, or decrease it after public notice and comment. The Egg Research and Consumer Information Act allows for an assessment rate of up to 20 cents per case of commercial eggs, which can be increased with Egg Board approval based on evidence to support the policy declared in the Act. The Secretary can conduct a referendum if requested by the Egg Board for rate adjustments. The Secretary conducts a referendum among non-exempt egg producers to approve a change in the assessment rate proposed by the Egg Board. The change becomes effective if approved by two-thirds of producers or a majority producing at least two-thirds of all commercial eggs. The Egg Board determines the order under the Act. The Egg Board decides whether to request a referendum from the Secretary to approve an increase in the assessment rate. The Secretary must conduct the referendum within 120 days of the request, or 170 days if the Office of Management and Budget requires review. If approved by producers, the increase in the assessment rate becomes effective. If an increase in the assessment rate is approved by producers in a referendum, the Secretary will amend the order accordingly, and the amendment will take effect on the date of issuance. SEC. 3.
