    "content": "The text chunk discusses the coverage of statewide behavioral health access program activities for children under age 21, amending Title XIX of the Social Security Act to include this provision. Beginning January 1, 2017, a State may opt to provide medical assistance for child behavioral health access program activities under this section, despite certain provisions being waived. Definitions for child behavioral health access administrative program activities and child behavioral health access administrative program are provided. An administrative program for behavioral health services for individuals under 21 years of age includes developing a network of mental health professionals to support pediatric primary care providers and assessing consultation needs. The program develops an online database and communication mechanisms for consultation support to pediatric primary care providers, tracks referrals for behavioral evaluation, and facilitates follow-up visits. It also provides training and technical assistance to support the prevention, early identification, diagnosis, treatment, and referral of children with mental or behavioral health conditions. The program supports pediatric primary care providers in accessing child and adolescent psychiatry consultations, referral for behavioral evaluation and treatment, and training. It also informs eligible children and families about available assistance, measures increased access to behavioral health activities, and coordinates with providers to identify and treat children with mental health issues. The program supports pediatric primary care providers in coordinating with state mental health resources for children and adolescents. It also enhances federal funding for mental health services over the next few years. The amendments increase federal funding for child behavioral health access administrative program activities, starting at 80 percent in 2018 and decreasing to 60 percent in 2020 and beyond. The effective date for these changes is 90 days after the enactment of the Act."
