    "content": "The Act titled \"Detainee Basic Medical Care Act of 2008\" establishes medical care standards for immigration detainees of the Department of Homeland Security. The Secretary of Homeland Security must establish procedures for providing medical and mental health care to all immigration detainees, including screenings and examinations upon arrival at detention facilities. Each immigration detainee must receive a comprehensive medical and mental health examination within 14 days of arrival. Detainees on prescribed medications can continue their treatment until a healthcare professional decides on an alternative. Those with serious medical or mental health conditions are given priority care. The Secretary's procedures ensure continuity of medical and mental health care services for immigration detainees, including informing them of available services, providing prompt responses to requests for care, making treatment decisions based on professional judgments, and ensuring access to prescribed medications and necessary treatments. The Secretary's procedures ensure medical and mental health care continuity for immigration detainees, including timely treatment decisions and access to prescribed medications. Medical records availability is also ensured during detainee transfers. The immigration detainee's complete medical records, including transfer summaries, must be provided to the receiving facility. Within 72 hours of a written request, the detainee or designated person must receive their medical records. Necessary forms must be provided to comply with privacy laws. An administrative appeals process for denials of medical or mental health care must be included in the Secretary's procedures. The Secretary must provide a written explanation for denying medical or mental health care to immigration detainees, allowing for an appeal process that is resolved within 30 days by an impartial board of healthcare professionals. The Secretary must ensure continuity of care for immigration detainees with serious medical or mental health conditions upon removal or release. Reporting requirements mandate the Secretary to report detainee deaths to the Offices of Inspector General within 48 hours and submit a detailed report to Congress annually. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines \"detention facility\" as any facility used by the Secretary of Homeland Security to hold immigration detainees for over 72 hours, and \"immigration detainee\" as any person in custody under immigration laws at a detention facility."
