    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Partnerships for Progress and Prosperity Act\" or the \"P3 Act\". The \"Partnerships for Progress and Prosperity Act\" or the \"P3 Act\" aims to address the shortage of skilled workers in the United States, as highlighted by various studies and recommendations from Harvard Graduate School of Education and the Executive Office of Science and Technology Policy. The American Enterprise Institute reports an increasing percentage of older manufacturing workers, leading to a potential shortage of skilled factory workers. The Society of Manufacturing Engineers predicts a shortfall of 3 million jobs by 2015 due to retirements and an anticipated manufacturing rebound. The United States scored below average in the 2012 Program for International Student Assessment. The United States scored below average in mathematics and science compared to other countries, dropping in math rankings from 25th to 36th. Studies highlight the benefits of school partnerships with outside organizations for student training in future jobs. The grant program is outlined in Section 3. The Secretary of Education awards grants to eligible entities to enhance STEM education and prepare students for careers in STEM fields. To receive a grant, an eligible entity must partner with a STEM employer and outline activities to be carried out with the grant. An eligible entity receiving a grant must partner with a STEM employer and an institution of higher education to assist students in internships. The eligible entity receiving a grant must partner with STEM employers and higher education institutions to assist students in internships, develop STEM curriculum, offer dual-credit courses, provide tutoring and mentoring in STEM, enable attendance at STEM events, and offer after-school and summer STEM programs. The Secretary evaluates grant applications based on research findings and positive evaluations to improve student outcomes. Special consideration is given to entities promoting in-classroom engagement between STEM professionals and students. The grant program aims to improve student outcomes by promoting co-teaching and guest-teaching opportunities, using technology-based instructional materials, pairing mentors with struggling students, serving schools with majority of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch, and targeting interventions for underrepresented populations in STEM fields. The grant program requires eligible entities to provide a 50 percent non-Federal match, which can be in cash or in kind. Partnerships with public and private entities are allowed to meet this requirement. The Secretary may waive the matching requirement for entities facing financial hardship. Grant funds must supplement, not supplant, existing funds for eligible activities. Grant funds provided to eligible entities must supplement, not supplant, funds for authorized activities. An eligible entity is defined as a local educational agency or an institution of higher education. Terms like \"low-income student\" are also defined in the Act. The term \"low-income student\" refers to a student whose family's income is below 150 percent of the poverty line. Appropriations are authorized for the implementation of this section for fiscal year 2018 and beyond."
