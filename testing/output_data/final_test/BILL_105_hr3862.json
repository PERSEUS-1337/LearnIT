    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Poison Control Center Enhancement and Awareness Act\". Congress finds that over 2,000,000 poisonings are reported annually, with 90% occurring at home and 53% affecting children under 6 years old. Poison centers are crucial, saving money and lives, but funding instability has led to a decline in the number of centers, currently at 75. Increasing funding and accessibility to poison control centers will expand the reach of certified centers in the United States, reducing inappropriate use of emergency services and costly healthcare. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is defined in this Act. The Act establishes a national toll-free number for poison control centers and authorizes funding for this purpose. Additionally, a nationwide media campaign will be established. SEC. 5. ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIONWIDE MEDIA CAMPAIGN.\n\nThe Secretary will create a national media campaign to raise awareness about poison prevention and the availability of poison control resources. This includes advertising the nationwide toll-free number through contracts with media firms for public service announcements. $600,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 1999 to 2003.\n\nSEC. 6. ESTABLISHMENT OF A GRANT PROGRAM. The Secretary will award grants to regional poison control centers for financial stability, prevention, and treatment recommendations for poisonings. The funds will also be used to develop education programs, patient management protocols, data collection systems, and toxic exposure surveillance. Centers must be certified by a professional organization in the field of poison control to receive grants. The Secretary may grant a waiver of certification requirements for noncertified poison control centers applying for grants under this section if they can demonstrate they will obtain certification within a reasonable period. Waivers can be renewed for up to 3 years. Amounts granted to poison control centers should supplement, not supplant, existing funds. The control center funded under this section must supplement, not replace, other funds. Poison control centers must maintain their expenditures at a certain level when using grant funds. The Secretary may require matching funds for grants. $25,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 1999 to 2003 to carry out this section."
