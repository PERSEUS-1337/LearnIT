    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Good Samaritan Protection for Construction, Architectural, and Engineering Volunteers Act\". The Congress acknowledges the valuable service provided by the construction, architectural, and engineering industries during disasters and emergencies, citing their assistance after September 11, 2001, and Hurricane Katrina. Their expertise and equipment significantly improved search and recovery efforts, making it safer for rescue workers. Construction, architectural, and engineering industries improve public safety by assessing and mitigating threats to life and property. Lawsuits were faced by companies in New York City and the Gulf Coast for their voluntary efforts. Providing immunity from liability for volunteer services ensures availability in future emergencies. Qualified immunity from liability for negligence is provided to construction, architectural, and engineering entities when offering volunteer services during declared emergencies or disasters. Liability protection is granted to construction, architectural, and engineering entities providing voluntary emergency assistance in good faith without expecting compensation. They are not liable for harm caused by negligence, except in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct. Definitions for \"construction entity\" and \"architectural or engineering entity\" are provided. The term \"architectural or engineering entity\" refers to a person or business providing architectural or engineering assistance. \"Construction assistance\" includes materials, labor, equipment, or services for construction activities. \"Architectural or engineering assistance\" involves professional services required to be performed by a licensed architect or engineer. \"Emergency construction assistance\" and \"emergency architectural or engineering assistance\" are for urgent situations. Emergency architectural or engineering assistance refers to construction assistance and architectural or engineering services provided in response to a declared emergency or disaster, directed by a public official. This section preempts state laws that are inconsistent with it, allowing states to provide higher liability protection or reimbursement as authorized by local law. The section provides reimbursement for costs or expenses authorized by State or local law, excluding liability under workers compensation laws."
