    "content": "Congress has been instrumental in developing civilian capacity to address conflicts overseas, with initiatives like the Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS) established in 2004. Senator Richard G. Lugar and former Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. were key in its establishment. The 113th Congress may continue this role by examining the State Department Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations (CSO), a \"second generation\" effort announced by the Obama Administration in November 2011. The State Department Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations (CSO) was established in November 2011 to provide policy and operational solutions for crises. The evolution from S/CRS to CSO was influenced by changing security perceptions, utility, and budget constraints. This report discusses issues from the S/CRS era that may still be relevant for CSO, such as effectiveness, size of the Civilian Response Corps, funding for stabilization operations, and a reserve component. It does not cover events post-CSO formation and will not be updated. For current information on CSO, refer to CRS Report R42775. The State Department Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations (CSO) was established in November 2011 to address the need for civilian capabilities in conflict and post-conflict situations. This was prompted by experiences in Haiti, Somalia, Bosnia, Afghanistan, and Iraq where military forces were involved in state-building tasks. The George W. Bush Administration initiated efforts to develop civilian structures for effective response to stabilization and reconstruction situations. The George W. Bush Administration established the S/CRS in the Office of the Secretary of State in mid-2004 to develop civilian capabilities for stabilization and reconstruction. The Obama Administration also supported civilian S&R capabilities, with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton mentioning the need for competence and funding in January 2009. The 110th Congress enacted legislation to create federal civilian \"response\" units and a volunteer S&R civilian reserve force to coordinate U.S. government S&R operations and deploy personnel for state-building activities in crises abroad. The 110th Congress enacted legislation to establish a volunteer S&R civilian reserve force, part of permanent law, to coordinate U.S. government S&R operations and deploy personnel for state-building activities in crises abroad. The 110th Congress established a volunteer civilian reserve force for S&R operations and state-building activities abroad. The State Department's QDDR proposed restructuring S/CRS and creating a Bureau for Conflict and Stabilization Operations. The Obama Administration implemented some QDDR proposals by establishing the CSO Bureau. Former President George W. Bush pledged support for these initiatives in 2005. Former President George W. Bush's pledge in 2005 to build and preserve free and independent nations with accountable governments and reflective of their cultures reshaped the concept of establishing new institutions in troubled countries. The Bush Administration reframed U.S. security and international development policy, leading to significant changes in governmental structures and practices. The Bush Administration implemented changes in U.S. governmental structures to enhance efficiency and reduce costs in conflict and post-conflict situations. This included establishing new civilian structures and forces like S/CRS and the civilian response/reserve corps. These changes were highlighted in initiatives such as NSPD-44 and the \"transformational diplomacy\" reorganization of State Department personnel after 9/11. After the terrorist attacks of 9/11, analysts predicted that weak states could pose security threats to the U.S. In response, a new foreign policy strategy was outlined by former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in 2006, focusing on diplomacy, democracy promotion, economic reconstruction, and military security. State-building was central to this strategy, with the creation of S/CRS in 2004 playing a key role in dealing with conflict transitions and fragile states. The creation of S/CRS in July 2004 aimed to enhance U.S. civilian capabilities for post-conflict state-building operations in response to the perceived threat of global instability after 9/11. Analysts believed that transforming weak and failing states into stable, democratic ones was crucial for U.S. security, necessitating interventions in foreign conflicts for peacekeeping and stabilization. The U.S. created civilian capabilities for post-conflict state-building operations to address global instability after 9/11. Analysts emphasized the importance of interventions in foreign conflicts for peacekeeping and stabilization to transform weak states into stable, democratic ones. The need to strengthen U.S. and international capabilities for security, governance, and economic development in weak states was highlighted by the 9/11 Commission and the Commission on Weak States and U.S. National Security. Weak states are vulnerable to criminal activities and terrorist groups, as well as public health issues like HIV/AIDS. Assistance to these states was recommended by analysts. The need to enhance U.S. government structures and capabilities for post-conflict operations was highlighted by various studies. They recommended replacing the ad hoc system with a permanent mechanism, deploying civilian personnel rapidly, considering preventive action, and enhancing multinational capabilities for post-conflict security tasks. Several reports emphasized the need for enhanced multinational capabilities in post-conflict security tasks and better coordination of international aid. Flexible funding arrangements were also recommended, along with the development of rapidly deployable civilian forces to undertake state-building functions, particularly related to the rule of law. This early deployment of civilian personnel is seen as crucial for providing security from the outset of an operation, leading to long-term stability and democracy in intervened or post-conflict countries. The concept of rapidly deployable civilian experts for stabilization and reconstruction operations has been supported by various reports since the Clinton Administration. Analysts have questioned the utility of this initiative. Some analysts questioned the utility of S/CRS and the transformational diplomacy strategy, arguing that weak and failed states are not the only sources of terrorism. Factors like demographics, politics, religion, culture, and geography also play a role. Emphasizing weak states could divert attention from more significant threats to the United States. The CATO Institute study raised concerns about the focus on promoting \"responsible sovereignty\" in transformational diplomacy, potentially justifying erosion of respect for national sovereignty and leading to fruitless interventions. Analysts doubted the effectiveness of military and political interventions in addressing weak and failed states, with skepticism about state-building efforts resulting in success. Success criteria, draws, failures, and the best means for achieving success are subjects of ongoing debate. Some scholars caution against missions that aim to remake countries, citing Germany and Japan as rare successful examples. Others point to Mozambique and El Salvador as cases where state-building efforts promoted peace. Senators Lugar and Biden introduced a bill in 2004 to enhance civilian agencies' readiness for stabilization and reconstruction efforts. The legislation proposed by Senators Lugar and Biden in 2004 aimed to establish and fund new operational entities for stabilization and reconstruction efforts, including a State Department Office, an Emergency Response Readiness Force, and an emergency response fund. Despite initial bills not passing, a subsequent measure, the Reconstruction and Stabilization Civilian Management Act of 2006, was approved in 2008. S. 3322 was introduced in the Senate on May 26, 2006, and approved without amendment the same day. It was later referred to the House International Relations Committee. In the 110th Congress, a similar bill, H.R. 1084, was passed by the House on March 5, 2008, and incorporated into the FY2009 NDAA. S/CRS began operations in July 2004 without statutory authority, and by 2005 had a staff of 37 individuals. S/CRS, established in July 2004, had a staff of 37 individuals from various U.S. government agencies by 2005. General Myers highlighted its role in post-conflict peace efforts, emphasizing the need for resources to synchronize military and civilian efforts. The Task Force on the United Nations, chaired by Newt Gingrich and George Mitchell, recommended strengthening S/CRS and providing necessary resources for coordination with the UN. S/CRS was established in 2004 with defined responsibilities to create a crisis response mechanism. The Task Force on the United Nations recommended strengthening S/CRS to address crises in conflict or civil strife regions, plan and coordinate non-military responses, and monitor global instability for potential assistance needs. Congress expanded the functions of S/CRS under the State Department's budget, funded through annual and supplemental appropriations. The role in interagency coordination was formalized under NSPD-44 to improve conflict-response coordination among executive branch agencies. The Secretary of State has the lead responsibility for developing civilian responses in conflict situations, with the option to delegate to the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization. The Secretary of State, with the option to delegate to the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization, is responsible for coordinating interagency processes to identify states at risk, leading planning to prevent conflict, and developing contingency plans for stabilization and reconstruction operations. NSPD-44 expanded S/CRS activities beyond congressional mandate, focusing on interagency cooperation in actual operations through the Interagency Management System (IMS). The January 22, 2007, Interagency Management System (IMS) for Reconstruction and Stabilization was drafted and approved by a National Security Council (NSC) deputies meeting. This document outlines interagency coordination in responding to complex crises. The Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization plays a key role in the U.S. government's crisis response, working with civilian and military entities. In October 2008, efforts to enhance civilian capabilities for stabilization and reconstruction tasks reached a significant milestone. In October 2008, Congress amended foreign assistance and State Department statutes to authorize assistance for reconstruction and stabilization crises, establish S/CRS, and create Response Readiness Corps and Civilian Reserve Corps. The authority is limited to FY2009-FY2011. In October 2008, Congress amended foreign assistance and State Department statutes to authorize assistance for reconstruction and stabilization crises, establish S/CRS, and create Response Readiness Corps and Civilian Reserve Corps. The authority is limited to FY2009-FY2011. The President has the authority to use U.S. civilian agencies or non-federal employees to provide assistance for reconstruction and stabilization in conflict-affected regions. The President may use funds from the FAA for reconstruction and stabilization purposes, with notification to Congress. Assistance can be provided regardless of other laws, with terms determined by the President. The section does not allow for fund transfers between accounts or agencies. The goal is to improve civilian capacity for stabilization and reconstruction operations. The Lugar-Biden legislation codifies the existence of S/CRS and assigns nine specific functions to the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization, including monitoring political and economic instability and planning a U.S. response. These functions prevent the dismantling of the office without congressional consent. The Lugar-Biden legislation sought to establish a corps of civilian personnel to work with USAID and other agencies for state-building activities. The Response Readiness Corps and Civilian Reserve Corps were created to address the scarcity of civilian personnel for stabilization efforts. The Response Readiness Corps and Civilian Reserve Corps were established by P.L. 110-417 to provide assistance in stabilization and reconstruction activities in foreign countries. The Obama Administration combined these into the Civilian Response Corps with three components. The Response Readiness Corps (RRC) and Civilian Reserve Corps were established by P.L. 110-417 to provide reconstruction and stabilization assistance in foreign countries. The RRC consists of federal employees from various agencies, while the CRC is made up of volunteers with the necessary skills. The Secretary of State is authorized to deploy members of the RRC. The Civilian Reserve Corps is established to provide assistance in foreign countries, with the Secretary authorized to deploy its members. The Corps can be deployed upon a presidential determination of national security interests. S/CRS has developed the capacity to respond to countries at risk of conflict or in recovery stages, with staff mainly from the State Department. The Civilian Reserve Corps, established to provide assistance in foreign countries, has staff mainly from the State Department and other executive branch agencies. S/CRS carries out activities such as monitoring potential conflict, planning U.S. responses, and initiating programs to prevent conflict. They work closely with the National Intelligence Council to identify weak states susceptible to crisis for contingency planning. S/CRS collaborates with various agencies to assess and prevent conflicts, develop planning models, and implement response programs in multiple countries. They also supported USAID in response efforts after the 2010 Haiti earthquake. In the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, S/CRS supported USAID's relief efforts. They began creating crisis-response teams in 2006, deploying members to various countries like Darfur and Lebanon. By 2010, S/CRS and the CRC conducted missions in Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Sudan. In August 2010, S/CRS and CRC staff were deployed in Afghanistan to support the government in implementing the Afghan National Development Strategy, coalition military commands, and communications/elections efforts. In Kyrgyzstan, S/CRS staff provided assessment and planning support for a strategic plan after the government overthrow. S/CRS and CRC personnel supported various U.S. activities in Sudan, including election preparation, stabilization efforts, and economic assessments. They also provided assistance to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). As of January 2011, there were 15 personnel engaged in Sudan work. As of January 6, 2012, S/CRS and CRC had 51 personnel deployed to 10 countries, with the majority in Afghanistan and Sudan. They worked on civil-military planning and coordination for stabilization and reconstruction operations. Contributing agencies included State, USAID, and Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and Justice. The Civilian Response Corps (CRC) was established to enhance civilian capabilities for stabilization and reconstruction operations. It consists of an active component (CRC-A) of 250 U.S. government employees who can deploy within 48 hours, a standby component (CRC-S) of 2,000 U.S. government employees who can deploy within 30 days, and a reserve component (CRC-R) of 2,000 experts from other public institutions. The CRC has been involved in training civilian planners, developing ties with international participants, and was formally launched by Secretary of State Rice in 2008. The Civilian Response Corps (CRC) consists of an active component (CRC-A) of 250 U.S. government employees who can deploy within 48 hours, a standby component (CRC-S) of 2,000 U.S. government employees who can deploy within 30 days, and a reserve component (CRC-R) of 2,000 experts from other public institutions and private sectors. The State Department, along with other contributing departments and agencies, are recruiting members for the CRC-A and standby component. Congress had appropriated $140 million for the establishment and deployment of the active and standby civilian response components as of May 7, 2009. The Civilian Response Corps (CRC) consists of an active component of 250 U.S. government employees who can deploy within 48 hours and a standby component of 2,000 U.S. government employees who can deploy within 30 days. In June 2008, Congress provided $65 million for S/CRS and USAID S&R activities through the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008. Up to $30 million was appropriated for the State Department to establish a coordinated civilian response capacity, and up to $25 million was appropriated to USAID for the same purpose. In March 2009, Congress allocated $75 million for the Civilian Stabilization Initiative to establish and support the CRC active and standby components. This included $45 million from the State Department and $30 million from USAID. The CRC-A was initially planned to have 250 members, but by early 2010, the Obama Administration aimed for 247 members to be trained and ready for deployment by the end of FY2010. As of FY2010, the CRC-A had 131 members, over half of the original goal of 250. The Treasury Department withdrew, and DOE and DOT were added. The CRC-S had 1,062 members ready for deployment by January 2011. The CRC-S had 1,062 members ready for deployment by January 2011, with plans to increase to 2,000 members by the end of FY2011. However, by January 6, 2012, the CRC-S was reduced to 590 members. Congress rejected a budget request for a 2,000-member CRC reserve component. The Obama Administration did not request FY2011 funds for a civilian reserve but proposed a more cost-effective 'Expert Corps' instead. The FY2010 budget request for the Civilian Stabilization Initiative was $323.272 million. The Civilian Stabilization Initiative (CSI) was designed to establish a civilian response corps to react to conflicts in foreign countries, reducing the need for large military deployments. The FY2010 budget request for CSI was $323.272 million. The State Department requested $323 million for conflict response efforts, including funding for personnel recruitment, training, and equipment pre-positioning. This includes building an active component of 250 members, a standby component of 2,000 members, and a reserve component of 2,000 members. Additionally, funds are allocated for deploying experts during operations and sustaining personnel for up to three months. The Obama Administration requested funding for civilian deployment, security, and leadership in response to crises, including $40 million for Stabilization Bridge Funds. Congress provided a $50 million \"Complex Crisis Fund\" under USAID for flexible funding for S&R operations. For FY2010, Congress provided $150 million for the CSI Active and Standby components in the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related programs Appropriations Act, 2010. $120 million went to the State Department and $30 million to USAID for Civilian Response Corps support and related reconstruction and stabilization assistance. Coordination between USAID and the State Department is required. The FY2010 funding for the Civilian Stabilization Initiative (CSI) includes allocations for salaries, training, equipment acquisition, deployments, operations support, and policy planning functions. The State Department's actual allocations, after rescissions, are detailed, with a new USAID Complex Crisis Fund established with $50 million. The Obama Administration requested $184 million for the Civilian Stabilization Initiative (CSI) in FY2011, with $50 million allocated to a new USAID Complex Crisis Fund. Congress divided FY2010 CSI funding between the State Department and USAID, but the Administration requested the entire FY2011 budget under the State Department. Total CSI funding remained at the FY2010 level under continuing resolutions for FY2011. H.R. 1 proposed $40 million for State and $7 million for USAID in FY2011 funding. The FY2011 funding request for the Civilian Stabilization Initiative (CSI) set funding levels at $40 million for State and $7 million for USAID. Planned allocations for CRC components included salaries, benefits, training, equipment acquisition, deployments, deployment center, operations support, and policy planning. Additionally, the Administration requested $100 million for the Complex Crises Fund to replace funding previously provided through Department of Defense Section 1207 authority. The requested funds through the Department of Defense Section 1207 authority will support activities to prevent or respond to emerging crises in countries at high risk of conflict or instability. Projects aim to address root causes of conflict through a whole-of-government approach. The Civilian Stabilization Initiative (CSI) funding levels were set at $40 million for State and $7 million for USAID, with an additional $100 million requested for the Complex Crises Fund. The Obama Administration requested $92.2 million for Conflict Stabilization Operations (CSO) and $75 million for the USAID Complex Crises Fund for FY2012. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 provided $8.5 million for Conflict Stabilization Operations. During FY2012, $21.8 million in funds for CSO were drawn from the State Department Diplomatic and Consular Programs account. The Obama Administration requested funding for Conflict Stabilization Operations (CSO) and the USAID Complex Crises Fund for FY2012. The establishment of the new State Department Conflict and Stabilization Operations (CSO) Bureau was in response to perceived issues with S/CRS. Analysts expressed doubts about S/CRS's capabilities and capacity to carry out its mission, citing a lack of initiative and funding from Congress. Some analysts have noted resistance from regional bureaus to S/CRS involvement in crises due to lack of support from top State Department leadership. There is a consensus on the need for a civilian entity to handle planning and coordination functions. Options include upgrading S/CRS, assigning functions to USAID, or creating a new organization. Improved capabilities and status for S/CRS have been suggested to address the mission's magnitude. Some suggest upgrading the rank or status of the S/CRS office to enhance its capabilities and provide better direction for interagency responses to crises. There are proposals to assign the Coordinator's functions to an Under Secretary or elevate S/CRS to a State Department bureau headed by an Assistant Secretary. However, there are concerns about whether all functions assigned to S/CRS are appropriate. Some question if all functions assigned to S/CRS are suitable. Suggestions include placing the office in USAID for better coordination in stabilization and reconstruction missions. Ambassador Smith proposes a fully integrated State-USAID operation for leadership in such missions. A new balance is needed between regional bureaus and a new office for planning and conducting operations. One proposal suggests reassigning S/CRS functions to a new entity, USOCO, responsible to the NSC. This would streamline the process and ensure readiness for future contingencies. Another proposal involves dividing S/CRS functions among the NSC and the State Department. The proposal to restructure S/CRS functions suggests dividing them among the NSC, State Department Policy Planning Office, and USAID. This would involve the NSC managing whole-of-government coordination systems, a more robust policy planning office at the State Department, and USAID taking on operational responsibilities for the Civilian Response Corps. The creation of the CSO Bureau was announced in the December 2010 QDDR, which also proposed restructuring the State Department to elevate S/CRS functions. The QDDR proposed restructuring the State Department to integrate conflict and stabilization operations into core functions. S/CRS would be subsumed under the new Bureau for Conflict and Stabilization Operations (CSO), which would serve as the institutional locus for policy and operational solutions for crisis, conflict, and instability. The Assistant Secretary leading the CSO Bureau would coordinate early conflict prevention efforts and rapid deployment of civilian responders, working closely with USAID. The CSO Bureau, under a new Under Secretary, would have various functions including building capabilities for interagency surge teams, providing expertise for crisis response policies, and integrating conflict prevention work across the State Department. It would also be responsible for institutionalizing an international crisis response framework and coordinating efforts with other countries and organizations. The State Department is restructuring to create a new CSO Bureau staffed with experts in conflict management and prevention, drawing personnel from various government agencies. They will deploy senior diplomats trained in conflict resolution to conflict zones and weak states, and develop a flexible contracting mechanism for quick deployment of resources. Additionally, USAID capabilities will be revamped in parallel with the creation of the CSO Bureau. The State Department is restructuring to create a new CSO Bureau with experts in conflict management and prevention. USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives will be expanded with enhanced field presence and staff. The CSO Bureau will work closely with OTI to ensure effective design and start-up. Other proposed improvements include expanding USAID's capacity for conflict programs and transitions from relief to development. Some question the effectiveness of the CRC components and whether the US should support such a Corps. The National Defense University study suggested that the Civilian Response Corps should be larger, with 5,000 in the active and standby components and 10,000 in the reserve component. This would provide a pool of trained experts for flexibility and adaptability in complex operations. The National Defense University study recommended a larger Civilian Response Corps with 5,000 in active and standby components and 10,000 in the reserve component for flexibility in complex operations. Another study suggested a combined active and standby force of 2,500 should be supported by a reserve force of 4,500 personnel. Some Members of Congress raised concerns about the rapid expansion of the CRC units. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the rapid expansion of the Civilian Response Corps units, emphasizing the need for a gradual stand up and implementation process. They also noted that the timelines for hiring, training, and deployment of civilian corps members were overly ambitious and unrealistic. The Committee approved the Administration's decision not to request reserve component funding until the CSI has established a record of effectiveness. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the rapid expansion of the Civilian Response Corps units and approved the Administration's decision not to request reserve component funding until the CSI has proven effective. Congress has resisted providing flexible funding mechanisms for S&R operations in the State Department budget. The 111th Congress created a USAID Complex Crises Fund with a $50 million appropriation in response to the Obama Administration's request for $116 million in flexible funding for stabilization and reconstruction purposes. This fund provides greater flexibility to USAID to prevent conflict in new and fragile democracies. The conferees on the bill established a new account to provide USAID with greater flexibility to respond to complex crises overseas. This account consolidates the budget for a Rapid Response Fund and a Stabilization Bridge Fund, aiming for more efficiency and oversight by the Administration and Congress. Proponents argue that flexible funding is necessary for unforeseen crises that require immediate response, as current mechanisms are too slow. Several bills were introduced to establish a conflict response fund, inspired by the Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance (ERMA) account. The HELP Commission recommended two rapid-response crisis funds in 2007, one for humanitarian crises and the other for security challenges. Funding for security and stabilization activities through the DOD increased from 2006 to 2010. The funding for security and stabilization activities authorized by Section 1207 of the NDAA served as a response fund for small projects by State Department and USAID personnel. Congress allowed this authority to expire at the end of FY2010, signaling that DOD's Section 1207 funding would not be provided for another year. In response to the expiration of DOD's Section 1207 funding, conferees recommended the establishment of the Complex Crises Fund to enable USAID and the State Department to address emergent requirements without relying on the Department of Defense. They also emphasized the importance of continued DOD participation in planning small-scale security and stabilization projects. Conferees recommended establishing the Complex Crises Fund to replace DOD's Section 1207 funding. They urged the State Department and USAID to develop additional capacity for crisis prevention and response, emphasizing the need for consultation between USAID, State, and Defense on stabilization and security assistance. The Administration requested $100 million for the CCF in the FY2011 budget to replace previous Section 1207 funding. The FY2011 budget will replace funding previously provided under Section 1207 authority. Continuing resolutions provided funding for the Complex Crises Fund (CCF) at the $50 million FY2010 level, but the final FY2011 appropriations bill provided no CCF funding. FY2012 appropriations for the CCF totaled $40 million, with plans to develop a civilian expert roster for deployment as needed, different from the original proposal for a civilian reserve component. In 2008, Congress authorized the establishment of a Civilian Reserve Corps to substitute for military troops in state-building activities, as proposed in the 2004 Lugar-Biden legislation. Former President Bush highlighted the need for a civilian reserve corps in the fight against terrorism, similar to the military reserve, to ease the burden on the armed forces and allow civilians with critical skills to serve on missions abroad. The 2008 CSI proposal called for a civilian reserve component of 2,000 troops, but Congress did not provide funding for it. The 2009 CSI proposal also called for the same reserve component, but it was denied funding in the Department of State Appropriations Bill. Proponents of the civilian reserve corps cite various advantages, with a focus on the active and standby components. The Department of Defense proposed the creation of a civilian reserve corps to free up military personnel from state-building tasks during operations, allowing them to focus on combat. This corps would have higher expertise and experience for success in search and rescue operations, especially at the national level. Many believe that there is a lack of civil affairs personnel to provide the necessary depth for deployment. Analysts argue that a civilian reserve corps may not have enough personnel for effective deployment in various situations. Some doubt the feasibility and effectiveness of such a corps, questioning if qualified experts would join in sufficient numbers. Cost considerations may have influenced the decision to switch to a roster system. The Bush Administration's CSI estimated the cost of recruiting, screening, enrolling, training, and equipping 2,000 members at $87 million in FY2009 and $47 million in 2010. Proponents argue that deploying civilian personnel could result in net savings for the military, despite potential high costs. Maintaining and deploying civilian reservists is seen as relatively inexpensive compared to the multiple costs incurred by the military. The QDDR proposed replacing the reserve with a more cost-effective 'Expert Corps' consisting of technical experts who have served successfully in various countries. Other nations and international organizations also use roster systems for civilian deployments in nation-building and post-conflict missions. The QDDR proposed an 'Expert Corps' as a cost-effective alternative to a reserve corps, consisting of technical experts with deployment flexibility and no re-employment rights. Funding would support actual deployments, with potential costs for equipment acquisition. Some costs like equipment acquisition may still be necessary. Savings could come from eliminating benefits like pensions and training costs, but some argue health coverage and a good training program are essential for recruiting quality personnel and effective performance."
