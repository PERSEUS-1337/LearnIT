    "content": "This report analyzes the impact of sanctions on achieving U.S. objectives regarding Iran and discusses various scenarios that could affect the easing or tightening of sanctions. It reviews the imposition of sanctions by the U.S. and the international community, highlighting their objectives. The effectiveness of sanctions is intertwined with other policy tools, making it challenging to isolate their specific impact on Iran. Various factors, such as Iranian decision-making and financial management, also influence Iran's behavior. The report references U.S. sanctions laws and Executive Orders. The report discusses U.S. and multilateral sanctions imposed on Iran, their objectives, and the multiple purposes they serve. It references U.S. sanctions laws and Executive Orders implementing those laws. The primary purposes of U.S. sanctions on Iran were determined through analysis of Administration statements, legislative history, and specific provisions. From 1979 to 2006, the U.S. imposed substantial economic sanctions on Iran, mainly targeting U.S. firms to shut Iran out of the U.S. market. After 1996, sanctions aimed to compel foreign countries and firms to choose between dealing with Iran and accessing the U.S. market, exemplified by the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996. The U.S. imposed significant economic sanctions on Iran from 1979 to 2006, targeting U.S. firms to exclude Iran from the U.S. market. Sanctions were expanded through legislative amendments, with the main goal of reducing Iran's support for terrorist organizations like Hezbollah and Hamas. Sanctions were triggered by Iran's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism in 1984, leading to restrictions on U.S. exports and foreign aid. President Clinton issued Executive Order 12957 in 1995 to ban U.S. firms from trading with Iran due to its support for terrorist groups. The U.S. imposed economic sanctions on Iran from 1979 to 2006 to reduce support for terrorist groups. Executive Order 13224 in 2001 targeted entities supporting terrorism, including Iran. Laws and Executive Orders aimed to limit Iran's access to advanced weaponry and equipment for potential WMD programs. Iran's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism restricted its ability to acquire U.S. arms. The \"state sponsor of terrorism list\" designation restricted Iran from obtaining U.S. arms and WMD-capable technology, with no penalties for third country suppliers. Laws like the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992 penalized foreign countries and firms providing arms or WMD tech to Iran. The Iran Sanctions Act of 1996 aimed to deter foreign firms from developing Iran's oil fields to cut off revenue for terrorism and WMD programs. In 2002, Iran's nuclear facilities construction was revealed. After Iran's nuclear facilities construction was revealed in 2002, the issue of Iran's nuclear program gained prominence on the U.S. foreign policy agenda. European countries initiated negotiations to persuade Iran to halt uranium enrichment, which broke down in 2005. Subsequently, the U.S., European countries, Russia, and China imposed U.N. economic sanctions on Iran through four Security Council resolutions from 2006-2010. The U.N. imposed targeted sanctions on Iran through four Security Council resolutions from 2006-2010, aiming to enforce non-proliferation regimes, hinder Iran's nuclear program, and impact Tehran's decision-making. The U.N. imposed targeted sanctions on Iran through four Security Council resolutions from 2006-2010 to hinder its nuclear program. Resolution 1929, adopted in June 2010, aimed to limit Iran's regional influence and military capabilities. Some countries enforced all provisions, while others only implemented mandatory sanctions, including a ban on major arms sales to Iran. The U.N. imposed targeted sanctions on Iran through four Security Council resolutions from 2006-2010 to hinder its nuclear program. Resolution 1929, adopted in June 2010, aimed to limit Iran's regional influence and military capabilities. Congress enacted several major Iran sanctions bills, such as the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability and Divestment Act (CISADA), to restrict Iran's access to major conventional arms systems. The U.S. implemented secondary sanctions to deny foreign firms access to the U.S. market for conducting transactions with Iran. During this period, sanctions were imposed on Iran to reduce its ability to suppress political opposition, influence neighboring countries, and export oil. The sanctions aimed to place economic pressure on Iran by restricting access to the U.S. market for foreign firms conducting transactions with key sectors of the Iranian economy. The sanctions imposed on Iran aimed to pressure the country economically and potentially influence its nuclear program. There is debate over the effectiveness of these sanctions in changing Iranian policies, especially regarding nuclear negotiations. The \"Joint Plan of Action\" agreed in 2013 eased sanctions temporarily in exchange for halting aspects of Iran's nuclear program. The U.S. and U.N. sanctions on Iran prior to 2013 were seen as ineffective in curbing Iran's nuclear development. However, the Joint Plan of Action (JPA) in 2013, following Hassan Rouhani's election victory, showed that sanctions played a role in Iran's decision to halt its nuclear program in exchange for some relief. The candidate advocating economic self-reliance won amidst international sanctions. Iran's signing of the JPA was influenced by U.S. flexibility on uranium enrichment. Meetings between U.S. and Iranian officials in Oman preceded Rouhani's election and accelerated after he took office. The effectiveness of sanctions on Iran's nuclear policies remains uncertain, with debates ongoing. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified that Iran's nuclear intentions are unclear, suggesting that sanctions may have only temporarily impacted their behavior. If Iran were to pursue nuclear weapons, the effectiveness of sanctions would be questioned. Sanctions have had limited effect on curbing Iran's nuclear and missile program development. Iran has continued to advance its nuclear program and ballistic missile arsenal despite sanctions. The ban on arms sales has hindered Iran's ability to modernize its combat aircraft. The ban on worldwide arms sales to Iran has prevented Iran from modernizing its combat aircraft or ground armor from major arms suppliers such as Russia or China. Despite sanctions, Iran has continued to increase its supply and sophistication of missiles with military utility. Iran's arms exports violate Resolution 1747, which prohibits Iran from exporting arms. Iran continues to support Syrian President Bashar al Asad and arm rebel factions in Yemen, Bahrain, and Palestinian groups. Reports show little improvement in Iran's human rights practices, although President Rouhani's government has released political prisoners and proposed a new \"charter of citizen's rights.\" Sanctions have significantly impacted Iran's economy, leading to a contraction in GDP and a substantial decrease in oil exports. The Joint Plan of Action (JPA) temporarily eases international sanctions from January 20 to July 20, 2014. The interim agreement from January 20 to July 20, 2014, provides a \"reversible\" easing of international sanctions, maintaining the bulk of sanctions including oil, finance, and banking. If Iran fails to meet its commitments, relief will be revoked. The relief does not affect U.S. sanctions related to terrorism, human rights abuses, or regional influence. U.S. officials value the sanctions relief during the JPA period at $7 billion, including access to $4.2 billion in hard currency from oil sales. During the JPA period, Iran is allowed to increase petrochemical sales, resume trading in precious metals, and import goods for its automotive sector. Oil exports are capped at 1 million barrels per day. The relief is expected to have a small positive impact on Iran's economy, with a projected GDP growth of 1%-2% for 2014. International sanctions on Iran remain ambiguous, with some sanctions temporarily relaxed by individual states. The future of Iran sanctions depends on the P5+1 \u2013 Iran negotiations for a final settlement on Iran's nuclear program. The Joint Plan of Action (JPA) aims for a comprehensive nuclear settlement by July 20, 2014. Uncertainties exist regarding the lifting of sanctions, as some require congressional action. The JPA acknowledges the political process needed to implement U.S. negotiating commitments. The U.S. Administration will refrain from imposing new nuclear sanctions during the JPA period. There are consultations with Congress on how to lift sanctions and what actions are needed. The U.S. Administration is working with partners on a phased sanctions relief plan in response to Iran's actions. Congressional action may be needed for lifting some sanctions, as indicated by a letter signed by 82 Senators outlining parameters for a comprehensive settlement. Congress could demand requirements of Iran in any deal reached. Congress may demand additional requirements of Iran in a comprehensive settlement beyond those sought by the Administration, including the possibility of not lifting certain sanctions. Failure to lift nuclear-related sanctions could lead to accusations from P5+1 countries like Russia and China for not fulfilling promises to Iran. The Administration may offer Iran the indefinite suspension of sanctions if Congress refuses to lift them. It is uncertain if Iran would accept this alternative or hold out for complete termination of sanctions. The possibility of maintaining the ban on U.S. trade with Iran as a form of leverage is also considered. The Administration may choose to keep the ban on U.S. trade with Iran to exert leverage in potential discussions about U.S.-Iran relations. American firms may argue for equal standards in trade opportunities. If negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear settlement fail, there is a possibility of new sanctions being imposed. President Obama and senior U.S. officials have expressed support for new sanctions if needed. The Administration may support new sanctions if negotiations with Iran fail or if Iran violates the Joint Plan of Action (JPA). Congress may need to ensure legislative authority for rapid expansion of sanctions in such scenarios. Specific details on potential new sanctions are not publicly articulated. Legislation such as H.R. 850 and S. 1881 could be considered for imposing sanctions. The threat of veto by the Administration against new nuclear sanctions contributed to the Senate setting aside further consideration of the bill. A collapse of negotiations could lead partner countries to support increased sanctions if attributed to Iranian refusal to agree to reasonable demands for a comprehensive nuclear settlement. If the Administration imposes sanctions on partner country firms, it could weaken solidarity with the United States on the Iran issue. Sanctions viewed as severe may deter business with U.S. companies. U.S. inflexibility in negotiations could cause friction with Russia and China, who oppose military action against Iran. The possibility of an extension of the Joint Plan of Action (JPA) beyond July 20, 2014, is being considered due to the complexity of reaching a comprehensive nuclear settlement. President Obama has stated that the chances of reaching an agreement are no higher than \"50-50.\" Experts believe that the JPA will likely be renewed for an additional six-month period to allow more time for negotiations. This extension could have implications for Iran sanctions. The Administration may extend the Joint Plan of Action (JPA) beyond July 20, 2014, including sanctions relief for Iran. Congress could view an extension as Iranian reluctance to agree to acceptable terms, leading to concerns about erosion of sanctions commitment. Some Members of Congress worry that sanctions relief could weaken sanctions as companies prepare to re-enter the Iranian market. Congress may consider enacting additional sanctions to prevent this erosion, potentially causing Iran to withdraw. The potential extension of the Joint Plan of Action (JPA) beyond July 20, 2014, could lead to concerns about erosion of sanctions commitment. Congress may enact additional sanctions to prevent this, despite President Obama's veto threat on S. 1881. The Administration maintains that concerns about sanctions erosion have been unfounded so far. Companies engaging with Iran during the JPA period have not violated any Iran sanctions. During the JPA period, no firm business deals have violated Iran sanctions. President Obama warned companies against violating sanctions, stating they would face consequences. The history of U.S.-Iran tensions and the ineffectiveness of past sanctions are also discussed. The Administration warns of potential catastrophic incidents caused by Iran-supported groups, which could lead to questioning Iran's trustworthiness on nuclear commitments and possible imposition of additional sanctions. Experts are considering the possibility of hardliners in Iran or Iranian-supported organizations orchestrating a terrorist attack to disrupt potential diplomatic progress with the West. This could lead to a significant shift in Iran's political landscape since President Hassan Rouhani's election in 2013. Iran's moderate forces have dominated Iran's political system regarding nuclear negotiations, but hardliners, led by Supreme Leader Ali Khamene'i, express skepticism towards compromise. Hardliners aim to undermine Rouhani and could jeopardize Iran's commitment to a comprehensive settlement, potentially leading to US sanctions. The potential impact of a popular uprising in Iran on international sanctions could be significant. If Rouhani and his allies gain strong support from the Supreme Leader, there may be calls to ease sanctions to reinforce unity. This could demonstrate the benefits of engagement and negotiations to the Iranian population, leading to further compromises with the international community. The 2009 fraud-led re-election victory for President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was met with demonstrations that were suppressed by security forces. A repeat of such events, especially if met with brutal repression, could lead to increased sanctions on Iran, targeting security organizations and individuals involved in crackdowns. However, a different regime response to a new uprising could garner international support to ease sanctions. The regime in Iran may face increased sanctions if it responds to domestic political issues with brutal repression. There is a potential for Iran to escalate direct military action in the region, particularly in Syria, which could lead to a shift in international views on sanctions. Additionally, a renewal of hostilities between Israel and Lebanese Hezbollah, supported by Iran, could also impact sanctions. A major conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, supported by Iran, could lead to additional sanctions against Iran by the United States and its partners."
