    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges that local educational agencies are facing rapid increases in energy costs due to approved rate hikes by the Public Utilities Commission. These agencies, including school districts and community college districts, are limited in their ability to raise local tax revenues to cover operational cost increases, forcing them to use state and local funds designated for educational programs to hire attorneys and experts for Public Utilities Commission proceedings. The Public Utilities Commission's Intervenor Compensation Program aims to assist individuals and groups representing residential or small commercial electric utility customers in bringing their concerns to the commission. County offices of education are designated as appropriate intervenors in proceedings affecting local educational agencies. Section 1802 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to define \"compensation\" as payment for advocate's fees, expert witness fees, and other costs in proceedings. \"Customer\" is defined as a participant representing consumers of utility corporations under the commission's jurisdiction. (A) A representative authorized by a customer or organization to advocate for residential or small commercial customers in utility matters. (B) Exemptions for county offices of education or community college districts to participate in commission proceedings regarding gas or electricity rates on behalf of local educational agencies. In a commission proceeding, a representative of a consortium of public school districts must not have a financial interest in the resolution within two years before filing comments. \"Customer\" excludes government agencies and entities formed by local governments for commission participation. Expert witness fees are costs incurred by a customer for an expert witness. In a commission proceeding, a party is any interested party, respondent public utility, or commission staff. Other reasonable costs are out-of-pocket expenses directly related to customer contentions resulting in a substantial contribution. (g) \u201cSignificant financial hardship\u201d means the inability to afford costs of effective participation, including advocate\u2019s fees and expert witness fees. For groups or organizations, it means the economic interest of members is small compared to participation costs. (h) \u201cSmall commercial customer\u201d refers to a nonresidential customer with a peak demand below 50 kilowatts. The commission may adjust this definition to encourage small business participation without including large commercial and industrial customers. The commission may award compensation for advocate's fees, expert fees, and other costs if the customer's participation substantially contributes to the decision, even if only part of their recommendations are adopted."
