    "content": "The \"Improved Passenger Automobile Fuel Economy Act of 2007\" establishes a 40 MPG standard by 2017 for passenger automobiles. It includes provisions for Cafe standards, fuel economy standard credits, authorization of appropriations, and market-based initiatives for greenhouse gas reduction. The \"Improved Passenger Automobile Fuel Economy Act of 2007\" sets a 40 MPG standard by 2017 for passenger automobiles, with provisions for Cafe standards, fuel economy standard credits, and market-based initiatives for greenhouse gas reduction. Section 32902 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to require the Secretary of Transportation to prescribe average fuel economy standards for passenger automobiles before each model year. The Secretary must ensure that the fuel economy standard for model year 2017 is at least 40 miles per gallon. If multiple manufacturers are unable to meet this standard, the Secretary will notify the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. The Secretary has the authority to prescribe fuel economy standards for automobiles based on vehicle attributes and express them mathematically. Amendments to make standards more stringent must be issued at least 18 months in advance. The Secretary must prescribe any amendment to fuel economy standards at least 18 months before the model year it applies to. The standard cannot be a uniform percentage increase from previous performance. Amendments also include considerations for motor vehicle safety and emissions, as well as reducing dependence on oil for transportation. Before finalizing a standard or exemption, the Secretary of Transportation must notify the Secretary of Energy and the EPA Administrator for their input. The Secretary of Transportation is also prohibited from setting fuel economy standards that have higher costs than benefits. Additionally, the criteria for exemptions have been revised to require the manufacturer requesting the exemption to transfer something instead of just resulting in reduced outcomes. The amendment involves changes to the wording of certain sections in title 49 of the United States Code, specifically regarding exemptions and conforming amendments. The amendments in title 49 of the United States Code involve changes to specific sections, including modifications to subsections and the timing of filing petitions. SEC. 102. FUEL ECONOMY STANDARD CREDITS. Amendment to Section 32903 of title 49, United States Code allows credits to be applied to 3 model years following the year earned or transferred to a registry. Manufacturers can use greenhouse gas credits purchased through a registry for model years after 2010 to meet CAFE standards. Manufacturers can use credits purchased through a registry to offset up to 10 percent of the fuel economy standard for any model year. SEC. 103 authorizes appropriations to the Secretary of Transportation for implementing the title and chapter 329 of title 49, United States Code. SEC. 104 specifies the effective date. The title and amendments take effect upon enactment of the Act, with a transition period for passenger automobile standards until a new standard is issued. The Secretary of Transportation must initiate rulemaking within 60 days of enactment. Transportation will start a rulemaking process for passenger automobiles under section 32902(b) of title 49, United States Code. Until a final rule is issued, the Secretary will amend the fuel economy standard for passenger automobiles in model years not covered by the new rule. TITLE II--MARKET-BASED INITIATIVES FOR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION\n\nSEC. 201. MARKET-BASED INITIATIVES. Establishment of a national registry system for greenhouse gas trading among industries is voluntary. Entities in the US can register emission results, including those generated outside the US, to encourage actions to reduce emissions and increase energy efficiency. The purposes include improving fuel economy and reducing reliance on petroleum in US markets. The national registry system aims to reduce reliance on foreign petroleum for vehicular fuel, facilitate emissions trading among partnerships, promote voluntary and mandatory reductions, recruit more participants, and help establish emissions baselines. The registry will provide referrals for advice on emissions reduction. The national registry system aims to reduce reliance on foreign petroleum for vehicular fuel, facilitate emissions trading, promote reductions, recruit participants, and establish emissions baselines. It provides referrals for designing programs, setting reduction goals, adopting a uniform reporting format, and maintaining emission records. The national registry system encourages organizations to monitor emissions, establish baselines, and set reduction targets. It also promotes public awareness by recognizing participants who commit to these actions and report on their progress. The registry allows for the transfer of ownership of any reductions achieved. The national registry system allows for the transfer of ownership of emission reductions achieved under the program. Any reductions obtained will be credited towards future mandatory greenhouse gas reduction requirements. The final approval of credits will be determined by the responsible agency, with an appeals process established by the Secretary of Commerce. The Secretary of Transportation will handle CAFE Standards Credits. The Secretary of Transportation will determine the equivalency of CAFE Standards Credits earned under section 32903 of title 49, United States Code, for inclusion in the registry. An appeals process will be established for resolving disputes. SEC. 202. IMPLEMENTING PANEL. Establishment of an implementing panel within the Department of Commerce, consisting of the Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Transportation, and experts from various agencies in the field of greenhouse gas emissions reduction. The panel may enlist experts and consultants for greenhouse gas reduction and trading. They are responsible for implementing standards for certification and measurement of greenhouse gas emissions. The panel will maintain a list of certified registries and issue rulemakings on standards for measuring greenhouse gas emissions and reductions. Certification and operation standards will ensure registries have no conflicts of interest. The panel will establish standards for certified registries, including prohibiting ownership of emission reductions and receiving commissions. They will also set criteria for registries to enter agreements with for-profit traders and ensure accurate measurement, verification, and recording of emissions."
