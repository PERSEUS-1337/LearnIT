    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature aims to prevent mandatory overtime for psychiatric technicians and assistants in state health care facilities. This includes avoiding on-the-spot overtime and prohibiting the use of mandatory overtime as a scheduling tool due to management failures. A new section, 19851.4, is added to the Government Code to address this issue. Section 19851.4 of the Government Code defines \"emergency situation\" as unforeseeable events like declared emergencies, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, disease outbreaks, or emergencies requiring outside agency assistance. (2) \"Facility\" refers to any health services facility operated by specific state departments where a PT or PTA works as a state employee.\n(3) \"Management or supervisor\" includes individuals responsible for staffing needs at the facility.\n(4) \"On call or on standby\" refers to alternative staff compensated for availability or willing to come to the facility on short notice. A facility shall not require a PT or PTA to work beyond their scheduled hours. They may volunteer for extra hours, but refusal should not result in discrimination or patient neglect. Management should prioritize staffing needs to avoid mandatory overtime. Employees are prioritized for extra work hours based on volunteering, part-time status, or on-call status. Exceptions include participation in surgical procedures and catastrophic events with insufficient staff. The section outlines that catastrophic events are unanticipated and nonrecurring, and facilities can hire part-time or intermittent employees without affecting their duties or preventing them from providing more protections against mandatory overtime."
