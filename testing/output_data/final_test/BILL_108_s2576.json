    "content": "The Act titled \"Health Care Reform Expedited Procedures Act of 2004\" allows for the expedited consideration of health care reform legislation in the Senate. The \"Health Care Reform Expedited Procedures Act of 2004\" mandates the introduction of universal health care bills by key Senate members within 30 days of a new Congress session. If they fail to do so, the minority party can introduce a qualified bill instead. The expedited procedure for qualifying bills requires the title to focus on reforming the US system and providing insurance for all Americans. The bill must aim to cover 95% of Americans within 10 years, with final approval by the Senate Budget Committee Chair. The bill introduced by the Chair of the Senate Committee on Finance and the bill introduced by the Chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions will be referred to their respective committees. If a committee has not reported the bill within 60 calendar days, it will be automatically discharged and placed on the chamber's legislative calendar. Leader bills introduced by the Senate Majority Leader and Senate Minority Leader are placed directly on the Senate Calendar of Business. A motion to proceed to the consideration of any qualified bill can be made by any Member after consultation with the Majority Leader, with notice given beforehand. The motion to proceed to a qualified bill can be made even if previously rejected, with a limit of 3 motions per congressional session. The motion is privileged, nondebatable, not amendable, and not subject to postponement. It is not debatable and not subject to reconsideration or other business. If adopted, the motion allows for the consideration of the qualified bill. If the motion to proceed is adopted, the chamber shall immediately consider a qualified bill without any other business. The bill remains unfinished business until disposed of, and only relevant amendments are allowed. SEC. 3. HOUSE CONSIDERATION OF HEALTH CARE REFORM LEGISLATION.
