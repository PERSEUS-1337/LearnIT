SEC. 4. Use of patented or proprietary items to further state strategic highway safety plans. Section 112 of title 23, United States Code, is amended to allow the use of Federal funds for patented or proprietary items in State strategic highway safety plans if certain criteria are met. The amendment to Section 112 of title 23, United States Code, allows the use of Federal funds for patented or proprietary items in State strategic highway safety plans, provided that these items are clearly identified in bid documents and available in sufficient quantity for the project. This authority is in addition to existing regulations and cannot be reduced by the Secretary. The Secretary of Transportation must set a minimum retroreflectivity standard for pavement markings by October 1, 2010, applying to all public roads. Additionally, there is a Highway Safety Improvement Program. The amendment to title 23, United States Code, includes the installation, replacement, and upgrade of highway signs and pavement markings to meet performance standards and regulations. Additionally, a new paragraph is added to maintain minimum levels of retroreflectivity. The term 'project to maintain minimum levels of retroreflectivity' refers to projects ensuring highway sign and pavement marking retroreflectivity meets prescribed levels. Amendments to 23 U.S.C. 148(d)(1) include projects on public roads to maintain retroreflectivity levels. The project involves maintaining minimum levels of retroreflectivity for highway signs and pavement markings, as specified in the State strategic highway safety plan. Amendments to 23 U.S.C. 120(c)(1) now include this requirement. SEC. 7. ROADWAY SAFETY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM FOR OLDER DRIVERS AND PEDESTRIANS. The Secretary of Transportation will implement a program to enhance traffic signs and pavement markings nationwide, following guidelines for older drivers and pedestrians. Funds will be allocated to states based on a formula share, with the federal government covering a portion of project costs. The Federal government will provide $90,000,000 annually from 2010 to 2014 for a project under section 120 of title 23, United States Code. The funds will be available for obligation in the same manner as apportioned funds under title 23. SEC. 8. RAIL-HIGHWAY GRADE CROSSINGS. State surveys and schedules of railway-highway grade crossings must be made available to the public online. $220 million is authorized for fiscal years 2010 through 2014 to carry out this section of the United States Code.

SEC. 9. REVIEW OF SAFETY OF RAIL-HIGHWAY GRADE CROSSINGS. The Secretary of Transportation will conduct a comprehensive review of highway-rail grade crossings in the US, assessing safety conditions, traffic, accidents, and safety improvements. A priority list of the 10 crossings in each state needing safety improvements will be submitted to Congress. The Secretary will update a comprehensive review of highway-rail grade crossings every 4 years and make priority lists available to the public online. Data collected will be included in a national database on crossing safety. Any information compiled for safety enhancement purposes related to potential accident sites or railway-highway crossings under this section is protected from being used in court proceedings or for damages claims. SEC. 10. RAIL-HIGHWAY GRADE CROSSING SAFETY. The Secretary of Transportation is required to establish a national database of information on the safety of highway-rail grade crossings in the United States, including accident and incident reports filed with the Federal Railroad Administration. SEC. 11. RURAL STATE INITIATIVE. The Secretary of Transportation allocates $20 million annually to rural states with low population density for projects not in urbanized areas. This funding is not considered an apportionment or specific program under title 23, United States Code. The Federal share of project costs is determined by section 120 of title 23. Authorization of appropriations is provided for in section 120 of title 23, United States Code. Funds necessary for fiscal years 2010 through 2014 can be allocated from the Highway Trust Fund.
