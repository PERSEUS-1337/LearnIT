    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Amateur Radio Parity Act of 2016\" and includes findings. Congress finds that there are over 730,000 licensed radio amateurs in the US who engage in amateur radio activities, providing a platform for technical self-training and emergency communications. There is a federal interest in ensuring the effective performance of amateur stations, which are often hindered by unreasonable land use restrictions. The FCC has prohibited State and local regulations that hinder amateur service communications. They require States and localities to allow the erection of station antenna structures for this purpose. The FCC has looked to Congress for guidance on applying their preemption policy to private land use restrictions. Aesthetic and common property concerns are also taken into account. In private land use regulations for deed-restricted communities, separate Federal policy is needed for amateur radio facilities. Community associations should fairly enforce regulations while allowing for installation and maintenance. Effective outdoor amateur radio antennas can be installed and maintained in community associations while respecting aesthetics and physical characteristics. SEC. 3. APPLICATION OF PRIVATE LAND USE RESTRICTIONS TO AMATEUR STATIONS. The Federal Communications Commission must amend its rules to prohibit private land use restrictions that hinder amateur radio communications or the installation of outdoor antennas by licensees. The FCC must amend rules to allow community associations to regulate outdoor antenna installation by amateur radio licensees, including height, location, size, and aesthetic impact. SEC. 4 affirms limited preemption of state and local land use regulation by the FCC regarding amateur service communications. SEC. 5 provides definitions. SEC. 5 defines key terms including \"community association\" and terms related to amateur radio services as per section 97.3 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations. The House of Representatives passed the bill on September 12, 2016. Karen L. Haas is the Clerk."
