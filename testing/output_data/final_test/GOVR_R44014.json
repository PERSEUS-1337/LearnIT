It aims to help consumers under 65 understand and navigate the different health insurance options available to them. The report serves as an introduction to health insurance for individuals under 65, covering the differences in purchasing health care compared to other goods and services. It explains how buying health insurance reduces risks and unpredictability in health care expenses by reimbursing a portion of future expenditures. Purchasing health care is more complex than buying milk due to the unpredictability of expenses and the inability to plan financially. Health insurance reduces risks by reimbursing a portion of future health care expenditures. Purchasing health care is unpredictable compared to buying other items like gowns or milk. Consumers rely more on doctors' opinions for health care decisions. The purchase of health insurance reduces financial risk and unpredictability in healthcare. Consumers pay a monthly premium to the insurer, who may cover some costs depending on the plan. Out-of-pocket expenses vary, but insurance generally lowers these costs. Health insurance helps consumers manage the risk of high healthcare costs by reducing out-of-pocket expenses. Some consumers are mandated to have insurance or face a penalty. Insurance can be obtained through employers or individually, with costs often shared when obtained through an employer. When obtaining health insurance through an employer, the cost is typically shared between the employee and employer. Other groups like labor unions also offer health insurance options. Employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) is easy to obtain without interacting with salespeople. If an employee declines group insurance, they can purchase from another source. Leaving employment may result in losing ESI, but those over 65 are eligible for Medicare. Consumers aged 65 and older are eligible for Medicare, a federal health insurance program. Those terminated from employment without cause may qualify for COBRA to continue their ESI by paying the full cost. Consumers can also explore other federal and state health insurance programs or purchase private insurance. Insurance brokers and agents, including web-based ones, can help consumers navigate health insurance options. Agents work with one insurer, while brokers can work with multiple insurers. Consumers can purchase health insurance policies directly from insurers or from exchanges, which act as marketplaces for different plans. These plans vary in coverage, costs, and special features, and can be bought for individuals, families, or other groupings. Coverage options include self-only, family, self plus one, and self plus children. During open enrollment season, consumers can change health insurance policies. Outside of open season, changes can only be made in case of qualifying life events like marriage, moving to a new state, divorce, or childbirth. Children under 26 can be added to their parent's health insurance plan regardless of their marital status, living situation, or financial dependency. A consumer's health care needs can vary widely, from routine office visits to more serious hospital treatments. Health insurance plans may not cover all possible care, typically only including medically necessary treatments. For example, reconstructive breast surgery after a mastectomy may be covered. Health insurance generally covers reconstructive breast surgery following a mastectomy for medical reasons, but not for cosmetic purposes. Coverage varies among insurers and plans, with differences in services considered medically necessary. Consumers may find variations in coverage for services like routine maternal visits and eating disorder treatments. Consumers choose health insurance plans with varying coverage for eating disorder treatments. Premiums are paid for private health insurance coverage, whether or not healthcare is sought. Consumers purchasing insurance directly or through exchanges pay premiums themselves, while those with employer-sponsored insurance share the cost. Some consumers may qualify for premium tax credits through the exchanges, reducing the cost of the premium. Tax credits reduce the premium cost by returning part of its value as a portion of the consumer's income tax refund. Eligibility depends on health insurance plan type and family income. Cost sharing refers to the consumer's payment for health services covered by the insurance plan, including deductibles, coinsurance, and co-payments. Deductibles are the amount consumers must pay out-of-pocket before receiving benefits from the insurance policy. Health insurance plans require consumers to meet deductibles before coverage kicks in. Preventive services are exempt from deductibles. Coinsurance is a percentage of the total bill paid by the consumer. If the deductible is not met, the consumer must pay the full bill. Alternatively, a flat-rate co-payment can be made. The consumer may pay a flat-rate co-payment for services once the deductible is met. A maximum out-of-pocket limit sets a cap on consumer spending, after which the insurer covers all costs. Premium tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies may be available for eligible consumers. Premium tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies reduce costs for covered services. Eligibility depends on health insurance plan type and family income. Benefits of three health insurance policies are compared. Plans include ESI, individual insurance, and exchange-purchased insurance. Subsidies and credits are only available for exchange-purchased plans. ESI allows employers to contribute to premiums. Some health insurance plans offer premium tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies. Consumers must choose providers from their plan's network to reduce cost-sharing obligations. In-network providers agree to lower prices, benefiting both insurers and patients. Health insurance plans with networks offer lower cost-sharing for in-network providers, while out-of-network visits may result in the consumer owing 100% of the provider's bill. Indemnity insurance allows consumers to choose any provider without a network, with cost-sharing specified by the insurance plan. Indemnity insurance plans have higher premiums and cost sharing compared to other types, offering flexibility in provider choice. HMOs require in-network providers for lower cost-sharing levels, with referrals needed for specialist visits. HMO insurance features lower premiums and cost sharing than other plans. Preferred provider organizations (PPOs) offer intermediate consumer flexibility in provider choice within a network. Insured individuals can select their primary care providers and see specialists without referrals. PPOs cover out-of-network care but with higher cost sharing. Premiums and cost sharing in PPOs are moderate compared to other plan types due to provider restrictions and cost control measures by the insurer. Consumers may have mixed feelings about networks in health insurance plans, as they offer lower out-of-pocket expenses but may limit provider choices. Some may need to change providers or pay more for out-of-network care. Specialized plan types like consumer-directed health care (CDHC) and value-based insurance design (VBID) aim to reduce individual health spending by making consumers more cost-conscious. Consumer-directed health care (CDHC) aims to increase consumer awareness of health care costs and reduce out-of-pocket spending by incentivizing informed decision-making. This includes price transparency and high-deductible health plans (HDHPs) where consumers are encouraged to be cost-conscious until meeting their deductible. Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) may also be utilized for unreimbursed medical expenses. Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) are tax-preferred savings accounts used for unreimbursed medical expenses. They encourage saving for healthcare in retirement and incentivize consumers to be more active in their care. Value-Based Insurance Design (VBID) adjusts cost sharing based on the clinical benefits of healthcare services. Value-Based Insurance Design (VBID) aims to lower costs for consumers with predictable, high clinical benefit healthcare needs. For example, diabetic consumers who require expensive long-lasting insulin may benefit from lower cost sharing on this essential drug. By reducing the financial burden, VBID encourages adherence to prescribed treatments. Comparing health insurance plans based on premiums alone may not capture the potential cost savings and improved health outcomes offered by VBID. When comparing health insurance plans, it is important to consider factors beyond just premiums. Cost sharing, covered services, network composition, and actuarial values play a significant role in determining plan benefits. Actuarial values provide a better measure of plan comparability than premiums alone, as they reflect the plan's benefit generosity based on a standard population and set of covered services. Comparing actuarial values can help identify plans that offer more comprehensive benefits despite potentially higher premiums. When comparing health insurance plans, it is important to consider factors beyond just premiums. Actuarial values provide a better measure of plan comparability than premiums alone, reflecting the plan's benefit generosity based on a standard population and set of covered services. Consumers should also consider the number of individuals the plan will cover and the choice of healthcare providers. When comparing health insurance plans, consumers need to investigate the network status of providers to ensure coverage. They can choose plans with their current providers, pay higher costs for out-of-network providers, or find new in-network providers. Affordability goes beyond premiums and cost sharing, as out-of-pocket costs cannot be known in advance. The consumer faces uncertainty in predicting out-of-pocket costs for healthcare due to unpredictable health needs. While employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) may offer value, it also presents challenges. One of the biggest disadvantages of employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) is the lack of portability for consumers. Changes in employment status can alter access to health plans and providers, and may result in the loss of ESI coverage. Additionally, employers offering ESI may pay lower wages to compensate for health insurance premiums, leading to workers accepting lower wages for benefits they may not use. Determining the right health insurance plan for a consumer is complex, involving predicting healthcare usage and understanding the link between healthcare and employment."
