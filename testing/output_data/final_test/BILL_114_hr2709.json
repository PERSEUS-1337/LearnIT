Congress finds a nationwide shortage of up to 250,000 public health workers by 2020, with similar trends projected for other health professions like nursing, dentistry, pharmacy, mental health, and primary care. This shortage will lead to serious health threats and costly healthcare needs due to delayed responses to various health issues. The health workforce shortage will have a significant impact on vulnerable populations and underserved areas, leading to fewer cancer screenings and delayed treatment. Over 2 million college-educated immigrants in the US are unemployed or underemployed in low-skilled jobs, with 2 out of 5 internationally educated immigrants facing unemployment or underemployment. Underemployment for immigrant women is 28% higher than for men, and their mean annual earnings are affected. According to research, underemployed immigrants earn $32,000 annually, 43% less than US-born college graduates. With support, skilled immigrants can increase their income by 215% to 900%. Immigrants in the health workforce are better educated than US-born workers. The Secretary of Health and Human Services can provide grants through the Bureau of Health Workforce.
