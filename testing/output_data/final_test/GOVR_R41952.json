    "content": "The CRS report provides an overview of U.S. policy on Taiwan, highlighting its significance in security, economic, and political interests. Despite not having diplomatic recognition, Taiwan is recognized by 22 countries including the Vatican. It is considered a model democracy with free elections and is a major recipient of U.S. arms sales. Taiwan is also a significant trading partner and export market for the United States. Taiwan is the 7th largest export market for U.S. agricultural products and ranks 20th in sending visitors to the United States. The U.S. has actively supported Taiwan's economic development, political liberalization, and self-defense against military threats from China. U.S. policy aims to maintain peace, stability, and the status quo in the Taiwan Strait, as well as support democracy and human rights in Taiwan. The U.S. is concerned about tensions across the Taiwan Strait and their impact on international security, the U.S.-Taiwan relationship, and U.S.-China cooperation. The U.S. has supported Taiwan's economic development, political liberalization, and self-defense against China. The cross-strait relationship has grown closer since the 1980s, with increased economic engagement reducing tension. U.S. support for Taiwan poses challenges to U.S.-China cooperation, as Washington balances relations with both Taipei and Beijing. Maintaining the relationship with Taipei is a key policy issue, separate from its relationship with Beijing. Taiwan has concerns about Beijing's cooperation with Washington and its impact on Taiwan's interests. Despite seeking a cooperative relationship with China, the U.S. respects Taiwan's sovereignty and democracy. After Ma Ying-jeou became president in 2008, dialogue across the Taiwan Strait resumed, following a decade-long suspension. The resumption of cross-strait dialogue under President Ma Ying-jeou led to closer economic engagement between Taiwan and the PRC, reducing tension and creating opportunities for the U.S. to strengthen its relationship with Taiwan and seek cooperation from Beijing. President Ma sought U.S. support, including arms sales, to sustain cross-strait talks. Views differ on whether the U.S. and Taiwan should focus on their relationship to pursue U.S. interests or leverage cross-strait engagement for improved ties with China while pursuing Taiwan's own interests. Washington and Taipei have increased efforts in this regard. On October 4, 2011, the House Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing on \"Why Taiwan Matters.\" Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Kurt Campbell testified about the importance of building a comprehensive, durable, and unofficial relationship between the United States and Taiwan, emphasizing the security relationship as a critical aspect. He highlighted the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) as a significant legislative act in U.S. history. Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell emphasized the importance of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) in U.S. policy on Taiwan, highlighting the need for the U.S. to maintain the capacity to resist coercion and provide defense articles to Taiwan. He also stressed the role of Congress in strengthening U.S.-Taiwan cooperation and ensuring Taiwan's self-defense capability. The Administration is urged to support Taiwan in playing a helpful role in maritime disputes and international organizations. Policy should allow for increased communication and visits between U.S. and Taiwan officials while promoting democracy and freedom in Taiwan. The United States should encourage Taiwan to contribute more in international security areas such as weapons nonproliferation and counter-piracy. There is a need to review Taiwan's role in the U.S. strategy for rebalancing priorities towards the Asia-Pacific region. Additionally, U.S. officials should work on reducing trade and investment barriers to enhance bilateral commercial ties with Taiwan. Taiwan's restrictions on U.S. beef have been resolved, but issues remain with U.S. pork. The United States may consider negotiating a free trade agreement or supporting Taiwan's participation in regional trade agreements. Concerns arise over Taiwan's economic dependence on China, prompting the need for diversification of economic partners. Taiwan, also known as the Republic of China, does not recognize the People's Republic of China's claims. Since 1949, the ROC has governed only Taiwan, while the PRC rules mainland China. Taiwan, previously called Formosa, has never been ruled by the CPC or as part of the PRC. The ROC and PRC do not recognize each other, with the ROC referring to the mainland as the \"mainland.\" Taiwan has tried to set aside the sovereignty dispute, while the PRC seeks unification with Taiwan as \"one China.\" The ROC's claim over Formosa from Japan was established upon Japan's surrender in 1945. The KMT forces led by Chiang Kai-shek retreated to Taiwan in 1949, leading to social, ethnic, and political issues among Taiwan's people. Two major groups emerged - the \"Taiwanese\" and the \"Mainlanders.\" The KMT imposed authoritarian rule and martial law on Taiwan, leading to the \"228 Incident\" in 1947. In 2014, Taiwan's Ministry of Culture announced the release of political prisoners from the \"White Terror\" period. The United States recognized the ROC until 1978, then shifted to recognize the PRC under the \"one China\" policy. In the 1970s, the U.S. shifted its policy towards China and Taiwan due to various factors, including the Vietnam War and the Sino-Soviet dispute. The previous policy of recognizing Taiwan as the government of mainland China was unsustainable, as both Taiwan and China claimed to be the rightful authority for all of China. The United States has its own \"one China\" policy and position on Taiwan's status, not recognizing the PRC's claim over Taiwan. Since 1950, the US has supported a peaceful determination of Taiwan's status. The US did not take a stance on Taiwan's sovereignty in the U.S.-PRC Joint Communiqu\u00e9s of 1972, 1979, and 1982, acknowledging both sides of the Taiwan Strait. The US has not promised to end arms sales to Taiwan for self-defense, despite the termination of the Mutual Defense Treaty in 1979. US policy remains neutral on Taiwan's independence. The United States maintains a neutral stance on Taiwan's independence, leaving the resolution of the Taiwan question to be decided by the people on both sides of the strait. Despite not having official diplomatic relations, the U.S. engages with Taiwan through unofficial channels, including arms sales. The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 governs U.S. policy towards Taiwan in the absence of a formal relationship or defense treaty. The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 governs U.S. policy towards Taiwan, emphasizing peaceful means for determining Taiwan's future, providing defensive arms, and maintaining the capacity to resist coercion. It also establishes the American Institute in Taiwan for day-to-day cooperation. The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 guides U.S. policy towards Taiwan, emphasizing peaceful means for determining Taiwan's future and providing defensive arms. President Reagan's \"Six Assurances\" in 1982 further solidified U.S. support for Taiwan by outlining key commitments in negotiations with China. The relationship between the United States and Taiwan has evolved with Taiwan's democratization and shared values about freedom. Taiwan's political liberalization from an authoritarian dictatorship to a dynamic democracy has allowed for greater public participation in determining Taiwan's identity. The formation of Taiwan's second major party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which leans towards Taiwan's independence, was not cracked down upon by the KMT in 1986. The DPP passed a Resolution on Taiwan's Future in 1999, declaring its stance after the national legislature elections in 1992. After Taiwan's democratization and constitutional reform, it declared itself a democratic and independent country, not part of the PRC. The PRC reacted unfavorably to Taiwan's democratic politics, leading to the Taiwan Strait Crisis of 1995-1996. President Clinton deployed aircraft carriers near Taiwan in response to PLA missile tests. Tensions escalated when President Lee Teng-hui described the cross-strait relationship as \"special state-to-state ties\" in 1999. In 2000, Chen Shui-bian of the DPP won Taiwan's presidential election, marking the first democratic transfer of power from the KMT after 55 years. President Clinton emphasized the need for a peaceful resolution to the Taiwan question with the \"assent\" of Taiwan's people. President Bush opposed any unilateral changes to the \"status quo.\" Representative James Leach highlighted Taiwan's unique situation of de facto self-determination without seeking de jure sovereignty. Taiwan's political ambiguity provides security for its people. Cross-strait tension increased when the PRC accused President Chen of promoting Taiwan's independence through a failed referendum. President Bush showed support by positioning aircraft carriers near Taiwan. The KMT's Ma Ying-jeou's victory in 2008 marked Taiwan's second democratic transfer of power. Taiwan was praised as a model democracy in a Chinese cultural context. The KMT's victory in the 2008 legislative elections solidified their control of the government in Taiwan. The new electoral rules implemented in 2005 favored larger parties and disadvantaged smaller ones. The 2008 legislative elections in Taiwan solidified the KMT's control, with new electoral rules favoring larger parties and disadvantaging smaller ones like the PFP and TSU. The DPP and TSU have a more Taiwan-centric perspective and tensions across the Taiwan Strait impact international security. Congressional oversight focuses on supporting U.S. interests and Taiwan's democracy. Negotiations between Taiwan and the PRC have been conducted through quasi-official organizations since 1992. President Ma of Taiwan aimed to normalize cross-strait ties by establishing a \"cross-strait common market\" and direct air links with the PRC. He emphasized his \"Three Noes\": \"no unification, no independence, and no use of force\" to maintain stability. President Ma of Taiwan announced his \"Three Noes\" to maintain the status quo and avoid sovereignty disputes with the PRC. He called for a diplomatic truce and pledged to stop using dollar diplomacy for diplomatic recognition. President Ma improved cross-strait engagement, building on foundations laid by his predecessor. KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung met with CPC General Secretary Hu Jintao in 2008, leading to reduced tension across the Taiwan Strait. Despite PRC objections to U.S. security assistance to Taiwan, economic integration and engagement between Taiwan and the PRC have intensified. Taipei sees U.S. support as crucial for engaging with Beijing. President Ma of Taiwan prioritized economic talks over political negotiations with the PRC. Taiwan's economic ties with the PRC have deepened, with significant investments and trade partnerships. Multiple rounds of talks and agreements have been signed between Taiwan and the PRC since 2008, including the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) to enhance economic cooperation. President Ma of Taiwan prioritized economic talks over political negotiations with the PRC, leading to the signing of the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) in June 2010. The agreement aimed to lower tariffs and increase access for 539 products and services from Taiwan. This move was met with opposition from the DPP, but Taiwan saw significant benefits such as increased direct flights and a rise in PRC tourists visiting the country. Taiwan saw an increase in direct flights from 370 to 560 a week, with passenger flights expanding to 828 a week in March 2014. PRC visitors accounted for over half of the 8 million visitors to Taiwan in 2013. Negotiations for an investment protection agreement faced challenges, but agreements were reached in August 2012. Additionally, the 19th agreement on trade in services was signed in June 2013. In February 2014, officials from Taiwan and China held their first formal meeting since 1949. Taipei's Mainland Affairs Council Minister met with Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office Director in Nanjing. They agreed to start direct communication but did not sign expected agreements on taxation and industrial cooperation. In 2011, Taiwan and China reached a \"consensus\" on industrial cooperation after failing to reach an agreement between banking regulators. Taiwan signed a memorandum of understanding on currency clearing with China in August 2012. Taiwan faces challenges in protecting its citizens from detentions in China, including secret detentions in \"black jails\". In 2012, a visitor from Taiwan was detained by China's Ministry of State Security for alleged activities associated with Falun Gong. Representative Dana Rohrabacher urged President Ma to speak out strongly. In July, Dana Rohrabacher urged President Ma to speak out against Chung's detention. Later, Chung testified about his interrogations and criticized the Ma Administration's passivity. Taiwan reached a separate \"consensus\" in August on protecting business people, but questions remained about protections for visitors detained by the MSS. Other concerns included Taiwan's enforcement of PRC promises and securing releases. The pace of signing cross-strait agreements between Taiwan and China has slowed since 2008. The 20th and 21st agreements, signed in 2014, were the first to be reviewed for national security impacts by Taiwan. Taiwan questioned the need for bilateral deals on public information that could be issued openly. The agreements were signed by the SEF and ARATS. The quasi-official SEF and ARATS signed agreements despite protests about lack of transparency and consultation. President Ma argued that the agreements would benefit Taiwan's economic liberalization and regional trade involvement. The LY's detailed review of the trade agreement triggered heated debates and protests, leading to the \"Sunflower Movement\" where college students occupied the LY in March 2014. Student leaders from the Black Island-Nation Youth Front protested against the Ma Administration, demanding a rejection of the agreement and suspension of cross-strait negotiations until a law on oversight of agreements with the PRC is passed. Protest escalated when activists broke into the Executive Yuan's office building, leading to riot police clearing the compound of protesters, resulting in injuries to police, protestors, journalists, and a lawmaker. On March 24, the State Department emphasized Taiwan's right to decide on the trade agreement peacefully. The Beijing TAO stated on March 26 that the agreement is mutually beneficial. On March 30, thousands protested against the agreement in front of the Presidential Office. Wang Jin-pyng pledged on April 6 to pass an oversight law before further talks on the agreement. Activists ended their occupation of the Legislative Yuan on April 10 after Wang's promise. The delay in concluding the cross-strait trade agreement could harm Taiwan's effort to join the TPP talks. The US Senior Official for APEC stated that Taiwan's membership in the TPP would depend on areas willing to open up. PRC leader Xi Jinping expressed understanding of Taiwan's people's needs and visited Taiwan in June. The US welcomed reduced tension across the Taiwan Strait due to economic and people-to-people engagement. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State David Shear emphasized the need for U.S. and foreign firms to benefit from the cross-strait agreements, particularly ECFA, which entered into force in September 2010. Concerns were raised about Taiwan not notifying ECFA to the WTO as required. Despite quick negotiations with Beijing, Taipei did not prioritize resolving the beef dispute with Washington. In mid-2011, the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei highlighted these issues. In mid-2011, the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei warned Taiwan about over-reliance on the PRC for exports and urged for balanced relationships with other countries, especially the United States for national security. AmCham's survey in 2014 showed mixed opinions on the effect of ECFA on business. Suggestions were made for Taiwan to increase visits to the United States by its Minister of Economic Affairs. Cross-strait flights raised concerns about their impact on U.S. and foreign airlines. In 2012, AmCham expressed concerns about Taiwan's shipping links with the PRC excluding foreign carriers. Taiwan has faced challenges in joining multilateral trade talks like the TPP but has signed bilateral agreements with New Zealand and Singapore. Questions have been raised about Taiwan's reviews of technology transfers to the PRC. In 2013, Taiwan implemented stricter rules for PRC investments threatening security. Concerns persist about PLA challenges to Taiwan despite cross-strait engagement. Taiwan's reviews of technology transfers to the PRC and national security implications of increasing PRC investments are under scrutiny. Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs is cooperating with the PRC's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. In October 2011, Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense Peter Lavoy expressed U.S. concern about Taiwan's vulnerability to PLA aggression. He emphasized the need for Taiwan to adopt innovative defense strategies. In March 2013, PACOM's Commander testified that cross-strait tensions were low due to economic integration and people-to-people contact. The PLA continued military buildup against Taiwan, contradicting PRC's peaceful development. Developments include ballistic missiles, patrol boats, electronic warfare, and cyber threats. DIA Director testified that PLA's focus remains on conflict with Taiwan and possible U.S. intervention. Defense Secretary reported in June 2014 that PLA's primary mission is contingency in Taiwan Strait. The Pentagon remains focused on potential contingency in the Taiwan Strait despite closer cross-strait ties. The PLA has deployed over 1,000 short-range ballistic missiles across from Taiwan and conducted joint exercises covering amphibious landing operations. However, the PLA Navy lacks the capacity for a large-scale invasion of Taiwan. President Ma's transparency on cross-strait negotiations and agreements is being closely watched. The CPC and KMT have proposed a \"peace agreement\" and military confidence-building measures. Ma's idea of a cross-strait peace accord was raised during his re-election campaign in 2011. Beijing viewed Taiwan's 2012 election results as validation of peaceful development. Beijing may increase pressure on Taiwan in Ma's second term, focusing on political and military aspects. In March 2012, KMT Honorary Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung met with CPC General-Secretary Hu Jintao in Beijing, discussing \"political trust\" and \"one China.\" The DPP criticized the \"one country, two areas\" concept, emphasizing Taiwan's sovereignty. Beijing's TAO Director Wang Yi visited Washington in April, expressing expectations of political talks with Taipei. President Ma did not mention these phrases in his second inaugural address in May 2012. President Ma, in his address on May 20, 2012, reassured Beijing on cross-strait policy but emphasized limits on sovereignty accommodation. He upheld the \"1992 Consensus\" and introduced the concept of \"one ROC, two areas\" defining Taiwan and the mainland. Ma proposed mutual non-recognition of sovereignty and non-denial of governing authority, emphasizing the \"status quo\" of no unification, independence, or the use of force. He also highlighted democracy, human rights, rule of law, and civil society as key principles for the ROC's survival. President Ma emphasized the importance of national security for the ROC's survival, advocating for cross-strait engagement, diplomacy, and defense. He called for continued U.S. arms sales to sustain this engagement and highlighted the need for a strong national defense. Ma referenced the model of West Germany and East Germany in discussing sovereignty and jurisdiction. The CPC TAO responded positively to Ma's \"One ROC, Two Areas\" formulation, seeing it as consistent with previous statements. The CPC TAO responded positively to Ma's \"One ROC, Two Areas\" formulation, emphasizing that both sides of the strait belong to one China. Despite Taiwan's strong Taiwan-centric identity, the people have pursued prosperity, security, and self-governance. Moderate voters support economic ties with the PRC while maintaining political separation. In a June 2014 poll, 59% desired the status quo. In a survey, 18% preferred the status quo with independence later, 6% wanted immediate independence, 9% favored the status quo with unification later, 1.4% called for urgent unification, and 7% had no opinion. Results showed low support for urgent unification, similar to 2008. The CPC called for strengthening cross-strait ties for peaceful reunification at the 18th National Congress in 2012. President Ma emphasized cooperation with Xi Jinping based on the \"1992 Consensus,\" while maintaining differing interpretations of \"one China.\" He aimed to enhance cross-strait ties, particularly in economics and people-to-people relations, by easing restrictions on investments, students, and travelers from the mainland. Ma also proposed establishing reciprocal representative offices between Taiwan and China. President Ma aimed to enhance cross-strait ties by proposing reciprocal representative offices between Taiwan and China, leading to negotiations on various issues such as sovereignty, national flags, legal immunity, and political talks. President Ma proposed reciprocal representative offices between Taiwan and China to enhance cross-strait ties. Talks were delayed as lawmakers hesitated to grant full authority. Taiwan officials mentioned 1,500 citizens detained in the PRC. KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung met with CPC General-Secretary Xi Jinping to maintain engagement, emphasizing ties under the \"one China framework.\" DPP criticized this approach, stating it harms Taiwan's sovereignty. The KMT's use of the \"one China framework\" was criticized for harming Taiwan's sovereignty and complicating efforts for domestic consensus. DPP shifted to discuss the \"1992 Consensus,\" with pressure from Xi Jinping on Ma Ying-jeou to agree to political talks. Ma defended Taiwan's approach in dealing with political issues when the time is right. The Administration and Congress are considering options to strengthen cooperation with Taiwan, despite political constraints on U.S. influence in 2011. Expectations are high for improved relations after the 2012 elections. Both Washington and Taipei view the relationship positively, focusing on economic and security partnerships. Efforts have been made by the U.S. Legislative and Executive Branches to enhance cooperation, including hearings on \"Why Taiwan Matters\" and meetings with Taiwan's presidential candidates. The Administration notified Congress of major arms sales programs to Taiwan worth $5.9 billion, including upgrades for F-16A/B fighters. Senior U.S. officials visited Taiwan in 2011, showing increased engagement. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton emphasized the strong relationship with Taiwan in November 2011. The United States has a strong relationship with Taiwan as an important security and economic partner. In December, Taiwan was nominated for the Visa Waiver Program. The Obama Administration has emphasized engagement with both Beijing and Taipei, raising questions about their objectives and timing of actions. Policy issues include arms sales, strengthening ties before elections, defense investment encouragement, and strategic inclusion of Taiwan. President Ma of Taiwan has actively engaged with the United States, visiting various cities during transit to and from other countries. He emphasized rebuilding trust with the U.S. by avoiding escalating tensions with China. Ma prioritized cooperation with the United States after the political season ended in January 2012. President Ma of Taiwan prioritized cooperation with the United States after the political season ended in January 2012. He faced challenges in resolving disputes over U.S. beef and pork, and expressed Taiwan's interest in joining the TPP in eight years. In 2014, he urged Taiwan to promote liberalization and avoid marginalization in regional economic integration. In 2014, President Ma urged Taiwan to promote liberalization and avoid marginalization in regional economic integration. The U.S. strategy towards the Asia-Pacific raised concerns about Taiwan's security role and contributions. Secretary of State Clinton highlighted Taiwan as an important security and economic partner in a speech in Honolulu. President Obama and Defense Secretary Panetta issued new Defense Strategic Guidance in 2012 to maintain U.S. military superiority and rebalance priorities. In response to budget cuts, the U.S. aimed to rebalance priorities towards Asia and the Middle East. Defense Secretary Panetta expressed support for Taiwan's engagement and peace across the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan's Deputy Defense Minister discussed Taiwan's role in the strategy with U.S. officials. Assistant Secretary of State Fernandez visited Taipei to discuss economic affairs. In August 2012, Business Affairs Jose Fernandez visited Taipei and discussed economic exchanges with Taiwan in the context of the U.S. rebalance to the region. TIFA talks resumed in March 2013 after years of seeking to resume trade talks, with support for a bilateral investment agreement (BIA) from key members of Congress. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kin Moy expressed optimism about U.S.-Taiwan cooperation and mentioned a potential BIA in October. Taiwan is seen as a close partner for trade negotiations and other substantive interactions. In late October, Taiwan's executives visited Washington, DC for President Obama's Select USA Investment Summit. Former vice president Vincent Siew sought U.S. support for Taiwan to join the TPP and led a delegation to discuss trade and investment with Members of Congress and U.S. private industry. Chairman Royce expressed concern about the lack of arms sales for Taiwan's self-defense to meet the spirit of the TRA. Members took actions to reaffirm the TRA. Members of Congress took actions to reaffirm the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), including attending a congressional reception and holding a hearing on the TRA. Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Russel did not clearly reaffirm the Six Assurances during the hearing but later clarified the Administration's commitment to them. The House passed H.R. 3470, authorizing the transfer of U.S. Navy frigates to Taiwan. Additionally, 52 Senators sent a letter to President Obama in support of Taiwan. On April 9, 52 Senators, led by Senators Menendez and Inhofe, sent a letter to President Obama to mark the TRA and note Taiwan's aspiration for economic integration, such as joining the TPP talks. Cabinet-rank officials visited Taiwan in 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, and 2000. In December 2013, the Administrator of the EPA, Gina McCarthy, postponed her visit to Taipei but visited Taiwan on April 13-15, 2014, after 14 years. Representative Ed Royce led 29 Members to send a letter on September 23, 2014, calling for expanding engagement with Taiwan. The State Department acknowledged the United States' ties with Taiwan under the TRA, dropping the insistence that cooperation is \"unofficial.\" They cited the \"one China\" policy based on the U.S.-PRC Joint Communiques and the TRA. In November, Kurt Tong visited Taiwan and welcomed their interest in joining the TPP in the future, urging Taiwan to improve competitiveness through liberalization. Taiwan has the option to increase defense and foreign aid spending, counter cyber threats, and improve counter-espionage. Taiwan could expand military or civilian missions in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. Taiwan has been a significant donor in international disasters, such as Haiti's earthquake and Japan's tsunami. President Ma led Taiwan to donate $224 million in aid after Japan's disasters. In 2011, Taiwan donated $224 million in aid, with $25 million from the government. Despite not providing military and coast guard assistance to Japan, Taiwan's foreign aid totaled $380 million in 2010 and 2011, accounting for 0.1% of gross national income. President Ma highlighted Taiwan's role as an aid donor in 2012 but promised to maintain the aid budget. However, in 2013, Taiwan's foreign aid dropped by almost 20% to about $366 million. After a typhoon in the Philippines in 2013, Taiwan donated $200,000 and provided aid using Air Force and Navy resources. Taiwan also supported refugees in Jordan and Iraq starting in 2013. In 2013, Taiwan provided shelters and supplies for refugees in Jordan and Iraq to support efforts against ISIL. In 2014, Taiwan donated protective clothing, scanners, and cash for Ebola treatment in Africa. The U.S. gained counterterrorism cooperation through Taiwan's agreements in 2005 and 2006. Radiation detection equipment was installed at Kaohsiung port in 2011. In December 2011, Deputy Secretary of Energy Poneman praised Taiwan's efforts in strengthening nuclear security at ports with the U.S. NNSA. Taiwan has cooperated with the U.S. in nonproliferation efforts, including concerns about Iran and North Korea. In March 2009, a Taiwanese company reportedly ordered pressure gauges for uranium enrichment in Iran. In July 2010, Taiwan raided a company receiving orders for North Korea. In August 2012, the United States asked a Taiwan shipping company not to transfer suspected weapons-related cargo in Malaysia that North Korea shipped via China to Burma. Japan seized the cargo. In October 2012, a U.S. court sentenced a Taiwan woman to two years in prison for procuring embargoed technology for Iran. In May 2013, two citizens of Taiwan were arrested for exporting U.S.-origin goods and machinery that could be used by North Korea to produce weapons. In June 2008, Alex Tsai was indicted in Taiwan for illegally shipping restricted materials to North Korea. In January 2009, the Department of the Treasury designated Tsai and his companies for supporting North Korean weapons proliferation. Sanctions were imposed on Taiwan's Trans Multi Mechanics Company and its general manager for procuring dual-use machinery for North Korea. The United States enacted the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act (CISADA) in 2010, following U.N. Security Council Resolution 1929 against Iran's nuclear program. Taiwan is expected to comply with U.S. sanctions on Iran for nuclear proliferation. Taiwan has not announced its own sanctions against dealings with Iran's oil and gas industry, but has cut some imports of Iran's crude oil. Taiwan and six other countries reduced crude oil imports from Iran and were exempt from sanctions for 180 days. On December 7, 2012, Taiwan's financial institutions were exempted from NDAA sanctions for 180 days due to reduced oil imports from Iran. In 2013, major Taiwan shipping companies stopped dealing with Iran, but Dragon Aromatics petrochemical company in Taiwan bought Iranian condensate from a sanctioned Chinese company. After negotiations with Iran to restrict its nuclear program, the Chinese company started new negotiations with Iran in December 2013. Zhuhai Zhenrong started negotiations with Iran for a new condensate contract to increase oil imports for the Dragon Aromatics petrochemical plant in Fujian province, China. Taiwan increased crude oil imports from Iran in 2013, becoming the seventh-largest source. In December 2013, the US and Taiwan signed a new civil nuclear energy cooperation agreement to replace the expiring 1972 agreement. President Obama transmitted a proposed agreement on peaceful uses of nuclear energy with Taiwan to Congress in January 2014. The agreement aimed to advance U.S. interests in nonproliferation and foreign policy, citing Taiwan's adherence to nonproliferation standards and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Consultations with the Senate and House committees were set to begin for review under Section 123b and 123d. Taiwan's counter-piracy security measures and involvement in a NATO anti-piracy operation resulted in the death of a fishing boat captain. The U.S. Navy intercepted a Taiwan-flagged fishing boat used as a pirate mother-ship, leading to the surrender of pirates and the discovery of the captain's body. The U.S. Navy accidentally killed Wu, the captain of a Taiwan-flagged fishing boat used by pirates, during a counter-piracy operation. Wu and three pirates died from ammunition fired by the Navy. The Navy buried Wu at sea and sunk the ship to prevent hazards. The U.S. expressed regret and followed rules of engagement. Taiwan protested and demanded $3 million in compensation. Taiwan has been facing political criticism and demands for compensation for the lack of rescue efforts by the government, including the navy, when a fishing ship was captured by Somali pirates. The PLA Navy claimed credit for the release of another ship's crew in 2012, but Taiwan attributed it to ransom and international assistance. Taiwan amended a law in 2013 to allow armed guards on ships and the PLA Navy escorted a cargo ship from Taiwan in 2013. Taiwan asserts itself as the ROC with sovereign claims in maritime disputes in East Asia. The disputes in the South China Sea involve overlapping claims by multiple countries, including the PRC, Philippines, and Vietnam. U.S. concerns involve potential conflict between the PRC and Japan over the Senkaku Islands. Taiwan also asserts claims in the East China Sea. Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell discussed U.S. concerns with Taiwan about working with the PRC in the South China Sea. Taipei's officials have insisted on no cooperation with the PRC, adding pressure against Japan, a U.S. ally. Concerns arose over actions by the PRC and Taiwan that militarized or escalated tensions. President Ma proposed the \"East China Sea Peace Initiative\" to address tensions peacefully and called for parallel bilateral talks that could lead to trilateral discussions. Taiwan claims various islands in the South China Sea, including Itu Aba. Taiwan has stationed coast guard personnel on Itu Aba since 2000, with military support. Taiwan conducted a live-fire drill on the island in 2013 and announced a budget for infrastructure development in 2014-2016. The PRC's nine-dash line in the South China Sea is based on ROC's maps from the 1940s. Taiwan's deployment of Coast Guard ships and military assets in the South China Sea raised tensions with Japan, leading to a confrontation near the Senkaku Islands. Taiwan's actions were seen as contradictory to international law, as it maintained a controversial border line on its maps. The military deployed various ships and aircraft for Taiwan's self-defense against the PRC. President Ma praised the actions near the islands and criticized Japan for holding them for 117 years. Congress passed a bill expressing the need for self-restraint in the East China Sea disputes. The United States emphasized self-restraint in activities that could escalate disputes in the region, acknowledged Japan's administration of the Senkaku Islands, and reaffirmed its commitment to Japan under the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security. Taiwan sent Coast Guard ships to the islands, prompting a response from Japan's Coast Guard. Taiwan and Japan signed a bilateral agreement in April 2013 to define expanded joint fishing rights near the Senkaku Islands, following 16 rounds of negotiations since 1996. The agreement did not address territorial sea boundaries but established a commission for resolving disputes. President Ma credited his \"East China Sea Peace Initiative\" for the agreement with Japan over joint fishing rights near the Senkaku Islands. The opposition DPP Chairman Su Tseng-Chang praised the agreement, while AIT Chairman Ray Burghardt and Secretary of State John Kerry also commended the handling of the agreement. Japan was concerned about Taiwan-PRC unity, and Taiwan faced tensions with the Philippines after a Taiwan fishing boat was shot at, resulting in the death of a fisherman. Taiwan faced tensions with the Philippines after a Taiwan fishing boat was shot at, resulting in the death of a fisherman. Taiwan's initial diplomatic reaction called for an investigation and arrests, while the PRC quickly condemned the act. President Ma also faced low approval ratings and a bid for re-election as the KMT Chairman. The State Department reacted calmly by welcoming the Philippines' pledge to hold a full investigation and urging all sides to ensure maritime safety.

The Philippines expressed sorrow but Taiwan insisted on a formal government-to-government apology. Taiwan increased Coast Guard patrols in response. Taiwan increased Coast Guard patrols and deployed Navy frigates to protect fishermen after demanding an official apology from the Philippines for the death of a fisherman. The State Department expressed regret for the incident and urged all parties to avoid provocative actions. Taiwan legislators supported President Ma's demands, and there were concerns about potential violence targeting Filipinos in Taiwan. President Ma held a National Security Council meeting and stated that the Philippines had not met his demands by the deadline. Taiwan implemented three sanctions after the Philippines failed to meet demands by the deadline. An investigation found 45 bullet holes in the fisherman's boat, indicating deliberate killing. President Aquino sent a representative to apologize. Taiwan announced 8 more sanctions, including suspensions of travel and military drills. The State Department expressed concern over tensions between the two countries. Taipei rejected Manila's apology as not formal and insincere. Taiwan proceeded with Navy and Air Force exercises, sending various military assets. President Ma declared the shooting as \"cold-blooded murder.\" PRC media used the tension to condemn the Philippines and called for cross-strait actions. Hackers from Taiwan and the Philippines exchanged cyber disruptions of government websites. Taiwan and the Philippines exchanged cyber disruptions of government websites. Taiwan's officials called for calm treatment of Filipinos in Taiwan amidst sanctions targeting Filipino workers. Both countries agreed to conduct \"parallel investigations\" after the Philippines rejected a \"joint investigation.\" Issues discussed included the incident's location and charges against Coast Guard officers. President Ma participated in a military war game focusing on crisis-management in the East and South China Seas. He announced increased patrols in the South China Sea and emphasized protecting fishermen as a major mission. Taiwan and the Philippines held talks on a fisheries agreement, agreeing to avoid the use of force in patrols. In 2005, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed to promote cooperation in agriculture and fisheries. The Philippines and Taiwan reached an agreement to promote cooperation in agriculture and fisheries, with measures to prevent poaching. Following an investigation, charges of homicide and obstruction of justice were recommended against Coast Guard officers. Taiwan also charged the officers with homicide. The Philippines apologized and offered compensation to the fisherman's family, leading Taiwan to lift sanctions. The Senate passed a resolution supporting diplomatic dispute resolution in the Asia-Pacific region. The text emphasizes the need for nations to resolve disputes in the Asia-Pacific maritime domains diplomatically and without the use of force. It mentions Taiwan's membership in international organizations like the Asian Development Bank and the WTO, as well as its efforts to seek \"international space\" despite constraints from China. Taiwan has been a full member of the APEC forum but has faced obstacles in attending summits due to China's opposition. PRC blocks Taiwan's international participation. Gambia ends recognition of ROC, surprising Ma Administration. PRC denies prior contact with Gambia. Clinton Administration's Taiwan Policy Review supports Taiwan's membership in organizations. Congressional focus on Taiwan's participation in WHO and WHA meetings. President Bush signed a law in 2004 supporting Taiwan's observer status in the WHO.

After President Ma Ying-jeou took office in 2008, Taiwan was included in the WHO's International Health Regulations in 2009. Taiwan's Minister of Health participated as an observer at the WHA in 2009, but concerns arose about the invitation requiring approval from China. The State Department reported that Taiwan was invited to the WHA in 2009 after China agreed to its participation. Additionally, a secret WHO Memorandum revealed an arrangement with China regarding Taiwan's participation. In 2010, it was revealed that the WHO had an arrangement with China regarding Taiwan's participation in the International Health Regulations.

Taiwan's airlines are members of ICAO. Taiwan's airlines (China Airlines, Eva Air, and TransAsia Airways) are members of IATA and seek observer status in ICAO. Taiwan joined CANSO in 2011 to enhance aviation security. President Ma highlighted the high number of flights passing through Taiwan's airspace. Congress has supported Taiwan's observer status in ICAO since 2010. In 2013, Congress passed H.R. 1151 and S. 579 to support Taiwan's observer status at ICAO. President Obama signed the bill into law, and the State Department confirmed U.S. support for Taiwan's participation at ICAO. In 2013, Taiwan was invited as a \"guest\" to the ICAO Assembly in Montreal, Canada, following the support of the U.S. Congress and State Department for Taiwan's participation at ICAO. Taiwan did not become an official \"observer\" at the Assembly, and concerns were raised about ICAO denying direct accreditation to Taiwan's reporters. Taiwan attended the Assembly from September 24 to October 4, with the State Department welcoming the invitation as a result of \"international cooperation.\" Taiwan's development in international cooperation and support from ICAO and its members were highlighted at a Senate hearing. Analysts suggest Taiwan could enhance its international presence by adjusting policies and attracting investments. The Defense Department reports a shift in the balance of forces across the Taiwan Strait in favor of the PRC. The Secretary's report to Congress in March 2009 stated that Taiwan's Air Force no longer had dominance over the airspace. Taiwan has been discussing acquiring submarines since 2001 and has faced challenges in procuring new F-16C/D fighters since 2006. There are concerns about President Obama's decisions on arms sales to Taiwan and the overall relationship with China. Despite tensions, President Obama notified Congress of major arms sales to Taiwan in 2010 and 2011. President Obama proposed three major arms sales programs totaling $5.9 billion in 2011, including upgrades for Taiwan's F-16A/B fighters. Concerns were raised about Taiwan's defense budget cuts under President Ma, with calls for increased spending to address security challenges. Taiwan's defense budget in 2014 faced a small cut, making up 2.0% of GDP, and President Ma failed to reach a bipartisan goal of raising defense budgets. President Ma has failed to reach a bipartisan goal of raising defense budgets to 3% of GDP, concerns about Taiwan's military hollowing out due to recruitment and retention issues. Demonstrations occurred after the death of a corporal, with protests against the government's handling of the situation. The Ministry of National Defense only reached 15% of its recruitment goal for the year, leading to a delay in the full conversion to a volunteer force. Senator John Cornyn urged the Administration to address these issues. In the 113th Congress, Senator John Cornyn advocated for the sale of F-16C/D fighters to Taiwan due to China's military modernization. Senator Daniel Coats introduced a bill to transfer U.S. Navy frigates to Taiwan, Mexico, and Thailand. Representative Robert Andrews inquired about U.S. support for Taiwan's submarine program. The United States has not made a decision on Taiwan's submarine design request since 2008. Taiwan has not asked for technical assistance for its submarine program. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kin Moy testified that he is unaware of any defense systems Taiwan has requested but the US has not decided to offer. The House passed H.R. 1960 (McKeon) in 2013, which included a provision to sell 66 new F-16C/D fighters to Taiwan. The Senate Armed Services Committee extended the deadline for the Defense Department to brief Congress on Taiwan's air power and requested a classified report on Taiwan's air force. On December 1, a classified report on Taiwan's air force is due. The House-Senate agreement for the FY2014 NDAA did not include Section 1265 but urged the President to support Taiwan's air force. The Pentagon submitted the report on January 3, 2014. The House Foreign Affairs Committee approved the Taiwan Policy Act of 2013 on August 1, which aims to strengthen Taiwan's defense through arms sales and other measures. Representative Michael McCaul inquired about defense adherence on September 5, 2013. On September 5, 2013, McCaul questioned Defense Secretary Hagel about adherence to the TRA and Six Assurances following a claim by the PLA's Director of the Foreign Affairs Office. The US does not consult with China before deciding on arms sales to Taiwan, as confirmed by Under Secretary of Defense James Miller. Representative Randy Forbes later urged Hagel to invite Taiwan's military to participate in RIMPAC 2014. States invited the PLA Navy to participate in a multinational maritime exercise. The U.S. military included Taiwan in an exercise in Hawaii to deal with hurricanes and decided to work with Taiwan's military at events other than RIMPAC. Legislation was introduced to authorize the transfer of U.S. Navy frigates to Taiwan, Mexico, Thailand, and Pakistan. The \"Naval Vessel Transfer and Security Enhancement Act of 2013\" aimed to transfer excess Perry-class frigates to Mexico, Thailand, and Taiwan. Senator Coats proposed an amendment for Taiwan to participate in RIMPAC 2014. The FY2014 NDAA did not include language on Taiwan, but H.R. 3470 was passed by the House, renamed the Taiwan Relations Act Affirmation and Naval Vessel Transfer Act of 2014. S. 1683 was passed by the Senate and House to authorize transfers to Taiwan and Mexico, becoming P.L. 113-276. Taiwan expressed concerns about the cost of its F-16A/B fighter upgrade program. Taiwan is concerned about the cost of its F-16A/B fighter upgrade program after the U.S. Air Force decided not to fund the CAPES program in its FY2015 budget. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kin Moy assured Congress that this decision would not significantly impact Taiwan's upgrade program, as funding is covered by the U.S.-Taiwan agreement. Representatives Forbes and Colleen Hanabusa introduced H.R. 4495, which includes a requirement for a report on Taiwan's maritime capabilities and suggests Taiwan's participation in RIMPAC. The U.S. Navy may invite Taiwan to participate in RIMPAC. H.R. 4435, FY2015 NDAA, includes a reporting requirement for Taiwan. Section 1240A calls for the sale of 66 F-16C/D fighters to Taiwan. The House Armed Services Committee directed the Missile Defense Agency to assess integrating Taiwan's radar with U.S. missile defense systems.

H.R. 3979 became P.L. 113-291 on December 19, 2014, dropping the requirement for a sale of F-16C/D fighters. Taiwan also sought inclusion in the U.S. Visa Waiver Program. The Ma Administration emphasized visa waiver status as a benefit for Taiwan's travelers, showing support for his policies and enhancing Taiwan's international stature. Mariko Silver from Homeland Security visited Taiwan in 2010, praising Taiwan's adoption of e-passports and efforts to improve security measures. Taiwan's non-immigrant visa refusal rate was 2.2% in 2010, meeting the VWP standard of 3%. Taiwan announced plans to sign three relevant agreements in late 2010. Taiwan announced agreements with the US to exchange information on passports, terrorists, and crime. To gain visa waiver status, Taiwan implemented new passport application requirements. $15 million needed to offset lost visa processing fees. Taiwan nominated for VWP in 2011, reviewed by Homeland Security in 2012. Only e-passports eligible for VWP. Issue with passports for \"ROC compatriots\" to resolve. Taiwan was designated in the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) by the Secretary of Homeland Security on October 2, 2012, allowing Taiwanese citizens to travel to the US for up to 90 days without a visa. This led to a significant increase in Taiwanese visitors to the US, with Taiwan becoming the 20th largest source of visitors. Additionally, Taiwan's inclusion in the VWP resulted in a boost to the US economy, with about 385,000 visitors contributing $1.4 billion in 2013. Other potential options for Taiwan include participation in the Department of Homeland Security's Trusted Traveler and Trusted Trader programs. In December 2012, Deputy Assistant Secretary Mark Koumans visited Taipei and discussed supply chain security. Taiwan requested an extradition treaty, with negotiations starting in 2010. President Ma Ying-jeou witnessed the signing of an extradition treaty with Saint Kitts and Nevis in August 2013. The Senate recommended negotiating an extradition agreement with Taiwan in 1992. Taiwan had proposed an extradition treaty with the US since 1979. The U.S.-Hong Kong extradition agreement is being discussed as an option, along with the possibility of an authorizing statute passed by Congress. President Ma of Taiwan has emphasized democracy, freedom, and human rights, but there have been concerns about heavy-handed measures by Taiwan's police against protestors. Critics argue that Taiwan has not done enough to promote these values in China or implement judicial reforms domestically. The KMT in Taiwan has faced criticism for not promoting democracy values in China or implementing judicial reforms domestically. Concerns have been raised about the Ma Administration downplaying democracy promotion and being less welcoming to those attacked by Beijing. Trials of former President Chen Shui-bian have brought scrutiny to judicial procedures and prisoners' freedom of speech. AIT Director Stephen Young emphasized the need for Taiwan's judicial process to be transparent, fair, and impartial. Jerome Cohen, a legal scholar, has critiqued Taiwan's judicial system and commended President Ma for signing international human rights agreements. He criticized the prosecution of former President Chen but acknowledged the importance of holding everyone accountable under the law. President Ma acknowledged the need for judicial reform in his second inaugural address in 2012. In May 2012, President Ma acknowledged the need for judicial reform in Taiwan. Concerns were raised by U.S. and foreign officials about the lack of political independence in the judiciary. Legal charges against former DPP officials were questioned for being politically motivated. Lee Teng-hui was indicted for allegedly misusing diplomatic funds, with timing raising suspicions of political influence. Lee Teng-hui's case saw delays in hearings, with his acquittal in November 2013 for embezzlement. In contrast, a KMT politician, Lin Yi-shih, was found not guilty of corruption in April 2013 but was impeached by the Control Yuan. Concerns about Chen's prison conditions and health were raised by U.S. Congress members in 2012. In 2012, concerns were raised by U.S. Congress members about ex-President Chen's prison conditions and health. Medical reports were submitted to the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, calling for his medical parole. Despite improvements in June, Chen's health deteriorated in September, leading to extended hospital stays. Calls for his release on humanitarian grounds were made by Representative Howard Berman and Senator Sherrod Brown. Jerome Cohen expressed concern about Chen's medical treatment during a visit in December. In December, concerns were raised about ex-President Chen's medical treatment at a hospital in Taipei. Representative Steve Chabot supported Chen's medical parole in January 2013. Representative Andrews urged Secretary of State John Kerry to take a stance on Chen's treatment in March. The State Department raised concerns about Chen's health with Taiwan's officials in response. In April, Chen was moved from a hospital in Taipei to Taichung Prison's Pei-Te Hospital. The Justice Ministry argued that Chen was treated legally and appropriately. The DPP continued to call for Chen's medical parole. On May 2 in Taiwan, Representatives Chabot and Eni Faleomavaega visited Chen at Taichung Prison's hospital where his health declined. The Justice Ministry granted Chen bail and medical parole, allowing him to return home in Kaohsiung. The State Department's 2013 human rights report highlighted Chen's suicide attempts and Taiwan's human rights issues. The State Department reported on human rights issues in the PRC, including forced labor and violations of maximum working hours. Taiwan denied a visa to the Tibetan Dalai Lama, sparking criticism from opposition lawmakers. The US expressed concern about violence and self-immolations in Tibetan areas, urging the PRC government to address policies exacerbating tensions. The US expressed concern about violence and self-immolations in Tibetan areas, urging the PRC to allow reporters, diplomats, and other observers access and to talk with the Dalai Lama without preconditions. Taiwan allowed a visit by PRC activist Chen Guangcheng, who fled detention in the PRC to the American Embassy and later visited Taiwan as a model for democracy. President Ma declined to meet with Chen, but his visit lasted 18 days. Jerome Cohen accompanied Chen Guangcheng during his 18-day visit to Taiwan, which held elections on January 14, 2012. Incumbent Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT won re-election with 51.6% of the votes, while DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen received 45.6% of the votes. The KMT won the majority in the Legislative Yuan with 64 seats, while the DPP won 40 seats. Voter turnout was 74% out of 18 million eligible voters. The DPP won 40 seats in the election, with minor parties and an independent winning the remaining 9 seats. The State Department congratulated Taiwan for the free and fair election. Senator Lisa Murkowski introduced a resolution to support democracy and human rights in Taiwan post-election. Observers noted the elections were mostly free but only partly fair, with Tsai's unclear stance on sustaining the status quo and cross-strait relationship being a factor in the DPP's loss. Tsai tried to appeal to both pro-independence and moderate voters, proposing a \"Taiwan Consensus\" while the KMT promoted \"peaceful development\" under the \"1992 Consensus.\" In 2011, Tsai's vague stance on the ECFA and Taiwan's relationship with the PRC led to warnings from the CPC about the \"1992 Consensus.\" Taiwan's major businesses also supported this consensus. The DPP attributed its loss to U.S. actions favoring the KMT. Tensions across the Taiwan Strait were reduced, and Ma was rewarded by the U.S. administration. After tensions eased across the Taiwan Strait, Ma was rewarded. A post-election poll showed voters' concerns were the economy, income gap, cross-strait ties, and social welfare. The DPP remains a strong party in Taiwan, with focus on party unity and leadership rejuvenation. Despite past losses, the DPP under Tsai Ing-wen regained strength in local and legislative elections. Concerns exist about the DPP's future electoral performance and potential changes in cross-strait relations. The DPP focuses on Taiwan-centric policies and democratic checks and balances, while the KMT emphasizes the ROC's legacy and the \"1992 Consensus.\" Both parties could use ambiguity in their approach, potentially reaching a consensus on key issues like Taiwan's international ties and protecting the country's interests. Taiwan's ties to the United States, Japan, the PRC, and other countries are crucial for protecting its democratic, security, and economic interests. The DPP and KMT face challenges from the PRC and need to clarify their approaches towards the United States and the PRC. Both parties have different interpretations of the ROC Constitution, with the DPP emphasizing Taiwan's jurisdiction over certain islands and the KMT including \"the mainland\" in the ROC's sovereign territory. In June 2014, Taiwan's future is emphasized to be decided by its 23 million people, not all Chinese people. Different DPP leaders proposed ideas for the 2016 presidential election. Former premier Su Tseng-chang announced the restoration of the DPP's Department of \"China Affairs\" after winning the DPP chairman election in May 2012. Former premier Frank Hsieh visited the PRC in October, proposing a \"constitutional consensus.\" Hsieh proposed a \"constitutional consensus\" for the \"status quo\" and urged the DPP to accept the ROC constitution. Su named himself as the convener of the Committee on China Affairs. The DPP reassured the US, PRC, and Taiwan's voters about cross-strait engagement and defense policy. Su issued a defense policy paper before his visit to the US, emphasizing defense against the PRC and cooperation with democracies. The DPP supported the KMT on a \"military presence\" in a dispute with the Philippines. The DPP supported the KMT on a \"military presence\" in a dispute with the Philippines over a Taiwan fisherman shooting. Su emphasized Taiwan's sovereignty and relationship with the US, calling for a \"freeze\" on independence and reaffirming the 1999 Resolution on Taiwan's Future. The DPP signaled support for cross-strait economic agreements and expressed goodwill towards China. The DPP expressed support for continuing cross-strait economic agreements and goodwill towards China. Tsai Ing-wen was re-elected as the DPP Chairperson, likely to be the opposition party's presidential candidate in 2016. She emphasized peace and stability for Taiwan and the region. The DPP is expected to clarify its stance on dealing with Beijing, with most voters prioritizing the economy due to concerns about wealth inequality and job prospects. The local elections in Taiwan on November 29, 2014, saw voters decisively rejecting the ruling KMT party due to dissatisfaction with President Ma's governance. The Sunflower Movement earlier highlighted discontent among younger people towards Ma's approach on cross-strait economic agreements. The KMT won only 6 out of 22 seats, prompting Ma to resign as Chairman of the party on December 3. The Premier also resigned, acknowledging a failure to listen to the people, especially the youth. Voters' turnout was at 68%. In the local elections in Taiwan, the KMT won 6 seats, the DPP won 13, and independents won 3. Voter turnout was at 68%. The KMT only won in New Taipei, with Mayor Eric Chu winning by a narrow margin. The DPP won in four major municipalities, including Taoyuan. Independent Ko Wen-je won in Taipei. The DPP viewed the results as not a referendum on cross-strait ties. The U.S. engagement with Taiwan remained unchanged, and AIT congratulated Taiwan on the elections. Beijing may increase scrutiny on the DPP. Mayor Chu ran uncontested for KMT Chairman. Mayor Chu of New Taipei ran uncontested for KMT Chairman on January 17, 2015, amidst a period of increased attention to governance in Taiwan. The country's politics have limited U.S. influence on issues like relaxing restrictions on U.S. beef and pork due to concerns about mad cow disease. Taiwan's compliance with international standards is a point of contention, as it seeks U.S. support for its participation in global organizations. In October 2009, President Ma agreed to relax Taiwan's restrictions on U.S. beef over concerns about mad cow disease. The U.S.-Taiwan agreement allowed bone-in beef, ground beef, and cow parts under 30 months without specified risk materials. However, both the ruling KMT and opposition DPP complained, leading to tension with the Obama Administration and Congress. Taiwan's Legislative Yuan passed a bill in January 2010 to ban certain beef products. Taiwan's Legislative Yuan passed a bill in January 2010 to ban ground beef, parts, and risky materials from areas with mad cow disease in the past 10 years. The U.S. Trade Representative and Members of Congress expressed concerns about Taiwan's restrictions on U.S. beef, leading to tensions and disputes. Taiwan raised another dispute over beef right before an attempted resumption of trade talks in late January 2011. On January 15, Taiwan ordered the removal of U.S. beef with ractopamine, despite U.S. claims of its safety. On February 17, Senators and Representatives wrote a letter to President Ma expressing concern about U.S. beef exports to Taiwan being halted due to ractopamine. AIT expressed disappointment in Taiwan's decision to maintain the ban, citing lack of agreement on acceptable residue levels. Representative Royce criticized the suspension of economic talks with Taiwan over the beef dispute. AmCham in Taipei urged President Ma to resolve the beef dispute before it damages the relationship with the United States. AIT issued Fact Sheets on the safety of U.S. beef and ractopamine in response to protests and recalls of U.S. beef in Taiwan. President Ma held \"national security\" meetings over the crisis and the Ma Administration set four conditions for beef imports to address domestic political pressure. President Ma faced domestic political pressure regarding beef imports, with Senator Chuck Grassley supporting Taiwan's decision to allow some beef imports. However, 68 Members of Congress objected to Taiwan's protectionist trade restrictions on U.S. pork and beef, stating it sets a dangerous precedent and undermines efforts to establish science-based standards for exports. The Department of Agriculture found a cow with mad cow disease in the US, but stated it posed no risk. Lawmakers in Taiwan's ruling party voted down attempts to ban US beef. A committee in the Legislative Yuan defeated a proposal to allow beef with safe levels of ractopamine. Taiwan sent officials to the US to inspect beef processing sites and found US beef to be safe. AmCham in Taipei criticized the politicization of the beef dispute but commended President Ma for working on a resolution. On July 5, Representatives Edward Royce and Gerald Connolly led 10 Members of Congress to write to President Obama, urging action on the \"U.S. beef bill\" in Taiwan. On July 5, Representatives Edward Royce and Gerald Connolly led 10 Members of Congress to urge President Obama to resume TIFA talks with Taiwan and open its market to U.S. agriculture exports. The Codex Alimentarius Commission adopted MRLs for ractopamine in beef and pork, prompting the DPP to support international standards. However, the DPP Caucus voted against ending the ban on ractopamine in beef, raising questions about its political leadership and principles. After the elections in January, Taiwan's people expressed satisfaction with U.S. products. The DPP supported its own version of legislation, including language on beef and pork treatment. Under Secretary of Commerce Sanchez visited Taipei in October 2012, announcing the VWP for Taiwan's travelers. Taiwan maintained a ban on ractopamine for pork, causing concern in the Senate Finance Committee in March 2013. Taiwan faces unjustifiable barriers discriminating against pork despite its highly developed economy and status as a major ICT producer. Per capita GDP is $39,700, larger than Japan and South Korea. Taiwan is a major leader in global technology, with many of its companies ranking among the top performers in the ICT industry. The country is also recognized for its ease of doing business, ranking 16th in the World Bank's Index of Doing Business. Taiwan's ability to generate, adopt, and diffuse knowledge is highlighted by its 13th ranking in the World Bank's Knowledge Economy Index. Additionally, Taiwan is competitive on a global scale, ranking 12th out of 148 economies in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report. In 2013-2014, Taiwan ranked 12th in the global competitiveness report. The country's economy heavily relies on trade, with exports equal to 72% of GDP. Taiwan's GDP growth is closely tied to export growth, with net exports being the largest contributor from 2005 to 2012. The global economic slowdown starting in 2008 significantly impacted Taiwan's economy, with real GDP growth dropping to 0.7% in 2008 and falling by 1.8% in 2009. Taiwan's real GDP growth slowed to 0.7% in 2008 and fell by 1.8% in 2009. It surged by 10.8% in 2010 but has averaged only 2.6% over the past three years. In 2013, Taiwan's merchandise exports were $305 billion, making it the world's 20th-largest exporter, while imports totaled $270 billion, making it the world's 18th-largest importer. Taiwan's share of global merchandise exports fell from 2.3% in 2000 to 1.6% in 2013. Concerns about exclusion from free trade agreements have raised worries about Taiwan's economy becoming less competitive. Taiwan has tried to expand trade to counter concerns about exclusion from FTAs with major trading partners. South Korea, a key competitor, has numerous FTAs in place, while Taiwan had FTAs with only a few Central American countries. Taiwan's officials warn that exclusion from FTAs could harm the competitiveness of Taiwanese firms and impact trade and economic growth. Taiwan is negotiating FTAs with multiple countries and regions, including China. Efforts to boost economic ties with China have led to the signing of the ECFA in 2010, aiming to liberalize trade and investment barriers. The agreement includes an \"early harvest\" provision to eliminate tariffs on various products within three years, expected to enhance cross-strait economic integration and growth. Taiwan has pursued trade agreements with various countries, including New Zealand and Singapore. It is also exploring agreements with the European Union, the Philippines, India, Indonesia, and Israel. Taiwan has expressed interest in an FTA/ECA with the United States and analysts suggest pursuing a bilateral investment agreement to boost trade and investment. Taiwan is seeking to join regional FTAs like TPP and RCEP to boost trade. The PRC is Taiwan's largest trading partner, with total trade growing significantly from $31.3 billion in 2000 to $124.4 billion in 2013. Taiwan's exports to China have risen from 3.2% in 1985 to 28.5% in 2013. Taiwan has enjoyed large annual merchandise trade surpluses with China, with exports rising to 28.5% in 2013. Taiwan is a major source of foreign direct investment (FDI) flows to China, with approved FDI reaching $13.1 billion in 2011. The stock of Taiwan's approved FDI to China from 1991 to 2013 was $133.7 billion, with the majority in manufacturing sectors like electronic parts and components. Taiwan is a major source of foreign direct investment (FDI) flows to China, with approved FDI reaching $13.1 billion in 2011. Analysts estimate Taiwan's total FDI in China could be as high as $300 billion, with more than 1 million Taiwanese residing in China and over 70,000 Taiwanese companies operating there. Sales by Taiwan's largest corporations to China and Hong Kong totaled $372.8 billion and $47.4 billion in 2012, respectively. Hon Hai Precision Industry (Foxconn) employs over 1 million workers in China. Taiwan's economic integration with China has raised concerns about dependency and potential dominance by PRC-invested firms. Protests in 2014 over a trade agreement reflected these worries. U.S. trade data shows a decline in Taiwan's importance as a trading partner compared to China. Total U.S. trade with Taiwan in 2013 was $63.6 billion. Total U.S. trade with Taiwan in 2013 was $63.6 billion, with U.S. imports from Taiwan at $37.9 billion and U.S. exports to Taiwan at $24.7 billion. U.S. trade data shows a decline in Taiwan's ranking as a trading partner over the years. Despite this, Taiwan's importance to the U.S. economy may be understated due to global supply chains. Taiwan's manufacturers and traders report export orders from U.S. buyers exceeding U.S. imports from Taiwan. In 2013, U.S. imports from Taiwan were $37.9 billion, while export orders to Taiwan firms were $107.2 billion. The gap has widened over the past decade, with a significant amount of Taiwan's ICT hardware products exported. U.S. trade data shows computer products and parts as the largest category of imports from China, indicating a substantial share of U.S. imports in this sector. Many U.S. imports of computers and computer parts from China are likely produced by Taiwan-invested firms in China. U.S. ICT firms like Apple, Dell, Verizon, and HP purchase products from Taiwan's firms, which are manufactured in China and then exported globally. Overseas production accounted for 51.5% of Taiwan export orders in 2013, up from 13.3% in 2000. In 2013, overseas production accounted for 51.5% of Taiwan's export orders, up from 13.3% in 2000. The disparity in data between Taiwan's export orders and U.S. import data is due to products designed by Taiwan's firms but built elsewhere, especially in China. Taiwan's IT hardware production value increased from $42.8 billion to $100.0 billion from 2001 to 2008, with a decline in Taiwan's share from 47.1% to 1.3% and an increase in China's share from 36.9% to 90.6%. Major U.S. imports from Taiwan in 2013 included semiconductors, electronic components, communications equipment, computer equipment, and motor vehicle parts.
