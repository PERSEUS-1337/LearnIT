    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Indian Financing Act Reform Amendment\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings. Congress finds that the Indian Financing Act of 1974 aimed to provide Native American borrowers access to commercial capital sources not available through the Secretary of the Interior. However, the use of loan guarantees and insurance by lenders for Native American business borrowers has been limited. The promotion of Native American-owned businesses remains crucial for economic and social stability, even 27 years after the Act's enactment. Commercial lenders' utilization of available loan insurance and guarantees may be constrained by liquidity and capital issues. The purpose of this Act is to reform and clarify the Indian Financing Act of 1974 to stimulate the use of secondary market investors for loans guaranteed by the Secretary, preserve the Secretary's authority to regulate lenders, and ensure that investors in guaranteed loans receive appropriate payments. The Act aims to reform the Indian Financing Act of 1974 by stimulating the use of secondary market investors for loans guaranteed by the Secretary. It also ensures that investors receive appropriate payments and authorizes the Secretary to appoint a fiscal transfer agent for loan transfers and develop regulations for a secondary market program. Additionally, the Secretary is authorized to assess lenders and investors for the costs of the fiscal transfer agent and system. The Indian Financing Act of 1974 is being amended to stimulate the use of secondary market investors for guaranteed loans by the Secretary. The amendment also authorizes the appointment of a fiscal transfer agent for loan transfers and the development of regulations for a secondary market program. Additionally, lenders and investors may be assessed for the costs of the fiscal transfer agent and system. The Indian Financing Act of 1974 is amended to increase the loan amount limit to $250,000 without prior approval. Lenders can now transfer their rights and obligations in insured or guaranteed loans, subject to regulations set by the Secretary. The lender of a loan insured or guaranteed under this title, or any subsequent transferee, may transfer all or part of the loan and security with notice to the Secretary. The transferee becomes the lender, responsible for loan duties and serving the loan according to the Secretary's terms. The Secretary or designee acknowledges loan transfer, with lender obligations remaining unchanged. The United States pledges full faith and credit for loan guarantees and insurance. Transfer of loan obligations is valid and incontestable. The Secretary may recover damages from the lender for breaching loan obligations under the guarantee or insurance. A fee may be collected for transferred loans. Procedures for loan transfers must be developed within 180 days of enactment. The Secretary will develop procedures and regulations for transfers of loans under this section, including central registration of guaranteed or insured loans. Pooling of loans or interests in loans transferred is allowed, and orderly pooling procedures may be issued by the Secretary."
