    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Senior Airman Michael Malarsie Act\". The Congress acknowledges the increasing need for guide dogs among veterans with visual, hearing, or mobility impairments, especially those who served in recent military operations. In fiscal year 2011, 269 veterans received benefits for guide dogs, hearing dogs, and mobility dogs from the Department of Veterans Affairs. Members of the Armed Forces and veterans with visual, hearing, or mobility impairments face long waiting periods for assistance dogs. Nonprofit organizations rely on fundraising and volunteers to meet the growing demand. In 2011, there was a backlog of 188 veterans waiting for guide and service dogs, with only 72 veterans receiving placements. As of the day before the enactment of this Act, each guide dog costs around $45,000 and takes two years to raise and train. In fiscal year 2011, the Department of Veterans Affairs spent $243,992 on veterinary care and hardware for 266 service dogs, with an average cost of $917 per veteran. Service dogs typically work for 10 years, and young veterans may need multiple replacements during their lifetime. The Senior Airman Michael Malarsie Program is established. The Senior Airman Michael Malarsie Program is established to award grants to eligible entities for providing assistance dogs to covered members and veterans. Eligible entities must be tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Program awards grants to eligible entities for providing assistance dogs to covered members and veterans who are receiving medical treatment, in medical hold status, or enrolled in the system of annual patient enrollment. Eligible entities must be tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and be a member of the International Guide Dog Federation or Assistance Dogs International. An eligible entity seeking a grant under the Program must submit an application to the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs containing a proposal for evaluation and descriptions of the training provided to covered members and veterans, as well as the training of assistance dogs. The eligible entity applying for a grant must outline aftercare services, marketing plans, breeding and training expertise, and commitment to humane standards for assistance dogs provided to covered members and veterans. The eligible entity applying for a grant must have experience working with military medical treatment facilities or medical facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs. The grant recipient must use the funds to provide assistance dogs to covered members and veterans with specific disabilities such as blindness, loss of limb, paralysis, loss of hearing, or other mobility issues. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs determine if provision of an assistance dog under the Program is appropriate for the treatment of covered members or veterans with disabilities, including post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs will evaluate the effectiveness of grant recipients in using funds for activities under the Program, considering findings from a study on the use of service dogs for veterans with mental injuries. The term \"assistance dog\" refers to a dog trained to perform physical tasks to help with disabilities, excluding comfort or personal defense. $15,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2012-2016 to carry out this section."
