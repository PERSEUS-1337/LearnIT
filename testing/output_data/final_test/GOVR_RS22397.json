    "content": "Prior to 1988, Medicaid did not cover services listed in a child's IEP/IFSP as special education funds were used. Congress changed the financing relationship between IDEA and Medicaid in 1988. IDEA requires interagency agreements to ensure services for eligible students, with Medicaid having financial responsibility before the LEA or state agency. Medicaid is considered the first payer for services listed in a child's IEP/IFSP, according to officials from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The 1988 law allows, but does not require, state Medicaid agencies to pay for these services. Most states do pay for these services, but there have been complications in the relationship between IDEA, schools, and Medicaid since 1988. Congress clarified that Medicaid funds can be used to pay for school-based services for IDEA children enrolled in Medicaid. In 1999 and 2000, the Senate Finance Committee asked the U.S. General Accounting Office to examine Medicaid school-based services due to concerns about improper payments. GAO identified three main concerns, including billing practices for school-based administrative services and bundled billing methods used by seven states. Improper payments were found in at least 2 of 17 states due to uneven oversight by HCFA. Both GAO and HCFA support bundled rates for LEAs to bill Medicaid, but some states saw school districts receiving little reimbursement due to state agencies and private contractors retaining a significant portion of federal payments. In some cases, schools only received a small fraction of the claimed amount for services provided to Medicaid-eligible children. Four conditions must be met for LEAs to qualify for Medicaid reimbursement for IDEA-related services. To qualify for Medicaid reimbursement for IDEA-related services, the child must be enrolled in Medicaid, the service must be covered in the state plan or federal statute, listed in the child's IEP, and the LEA must be an authorized Medicaid provider. Manuals were issued to help schools obtain reimbursement, with input from the education community. In FY2006, Medicaid expenditures for school-based services were $2.7 billion, with 69% for benefits and 31% for administration/training. Spending patterns varied across states, with some reporting expenditures for benefits only and others for administration/training only. The Bush Administration noted Medicaid claims for services in school settings in the FY2008 budget proposal. The Bush Administration highlighted issues with Medicaid claims for services in school settings, particularly regarding transportation and administrative activities. The HHS OIG and GAO found inappropriate billing practices, such as lack of verification for services provided and discrepancies in child/family plans. School districts may also perform administrative functions for Medicaid purposes. The Bush Administration addressed Medicaid billing issues in school settings, focusing on inappropriate payments for administrative activities like outreach and referrals. Inaccurate time studies and expenditures on non-Medicaid related costs were highlighted as problematic. A final rule was published in 2007 to restrict federal payments for certain school-based administrative activities. The final rule published in 2007 addressed Medicaid billing issues in school settings, focusing on inappropriate payments for administrative activities. It restricted federal payments for certain transportation services provided to children dually eligible for Medicaid and IDEA, aiming to reduce federal Medicaid outlays. The rule was estimated to save billions over a period of years, impacting school budgets minimally for the 2007-2008 school year. CMS indicated that school budgets for the 2007-2008 school year would not be affected by the rule. Federal Medicaid reimbursement would no longer be available for administrative activities performed by school employees or contractors, or transportation from home to school and back for school-aged children with an IEP or IFSP. Many in the education and state Medicaid communities oppose these cuts, arguing that it will reduce access to needed healthcare for children and is inconsistent with approved state plan amendments. The final rule eliminates federal funding for certain school-based administrative and transportation services under Medicaid, which is opposed by many in the education and state Medicaid communities. They argue that these cuts will reduce access to healthcare for children and are inconsistent with approved state plan amendments. Additional federal funding to offset these Medicaid cuts is unlikely, and states can still claim federal matching dollars for other school-based expenditures. The final rule eliminates federal funding for certain school-based administrative and transportation services under Medicaid, which is opposed by many in the education and state Medicaid communities. They argue that these cuts will reduce access to healthcare for children. Federal funding would still be available for administrative overhead costs integral to direct medical services, Medicaid outreach, and eligibility intake. Medicaid would continue to reimburse states for school-based direct medical services under IDEA and transportation of school-age children to non-school-based providers participating in Medicaid. The final rule eliminates federal funding for certain school-based administrative and transportation services under Medicaid, which is opposed by many in the education and state Medicaid communities. P.L. 110-173 prohibited the Secretary of HHS from restricting coverage or payments for school-based administration and transportation under Medicaid until June 30, 2008. This moratorium was extended to April 1, 2009, through P.L. 110-252. The moratorium on federal funding for certain school-based Medicaid services was extended to July 1, 2009, through P.L. 111-5. The estimated cost of the moratorium on various final rules is $105 million in FY2009."
