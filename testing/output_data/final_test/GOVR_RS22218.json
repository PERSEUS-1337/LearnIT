    "content": "The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 requires broadcasters to end analog broadcasting by February 17, 2009, freeing up the 700 MHz band for other uses. The spectrum will be auctioned with an estimated value of $12.5 billion, which will be deposited in the Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Fund managed by the NTIA. The NTIA manages a $10 billion fund from auction proceeds to close the budget deficit. Nine programs authorized by the Deficit Reduction Act receive funds for various purposes, including coupons for TV set top boxes, grants for public safety agencies, and payments for digital transmission equipment. The NTIA manages a $10 billion fund from auction proceeds to close the budget deficit. Various programs receive funds for different purposes, such as coupons for TV set top boxes, grants for public safety agencies, and payments for digital transmission equipment. Additionally, stations convert broadcast signals from digital to analog, with funding for upgrading equipment in rural areas, implementing a national alert system, a tsunami warning program, a national 911 improvement program, and support for the Essential Air Service Program. The FCC prepares for auctions by developing a band plan and deciding on the number of licenses and geographic coverage for each license. The FCC shapes auctions by determining bandwidth size and geographic coverage for licenses, which can cater to different types of services and encourage participation from various companies. Participation criteria include financial documentation, and service rules outline expectations for license usage, including deadlines for network build-out. The FCC communicates proposed plans through notices. The FCC announces proposed auction plans through public notices before finalizing decisions in a Report and Order. Rules for the 700 MHz band auction were established in a Second Report and Order in 2007. The spectrum's propagation qualities and service rules framework have sparked debate, with some calling it the \"100-year auction\" due to its potential impact on spectrum management and the wireless industry. The FCC's proposed auction plans for the 700 MHz band could have a significant impact on spectrum management and the wireless industry. Public safety groups have been assigned 24 MHz of spectrum in the band, with licenses designated for public safety use by Congressional mandate in 1997. A national license for 10 MHz, Upper Block D, will be auctioned under service rules requiring collaboration with a Public Safety Licensee to build and manage a shared network. Under a Network Sharing Agreement, public safety agencies will collaborate with a Public Safety Licensee to build and manage a shared network for Block D in the 700 MHz band. The Public Safety Spectrum Trust has requested a Statement of Requirements outlining expectations for the network, including operation, security, device support, and technical/administrative requirements. This partnership would provide access to private-sector capital and expertise, as there is no federal plan for a nationwide network. Proponents argue that costs will be lower with shared access, and companies from Silicon Valley have petitioned the FCC for this initiative. Companies in Silicon Valley and Internet ventures have petitioned the FCC for a national license block of spectrum for open access, including open devices and applications. The FCC will auction 22 MHz of spectrum with service rules requiring open devices and applications. Regional licenses will allow customers to choose handsets and download programs. Proponents argue that an open network accessible to all users, not just subscribers of one wireless company, is essential for consumer choice. An open network would allow customers to choose their own wireless devices without being tied to a specific service plan from a single provider. This challenges the business model of large wireless companies that rely on contracts for specific devices. Service contracts limit customer choice and carriers are blocking access to certain services, creating a \"walled garden\" model. A wholesale network could offer more market opportunities for new wireless devices, especially those providing unrestricted Internet access. Wireless incumbents are resistant to the concepts of open access and wholesaling. The FCC has made changes to the band plan for the auction, allowing for licenses for 62 MHz of spectrum at 700 MHz. There will be 734 CMA licenses and 176 licenses for EAs in the Lower 700 MHz band. Some argue that creating a wholesale network introduces extra regulatory oversight and risks devaluing auctionable licenses. Some commentators believe that conditions on licenses in the Upper 700 MHz Band may drive bidding activity to the lower part of the band, potentially increasing prices. Smaller companies may struggle to obtain CMA licenses due to potential outbidding. FCC imposes strict performance requirements, including build-out rules, on all commercial licenses. Winning bidders must provide service within specific timeframes or risk losing licenses. For example, Lower 700 MHz band licensees must cover 35% of the geographic area within four years and 70% within ten years. Upper 700 MHz band regional license-holders must reach 40% of the population in their area within a specified timeframe. The FCC imposes strict performance requirements on license holders in the Upper 700 MHz Band, including build-out rules. Licensees must reach 40% of the population in their area within four years and 75% by the end of the license term. Failure to meet these guidelines will result in a reduction of the license term or forfeiture of the license. The FCC will reclaim the spectrum if build-out requirements are not met. Auction rules include minimum opening bids, reserve prices, and the use of blind bidding to prevent collusion among bidders. Package bidding, or combinatorial bidding, will also be permitted. The FCC allows package bidding, where bidders can bid for a group of licenses instead of individually. This method is seen as more efficient and less risky, benefiting new entrants and larger companies. Package bidding reduces the supply of licenses available for small players seeking only one or two licenses. The Communications Act of 1934 introduced provisions for spectrum license availability, competitive bidding methodology, and the transfer of auctionable radio frequencies from the federal government to the commercial sector. The FCC was directed to allocate these frequencies over a 10-year period, with a significant portion reserved for allocation after that time. The FCC was instructed to ensure availability of frequencies for new technologies and services, stimulate wireless technology development, and consider reallocating spectrum for more efficient use. The AWS-1 auction in 2006 resulted from this spectrum reassignment requirement. Congress foresaw the need for inclusive airwave access policies in 1993. In 1993, Congress anticipated the need for inclusive airwave access policies to accommodate technological advancements and cultural changes."
