A method is needed to learn a representation of manifolds induced by identity-preserving transformations for robustness in machine learning tasks. Previous work has focused on learning transport operators to define the process of moving data points on a manifold. The main contribution of this paper is to define two. The paper introduces two transfer learning methods using generative manifold representation to learn natural transformations and incorporate them into new data. The first method maps out unseen regions of the data space for transfer learning in few-shot image classification. The second method uses transport operators to inject specific transformations into new data, allowing for realistic image animation and informed data augmentation. The paper proposes transfer learning methods using generative manifold representation for few-shot image classification and realistic image animation through transport operators. It addresses the challenges of classifier complexity and within-class variation in high-dimensional datasets. The manifold hypothesis suggests that variations in data lie on a low-dimensional nonlinear manifold, which can be exploited by hierarchical processing stages to untangle object representations. Learning manifold representations of transformations allows for transferring natural variations to new data, increasing robustness and reducing training burden for machine learning tasks. Generative models of transformation manifolds can transfer knowledge of variations to unseen domains, enabling the generation of novel examples. Manifold learning algorithms aim to discover the low-dimensional structure of datasets by preserving local or global properties through transformations. This approach enhances interpretability and enables the generation of novel examples in machine learning tasks. Manifold learning algorithms aim to discover the low-dimensional structure of datasets by preserving local or global properties through transformations. However, traditional approaches do not provide a generative model of the data in the original high-dimensional space, limiting transferability and interpolation/extrapolation capabilities. New methods, such as estimating local tangent planes, offer some advantages but may face challenges in transfer learning. Transfer learning challenges arise when extrapolating to out-of-sample points in manifold locations not well-represented in training data. Previous work suggests using unsupervised learning algorithms to learn Lie group operators capturing low-dimensional manifold structure. This paper introduces two transfer learning methods utilizing a generative manifold representation to learn natural transformations and incorporate them into new data. The first method employs a randomized approach to map unseen regions of the data space using the learned generative model. The second method involves using transport operators to inject specific transformations into new data examples for realistic image animation and informed data augmentation. Transfer learning problems can take various forms, including approximating target distributions, biasing a classifier, or defining a prior on parameters. Research has introduced a framework for transferring a data distribution from one area of a manifold to another using parallel transport of model parameters. Some data augmentation techniques are closely related to transfer learning as they aim to expand limited training sets. Many manifold learning techniques aim to expand training sets beyond the original domain by representing data points in a low-dimensional embedding. Recent techniques like Locally Smooth Manifold Learning and Non-Local Manifold Tangent Learning use data points to map high dimensional points to tangent planes for manifold representation. These methods offer a different approach compared to traditional manifold learning techniques. The Locally Linear Latent Variable Model (LL-LVM) estimates embedded points and mappings between high-dimensional and low-dimensional data, maximizing observation likelihood. Manifold transport operators capture paths on a manifold between data points through Lie group operators. The text discusses how nearby points on a low-dimensional manifold can be related through a dynamical system with a solution path. The dynamics matrix A can be decomposed into transport operators representing local manifold characteristics, allowing for different geometrical characteristics at various points. These operators are weighted and govern the geometry at each manifold location. A probabilistic generative model is used for efficient inference on transport operators with Gaussian noise and prior models. The negative log posterior is optimized using unsupervised learning on nearby training points, alternating between coefficients and operators. Transport operators are learned on a benchmark manifold by sampling points and inferring coefficients. The neighborhood surrounding x0 is used to infer coefficients for a fixed dictionary {\u03a8m}. A gradient step is taken on the objective with respect to the dictionary while holding the coefficients fixed. The trajectories of the transport operator dictionary elements are visualized, showing learned motions. The objective function serves as a similarity measure between pairs of points for classical Multidimensional scaling (MDS). By running classical Multidimensional scaling (MDS) between pairs of points, an embedding in 2D can be created to show the intrinsic low-dimensional structure. Unlike other manifold learning techniques, the transport operator approach offers robustness properties, as it does not rely on a local neighborhood definition that can lead to errors. This approach provides a way to assess the quality of the output embedding without the risk of shortcut errors. The transport operator approach offers robustness properties by averaging information from point pairs during training, making it less sensitive to mistakes in neighborhood definitions. The objective function value can evaluate the likelihood of points being in the same neighborhood on a low-dimensional manifold. This metric can correct neighborhoods in isomap embeddings, preventing distorted embeddings caused by shortcut connections. The transport operator approach corrects neighborhood definitions in isomap embeddings by cutting connections with objective function values above a threshold. It identifies erroneous pairs causing neighborhood errors and extrapolates points outward for a more accurate embedding.

It identifies erroneous pairs causing neighborhood errors and extrapolates points outward for a more accurate embedding. The probabilistic generative model allows for generating new points on the manifold that are consistent with natural variations, exploring and expanding manifolds associated with new data points, and transferring model variations. Interpolating paths between points on the manifold and extrapolating realistic transformations beyond the training domain are essential for successful transformation transfer. Classic techniques based on data embeddings are limited in their ability to interpolate between points, while techniques like LSML and Non-Local Manifold Tangent Learning learn global manifold mappings. The proposed transfer learning method utilizes generative models defined by the transport operator framework to map out unseen regions of the manifold using learned manifold transformations. Random coefficients are applied to explore the data space with paths consistent with the observed manifold geometry. Specific manifold variations are transferred in the second method. The transfer learning method uses generative models and transport operators to map unseen regions of the manifold by applying random coefficients consistent with the observed geometry. Specific manifold variations are transferred to new example points through precomputed structured coefficients. The transformations must accurately represent the manifold shape outside the original training domain. Transfer learning is demonstrated on the swiss roll manifold and applied to USPS handwritten digits and facial expression databases. The training domain in dark gray is shown in FIG2, while the testing region is in blue with no overlap. The generative properties of the transport operator model are used to transfer learned manifold knowledge from the training to testing region by extrapolating with random coefficients. This process maps out an approximation of the new portion of the swiss roll manifold. Each colored dot represents a random extrapolation from a datapoint on the edge. The colored dots represent random extrapolations from datapoints on the edge of the training region, showcasing the random manifold mapping needed for transfer learning methods. Different techniques can extrapolate by computing local tangent directions at each point, but there are limits to the size of extrapolations due to the linearity assumption in tangent plane approximations. Testing the ability to estimate paths between points outside the training domain demonstrates this phenomenon. The transport operator path is the only one that does not depart significantly from the manifold, indicating an error in the tangent mappings in the testing region. Path offset metric quantifies the error in manifold representation when transferring from training to testing regions. The transport operator approach consistently produces paths with smaller deviations from the manifold compared to other algorithms in the transfer learning scenario. Performance decreases for all algorithms in the transfer setting, but the transport operator path remains closest to the true manifold. The transport operator approach performs better for longer path lengths in transfer learning scenarios, mapping out paths close to the manifold. This is demonstrated using the USPS handwritten digit image dataset BID18 for transfer learning through a few-shot classification task. The curr_chunk discusses the use of transport operators to learn a one-dimensional manifold from examples of rotated '8' digits, extending the transfer learning example from BID3. Training on a single digit increases the risk of overfitting. The use of transport operators to learn a one-dimensional manifold from rotated '8' digits is highlighted, showing the ability to transfer learned transformations to other inputs like the letter 'M'. The LSML tangent, however, transforms the 'M' to resemble an '8', indicating specificity to the rotated '8' digit. Transfer learning can be applied for data augmentation in few-shot learning tasks. Data augmentation for few-shot learning involves bolstering an impoverished training set from one class by creating surrogate data through transfer learning from another class with more data. This technique aims to transfer variability learned from other classes into an augmented dataset for new classes. The approach was tested on rotated USPS digits using a convolutional neural network classifier. The study tested data augmentation for few-shot learning by applying a transport operator to create \"happiness\" and \"surprise\" in rotated USPS digits. The classification accuracy on rotated digits varied, with the network trained on original data experiencing a performance decrease with larger rotations. The network trained with LSML from transfer learning does not improve performance due to distortions with large transformations. Facial expression datasets like MUG and CK+ contain sequences of subjects making six expressions. The study focuses on identifying natural facial dynamics leading to expressions by using transport operators on landmark points from facial sequences. Training is done on a subset of subjects from the MUG database, using facial landmark detection functions. Parameters for best performance are determined through parameter sweeping. The unsupervised training results in multiple operators associated with expressions. The study uses transport operators on facial landmark points to elicit transformations associated with expressions. These operators can generate realistic expression sequences for new subjects and interpolate paths between points. The mean maximum path offset for all paths in the CK+ database is 0.5526 for transport operators and 0.5978 for LSML. Transport operators can also be used to extrapolate expressions from neutral landmark points. The study utilizes transport operators on facial landmark points to create expressions by applying transformations. Coefficients are computed for each desired expression before extrapolating from neutral landmark points. These expressions are incorporated into a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate new expressions based on given landmark points. The conditional GAN is trained on images and facial landmark points from the MUG database. The study uses transport operators on facial landmark points to create new expressions by applying dynamics matrix A i. This technique can be used for data generation and facial animation, transferring expressions to individuals from one input point. It can also augment datasets with limited labeled data for improved classification. Operators trained on the MUG database are used to augment labeled data from the CK+ database. One neutral image and an expression image are chosen for each expression, and coefficients between landmarks are inferred. These coefficients are then applied to neutral frames in the training set. A support vector machine is trained with this data to classify expressions. The average accuracy improved from 0.4787 to 0.643 with transport operator data augmentation. The use of transport operators improved classification accuracy to 0.643 by transferring information from unsupervised datasets. Manifold transport operators accurately characterize data and enable transfer learning for data generation and augmentation tasks, such as animating facial expressions and few-shot learning. The results show that transport operators can enhance classification accuracy for facial expressions. This approach can serve as a basis for learned representations in manifold data and transfer learning tasks. The simulations presented are proof-of-concept, demonstrating the potential utility of transport operators in applications. The current model using manifold transport operators may not be sufficient to represent complex variations in datasets. Future work is needed to determine the complexity of models that can be successfully captured by this approach, including demonstrations on more complex image classification tasks. Additionally, the model only captures local transformations between points, and further development is necessary to capture more regularity in coefficient behavior across multiple pairs of points."
