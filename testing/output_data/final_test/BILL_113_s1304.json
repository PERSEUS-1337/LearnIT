    "content": "The \"Buy Smarter and Save Act of 2013\" aims to improve the strategic sourcing of federally procured goods and services. The President is required to establish annual Government-wide goals for procuring goods and services using strategic sourcing and for savings resulting from strategic sourcing. The procurement goal is set at $100 billion for fiscal years 2014 and 2015, and $75 billion for fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018. In fiscal years 2014 and 2015, strategic sourcing must be at least $10 billion annually, and in fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018, it must be at least $7.5 billion annually. The Office of Management and Budget will implement strategic sourcing goals. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will issue guidance to executive agencies for implementing strategic sourcing goals, including criteria for procurement, data submission requirements, and guidance on calculating savings. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will issue guidance to executive agencies for implementing strategic sourcing goals, including criteria for procurement, data submission requirements, and guidance on calculating savings. The guidance will include standards to measure progress, procedures for accountability, preventing excessive purchases, and a list of existing Government-wide sourcing vehicles. Considerations include maintaining a strong industrial base, complying with trade agreements, and weighing the benefits and costs of procurement. The guidance issued by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget emphasizes the procurement of goods and services that are repetitive, Government-wide, non-technical, and commercial. It also reflects the requirements of the Small Business Act, including addressing contract bundling and achieving small business contracting goals. The guidance will be consistent with the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative. The Director must submit a report to Congress within 180 days after a fiscal year with details on strategically sourced spending, savings on purchases, and any relevant findings and recommendations. SEC. 4. STRATEGIC SOURCING DUTIES OF COVERED DEPARTMENTS. The Secretary of a covered department must establish department-wide goals and savings targets for strategic sourcing, appoint a strategic sourcing accountability official, issue a policy outlining roles and responsibilities, identify current contracts, and develop compliance standards. The Secretary of a covered department must conduct a spend analysis of procurements to identify goods and services suitable for strategic sourcing. At least one good or service from the top 20 procurement spending categories will be selected for implementation in fiscal year 2014. SEC. 5. STUDY AND REPORT BY COMPTROLLER GENERAL. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study on contract utilization fees and the use of multiple agency contracts, including strategic sourcing vehicles. Another study will examine the cost of establishing Federal strategic sourcing initiative contract vehicles. Additionally, the Comptroller General will provide an annual report on the implementation of the Act. The Comptroller General will assess executive agencies' performance in implementing strategic sourcing goals and the amounts saved through strategic sourcing. A report on the assessment will be submitted to Congress annually. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines \"executive agency\" as in title 5, United States Code, \"covered department\" as specific government departments, and \"strategic sourcing\" as a process to analyze spending for cost reduction and improved performance."
