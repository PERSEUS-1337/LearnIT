    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 125000 of the Health and Safety Code in California is amended to establish a genetic disease unit to detect preventable heritable disorders early on. The unit will coordinate programs, provide information, testing, and counseling services for genetic diseases. The California Health and Safety Code establishes a genetic disease unit to provide information, testing, and counseling for children and pregnant women in accordance with accepted medical practices. The department will obtain parental acknowledgment for the storage and use of newborn blood samples for research purposes. Regulations and testing methods will be established following specified standards and principles. The department may provide laboratory testing facilities or contract with qualified laboratories for required tests, contingent on funding from the Genetic Disease Testing Fund. If funds are not available, the department can still contract for testing services to ensure program objectives are met. The department charges fees for tests to cover costs, informs hospitals of regulations, may adjust requirements based on medical practice, allows exemptions based on religious beliefs, and authorizes grants for testing and counseling services. The genetic disease unit evaluates and recommends tests for hereditary diseases like biotinidase deficiency and cystic fibrosis, as well as interventions such as medically necessary dietary products. The Legislature intends to fund evaluations and recommendations for genetic disease testing from the Genetic Disease Testing Fund in the annual Budget Act appropriation. Health care providers under a prepaid group practice plan with at least 20,000 births annually can offer required testing and counseling services without contracting with the department, as long as they meet quality standards and adhere to regulations. The plan must pay the department's reasonable costs for administering the services, fulfilling any fee obligations for the provider or patient. The department may appoint genetic screening experts to provide advice on regulations. Experts will not receive a salary but will be reimbursed for expenses. Parents can request the destruction of their child's blood sample collected as a newborn. The department shall acknowledge receipt of requests to destroy or not use newborn blood samples for research purposes. Informational materials will be provided regarding newborn child blood samples collected. The curr_chunk provides an explanation of the purpose of newborn child screening tests, benefits of early screening for heritable disorders, details about the California Biobank Program, and the right of parents to request the destruction of their child's blood sample for research purposes. The informational materials must include a statement allowing individuals to request the destruction of their blood sample for research purposes. This information should be presented on a single page separate from the standard acceptance form required for newborn child screening tests. The standard informational acceptance form for newborn child screening tests includes a space for parents to request the destruction of their child's blood sample for research purposes. The form must be a single page separate from the informational materials provided. A copy of the form is kept in the mother's medical record. The informational acceptance form is a written acknowledgment signed by a parent or legal guardian of a newborn child. If no form is signed, the newborn child will undergo genetic screening and their blood sample will be stored for research. The department must provide parents with informational materials and the acceptance form regarding the retention of newborn blood samples. A birth attendant providing perinatal care must give pregnant women informational materials and an acceptance form before delivery. If not provided, a licensed health facility must give these to pregnant women admitted for delivery. The local registrar of births and deaths must provide informational material and an acceptance form to individuals registering the birth of a newborn that occurred outside of a perinatal licensed health facility. They must also notify the local health officer and the department of these registrations. \"Birth attendant\" is defined as a person licensed to provide maternity care, and \"perinatal licensed health facility\" is defined as a facility approved to provide perinatal services. Reimbursement for mandated costs in this act will be provided to local agencies and school districts by the Commission on State Mandates."
