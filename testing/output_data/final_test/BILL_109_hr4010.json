    "content": "The \"Low-Income Gasoline Assistance Program Act\" aims to create emergency assistance programs for families receiving assistance under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act and low-income working families to cope with rising gasoline prices. The Act defines \"covered activities\" as work, education related to employment, or activities for necessary medical treatment. It also clarifies the terms \"gasoline,\" \"household,\" \"poverty level,\" \"state median income,\" and \"Secretary.\" The term \"State\" refers to individual states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. \"Work activities\" is defined in section 407(d) of the Social Security Act. The Secretary will provide grants to States for emergency assistance programs to help eligible households purchase gasoline. States will receive allotments based on funds appropriated for the fiscal year. States must submit applications for the program. To be eligible for a grant under this Act, a State must submit an application to the Secretary with designated agency information and details of the emergency assistance program. Indian tribes can also participate in the program. The Secretary may reserve funds from a State's allotment under the Act if requested by an Indian tribe or organization for direct assistance, determined to better serve the tribe, based on population of eligible Indians. The Secretary may reserve funds from a State's allotment under the Act for eligible Indians determined by population, with awards given to Indian tribes or organizations. To be eligible for a grant, a tribe or organization must submit a plan meeting the Secretary's criteria. Definitions include \"Indian tribe\" and \"tribal organization\" as tribes, bands, or organizations. The terms \"tribe\" and \"tribal organization\" refer to recognized Indian groups in a state or by the Secretary of the Interior. The term \"Indian\" denotes a member of such a tribe or organization. Eligible households are defined in the context of recognized Indian groups or tribal organizations. To be eligible for a payment under this Act, a household must submit an application to the State with required information. The applicant must demonstrate that individuals in the household drive a certain distance daily or weekly to covered activities and meet specific eligibility requirements. To qualify for assistance under this Act, a household's income must not exceed 150 percent of the state's poverty level or 60 percent of the state median income. States cannot deny eligibility based solely on income below 110 percent of the poverty level but can prioritize households with high gasoline costs relative to income. SEC. 9. PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, determines a grade of gasoline for price determinations, a method for calculating average prices per gallon, and calculates the average price baseline. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, calculates trigger and release prices for each State based on the average per gallon price of gasoline. Monthly price calculations are also done to determine payments. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, determines if a State should provide payments based on the average gasoline price. If the price exceeds the trigger price, payments are required for the following month; if it falls below the release price, payments are suspended after 30 days. The State uses funds from grants to make payments to eligible households under the Act for up to 3 months per application approved. The payments are made in specified amounts. The State administers payments to eligible households in amounts ranging from $25 to $75 per month, based on household income. Up to 10% of funds can be used for administrative costs. Definitions include \"covered grade,\" \"release price,\" and \"trigger price.\" SEC. 10 of the Act states that any payment provided under this Act will not be considered as income or resources for eligibility in other federal programs or under the Internal Revenue Code. Additionally, payments under this Act will not be considered TANF assistance, and the period of receiving these payments will not count towards the 60-month limit under the Social Security Act. SEC. 11 amends Section 404(d) of the Social Security Act to allow states to use funds for a State program under the Low-Income Gasoline Assistance Program Act. SEC. 12 grants discretionary activities to the Secretary. The Secretary of Health and Human Services can reserve up to 5% of funds for administering the Act and increasing grants to States in emergency gasoline price situations. $500,000,000 is authorized annually for the Act's implementation, with funds available until the next fiscal year."
