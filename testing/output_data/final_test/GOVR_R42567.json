    "content": "The report provides background information on the Coast Guard's procurement programs for National Security Cutters, Offshore Patrol Cutters, and Fast Response Cutters. The proposed FY2020 budget requests $657 million for these programs. Congress must decide whether to approve, reject, or modify the funding requests and acquisition strategies, which could impact Coast Guard capabilities and the U.S. shipbuilding industry. These programs have been under congressional oversight for years and were previously covered in archived reports. The Coast Guard's cutter acquisition programs, including plans for modernizing its fleet of polar icebreakers, are covered in a separate CRS report. The 91 planned NSCs, OPCs, and FRCs are intended to replace 90 older Coast Guard ships, including high-endurance cutters, medium-endurance cutters, and 110-foot patrol craft. The older ships are manpower-intensive and include various classes that entered service between 1964 and 1992. Between 1986 and 1992, 90 ships entered Coast Guard service, many of which are manpower-intensive and costly to maintain. Some ships have already been decommissioned, such as the Island-class patrol boats and Hamilton-class cutters, as new FRCs and NSCs are introduced. A 2012 GAO report highlighted the poor condition of older high-endurance cutters, medium-endurance cutters, and 110-foot patrol craft. NSCs, OPCs, and FRCs are multi-mission ships replacing older cutters. They perform 7 of the Coast Guard's 11 statutory missions, including SAR, drug interdiction, and defense readiness operations. NSCs are the largest and most capable cutters in the Coast Guard's fleet. The National Security Cutters (NSCs) are the Coast Guard's largest and most advanced cutters, built by Huntington Ingalls Industries. The acquisition program calls for 8 NSCs to replace older cutters, with a total estimated cost of $6.030 billion for a nine-ship program. Congress has funded 11 NSCs so far, with the latest deliveries in 2018. The Coast Guard has received seven NSCs so far, with the eighth delivered in April 2019. The ninth through 11th are currently under construction, with the ninth scheduled for delivery in 2021. The proposed FY2020 budget requests $60 million for the NSC program, excluding funding for a 12th NSC. Offshore Patrol Cutters (OPCs) are smaller and less expensive than NSCs, about 80% in size, and somewhat less capable. The Coast Guard's top acquisition priority is the Offshore Patrol Cutter (OPC) program, with OPCs being 80% smaller than NSCs. The program aims to procure 25 OPCs to replace medium-endurance cutters, with an estimated total acquisition cost of $10.523 billion. The first OPC is funded for delivery in 2021, with additional funding in FY2019 and FY2020 for subsequent ships and program costs. The RFP for the OPC program set an affordability requirement of $310 million per unit. The Coast Guard's Offshore Patrol Cutter (OPC) program has an affordability requirement of $310 million per ship for ships 4 through 9. The shipbuilder's portion of the total cost does not include government-furnished equipment or other program costs. Eight shipyards showed interest in the program, with contracts awarded to Bollinger Shipyards, Eastern Shipbuilding Group, and General Dynamics' Bath Iron Works. The Coast Guard awarded the DD&C contract for up to 9 OPCs to Eastern Shipbuilding, with a potential value of $2.38 billion. FRCs, smaller and less expensive than OPCs, are being built by Bollinger Shipyards to replace older patrol boats. The POR calls for procuring 58 FRCs as replacements for the service's 49 Island-class patrol boats. The Coast Guard plans to procure 58 Fast Response Cutters (FRCs) to replace its Island-class patrol boats. Additionally, six FRCs are designated for Patrol Forces Southwest Asia (PATFORSWA) in the Persian Gulf, bringing the total to 64 FRCs. The total acquisition cost is estimated at $3.748.1 billion, with an average cost of $65 million per cutter. As of FY2019, 56 FRCs have been funded, with four allocated for replacing PATFORSWA cutters. The Coast Guard's FRC program aims to procure 58 cutters to replace Island-class patrol boats, with an estimated total cost of $3.748.1 billion. Excluding four OPCs for PATFORSWA, 52 FRCs have been funded for domestic operations by FY2019. The 32nd FRC was commissioned in May 2019, and the FY2020 budget requests $140 million for two more FRCs. Congress faces a decision on funding a 12th NSC in FY2020, with potential costs for long leadtime materials. Supporters argue that funding for a 12th NSC in FY2020 is necessary to replace retiring cutters and meet Coast Guard's mission requirements. Skeptics question the need for additional NSCs, pointing out that the current fleet mix analysis only includes 8 NSCs. The cost of fully funding a 12th NSC in FY2020 could exceed $700 million. In FY2020, funding for a 12th NSC is debated due to budget constraints and potential impact on other Coast Guard programs. The procurement of two FRCs is also questioned, with arguments for higher numbers to accelerate the replacement of aging patrol boats. In FY2020, the debate over Coast Guard funding includes whether to procure more than two Fast Response Cutters (FRCs) to replace aging patrol boats. The issue of acquiring Offshore Patrol Cutters (OPCs) using annual or multiyear contracting is also a concern for Congress. The Coast Guard is debating whether to use multiyear contracting for acquiring Offshore Patrol Cutters (OPCs) to replace aging patrol boats. Block buy contracting, authorized by the Frank LoBiondo Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018, allows for upfront batch purchases of components in major acquisition programs. This method can help achieve reductions in acquisition costs. The Coast Guard is considering using block buy contracting with EOQ purchases for acquiring Offshore Patrol Cutters (OPCs) to save on acquisition costs. CRS estimates potential savings of roughly $1 billion if this method is used for all 25 OPCs. One option is to convert the current OPC contract into a block buy contract with EOQ authority to achieve these savings. The Coast Guard is considering replacing the current OPC contract with a block buy contract to save on acquisition costs. This could potentially save around $300 million, although it may require recompeting the program. Eastern Shipbuilding Group, the current contractor, could have an advantage in a new competition due to its experience in building the first OPC. The current procurement profile for the OPC may result in delays in delivering the ships. Coast Guard officials plan to extend the service lives of medium-endurance cutters until they are replaced by OPCs. Increasing the annual OPC procurement rate from two to three or four ships per year could expedite delivery by four to six years. This would require a substantial increase in the Coast Guard's budget. Increasing the maximum procurement rate for the OPC program to three or four ships per year could reduce unit acquisition costs and create new opportunities for competition. This could result in significant savings in acquisition costs for the program. The options for increasing production rate for the OPC program include: increasing production at Eastern Shipbuilding to three or four ships per year, introducing a second shipyard to build Eastern's design or its own design for the OPC, or building additional NSCs in place of some OPCs. This approach is similar to how the Navy is using a descoped version of the San Antonio class amphibious ship for its LPD-17 Flight II class ships. Congress may also be concerned about the impact of Hurricane Michael on Eastern Shipbuilding. Hurricane Michael's impact on Eastern Shipbuilding in Panama City, FL, where the first nine OPCs are being built, is being assessed. The effects on the Coast Guard's medium-endurance cutter ship are uncertain in terms of cost and schedule. An analysis is due by May 31, with a decision expected by the end of June. Eastern Shipbuilding in Panama City, FL is assessing the impact of Hurricane Michael on the first nine OPCs being built. Rep. Peter DeFazio mentioned Sen. Marco Rubio's proposal to allow renegotiation of the firm fixed-price contract due to hurricane damage and increased labor costs. DeFazio expressed skepticism about the company's claim and questioned the need for contract renegotiation. Rep. Peter DeFazio expressed skepticism about Eastern Shipbuilding's claim of needing contract renegotiation due to Hurricane Michael's impact on the OPC program. He raised concerns about a former Coast Guard Commandant working for the company and the potential for conflict of interest in negotiations. The Coast Guard stated that the OPC contract cannot be renegotiated without legislative authorities from Congress. A new provision in the supplemental disaster relief bill allows Eastern Shipbuilding Group to renegotiate its contract with the U.S. Coast Guard to build up to 25 new off-shore patrol cutters. Admiral Bob Papp stated that the old contract prohibited negotiating for additional money for increased costs, hindering their ability to cover new costs post-Hurricane Michael. The largest contract in the Coast Guard's history with Eastern Shipbuilding Group, worth over $10 billion, needed renegotiation due to damage from a Category 5 storm, labor costs, and a prolonged schedule. The community stands to gain 900 planned jobs and up to 5,000 indirect jobs. A new provision in the disaster relief bill allows for negotiations, with Senator Marco Rubio securing the language with President Trump's help. Senator Marco Rubio secured a provision in the disaster relief bill to address Florida-specific issues, including a Coast Guard project impacted by a hurricane in Northwest Florida. Eastern Shipbuilding Group began steel cutting for the first offshore patrol cutter despite challenges. The company expressed gratitude for the advocacy of the congressional delegation. ESG successfully achieved a milestone by starting the fabrication of the cutter's hull despite damage from Hurricane Michael. Keel laying of ARGUS will be completed later this year. Orders for long lead time materials for Coast Guard Cutter CHASE (WMSM-916) have been placed. Eastern's President expressed gratitude for the workforce's dedication and support during the recovery from the storm. Eastern Shipbuilding Group resumed operations at its shipbuilding facilities just two weeks after Hurricane Michael, with the majority of its workforce quickly returning to work despite storm damage. The firm expressed excitement for the construction of the OPCs for the Coast Guard, highlighting the support received from vendors and community partners. This marks the beginning of a successful 2019 for Eastern Shipbuilding Group and Bay County, Florida. Eastern Shipbuilding Group's employees have shown resilience and resourcefulness by quickly returning to work after Hurricane Michael, exceeding 80% of pre-storm staffing levels. President Joey D'Isernia praised their unbreakable spirit and the support from the maritime community in helping employees bounce back. ESG worked diligently to locate and assist employees in returning to work, showcasing a strong sense of community and teamwork. ESG organized daily distribution of meals and goods for employees in need in the maritime community after Hurricane Michael. They also provided interest-free loans, set up a Go Fund Me account, and built temporary housing for affected employees. Power was restored to ESG facilities, and production of vessels under contract is ramping back up. ESG personnel working on the US Coast Guard's Offshore Patrol Cutter contract have returned to work. The US Coast Guard's Offshore Patrol Cutter personnel have returned to work after Hurricane Michael. The Eastern Shipbuilding Group is assessing the damage caused by the storm to their Panama City yard. Despite the lingering effects of the hurricane, they are open for business and excited to deliver quality vessels to customers. Eastern Shipbuilding was awarded a contract to build the future USCGC Argus and USCGC Chase, the first two offshore patrol cutters (OPCs). The yard's contract includes nine OPCs with options for two more, as the Coast Guard plans to acquire a total of 25 OPCs. Despite Hurricane Michael causing damage to the yard, work on the vessels has not been significantly impacted. Eastern Shipbuilding is assessing damage from Hurricane Michael, with many employees evacuated or displaced. Despite the impact, the company is making progress thanks to the resilience of its workforce. Congress is also concerned about the Coast Guard's planned procurement quantities for cutters. The Coast Guard's planned procurement quantities for cutters, including NSCs, OPCs, and FRCs, are to be individually more capable than older ships. However, studies show that the planned total of 91 cutters would only provide 61% of the needed capacity for future missions. Congressional concerns have been raised about this issue, with ongoing discussions and appropriations actions for FY2020 acquisition funding. The Coast Guard's planned procurement quantities for NSCs, OPCs, and FRCs are insufficient for future missions, with only 61% of the needed capacity. While the Navy adjusts its ship force-level goals, the Coast Guard's force levels have remained unchanged since 2004, potentially due to budgetary constraints. The Coast Guard's 2009 Fleet Mix Analysis highlighted the need for a higher PC&I funding level of $2 billion per year to support planned force levels for NSCs, OPCs, and FRCs. Using outdated 2004 expectations for funding levels can limit Congress's options and hinder its ability to provide for national defense. The Coast Guard's planned force of 91 NSCs, OPCs, and FRCs would result in capability or capacity gaps in 6 of its 11 statutory missions. These gaps are considered high or very high risk. While discussions often highlight the improvement over the legacy force, it is important to note that the POR force would still be smaller than what is needed to fully perform the Coast Guard's missions in the future. The Coast Guard's planned force of 91 cutters may not be sufficient to fully perform its statutory missions in the future, as identified in the Fleet Mix Analysis. The objective fleet mix includes 66 additional cutters, indicating a 73% increase over the planned force. The Fleet Mix Analysis identified a need for 66 additional cutters, a 73% increase over the planned force of 91 cutters. Different forces were calculated to address mission gaps of varying risk levels, leading to the objective fleet mix labeled as FMA-4. The Fleet Mix Analysis identified a need for 66 additional cutters, a 73% increase over the planned force of 91 cutters. Table A-3 shows the POR and FMAs 1 through 4 in terms of their mission performance gaps. Figure A-1 from FMA Phase 1 depicts the overall mission capability/performance gap situation in graphic form, showing the declining capability of legacy assets and added capability from ships and aircraft to be procured under the POR. The level of capability provided by the POR force is substantially below a projection of Coast Guard mission demands post-9/11. The Coast Guard conducted a Fleet Mix Analysis to address mission performance gaps post-9/11. The study recommended acquiring 66 additional cutters to meet future mission demands. The analysis was completed in December 2009 but was not publicly discussed until April 2011. The Coast Guard conducted a Fleet Mix Analysis post-9/11, recommending acquiring 66 additional cutters. GAO presented findings in April 2011 and July 2011. A follow-on study, FMA Phase 2, was completed in May 2011, showing a refined objective mix with 49 OPCs instead of 57. The refined mix includes 58 additional cutters, 64% more than the POR. Larger force mixes would be more costly to procure, operate, and support. The refined objective mix includes 58 additional cutters, with most of the cost going towards 24 additional FRCs. The larger force mixes in the FMA Phase 1 and 2 studies also involve increased numbers of Coast Guard aircraft. The procurement, operation, and support of these additional cutters would require billions of dollars. The FMA Phase 1 study estimated that procuring a larger fleet mix of 157 cutters and 479 aircraft would cost $61 billion to $67 billion, 66% more than the current fleet mix of 91 cutters and 248 aircraft costing $37 billion to $40 billion. The total ownership cost of the larger fleet mix is estimated at $201 billion to $208 billion, 53% more than the current fleet mix costing $132 billion to $136 billion. The Coast Guard's vice commandant expressed concerns about the limited capabilities of the fleet due to its small size and advanced age, hindering missions in the Arctic, drug transit zones, and the South China Sea. He emphasized the need for fleet recapitalization to address resource shortages and highlighted the disparity in ship numbers between the Coast Guard and China's coast guard. The Coast Guard's vice commandant highlighted China's superior numbers of coast guard ships in the South China Sea, emphasizing the need for fleet recapitalization. China's use of coast guard vessels to enforce territorial claims was noted as a strategic advantage. Despite requests for U.S. Coast Guard cutters in the region, resource limitations prevented their deployment. The Coast Guard's vice commandant emphasized China's superior numbers of coast guard ships in the South China Sea and the need for fleet recapitalization. Resource limitations prevented the deployment of U.S. Coast Guard cutters in the region, leading to potential oversight questions for Congress regarding performance gaps and the impact on public safety and national security. The Coast Guard's vice commandant highlighted China's extensive coast guard fleet in the South China Sea, underscoring the urgency for fleet modernization. Resource constraints hindered the deployment of U.S. Coast Guard vessels in the area, prompting Congress to address performance shortfalls and their implications for public safety and national security. The executive branch's communication to Congress on the disparity between the current and required number of ships and aircraft for Coast Guard missions remains unclear. Public discourse on the Program of Record (POR) has primarily focused on capability enhancements rather than the operational gaps outlined in Appendix B. Funding for the Coast Guard's Procurement, Construction, and Improvements (PC&I) account has decreased from an average of $1.5 billion per year in FY2013 to $1 billion to $1.2 billion per year in FY2014-FY2016. The Coast Guard's PC&I account funding has decreased to $1 billion to $1.2 billion per year, impacting acquisition projects like a new polar icebreaker and shore installations. Plans to procure OPCs at a rate of two per year would leave $200 million to $400 million for other programs. Coast Guard officials emphasize the need for a $2 billion per year funding level for full execution of acquisition programs. The Coast Guard's PC&I account funding has decreased to $1 billion to $1.2 billion per year, impacting acquisition projects. Plans to procure OPCs at a rate of two per year would leave $200 million to $400 million for other programs. Coast Guard officials emphasize the need for a $2 billion per year funding level for full execution of acquisition programs, with past figures sometimes reaching $2.5 billion per year. Analyzing future funding levels based on past levels may not always be the best approach for the Coast Guard due to fluctuations in major platform acquisitions. The analysis of future funding levels for the Coast Guard should not be based solely on past funding levels, as this can limit congressional options and deprive Congress of agency in setting funding levels. During a hearing in 2011, Admiral Robert J. Papp highlighted the need for a $2 billion per year funding level to fully execute acquisition programs. Admiral Robert J. Papp, Commandant of the Coast Guard, stated that the current budget constraints limit their ability to fully sustain their capital plant. While they receive $1.4 billion annually for acquisitions, they estimate needing $2.5 billion per year to address shore infrastructure, renovate icebreakers, ships, and aircraft. Tradeoffs must be made to balance frontline operations and recapitalization efforts. The Coast Guard faces tradeoffs between sustaining frontline operations and recapitalizing its assets. Rear Adm. Mark Butt and Commandant Robert Papp emphasize the need for an annual budget of $2.5 billion for procurement, compared to the current budget of less than $1.5 billion. This shortfall could result in a 30% reduction in assets. At a Senate hearing, Admiral Papp reiterated the need for increased funding to meet the Coast Guard's operational and procurement requirements. Admiral Papp emphasized the need for closer to $2 billion per year in acquisition funding for the Coast Guard's recapitalization. He highlighted the impact of having $1 billion per year instead of $1.5 billion, stating that the $500 million difference is significant for the Coast Guard's projects and priorities. Admiral Papp stresses the importance of adequate funding for Coast Guard projects, mentioning the challenges of reducing order quantities and stretching timelines, which ultimately lead to higher costs and maintenance expenses for older assets. This situation puts a strain on operating funds and creates a difficult situation for the Coast Guard. Admiral Papp emphasizes the need for sufficient funding for Coast Guard projects, highlighting the challenges of budget constraints and aging infrastructure. He mentions the struggle to fit projects into the budget annually and the difficulty of maintaining older assets. Admiral Papp discusses the challenges of aging infrastructure and budget constraints in the Coast Guard, emphasizing the need for sufficient funding. He mentions the difficulty of fitting projects into the annual budget and the lack of replacement plans for aging fleets. The Coast Guard also faces the need to build a polar icebreaker, but with a reduced budget of around 1 billion dollars per year. Admiral Zukunft highlights the past acquisition budget of 1.5 billion dollars as more conducive to moving programs forward rapidly. Admiral Zukunft emphasizes the urgent need for a reliable and predictable acquisition budget of $2 billion annually to sustain Coast Guard recapitalization plans and operations. Uncertainty in funding and potential further reductions pose significant challenges, with current variances in budget causing difficulties in delivering platforms in a timely and affordable manner. Admiral Zukunft stresses the importance of a $2 billion annual acquisition budget for Coast Guard operations, with a 5 percent annual growth needed for operations and maintenance accounts. Predictable funding is crucial for executing plans and building the force effectively. The Coast Guard has been funded below the Budget Control Act floor for the past five years, requiring 5 percent annualized growth for the next five years to rebuild capability. Predictable funding is essential for executing plans effectively. Additional information on the status and execution of NSC, OPC, and FRC programs is provided in a May 2018 GAO report. The USCG's OTA began follow-on OT&E in October 2017 to test unmet KPPs and address deficiencies found during prior testing on the NSC. While initial operational testing in 2014 did not fully demonstrate 7 of its 19 KPPs, operators have since demonstrated these during USCG operations. The NSC will undergo cybersecurity testing, which has been delayed, with the final cyber test event scheduled for August 2018. The DHS USM directed the USCG to complete a study on the NSC's propulsion system issues by December 2017, but the study was not yet complete as of January 2018. The crew rotational concept was abandoned in February 2018 due to lack of expected return on investment, and a new plan was implemented to increase days away from home port. The USCG's OPC program aims to increase days away from home port from 185 to 200 days. The program has set key performance parameters related to the ship's range, crew size, and operational capabilities. The first OPC has not been built yet, so its compliance with these parameters remains untested. The USCG plans to conduct engineering reviews and tests to assess the OPC's performance and refine its design as needed. The USCG's OPC program aims to increase days away from home port from 185 to 200 days. The program plans to conduct initial operational test and evaluation (OT&E) on the first OPC in fiscal year 2023. However, key decisions such as building 2 OPCs per year starting in fiscal year 2021 will be made without test results. The USCG is completing the design of the OPC before construction, using proven technology from other ships. The FRC program, using proven technology, has addressed deficiencies from initial testing but still has five major issues related to ergonomics and stowage. The program met key performance parameters and was deemed operationally effective and suitable. The USCG plans to resolve remaining deficiencies in the FRC program by fiscal year 2020, including issues with stowage space and ergonomics. While these deficiencies do not pose a danger, they are recommended to be addressed promptly. The USCG is working with Bollinger Shipyards, LLC to address warranty issues, with 65% of engine problems already resolved through retrofits. Additional engine issues have been identified since April 2017. Issues with water pump shafts on the engines are currently being examined for redesign and retrofits starting in December 2018. The FRC's warranty has resulted in cost and quality improvements, with replacements and retrofits saving the USCG an estimated $104 million in potential unplanned costs, $63 million of which is related to the engines. For more details on warranties in shipbuilding and defense acquisition programs, refer to Appendix D. Including a warranty in a shipbuilding contract shifts the risk to the contractor for fixing problems with earlier work. Whether including a warranty is preferable depends on the circumstances of the acquisition, and it is not necessarily a valid criticism to not include one. Including a warranty in a contract shifts the risk to the contractor for fixing problems with earlier work. The government may end up paying more in total for acquiring the item under a contract with a warranty. However, not including a warranty does not mean the government is free from paying to fix problems. In a contract with a warranty, the government will pay upfront for the warranty, which may be more cost-effective in the long run. Including a warranty in a contract shifts the risk to the contractor for fixing problems with earlier work. The cost of including a warranty upfront may be more than what the government would pay later for fixing issues. The Department of Defense's guide on warranties states that their use is not mandatory. Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 46.7 states that warranties are not mandatory, but should be considered if benefits outweigh costs. CO must consider various factors before including a warranty in the contract. A Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) is used to determine if a warranty is cost-effective by comparing life cycle costs with and without the warranty. The Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) evaluates the Life Cycle Costs (LCC) of a system with and without warranty coverage to determine if it will improve overall costs. Key factors driving the results include the cost of the warranty, warranty administration, compatibility with program efforts, overlap with Contractor support, and intangible savings. Effective warranties consider reliability, maintainability, supportability, availability, and life-cycle costs. Decision factors for evaluation include technology state, warranted population size, field performance requirements, and warranty period."
