    "title": "SB 587",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 51 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to determine the taxable value of real property based on its base year value compounded annually by an inflation factor. The inflation factor for assessment years starting after January 1, 1985, and before January 1, 1998, is based on the California Consumer Price Index. For assessment years starting on or after January 1, 1998, the inflation factor is determined from October to October. The percentage increase cannot exceed 2 percent of the prior year's value. For assessment years starting on or after January 1, 2017, the percentage increase for a qualified taxpayer's principal place of residence, including surrounding land, is not applicable. A qualified taxpayer is 65 years or older with an annual household income of $25,000 or less if single, or $50,000 or less if married. A qualified taxpayer, 65 years or older, can claim a benefit by providing required information in an affidavit furnished by the assessor. The assessor may ask for additional proof before allowing the benefit. The full cash value of the property is considered on the lien date, accounting for any reductions in value. If real property is damaged by disaster and no ordinance is in place, the taxable value is determined by the base year value of land and improvements or full cash value. In cases where real property is damaged or destroyed by disaster, the taxable value is determined by the assessed value as computed pursuant to Section 170 if the board of supervisors has adopted an ordinance. The base year value of the property does not include the value of any portion that has been destroyed or removed, and this value remains until the property is restored or other laws require a new base year value. For each lien date after the first one where property value is reduced, it must be annually reappraised until it exceeds the initial value. The assessor cannot require an assessment appeal for this reappraisal. The value of a manufactured home can be determined by its base year value compounded annually by an inflation factor, its full cash value as of the lien date, or its value determined after being damaged or destroyed until restored. For assessment years starting January 1, 2017, the percentage increase for an assessment year does not apply to the principal residence of a qualified taxpayer who is 65 years or older and meets income requirements. Qualified taxpayers who are 65 years or older, including a married couple with one member meeting the age requirement, must provide necessary information to the assessor to claim a benefit. No appropriation is made by this act, and the state will not reimburse any local agency for lost property tax revenues. The act mandates reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for costs determined by the Commission on State Mandates. It also establishes a tax levy and goes into immediate effect."
