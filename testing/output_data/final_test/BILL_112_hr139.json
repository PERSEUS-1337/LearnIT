    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Udall-Eisenhower Arctic Wilderness Act\" and includes findings and a statement of policy. The Congress finds that Americans value unspoiled wilderness and wildlife on public lands, especially the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. President Eisenhower initiated protection efforts for this pristine wilderness ecosystem. President Dwight D. Eisenhower established the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in 1960 to preserve wildlife and wilderness values. In 1980, the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act expanded the refuge's size and extended wilderness protection. The House of Representatives passed legislation to protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, including the Arctic coastal plain, from industrial development. Americans support preserving the refuge and consider oil and gas exploration incompatible with its purpose. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is established to provide subsistence uses for local residents and is managed consistently with this purpose. Canada also protects the wilderness ecosystem on its side of the border, including the habitat of the Porcupine River caribou herd. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge aims to protect the Arctic coastal plain, with bipartisan efforts to preserve the wilderness ecosystem. The policy of the United States is to sustain this natural treasure for current and future generations. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge aims to protect the Arctic coastal plain and preserve the wilderness ecosystem for future generations of Americans. SEC. 3. DESIGNATION OF ADDITIONAL WILDERNESS, ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE, ALASKA. Designation of approximately 1,559,538 acres within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska as wilderness, administered by the Secretary of the Interior in accordance with the Wilderness Act."
