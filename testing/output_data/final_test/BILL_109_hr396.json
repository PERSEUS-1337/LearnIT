Congress finds that over 160,000 people were killed in the Indian Ocean region due to the 2004 tsunamis. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center detected the earthquake but couldn't inform at-risk countries. With just 15 minutes of warning, many lives could have been saved. The United Nations reports significant annual loss of life and property due to disasters. The World Conference on Disaster Reduction established the International Early Warning Program in 2005 to improve early warning systems. The program identified four key elements for effective early warnings: knowledge of risks, hazard monitoring, clear warnings, and preparedness for action. The United States, through the United States Agency for International Development, helped establish a typhoon early-warning system in Bangladesh. Additionally, the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance has funded the United Nations Development Program to develop early warning communications systems for floods and coastal storms in Vietnam. The Act aims to create a US program to assist foreign countries in developing effective public warning systems for all-hazard events and improving communication channels for disaster-related data dissemination. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines \"all-hazard event\" as emergencies or disasters caused by natural disasters, accidents, or intentional/negligent acts. It also defines \"effective public warning\" as timely information given to individuals threatened by such events to protect their safety. The Secretary of State will conduct a study to determine the extent of data dissemination procedures for all-hazard events within US government departments and agencies, as well as evaluate communication links with foreign agencies responsible for disseminating information. The study will assess data dissemination procedures for all-hazard events within US government departments and agencies. It will also explore the feasibility of the Department of State directly contacting foreign media organizations with information to mitigate hazards in foreign countries. Officials involved include the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Director of the United States Geological Survey, and the Director of the National Science Foundation. The Secretary of State must submit a report to relevant committees within 90 days of this Act, containing the study results and recommendations to improve communication deficiencies hindering the dissemination of all-hazard event warnings within and outside the US government. SEC. 6. ASSISTANCE FOR EFFECTIVE PUBLIC WARNING SYSTEMS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. The President, through the Secretary of State and in coordination with the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, is authorized to provide assistance for programs that enhance the public warning capability of foreign countries. This includes establishing communications infrastructure, providing technical expertise and training on risk assessment, and conducting public education campaigns on proper reactions to public warnings. The Secretary of State, in collaboration with other government agencies, is tasked with disseminating research on effective public warning systems for all-hazard events internationally. This includes broadening research programs to improve warning systems. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 established research programs to investigate how results could be applied internationally. The programs also focus on evolving technologies for emergency warning systems and studying the role of satellites and wireless technology through international forums. The Secretary of State will coordinate with the United Nations' International Early Warning Program to utilize satellites, wireless technology, and radio frequency assignments for emergency alert systems. Authorization of appropriations for the President to carry out the Act is set at $10,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2006 to 2010, with funds remaining available until expended."
