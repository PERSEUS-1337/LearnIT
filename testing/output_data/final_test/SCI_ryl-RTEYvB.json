    "content": "Design of reliable systems must ensure stability against input perturbations, especially in machine learning to prevent overfitting and ensure model robustness. An efficient implementation of Jacobian regularization increases classification margins of neural networks, leading to improved robustness against random and adversarial perturbations without compromising generalization. Stability analysis is crucial for complex engineered systems to avoid performance impacts from infinitesimal perturbations. Complex engineered systems, including machine learning models, must be robust against input shifts to prevent catastrophic consequences. This is especially important in tasks like domain adaptation and few-shot learning, where training data may be biased or sparse. Any instability in the system can be exploited by adversaries, rendering trained models useless. Various regularization schemes have been proposed to improve the stability of models, such as L2 regularization for linear classifiers and support vector machines. It is essential to ensure that models are stable against perturbations in the input space to prevent adversaries from rendering them useless. In this paper, the authors propose Jacobian regularization as a method to ensure the robustness of nonlinear models by increasing classification margins and stability. Visualizations show how Jacobian regularization enlarges decision cells and reduces instability compared to L2 regularization. The goal is to promote Jacobian regularization as a generic approach for improving model stability. The paper promotes Jacobian regularization as a generic scheme for increasing robustness in models, agnostic to architecture or task. It evaluates the regularizer's effect in isolation and in combination with existing approaches to showcase its ease of use and complementary nature. The rest of the paper discusses the motivation for Jacobian regularization, develops an efficient algorithm for implementation, and empirically studies its effectiveness. In Section 3, the effectiveness of the Jacobian regularizer is empirically studied, showing significant improvements in robustness against perturbations. The regularizer minimizes the norm of an input-output Jacobian matrix to enhance learning with stochastic gradient descent. In this work, the focus is on learning a classification function as a neural network with model parameters to minimize the classification objective on training data and increase classification margins. The input-output Jacobian matrix emerges in the stability analysis against input perturbations. The input-output Jacobian matrix is crucial in analyzing stability against input perturbations. By minimizing the square of the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian matrix, instability in model predictions can be reduced. The Jacobian regularization minimizes the square of the Frobenius norm of the input-output Jacobian, increasing classification margins for linear models. For nonlinear models, this regularization enhances stability by reducing variation in predictions as inputs are perturbed, leading to larger decision cells. This regularization can be combined with any loss objective for training parameterized models like neural networks optimized with SGD. The Jacobian regularization minimizes the Frobenius norm of the input-output Jacobian to increase classification margins for linear models and enhance stability for nonlinear models. This regularization can be integrated into training neural networks optimized with SGD by minimizing a joint loss function with a hyperparameter \u03bb JR. Minimizing the Frobenius norm also reduces the L 1 -norm, leading to models that learn correctly and robustly. The previous section discussed Jacobian regularization, which minimizes the Frobenius norm of the input-output Jacobian to improve model stability. The current section focuses on efficiently computing and implementing this regularizer to seamlessly incorporate it into existing learning paradigms. Sokoli\u0107 et al. (2017) also explored this idea but provided an inefficient algorithm with high computational costs. In contrast to previous inefficient algorithms, our solution uses random projections to approximate the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian efficiently. This approach introduces only a small time overhead and maintains model solution quality. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees and empirical verification of the negligible difference in training outcomes between exact and approximate Jacobian computations. The model solution quality is compared between training with exact Jacobian computation and training with an approximate algorithm using random projections. Efficiently computing gradients of the joint loss is crucial in optimization. Automatic differentiation systems can compute derivatives of vectors with respect to variables. The squared Frobenius norm is rewritten using an orthonormal basis for the output space. The derivative of the squared Frobenius norm with respect to model parameters can be efficiently computed using backpropagation. This involves backpropagating gradients through the model C times over orthonormal basis vectors. By rewriting the equation in terms of an unbiased estimator, the norm can be estimated using random vectors drawn from a unit sphere. The norm can be estimated using random vectors drawn from a unit sphere, with fluctuations potentially suppressed by cancellations within a mini-batch. The difference between exact and random projection methods is negligible in terms of accuracy and the norm of the input-output Jacobian for models trained on MNIST. Algorithm 1 Efficient computation of the approximate gradient of the Jacobian regularizer. Inputs: mini-batch of examples, model outputs, and number of projections. Outputs: Square of the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian and its gradient. Uniform sampling from the unit sphere for each example. Single projection yields model performance similar to the exact method with reduced computational cost. Implementation in PyTorch with n proj = 1 shows minimal increase in training cost compared to standard SGD. In this section, the effectiveness of Jacobian regularization on robustness is evaluated. The regularizer reduces the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian while maintaining generalization to unseen test sets. Jacobian regularization provides significant robustness against input data corruption from random and adversarial perturbations. Results are mainly presented with the MNIST dataset, with experiments for CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets in Appendices. The MNIST dataset consists of hand-written digits images, preprocessed by subtracting the mean and dividing by the variance. Different regularization techniques are evaluated, including L2, Dropout, Jacobian, and a combination of all. The LeNet-5 model is used for optimization with SGD and momentum. The supervised loss is calculated using cross-entropy with one-hot targets. Model parameters are initialized using the Xavier method. Hyperparameters include L2 regularization, dropout rate, and Jacobian regularization coefficient. The goal of supervised learning is to generalize from training to unseen test sets, addressing distributional shift and overfitting. L2 regularization is a common method to combat overfitting in neural networks. Jacobian regularization is proposed as a solution to overfitting in neural networks, along with L2 regularization and dropout. It is shown to not adversely affect classification accuracy on the MNIST test set. The learning rate is adjusted during training, with different settings for full training set and small subsamples. Regularizing with Jacobian, L2, or dropout does not significantly impact performance on clean data. Increased regularization improves performance with limited samples. Model trained with Jacobian regularization performs well on all data. Trained models with Jacobian regularization show significantly smaller Jacobian norm compared to models without regularization. Testing on a new domain (USPS test set) shows improved generalization. Regularizers, including Jacobian, increase accuracy on unseen data. Regularization techniques, including Jacobian, improve model generalization on unseen data. Combining regularizers enhances this effect, as shown in Table 2. The Jacobian regularizer demonstrates robustness against random and adversarial input perturbations, offering potential for further gains when combined with domain adaptation techniques. Robust models should minimize the impact of corruption in input data, such as random noise and occlusion. Evaluation of stability to natural corruption involves perturbing test input images with normal distribution noise. Models trained with Jacobian regularization show more robustness against white noise. This aligns with the concept of embiggening decision cells. Adversarial perturbations can attack models by seeking imperceptible changes to input examples. Attacks like FGSM and PGD distort images to affect model predictions. The Carlini-Wagner (CW) attack is a strong adversarial attack that yields reliable estimates of distance to decision boundaries. Models trained with Jacobian regularization are shown to be more resilient. Adversarial training with FGSM attack and Jacobian regularization combined further improves robustness. Double backpropagation is also mentioned as a defense mechanism. The Jacobian regularizer has a stabilizing effect and has been used in various forms over the years to penalize large derivatives with respect to input data. Gu and Rigazio proposed Jacobian regularization to combat adversarial attacks, but initially faced computational concerns. Minimizing layer-wise Jacobians imposes a stronger constraint on model capacity compared to minimizing the input-output Jacobian. The layer-wise regularization imposes a stronger constraint on model capacity compared to minimizing the input-output Jacobian. Recent studies have shown that this regularization may degrade test performance on clean data and only marginally improve robustness. Computational challenges with full Jacobian regularization have been addressed by implementing a more efficient approach called spherical SpectReg. In this paper, the authors conducted a thorough analysis comparing exact and random projection methods in terms of model solution quality. They found no significant difference in test accuracy and stability. The study focused on the stabilizing effect of Jacobian regularization on classification margins of nonlinear neural networks, showing its effectiveness against perturbations. The method is easily implementable and the approximate nature of random projection is negligible. The study highlights the effectiveness of Jacobian regularization in improving model generalization and robustness against input-data corruption. Practitioners are encouraged to combine this scheme with other machine learning techniques for pushing the boundaries of the field. Figures S1 and S2 demonstrate the impact of different training seeds and hyperplane slicing schemes on model performance. Adversarial examples do not deceive models trained with Jacobian regularization. Adversarial examples do not deceive models trained with Jacobian regularization, as shown in Figure S2. The hyperplane through a test sample is spanned by two adversarial examples identified through FGSM for models with and without Jacobian regularization. The derivation process involves sampling components from a standard normal distribution, normalizing them, and using specific formulas to compute equations. The variance of the estimator is also calculated using similar techniques in reverse order. The formula for evaluating the variance simplifies after cancellations. The relative error of the random-projection estimate diminishes with the number of random vectors used. Averaging over a mini-batch of samples suppresses the relative error of the Jacobian regularization term. In the large-C limit, additional structure in the Jacobian traces may be present. The Jacobian regularizer can be derived in a closed-form expression for multilayer perceptron, eliminating the need for random projections while maintaining computational efficiency. The total input-output Jacobian is defined layer-wise, with derivatives calculated for biases and weights. This information can be useful for implementation in open-source packages or other models. The Jacobian regularizer is computed layer-wise for biases and weights in neural networks. The algorithm involves backpropagation from the last layer to the first, forward propagation, and backpropagation again. This process, known as cyclopropagation, is essential for calculating the Jacobians. Additionally, convolutional neural network architectures are described using tuples to specify parameters like filter width, channels, stride, padding, and pooling. The LeNet' model used for MNIST experiments consists of input layers, convolutional layers, fully-connected layers, and output logits with hyperbolic tangent activations. For CIFAR-10 dataset, the DDNet model architecture is used with specific input and convolutional layer specifications. For CIFAR-10 experiments, a modified version of ResNet-18 is used with 32-by-32 input size. Standard PyTorch initialization is applied for parameter initialization. Data preprocessing and optimization hyperparameters are specified. The standard ResNet-18 model from PyTorch is used for ImageNet experiments with standard weight initialization. Dropout regularization is not typically used in ResNet models, but the effect of L2 regularization and Jacobian regularization is examined. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of color images. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of color images divided into ten categories with 32-by-32 pixels in each of 3 color channels. The images are preprocessed by adjusting pixel values. Model parameters are initialized using the Xavier method for DDNet and standard PyTorch initialization for ResNet-18. Training is done using SGD dynamics with momentum and cross-entropy loss with one-hot targets. For training on CIFAR-10, mini-batch size is 100, initial learning rate is set to 0.01 for DDNet and 0.1 for ResNet-18, quenched ten-fold after 50,000 iterations. Few-shot learning uses full-batch SGD with learning rate 0.01. Hyperparameters include weight decay, dropout rate, Jacobian regularization, and adversarial training. Dropout improves test accuracy more than L2 regularization. The results show that dropout improves test accuracy more than L2 regularization. Turning on the Jacobian regularizer significantly improves stability, even when combined with other regularizers. The Jacobian regularizer remains successful against white-noise and CW adversarial attacks, but results are mixed when combined with PGD attack at high degradation levels. This discrepancy may be due to the simplicity of the PGD search algorithm. The CW attack, along with Jacobian regularization, simplifies the loss landscape for attack methods. Various input perturbations are compared in changing the model's decision. Different attack methods measure fooling L2 distance in the original input space. White noise attack chooses a random direction and increases noise until wrong prediction. FGSM attack computes gradient at a clean sample and increases magnitude until model is fooled. PGD attack iterates attack step until model is fooled. The CW attack uses the Adam optimizer on logits loss with specific parameters, while evaluating the shortest distance for 1,000 test samples. The effectiveness of attacks is ranked as CW > PGD > FGSM. In terms of attack effectiveness, CW > PGD > FGSM > white noise, with CW being the most effective. Simple methods like FGSM and PGD attacks may sometimes produce incorrect results for decision boundaries. 10,000 test examples were used to compensate for the lack of multiple runs."
