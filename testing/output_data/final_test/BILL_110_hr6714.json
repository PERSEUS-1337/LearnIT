The Congress acknowledges the importance of workers' compensation for American workers' economic security. The National Commission on State Workmen's Compensation Laws found in 1972 that state laws were inadequate and inequitable, with subsequent reductions worsening the situation. Serious questions exist regarding the fairness and adequacy of current workers' compensation laws due to various factors such as changes in the labor force, misclassification of workers, erosion of remedies for bad faith handling, advancements in medical knowledge, new technology creating health risks, and increases in wages and cost of living. The National Commission on State Workers' Compensation Laws is established to address concerns about the fairness and adequacy of current laws. The Commission's duties include reviewing previous findings, studying state workers' compensation laws for adequacy, and evaluating additional remedies for injured workers. The evaluation will cover disability benefits and criteria for maximum benefits. The curr_chunk discusses the criteria for determining maximum limitations of benefits, evaluating state workers' compensation laws for adequacy, studying alternative remedies for prompt payment of benefits, and determining the amount and duration of medical benefits. The curr_chunk outlines key aspects of workers' compensation laws, including medical benefits, rehabilitation, assurance of benefits for preexisting conditions, filing claims, waiting periods, coverage options, administration, due process rights, interrelation with other insurances, and implementation methods.
