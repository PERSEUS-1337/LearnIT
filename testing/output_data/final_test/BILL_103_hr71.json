    "content": "Ready Reserve-National Guard Employee Credit is added to the general business credit under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Ready Reserve-National Guard employee credit for the taxable year is 50% of actual compensation amount plus 10% of unpaid compensation amount. Actual compensation is for days of qualified active duty, while unpaid compensation is also considered. The term 'unpaid compensation amount' refers to compensation not paid to a Ready Reserve-National Guard employee during qualified active duty. The maximum credit allowed is $2,000 per employee per year. No credit is given for days of active duty when the employee was not scheduled to work. The term 'qualified active duty' refers to active duty in connection with which an employee is entitled to reemployment rights and benefits under certain codes. The curr_chunk defines terms related to compensation for employment, including 'compensation', 'Ready Reserve-National Guard employee', 'National Guard', and 'Ready Reserve'. The curr_chunk amends the General Business Credit section of the United States Code to include a new paragraph related to the Ready Reserve-National Guard employee credit. It also makes clerical amendments to the subsection. The General Business Credit section of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to include a new Ready Reserve-National Guard employee credit. The effective date for these amendments is for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1992."
