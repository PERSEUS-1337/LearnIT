The Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 are amended to include a new section (e) that prohibits various acts related to captive wildlife. The Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 include a new section that prohibits the export, transport, sale, receipt, acquisition, or purchase of live animals of prohibited wildlife species in interstate or foreign commerce. This section also limits its application to individuals who do not allow direct contact between the public and prohibited wildlife species. In subparagraph (C), clauses (ii) and (iii) replace \"animals listed in section 2(g)\" with \"prohibited wildlife species\", clause (iv) replaces \"animals\" with \"prohibited wildlife species\", and remove the \"or\" after the semicolon. In subparagraph (D), replace \"animal\" with \"prohibited wildlife species\". The text discusses the transportation of nonhuman primates for individuals with severe mobility impairments, under specific conditions.

The transportation of nonhuman primates by specially trained individuals from nonprofit organizations to permanently disabled individuals with severe mobility impairments must adhere to specific guidelines, including secure enclosure, no contact with other animals or the public, and compliance with state and local transport restrictions. The Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 impose civil and criminal penalties for violations, with amendments to include subsections (e) in various sections. Effective date and regulations are also addressed. The Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 impose penalties for violations, with subsection (d) addressing the effective date and regulations. Subsections (a) through (c) and related amendments will take effect upon the promulgation of regulations by the Secretary of the Interior within 180 days of enactment. SEC. 4 of the Captive Wildlife Safety Act amends Section 3 by removing subsection (b). SEC. 5 of the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 requires the Secretary to create regulations for section 3(e)."
