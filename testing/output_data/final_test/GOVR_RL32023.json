    "content": "The advisory system has five threat levels: low, guarded, elevated, high, and severe, each indicating mandatory protective measures for federal departments. DHS receives threat information from various agencies to determine the terrorist threat level. The DHS Secretary decides on threat level changes based on credibility, corroboration, specificity, imminence, and potential consequences of the threat. The DHS Secretary decides on threat level changes based on credibility, corroboration, specificity, imminence, and potential consequences of the threat. When the decision is made, DHS sends notifications to state homeland security centers and agencies via NLETS. They also conduct conference calls with governors, state homeland security advisors, mayors, and law enforcement associations to alert them of the change in the terrorism threat level. Several bills were introduced in the 109th Congress to address the administration of the Homeland Security Advisory System (HSAS) and alert notifications to various entities. One of the proposed bills, H.R. 2101, aimed to establish a telephone alert network for public warnings of terrorist emergencies. The Business Roundtable's Critical Emergency Operations Communications Link (CEO COM LINK) is used to notify CEOs of top businesses and industries, who then participate in secure conference calls with DHS officials for briefings on developments and threats. Subsequently, DHS makes a public announcement through a press conference, and critical infrastructure associations and business groups are also notified. A proposed bill, S. 1753, aimed to establish a National Alert System within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to warn the public of emergencies caused by terrorist incidents and disasters. Another bill, H.R. 5001, sought to implement changes to the Homeland Security Advisory System (HSAS) by requiring every alert to include information on the threat and appropriate protective measures, with warnings limited to specific regions or sectors at risk. H.R. 5001 proposed changes to the Homeland Security Advisory System (HSAS), aiming to improve warning dissemination without color designations. Issues with the current system include vague warnings, lack of protective measures for state and local governments, and coordination with other warning systems. The House of Representative's Committee on Government Reform held a hearing on the HSAS threat codes and public response to raised threat levels. The HSAS threat level has been raised seven times from \"yellow\" to \"orange\" since 2002, with limited specificity provided by the Attorney General or DHS Secretary. Specific targets were only mentioned twice, with financial institutions and soft skin targets highlighted. No regions or cities were identified as possible locations of attacks. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has faced criticism for the vague nature of terrorist threat warnings, leading to concerns about the credibility of the Homeland Security Advisory System (HSAS). Former Secretary Ridge acknowledged the need for refinement of the system to address public doubts and ensure clear guidance on how to respond to threats. Without specific threat information, the public may be unsure of how to react or whether to take any special precautions. Former Secretary Ridge acknowledged the lack of specific terrorist threat information, leading to concerns about the credibility of the Homeland Security Advisory System. The Department of Homeland Security cites the lack of specificity in intelligence as the reason for a lack of detailed information when the threat level is changed. Maintaining the status quo places the burden of decision-making on the Department, with the need to protect intelligence sources possibly contributing to the lack of specificity in warnings. The Department of Homeland Security is facing criticism for the lack of specific terrorist threat information, leading to concerns about the credibility of the Homeland Security Advisory System. One option suggested is to provide general warnings about the threat of terrorist attacks without using the HSAS, ensuring notices are issued to state and local governments, the public, and the private sector. This approach was taken on September 4, 2003, and November. On September 4, 2003, DHS issued a general warning about possible Al Qaeda plans to attack the U.S. and U.S. interests overseas, citing concerns about aviation, critical infrastructure, WMD, and soft target threats. Another warning was issued on November 21, 2003, regarding threats during the Muslim holiday of Ramadan, with reports suggesting Al Qaeda's interest in using commercial aircraft as weapons against critical infrastructure. No specific locations for possible attacks were provided. The HSAS aims to provide specific warnings to targeted federal facilities, regions, states, localities, and private sector industries to address concerns about vagueness in terrorist attack warnings. DHS is working towards issuing high alerts to designated areas to improve specificity, as seen in the latest alert issued on August 1, 2004. The HSAS aims to provide specific warnings to federal facilities, regions, states, localities, and private sector industries. However, recommended protective measures lack specificity for states, localities, and the public. Concerns have been raised about the lack of defined response protocols for state and local governments. Local law enforcement agencies are concerned about the lack of DHS guidance on protective measures. Non-federal entities like the American Red Cross are stepping in to provide recommendations. Some cities have adopted protective measures such as activating surveillance cameras, increasing port security patrols, and requiring law enforcement officers to carry protective masks during \"orange\" threat levels. Option 1: Status Quo suggests using the current Homeland Security Advisory System (HSAS) for federal government use, encouraging states and localities to conduct threat assessments. Option 2 proposes federal guidelines for state and local protective measures if more guidance is needed. If more guidance is needed for states, localities, the public, and the private sector, DHS could establish protective measure guidance or enact legislation mandating these activities. These measures would align with federal government preparedness and response activities in the HSAS, providing guidance on preparing for and mitigating terrorist attacks. DHS uses various communication systems to provide threat warnings, but lacks a single system. DHS lacks a single communication system for issuing HSAS terrorist warnings. Police and fire chiefs rely on news media, particularly CNN, for notifications of changes in the threat level. Former DHS officials testified before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee on the issue. Former DHS Secretary Ridge highlighted the need for improved notification processes for state and local agencies regarding changes in the HSAS threat level. The public is informed of these changes through news media or leaks, with no formal Emergency Alert System in place. Private sector alerts are conducted through systems like CEO COM LINK and conference calls, potentially prioritizing certain entities. Option 1: Congress may allow DHS to handle HSAS advisories without establishing new communication systems. This approach relies on existing DHS terrorist threat communication systems, but some argue that protective measures for states, localities, the public, and the private sector need to be established before specific systems for communicating changes in HSAS threat levels are implemented. Option 2 suggests revising the HSAS notification process to ensure state and local agencies are informed of terrorist threat level changes more effectively. This approach aims to address the issue of receiving notifications through the news media before official notification from DHS. However, it does not solve the problem of timely notification for the public and private sectors. The Homeland Security Information Network could be used for disseminating threat level changes. The Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN) was expanded by DHS on February 24, 2004, to connect all 50 states, five territories, and 50 major urban areas for real-time terrorist threat information exchange. This system allows interactive connectivity between state and local partners and the DHS Homeland Security Operations Center (HSOC) through the Joint Regional Information Exchange System (JRIES). Additionally, there are eight separate federal warning systems for notifying about imminent threats to health and safety. The Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN) was expanded by DHS on February 24, 2004, to connect all 50 states, five territories, and 50 major urban areas for real-time terrorist threat information exchange. There are eight separate federal warning systems for notifying about imminent threats to health and safety, including severe weather, contamination from chemical and biological weapon stockpiles, terrorist attacks, and other emergencies. Some advocate for consolidating these systems into an \"all-hazard\" system, while others recommend establishing a uniform Emergency Alert System (EAS) nationwide. Challenges in administering an \"all-hazard\" warning system include consolidation and coordination of various warning systems. The challenges in administering an \"all-hazard\" warning system include interoperability of existing systems and industry involvement. Federal agencies are directed to issue timely disaster warnings and provide technical assistance to state and local governments. The President can utilize civil defense communications systems for issuing warnings to authorities and the public. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other federal agencies currently administer warning systems. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Federal Communications Commission, Federal Emergency Management Agency, and Department of Defense administer warning systems. Existing systems are not interoperable due to separate equipment, protocols, procedures, and training. The federal government could establish relationships with private industry to encourage development and make warning systems interoperable. The mature warning systems have established protocols and routines, but consolidating them may lead to less effective warnings. Option 1 suggests maintaining the status quo without congressional intervention, focusing on traditional hazards to avoid the need for increased federal funding. However, this approach does not address issues like overlapping hazards and the need to reach a wider audience. Option 2 proposes coordinating and updating warning systems across federal agencies to ensure effective communication of man-made or natural hazards to a wider audience. This would involve developing a communication protocol for different federal warning systems to interact and share information. Option 3 proposes the consolidation of warning systems across federal agencies to create an all-hazard warning system for man-made or natural hazards. This would involve enacting legislation to ensure effective communication and warning dissemination to states, localities, the public, and the private sector. In the 108th Congress, bills S. 118 and H.R. 2537 propose establishing a single all-hazard warning system to alert states, localities, the public, and the private sector to specific risks from man-made and natural hazards. This approach would require federal funding and effort to research, test, develop, and implement the system, with increased costs on various levels of government and the economy during heightened threat levels. In FY2003, the Office for Domestic Preparedness Critical Infrastructure Protection grant program allowed state and local governments to use grants for overtime costs during heightened threat levels. Overtime is authorized for training or exercises, but the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program permits overtime for homeland security efforts. Local governments face direct costs for additional security measures, like random car searches at airports, which can be expensive. The cost of random car searches at Atlanta's Hartsfield airport is $180,000 a month for labor and signage, borne by the police department and airport administration. Additional homeland security costs during heightened threat periods are seen as a fiscal burden due to budget crises in many states. State and local officials have complained to DHS about the costs associated with threat level changes. The United States Conference of Mayors reported that homeland security costs increased by an additional $70 million a week during heightened alert periods. Localities are arguing for direct funding from the federal government, with FEMA's Assistance to Firefighters being the only program providing 100% funding. The Office of Grant Programs's Urban Area Security Initiative grants pass through the state, causing delays in funding for some localities. States and localities have concerns about authorized program expenditures not meeting their specific homeland security needs. Homeland security costs occur at federal, state, and local levels, with changes in threat levels impacting tourism in potential target cities. Increased threat levels and heightened security measures have negatively impacted tourism in cities like Washington, DC, New York, and Chicago. Washington's Mayor and Delegate emphasize the importance of remaining open and safe for tourists despite the terrorist threat. Some schools have canceled trips to Washington due to security concerns, forcing officials to weigh the costs of homeland security against the effects on tourism. Some municipal officials, like Philadelphia's Mayor John F. Street, faced a costly decision between homeland security and tourism. Mayor Street chose not to close a street around Independence Hall despite a recommendation from DHS Secretary Ridge, citing traffic and tourism concerns. The potential indirect cost of changing the HSAS threat condition on stock markets is also a concern. Congress may consider maintaining the current homeland security assistance program to address the needs of states and localities in response to a heightened threat level. Option 2 proposes funding through established grant programs to cover costs incurred by states and localities due to increased terrorist threat levels. This approach includes providing grant allocations for overtime expenses related to training and activities for first responders and critical infrastructure protection. Option 3 suggests providing funding specifically for heightened threat levels, separate from existing grant programs. This funding would compensate states, localities, and private sector entities for costs incurred during periods of increased HSAS threat levels, such as emergency preparedness responses to a WMD incident. In the 108th Congress, S. 728 proposed compensating state and local law enforcement for costs related to airport security during heightened threat levels."
