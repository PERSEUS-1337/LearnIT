    "title": "AB 2004",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature aims to explore ways to ensure continued coverage of pediatric hearing benefits without incurring state costs. A new section in the Health and Safety Code mandates health care service plans to cover hearing aids for enrollees under 18 years of age, including assessments, replacements every five years, fittings, adjustments, and maintenance. The section defines a hearing aid as an electronic device for amplifying sound, excluding certain health care plans. It will become inoperative if deemed discriminatory under federal law, requiring coverage for hearing aids for enrollees 18 years and older. Section 10123.72 of the Insurance Code mandates that health insurance policies issued, amended, or renewed after January 1, 2017, must cover hearing aids for insured individuals under 18 years old when medically necessary. The section will be repealed on January 1, 2019, unless a later statute extends the date. Coverage for hearing aids for insured individuals under 18 includes initial assessment, new hearing aids every five years, ear molds, replacements if needed, fittings, adjustments, auditory training, and maintenance. \"Hearing aid\" refers to an electronic device for amplifying sound. This section excludes certain types of health insurance policies. This section will become inactive if the department is notified by federal agencies that it violates federal age discrimination laws and the state must cover the costs of including hearing aid coverage in health insurance policies for insured individuals aged 18 and older. It will become inactive 30 days after the commissioner declares receipt of the notification, which will be posted on the department's website and sent to the Legislature. Section (e) will be in effect until January 1, 2019, and will be repealed on that date unless a later statute extends it. No reimbursement is required for this act as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions."
