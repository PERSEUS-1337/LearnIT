The House State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee approved a draft FY2011 funding bill with $52.81 billion, $4 billion less than the Obama Administration request. The draft FY2011 funding bill allocated $2.3 billion less than the enacted FY2010 funding level. The bill did not allocate the $3.9 billion requested by the Administration for Afghanistan due to concerns of aid diversion by corrupt officials.

A chart in the report illustrates the bill's organizational structure, focusing on accounts funded through this bill. Appropriations figures for the entire international affairs budget are provided in the appendix. During the Cold War, foreign aid and diplomatic programs focused on anti-communism and other U.S. policy interests. In the 1990s, new objectives emerged, such as stopping nuclear weapons proliferation and promoting regional stability. Following the Cold War, U.S. foreign aid and diplomatic programs shifted focus to countering trafficking in persons and other national security objectives, particularly after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Global development was established as a key pillar of U.S. national security alongside defense and diplomacy, with an emphasis on assisting \"front-line\" states in the war on terrorism. The United States cooperated in the war on terrorism and focused on using foreign aid for reconstruction programs in Afghanistan and Iraq. State Department efforts emphasized diplomatic security and public diplomacy in Muslim communities. The Obama Administration continued Bush's foreign aid initiatives, including assistance to Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, as well as investments in global health and HIV/AIDS treatment. The Global Health Initiative shifted focus towards comprehensive health systems. The FY2011 request outlines international priorities, focusing on building State Department and USAID capacity, supporting food security and climate change initiatives, and transitioning assistance programs from military to civilian authorities. Year-to-year funding comparisons are complicated by supplemental appropriations, which were used extensively during the Bush Administration for ongoing international activities related to reconstruction efforts and military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Obama Administration requested $6.16 billion in supplemental funds for FY2010 for needs in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, and Haiti. Congress approved $6.18 billion in FY2010 supplemental funds on July 27. Year-to-year comparisons are complicated by forward funding mechanisms used in appropriations legislation. For example, an FY2008 supplemental included $3.68 billion designated as FY2009 funds. The FY2009 supplemental appropriations measure included $1.8 billion for priorities identified in the FY2010 request. The accounting for these funds in FY2010 can affect year-to-year comparisons of appropriations levels. The FY2011 request showed a slight decrease from FY2010 when including supplemental and forward funding, but a 16% increase when excluding supplemental funds. The FY2011 State-Foreign Operations budget request of $56.81 billion represented a 3% increase from FY2010 funding. Figure 3 breaks down the request by assistance type, while Figure 4 shows major accounts and funding levels compared to FY2010. The FY2011 State-Foreign Operations budget request of $56.81 billion represents a 3% increase from FY2010 funding. Just five accounts make up over 60% of the total funding requested, with some apparent decreases due to supplemental appropriations enacted after the FY2011 request. For example, the Economic Support Fund request was initially above the FY2010 level but is now below it after Congress approved additional funds. See Appendices C and D for a full listing of funds requested. The FY2011 budget request for the Department of State and related programs was $17.41 billion, a 1.2% decrease from the previous year. Funding includes contributions to international organizations like the United Nations, peacekeeping efforts, and support for various non-profit organizations advancing U.S. interests. (For a detailed breakdown, refer to CRS Report R40482, State) The FY2011 State Department budget request included significant funding for U.S. missions in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, totaling $1.79 billion to support logistics, security, and information technology needs. The FY2011 State Department budget request included $1.79 billion for U.S. missions in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan.

Additionally, $754 million was requested for civilian staff in Afghanistan, $102 million for public diplomacy activities in Pakistan, and $9.55 billion for Diplomatic & Consular Programs to increase Foreign Service capacity. Clinton proposed a strategy to reduce the State Department's reliance on contractors, aiming to improve accountability and save money. The FY2011 request included funding for 599 new positions, expanded language training, and sought authority to retain passport and consular fees. Congress expressed concerns about this new funding mechanism, which could lead to a 45% increase in available fees if granted. The Administration proposed a 45% increase in available fees for FY2011, totaling $2.59 billion. Funding reductions were suggested for voluntary contributions to international organizations and foundations, including a 5% decrease for international organizations like the U.N. Contributions to various foundations would also be reduced, with cuts ranging from 11% to 50%. The Foreign Operations budget makes up the majority of U.S. foreign assistance. The Foreign Operations budget, totaling $105 million, includes U.S. bilateral and multilateral foreign assistance programs. It funds development assistance managed by USAID, the State Department, and other agencies. Additionally, it supports contributions to major multilateral financial institutions and includes funds for the Export-Import Bank and Overseas Private Investment. The Foreign Operations budget includes funds for U.N. entities, the Export-Import Bank, and Overseas Private Investment Corporation. It also replenishes U.S. financial commitments to international financial institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The FY2011 foreign operations budget request was $39.40 billion, a 5% increase from FY2010. If enacted, funding would have increased by 142% in current dollars and 91% in constant dollars from FY2001 to FY2011. Israel and Egypt typically received foreign aid before the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In FY2001 to FY2011, Israel and Egypt were top recipients of U.S. foreign aid. However, with the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan moved up the list. In FY2011, Afghanistan received nearly $4 billion, followed by Pakistan at $3 billion. Israel, Egypt, and Jordan also received significant funds for various purposes. Iraq was the fifth-largest recipient of aid. In FY2011, Iraq was the fifth-largest recipient of U.S. foreign aid with $682.7 million requested. The top recipients were Kenya, Nigeria, Ethiopia, and South Africa, primarily for HIV/AIDS and health programs. Africa and South Central Asia received the most aid, with $7.6 billion requested for each region. Aid to South Central Asia was mainly for Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Near East region saw significant aid for Israel, Iraq, and Egypt. In FY2010, Western Hemisphere aid increased due to funds for Haiti. Assistance to Europe, Eurasia, East Asia, and Pacific remained low. Congress focuses on aid sectors like education and health. Budget requests now include key interest areas for funding. The FY2010 and FY2011 budget requests show changes in key interest areas identified by the Administration. The FY2011 request increased funding for non-HIV/AIDS health activities, global climate change, food security, and microfinance programs. Neglected tropical diseases and nutrition were added as new focus areas, while pandemic flu, basic education, biodiversity, and Trans-Saharan Counter Terrorism were lower priorities compared to the prior year. The FY2011 Foreign Operations budget request includes priorities such as expanding USAID's Foreign Service staff through the Development Leadership Initiative to implement assistance programs effectively. The Administration requested $1.48 billion for USAID Operating Expenses for FY2011, a 6% increase over the enacted FY2010 level. The FY2011 foreign operations request includes $354.8 million for recruiting 200 new Foreign Service Officers at USAID and supporting DLI positions. The Department of Defense expanded foreign aid activities post-Iraq and Afghanistan invasions, but now supports stronger civilian control. The FY2011 request includes $100 million for the Complex Crisis Fund. The Defense Appropriations bill includes funding shifts for various programs, such as the Complex Crisis Fund, Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund, and Iraqi police training programs, moving control from DOD to the Secretary of State to enable civilian oversight and reduce defense budget for Iraq. The Defense Appropriations bill allows for a $16 billion decrease in the defense budget for Iraq. The proposed funding for FY2011 focuses on providing assistance to front-line states in the fight against terrorism, with significant allocations for Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq for various purposes such as civilian resources, government capacity building, and security training programs. The Administration requested $8.5 billion for Global Health Initiative (GHI) activities in FY2011, representing an 8.8% increase over the previous year. The GHI aims to address global health issues by prioritizing maternal and pediatric programs and building strong health systems. Some advocates are concerned about the shift in focus from HIV/AIDS programs. The Obama Administration requested $1.64 billion for food security programs in FY2011, excluding P.L. 480 food assistance funds. The Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative aims to target funding to countries with widespread hunger and agriculture-based economies. The Obama Administration requested $1.39 billion in FY2011 for climate change activities, focusing on adaptation, clean energy technologies, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This included $400 million for the International Clean Technology Fund, a 33% increase from FY2010.
