    "content": "Deep Reinforcement Learning has shown success in learning control policies from raw pixels but struggles with generalization. Using Breakout, it is challenging for a trained agent to adapt to small visual changes. Fine-tuning for transfer learning is not effective, suggesting re-training from scratch may be easier. Adding a dedicated component to visually map between domains could improve transfer learning. Using Unaligned Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a mapping function is created to translate images from one task to another, making transfer learning more efficient than re-training. This approach is demonstrated with Breakout and Road Fighter games. Transferring knowledge between tasks is a key challenge for deep learning applications and is essential for artificial general intelligence. Visualizations of trained agents playing the games with and without GAN transfer can be viewed at the provided URLs. A key challenge for artificial general intelligence is the ability for a network to reuse existing knowledge for different tasks. Deep reinforcement learning, particularly in Atari 2600 games, has shown success in achieving human-level performance. Making analogies between similar situations is easier for humans than for machines, which struggle to adapt knowledge from one task to another. In the field of artificial intelligence, recent works have focused on improving efficiency in training agents to play Atari 2600 games. One approach involves training universal policies that can generalize between related tasks, while another involves transfer learning techniques. Specifically, in this work, the focus is on modifying the Atari game Breakout by introducing visual changes to test the agent's adaptability. The study explores the adaptability of agents in Atari games by introducing visual changes. The agent fails to transfer knowledge even with fine-tuning, behaving as if facing entirely new tasks. Additionally, the research investigates if an agent trained on one level of a game can perform well on subsequent levels, using the Nintendo game Road Fighter as a case study. The study examines the adaptability of agents in Atari games with visual changes. In the Nintendo game Road Fighter, an agent trained on one level fails to adapt to new levels. A zero-shot generalization approach using Generative Adversarial Networks is proposed to address the generalization problem. In computer vision tasks like style transfer, object transfiguration, and photo enhancement, Unaligned GANs are used for transferring between similar tasks without paired images. The study presents three main contributions: demonstrating the failure of deep reinforcement learning algorithms to adapt to visual changes, proposing a new transfer learning approach separating visual mapping from game dynamics, and evaluating the approach on Breakout and Road Fighter games. The study presents results comparing different baselines, showing the visual transfer approach is more sample efficient. An evaluation setup for unaligned GAN architectures is suggested in section 5, focusing on performance on downstream tasks. Breakout variations involving non-critical modifications for humans but crucial for algorithms are demonstrated. Deep reinforcement learning's struggle to generalize is shown through 4 types of modifications. The Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm is used for experiments, known for being faster than Deep Q-Network (DQN). The study explores different policies for training acceleration and stability using 32 actor learners with specific parameters. The LSTM-A3C network is utilized, achieving success on Breakout but failing on game variants. The network's reliance on images is highlighted, leading to the need for fine-tuning for knowledge transfer across tasks. Various deep learning techniques are experimented with in different settings. The study explores training acceleration and stability using deep learning techniques in different settings. The settings involve frozen and fine-tuned layers, initialized with target parameters or random values. Tasks are trained for 60 million frames, evaluating total reward collected in episodes. Settings include From-Scratch, Full-FT, and Random-Output. The study examines training acceleration and stability in deep learning using various techniques. Different settings involve frozen and fine-tuned layers, initialized with target parameters or random values. Results show that fine-tuning approaches often fail to transfer to target tasks efficiently, sometimes requiring as many epochs as training from scratch. Some modifications have a more significant impact than others. The study found that fine-tuning layers in the network often led to negative transfer and overfitting issues, impacting the model's performance on new data. Results were consistent with similar approaches used in other experiments. The study found that fine-tuning layers in the network often led to negative transfer and overfitting issues, impacting the model's performance on new data. In experiments with Pong BID24 and Road Fighter, transferring knowledge between levels resulted in failure. The proposal is to separate visual transfer from dynamics transfer, allowing the agent to make analogies between domains to improve performance. The study proposes learning a mapping function to transfer knowledge between source and target domain images using a trained policy. The function is learned heuristically by visually mapping images from both domains using Unaligned GAN. The goal is to reuse the same policy for both environments, with the GAN model selection based on interaction scores. The study focuses on using Unaligned GANs to translate images between different domains without prior domain knowledge. The goal is to generate images that are indistinguishable from the source domain, using the Cycle-Consistency principle. The UNIT framework in GAN architecture utilizes cycle consistency to generate images that are indistinguishable from the source domain. It includes generators G1 and G2 as well as discriminators D1 and D2 to distinguish between generated and real images. The shared-latent space assumption in UNIT framework involves a shared latent code for image pairs. The UNIT framework in GAN architecture utilizes a shared-latent space assumption with a shared latent code for image pairs, learned using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). This shared space ties images in the source and target domain, encouraging mappings that preserve similarities. In contrast, CycleGAN does not make this assumption and trains generators independently with separate networks. The Unaligned GAN training dataset requires images from both domains, collected by running an untrained agent and observing images. During training in the UNIT framework, a diverse dataset is created for each target task by collecting images from both domains. The network is trained with Xavier initialization and a batch size of 1, adjusting the number of iterations based on task difficulty. Evaluation is done by testing the agent with generated images to assess the mapping between domains. The evaluation metric for testing the agent with generated images in GAN training is challenging due to the lack of a universal evaluation criteria. Different methods are used based on the data types, but a suggested natural evaluation criteria involves running the source agent without further training and translating images back to the source task to collect rewards. The evaluation metric for testing the agent with generated images in GAN training involves using the total accumulated rewards as model accuracy. The approach is tested on Breakout and Road Fighter games to transfer between different environments and remove modifications in target tasks. Some tasks are more challenging than others due to variations in the images. The evaluation metric for testing the agent with generated images in GAN training involves using total accumulated rewards as model accuracy. Breakout variations show successes and failure modes of unaligned GAN, with some frames requiring less training like the Rectangle variation. During testing, problems were encountered with image generation in the Rectangle variation of the Breakout game. The network struggled to generate objects accurately, often creating unwanted elements like bricks and noisy images. The location of the generated ball also posed challenges due to its small size and frequent movement. The generator had difficulty locating the small, moving ball in the generated image due to training with unaligned pairs. More training improved results for some variations, with different iterations needed for each. Results from a test game showed that training with GANs was 100 times more sample efficient than training from scratch, requiring only a few hundred thousand images compared to tens of millions. The GAN was trained on limited frames and managed to generalize to advanced game stages. Breakout variants are considered \"toy examples\" for transfer failure cases. The effectiveness of transfer learning was demonstrated on the Road Fighter game with 4 different levels, each with varying difficulty levels but same rules and driving techniques. An RL agent was trained to play the first level, focusing on driving fast, avoiding obstacles, and collision with other cars. The GAN was trained on limited frames to generalize to advanced game stages, using the A2C algorithm. 100k frames were collected from levels 2, 3, and 4 for GAN training. The GAN had to map new tasks to the original one, facing challenges like changing backgrounds. The GAN was trained on limited frames to generalize to advanced game stages using the A2C algorithm. The GAN had to change the background and road size while keeping the cars in the right position on the road. The experiments showed that an agent trained on the first level of the game failed to follow optimal policies on new levels, but with GAN-based visual analogies, the agent could apply some of its training abilities. The agent, trained on the first level, applies its abilities to drive fast, stay on the road, avoid cars, and recover from crashes on levels 2, 3, and 4. It achieves high scores without additional training, but struggles with generating new objects, resulting in differently colored cars that affect its performance on the track. The agent struggles with generating new objects on levels 2, 3, and 4, resulting in differently colored cars affecting its performance on the track. Data efficiency is measured by the number of frames needed for the analogy transfer method, with 250k frames of game interaction for each transferred level. The approach successfully transfers to most tasks, achieving the best scores on levels 2 and 3. The road becomes more challenging as the game progresses, with obstacles making it harder to play. The GAN manages to generate the road shape correctly and position cars accurately, achieving high scores after a certain number of iterations on each level. The agent achieves 5000 points after 450k GAN iterations, with the most challenging level being level 4. The obstacles in this level include sudden turns and increasing dangers, making it harder than level 1. The agent performs well by applying 2 out of 3 main capabilities, missing the third due to bad generation. This success demonstrates the analogy transfer method for zero-shot generalization in a video game. Evaluating GAN models is a major challenge, with human judgment often used to assess image quality. Linear classifiers are also used to evaluate image representations learned by GANs on supervised datasets. However, these approaches may not reflect real-world performance. Unaligned GANs have shown impressive results with few training examples, but translating cases can be challenging for them. Trivial translation cases are challenging for unaligned GAN architectures, requiring training on a substantial number of images. The GAN must generalize by translating images with objects removed, added, or in different locations, which may not be reflected in existing test sets. Evaluating GAN models by running a game with images generated by GAN for a Deep RL network is proposed as a step forward in evaluation. The comparison between Cycle-GAN and UNIT-GAN BID19 in running RL agents for Breakout and Road Fighter tasks shows that UNIT-GAN performs better in Breakout tasks, while Cycle-GAN outperforms UNIT in Road Fighter tasks with fewer iterations. The weight-sharing constraint in UNIT-GAN, where domains share and update weights, is advantageous when images in different domains are similar, as seen in Breakout tasks. Transfer Learning (TL) is a machine learning technique used to improve training speed by leveraging knowledge from a source task to a target task. Pretraining and fine-tuning involve training a base network and transferring its layers to a target network, which can be updated or frozen during training on the new task. Fine-tuning can accelerate the training process, but its effectiveness varies. Fine-tuning can accelerate training but may have a damaging impact. Generalization is crucial for training deep learning models with constraints. Progressive networks transfer knowledge between games by training copies of A3C on each task. The drawback is the quadratic growth in parameters. The drawback of the approach discussed is the quadratic growth in parameters with the number of tasks. Different tasks may require different adjustments, and predefining the number of layers and network representation hinders flexibility. Zero-shot generalization is a current research topic. One study transferred between game versions using zero-shot transfer, while another focused on achieving robust policies using learned representations and interactive replay during training. The idea of using GANs for transfer learning and domain adaptation in supervised image classification and robotics applications was explored by several authors. Unlike previous methods, a new RL-based setup has limited target-domain data, no access to supervised labels on the source domain, and indirect rewards from interactions with the game environment. This leads to a different strategy for training, focusing on learning policies rather than mapping source to target domains. Instead of mapping source to target domain and training on the projected signal, a pre-trained source model is used with an unaligned GAN to transfer knowledge to the target domain without additional training of the RL agent. This novel approach for transfer learning in RL environments using GANs was demonstrated to outperform fine-tuning and show lack of generalization in different game variants. Using GANs without additional training of the RL agent, our approach transfers knowledge from a pre-trained source model to the target domain. This method outperformed fine-tuning in RL environments, revealing differences between Cycle-GAN and UNIT-GAN architectures. While successful in analogy transfer, limitations in the generation process hindered performance on specific tasks. Future work will focus on integrating analogy transfer with RL training for dynamic adjustments."
