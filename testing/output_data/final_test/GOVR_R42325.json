    "content": "The Federal Activities Inventory Reform (FAIR) Act of 1998 defines inherently governmental functions, along with other statutory definitions and provisions. The Act was originally introduced to promote compliance with OMB Circular A-76, which emphasizes relying on competitive private enterprises for commercial supplies and services. The FAIR Act of 1998 aims to promote compliance with OMB Circular A-76, which emphasizes using competitive private enterprises for commercial supplies and services. It requires agencies to compile annual lists of commercial activities they perform and make them available to Congress and the public, but does not mandate contracting out specific activities. The FAIR Act of 1998 focuses on using competitive processes for contracting with private sector sources for certain activities performed by government employees. It defines inherently governmental functions as those that require performance by Federal Government employees and elaborates on the types of functions included and excluded from this definition. The FAIR Act of 1998 defines inherently governmental functions as those requiring discretion or value judgments for the Federal Government. It includes functions like binding the U.S., protecting interests, affecting private interests, controlling officers, and exerting ultimate control over acquisitions. The FAIR Act of 1998 defines inherently governmental functions as those involving ultimate control over the acquisition, use, or disposition of property of the United States. It excludes functions like gathering information, providing advice, and ministerial or internal tasks such as building security and housekeeping. The FAIR Act defines inherently governmental functions and listing requirements for certain executive branch agencies, military departments, and independent establishments. It exempts entities like the Government Accountability Office, government corporations, non-appropriated funds instrumentalities, certain maintenance activities of the Department of Defense, and agencies with fewer than 100 employees. Other statutes also have definitions related to inherently governmental functions. The Coast Guard appropriations authorization act for FY2004 and FY2005 and the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 define an inherently governmental function as an activity so closely related to the public interest that it must be performed by a federal government officer or employee, involving discretion or judgment in decision-making for the government. The definition of inherently governmental functions in various statutes often aligns with OMB Circular A-76, incorporating the key elements of exercising discretion and using judgment. While some statutes use slightly different language, the core concept remains consistent across different legislative acts. Several federal statutes declare specific functions as inherently governmental without providing a clear definition. Examples include preparing agency strategic plans under the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 and operating hydroelectric power facilities for the Army Corps of Engineers. Specific groups of employees may also be designated as performing inherently governmental functions at the time of a statute's enactment. Congress can designate specific functions as inherently governmental for purposes of the FAIR Act, such as federal employees at certain agencies and instructor staff at training centers. They can also temporarily restrict the use of appropriated funds to contract out certain functions without officially classifying them as inherently governmental. Additionally, Congress can express concerns about the executive branch's classification of functions by imposing additional restrictions or stating its sense that certain functions are inherently governmental. Congress can designate functions as inherently governmental under the FAIR Act, imposing restrictions on contracting out activities. OMB Circular A-76 and OFPP Policy Letter 11-01 provide definitions of inherently governmental functions in federal law and policy. Policy Letter 11-01 aligns with the FAIR Act's definition. Policy Letter 11-01 aligns with the FAIR Act's definition of inherently governmental functions and provides new tests for identifying these functions. It also establishes procedures for managing contracts related to critical functions. OMB Circular A-76 outlines federal policy for competition of commercial activities and emphasizes reliance on the private sector for services. The current version of OMB Circular A-76 requires agencies to list and classify all activities as commercial or inherently governmental. Inherently governmental activities must be performed by government personnel, while commercial activities may be considered for contracting out. The definition of inherently governmental functions in Circular A-76 is brief and contrasts with commercial activities. The current version of OMB Circular A-76 defines inherently governmental activities as those requiring substantial discretion in applying government authority. These activities fall into two categories: exercising sovereign government authority and overseeing monetary transactions or procedures. The establishment of procedures and processes related to the oversight of monetary transactions or entitlements is considered an inherently governmental activity. This involves binding the United States to certain actions, protecting economic and other interests, affecting private persons' rights, and controlling the acquisition and use of US property. The FAIR Act and OMB Circular A-76 have differences in their definitions of inherently governmental functions. OMB Circular A-76 distinguishes between the exercise of discretion and substantial discretion, while also allowing contractor support under certain conditions. The current version of OMB Circular A-76 defines commercial activity as a recurring service that could be performed by the private sector and is controlled by the agency. It also includes a category of activities that are commercial but \"not appropriate for private sector performance.\" The OMB Circular A-76 applies to all executive departments and independent establishments, with no exemptions. It is described as a \"policy\" document and may not be used to challenge agency actions, except in specific cases. Courts have found that it lacks legislative authority in some instances. OMB Circular A-76 is not legally binding as it lacks congressional grant of legislative authority. Courts have found plaintiffs lacking standing to challenge violations of the circular. However, its definition of inherently governmental function is part of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which is legally binding. OFPP Policy Letter 11-01, issued in 2011, provides guidance on inherently governmental functions, relying on existing authorities. Policy Letter 11-01 relies on existing authorities and adopts the FAIR Act's definition of an inherently governmental function. It provides clarification and elaboration on this definition, noting that these functions require the exercise of discretion and making value judgments for the Federal Government. The listings of inherently governmental functions in its Appendices mirror those in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). Policy Letter 11-01 expands on existing authorities by establishing two new tests for identifying inherently governmental functions in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). One test is based on the \"nature of the function,\" categorizing functions involving U.S. sovereign power as inherently governmental. The other test focuses on the \"exercise of discretion,\" prohibiting agencies from contracting out functions that involve decision-making without existing guidance. Policy Letter 11-01 establishes tests for identifying inherently governmental functions in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and requires agencies to ensure contractors do not perform these functions before and after awarding a contract. Agencies must review designated functions, analyze requirements, and monitor contractor performance and contract management. Policy Letter 11-01 instructs agencies to reestablish control over contractors performing inherently governmental functions by strengthening oversight, insourcing work, refraining from contract options, or terminating contracts. It defines \"critical functions\" as essential for agency operations and mandates federal employees to manage them. Agencies can outsource critical functions under certain conditions. The policy letter allows agencies to contract out critical functions under specific conditions, ensuring federal employees maintain control. It emphasizes that critical functions vary among agencies and over time. Additionally, it provides guidance on functions closely associated with inherently governmental tasks, requiring agencies to consider federal employees, allocate resources for contract management, and ensure special attention to contract performance. Policy Letter 11-01 outlines conditions for agencies to contract out critical functions while maintaining federal control. It emphasizes the need for agencies to allocate resources for contract management and ensure special attention to contract performance. OFPP may consider amending other authorities, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation, in line with Policy Letter 11-01. The Federal Acquisition Regulation is the primary document for uniform acquisition policies. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provides uniform policies and procedures for acquisition by executive agencies. It includes Subparts 7.3 and 7.5, addressing contractor versus government performance and inherently governmental functions. Subpart 7.3 outlines procedures for contracting out functions appropriate for private-sector performance under OMB Circular A-76. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 7.5 ensures that inherently governmental functions are not performed by contractors. It defines inherently governmental functions as those intimately related to the public interest and requiring discretion or value judgments. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 7.5 defines inherently governmental functions as involving the discretionary exercise of Government authority and monetary transactions. These functions include interpreting and executing laws, binding the United States to actions, protecting national interests, affecting private individuals, controlling officers and employees, and managing property. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 7.5 defines inherently governmental functions as involving the discretionary exercise of Government authority and monetary transactions, including control over the acquisition, use, or disposition of property and Federal funds. Inherently governmental functions do not include providing advice or performing routine internal tasks like building security or mail operations. Subpart 7.5 provides detailed lists of functions considered inherently governmental and those that may approach that category. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 7.5 defines inherently governmental functions as involving the discretionary exercise of Government authority and monetary transactions. It includes direct control of criminal investigations, leadership of military personnel, conducting foreign relations, and directing federal employees. The FAR provides no further elaboration on these functions beyond the lists provided. The FAR does not provide guidance on functions approaching being inherently governmental beyond identification. Agencies are not barred from contracting out these functions, and a federal court decision suggests agencies can contract for functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions. The FAR's provisions on inherently governmental functions apply to executive branch agencies not exempted from the FAR, but Subpart 7.5 does not apply to services obtained through personnel appointments, advisory committees, or personal services contracts issued under statutory authority. The FAR is legally binding, but agencies can deviate from it under certain conditions. Executive orders have designated functions as inherently governmental or commercial. GAO decisions have also addressed these designations. The GAO addresses the designation of functions as inherently governmental or commercial in advisory opinions and bid protests. GAO's decisions are not legally binding and are based on OMB Circular A-76 and the FAR. The GAO's decisions on inherently governmental functions are discussed in advisory opinions and bid protests, not federal court decisions. The test looks for substantial discretionary authority or value judgments by government contractors. An example is the NRC's proposal to contract out licensing tests for nuclear reactor operators. The GAO found that the proposed contract for licensing tests did not involve inherently governmental functions as the NRC guidelines provided detailed guidance, limiting contractor discretion. Agency personnel, not contractors, would decide who received licenses. This decision aligns with GAO's approach in determining inherently governmental functions. The General Services Administration (GSA) proposed to contract out seven functions previously performed in-house for transportation audits. GAO found two functions to be inherently governmental, two commercial, and three unclear. GAO considers actual supervision over contractors for inherently governmental functions. The General Services Administration (GSA) proposed to contract out seven functions previously performed in-house for transportation audits. GAO found two functions to be inherently governmental, two commercial, and three unclear. GAO considers actual supervision over contractors for inherently governmental functions. Requesting set-off actions against transportation carriers, communicating with U.S. attorneys for collection actions against delinquent carriers, agency hearing officer duties, preparing congressional testimony, legally required audit tasks, candidate selection for programs, approving departures from policy, certifying new technologies, determining safety standards, identifying overcharges, and assessing individuals' suitability for employment or security clearances are recognized functions. The General Services Administration (GSA) proposed to contract out seven functions previously performed in-house for transportation audits. GAO found two functions to be inherently governmental, two commercial, and three unclear. GAO considers actual supervision over contractors for inherently governmental functions. Federal courts have also addressed the question of whether specific functions are inherently governmental or commercial. The courts determine whether functions are inherently governmental or commercial in two main contexts: litigation under various acts and regulations, and litigation concerning constitutional rights. The latter includes cases on the \"state action doctrine\" and the \"private delegation doctrine.\" The courts do not have an independent definition of inherently governmental functions and rely on sources like the FAIR Act. They give deference to the executive branch's classification of functions as governmental or commercial due to the political question doctrine. In Arrowhead Metals, Ltd. v. United States, the court classified coinage of money as inherently governmental. The court categorized the coinage of money as inherently governmental because it is a power granted to Congress by the Constitution. The U.S. Mint has discretion to determine if stamping blanks constitutes coinage. The court aims to avoid legislative-executive controversy on this issue. In other cases, courts use a test similar to GAO's for inherently governmental functions, focusing on the degree of private party discretion in government tasks. Functions like conducting elections and providing police services are considered inherently governmental. The court categorized functions like conducting elections and providing police services as inherently governmental. Other functions include exercising eminent domain, investigating child abuse allegations, and holding prisoners' personal property. Designations of functions as inherently governmental have the force of law in judicial decisions. The designation of a function as inherently governmental means that the contractor must uphold constitutional rights for private individuals and may claim sovereign immunity. This designation does not prevent the contractor from performing other functions under the contract. The various authorities discussed differ in their treatment of inherently governmental and other functions. The key differences lie in their provisions elaborating on the definition of inherently governmental functions, reflecting the source's intended purpose and use. For example, OMB Circular A-76 includes a definition and discussion of commercial services not found in other sources. Similarly, OFPP Letter 11-01 is designed to assist agency officers and employees in ensuring that only Federal employees perform inherently governmental work. The OFPP Letter 11-01 is designed to assist agency officers and employees in ensuring that only Federal employees perform work that is inherently governmental or needs to be reserved to the public sector, including a definition of critical functions and tests for identifying such functions."
