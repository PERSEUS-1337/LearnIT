    "content": "This report analyzes U.S.-Malaysia relations, Malaysia's domestic politics, economy, environment, external relations, and geopolitical context within Southeast Asia. Congress has expressed interest in various issues regarding Malaysia. The relationship between the United States and Malaysia is complex, with bilateral ties closer than they may appear. Malaysia, a majority Muslim nation of 31 million people, is a partner in numerous U.S. security and economic initiatives in Southeast Asia. Malaysia is a major U.S. trading partner with substantial U.S. investment. Concerns about China's assertiveness in the South China Sea have driven closer U.S.-Malaysia ties. However, contentious issues like human rights and U.S. counter-terrorism policy have limited the depth of the relationship. Malaysia maintains a foreign policy that balances between the U.S., China, and other powers under Prime Minister Najib Razak. Under Prime Minister Najib Razak, Malaysia has maintained a foreign policy that balances between the U.S., China, and other powers. The U.S. has increased attention on Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, through strategic rebalancing. U.S.-Malaysia relations warmed considerably, with cooperation in military exchanges, training exercises, counter-terrorism, and maritime domain awareness. Malaysia signed the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) but the U.S. withdrew. Malaysia plays an active role in the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and criticizes U.S. military interventions. Malaysia has criticized U.S. military interventions in the Middle East and support for Israel, suggesting the U.S. is \"anti-Islam.\" Malaysian statements have moderated under Prime Minister Najib, but rising tension among some Muslim leaders is evident. The U.S.'s withdrawal from the TPP and actions by the Trump Administration have created uncertainty in Malaysia about the U.S.'s approach and commitment to the region, contributing to perceptions of anti-Islamic sentiment. The U.S.'s uncertain policy shifts may affect how Asian states view their relationships with the U.S. and China. Malaysia welcomed the Asia rebalance as a sign of U.S. commitment, but questions arise about waning commitment under the new administration. Malaysia's history includes small kingdoms, Islam adoption, and colonization by Portuguese and Dutch. In the late 18th through mid-19th centuries, various principalities on the Malaysian Peninsula and northern Borneo fell under British influence. Japan briefly ousted European powers during World War II, but Britain restored governance after 1945, forming the Federation of Malaya in 1948. The Malayan Communist Party waged a guerrilla campaign against British rule, leading to the defeat of the Communist campaign known as \"the Emergency.\" Peninsular Malaya gained independence. In 1957, Peninsular Malaya gained independence as a constitutional monarchy. Singapore, Sabah, and Sarawak joined the new Federation of Malaysia in 1963, but Singapore was later forced out in 1965 due to political disagreements. Race riots in 1969 led to the implementation of the New Economic Policy favoring bumiputra over minority groups. The Malaysian government promoted economic growth through agricultural improvements and industrialization, favoring bumiputra over minority groups. The UMNO-led coalition has maintained political stability, with Mahathir Mohamad playing a central role in shaping a more secular Malaysia. During his time in power, Mahathir Mohamad strengthened religious leaders and reduced the privileges of Malaysia's royalty. He also worked to suppress dissenting voices in politics, media, and civil society. His influence is still felt in Malaysia's political landscape, with both current prime ministers and opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim having been his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. Mahathir remains a prominent political figure in Malaysia, occasionally opposing the policies of leaders like Najib. Malaysia faces challenges in achieving its goal of prosperity, including ethnic and religious tensions, a volatile political climate, and dissent within the ruling coalition and opposition. Malaysia's economy relies heavily on natural resources like oil, gas, and timber, facing opposition to economic reform from Malay-centric groups. As a key member of ASEAN, Malaysia works on regional trade integration and attracting foreign investment amidst China's growing influence in East Asia. Malaysia's economy heavily relies on natural resources like oil, gas, and timber, facing opposition to economic reform from Malay-centric groups. As a key member of ASEAN, Malaysia works on regional trade integration and attracting foreign investment amidst China's growing influence in East Asia. Concerns arise over Beijing's assertiveness in regional affairs, particularly through the militarization of disputes in the South China Sea. Malaysia is a federated constitutional monarchy with a rotating Head of State, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, elected every five years by the nine Sultans. The Constitution includes special safeguards for Sabah and Sarawak in East Malaysia, with a federal parliament consisting of the Dewan Negara and Dewan Rakyat. The Malaysian political landscape is dominated by the Barisan National Coalition, led by Prime Minister Najib's United Malays National Party. The coalition holds a majority in parliament but falls short of the two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution. The main opposition alliance, Pakatan Harapan, consists of key parties like Parti Amanah Negara, Democratic Action Party, and Parti Keadilan Rakyat. Additionally, the Islamic party PAS and former Prime Minister Mahathir's Parti Pribumi Bersatu play significant roles in the political scene. Malaysia's political landscape is characterized by the dominance of the Barisan National Coalition led by Prime Minister Najib's United Malays National Party. The opposition includes Pakatan Harapan and other significant parties like Parti Pribumi Bersatu. Political competition in Malaysia occurs along ethnic lines, with the ruling coalition losing some of its grip on power. Despite strong political divides, Malaysia has maintained political stability since gaining independence in 1957. UMNO, Malaysia's dominant political party, has ruled the country since independence. The party's position in the ruling coalition reflects the importance of ethnicity in Malaysian politics. The implementation of the NEP in the 1970s aimed to reduce tensions between the Muslim Malay majority and minority groups. The issue of bumiputra preferences and ethnic identity has become a defining issue in Malaysian politics. Chinese- and Indian-based parties in the ruling coalition have performed poorly in recent elections. The ruling coalition in Malaysia has become less multi-ethnic as Chinese- and Indian-based parties have performed poorly in recent elections. The Parti Islam se-Malaysia (PAS) split from the opposition coalition in 2015 due to hardline Islamist, pro-Malay elements pushing for an Islamic legal code. Malaysia's political landscape faces obstacles like uneven election districting and disproportionate parliamentary seats in East Malaysia, favoring UMNO. Opposition leaders often face government harassment and legal actions aimed at defamation. The Najib government in Malaysia faced criticism for restrictions on freedom of expression, including the repeal of the Internal Security Act in 2011 and the introduction of the Security Offenses (Special Measures) 2012 Act in 2012. Despite some improvements, human rights groups still found the measures overly restrictive. Prime Minister Najib also faced political pressure in 2015 over reports of nearly $700 million linked to him. In 2015, Prime Minister Najib faced pressure over allegations of corruption involving the Malaysian investment fund 1MDB and a decade-old case. He denied wrongdoing, reshuffled his Cabinet, and used the Sedition Law to silence critics. Media and civil society groups criticized the government for repressing political dissent. Despite structural handicaps, Malaysian politics has become increasingly competitive over the past two national elections in 2008 and 2013. The BN coalition failed to win two-thirds of Parliament's seats for the first time in 2008. In 2013, the BN won only 47% of the popular vote compared to 51% for the opposition coalition, but still secured over 60% of Parliament's seats. Opposition parties alleged electoral fraud, leading to public protests in Kuala Lumpur. The position of opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim is sensitive in Malaysia and U.S.-Malaysia relations. Anwar, a former Deputy Prime Minister, was arrested after a public break with the Prime Minister in 1998. Anwar Ibrahim, a former Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia, was arrested in 1998 after a public break with Prime Minister Mahathir. He was accused of sodomy, leading to a politically motivated trial and conviction in 1999. Anwar was released in 2004 after the Supreme Court overturned his conviction, becoming a prominent figure in the political opposition. However, he was arrested again in 2008 on separate sodomy charges, leading to his sentencing to five years in prison in 2014, depriving the opposition coalition of its leader. Prime Minister Najib is expected to call for early elections in 2017 to solidify his position, with analysts predicting a victory for him and the Barisan National due to a fragmented opposition. The outcome will determine Najib's future as leader, with any loss of seats prompting a leadership change in UMNO. Bilateral ties between the U.S. and Malaysia have been cooperative but strained by domestic sensitivities, particularly regarding Malaysia's identity in the Muslim world. The decision to \"elevate\" the U.S.-Malaysia relationship to a \"Comprehensive Partnership,\" announced during former President Obama's April 2014 visit, indicated cooperation on a wider range of issues. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has emphasized building stronger relations with the United States, with visible support for U.S. initiatives. Former President Obama's visit in 2014 promoted bilateral cooperation, particularly in people-to-people ties like the Fulbright English Teaching Assistant program. Malaysia has taken steps to support U.S. initiatives, including enacting legislation to strengthen restrictions on nuclear materials shipment and joining the Proliferation Security Initiative. The country has also sent military medical personnel to Afghanistan and cooperated with the U.S. to combat terrorist groups in Syria. These actions mark a change in the bilateral relationship, which was previously strained under former Prime Minister Mahathir. Following Mahathir's retirement as Prime Minister in 2003, barriers to warmer bilateral ties eased, although Malaysia still opposes U.S. support for Israel. Efforts to negotiate a U.S.-Malaysia free trade agreement in the mid-2000s failed, but Malaysia joined TPP negotiations in 2010. The emergence of corruption scandals linked to Prime Minister Najib in 2015 poses a dilemma for U.S. policy towards Malaysia. Najib has prioritized good relations with the U.S. and supported several U.S. initiatives. Najib prioritized good relations with the United States and was known as a pro-American leader in Malaysia. However, U.S. support for Najib raised concerns about tolerance for corruption and could alienate segments of the Malaysian public. The U.S. Justice Department filed a civil forfeiture complaint seeking the recovery of over $1 billion in assets linked to a corruption scandal involving Najib. The United States is pursuing an international conspiracy to recover over $1 billion laundered from a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund. The fund, 1MDB, intended for economic development, was allegedly misappropriated by officials and used to finance the movie The Wolf of Wall Street. This is the largest action under the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative. In March 2014, Malaysia's highest appeals court overturned the acquittal of opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim on a sodomy charge, raising concerns about the rule of law and court independence. Former President Obama addressed human rights during his visit in April 2014 but did not meet with opposition leaders. The U.S. reaction to Malaysia's 2013 parliamentary elections, marred by allegations of electoral fraud, was critical. The State Department upgraded Malaysia's ranking in its Trafficking in Persons Report from Tier 3 in 2014 to Tier 2 Watch List in 2015, sparking controversy. Critics allege that the State Department overlooked evidence of Malaysia's human trafficking problems. Large camps were discovered on the Malaysia-Thailand border in May 2015 where migrants were abused and possibly murdered by smugglers. Senior State Department officials allegedly overruled TIP analysts to maintain good relations with Malaysia. The Trade Promotion Authority legislation passed in 2015 does not confer expedited legislative procedures to implementing legislation for a trade agreement with a country that receives a Tier 3 ranking in the TIP Report. Despite discord at the political leadership level, the United States and Malaysia have maintained steady defense cooperation since the 1990s, with improved aspects in the 2010s as the overall relationship warmed. The former Obama Administration's strategic rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific region emphasized bolstering security ties with Malaysia. The Asia-Pacific region focused on enhancing security ties with Malaysia and other emerging partners due to the global terrorist threat dynamics created by the Islamic State organization. Malaysia has been a key player in counter-terrorism efforts in Southeast Asia, establishing the Southeast Asia Regional Centre for Counter-Terrorism in 2003. Despite not being a known base for major terrorist groups, Malaysia has faced terrorist incidents and has worked to prevent the flow of foreign fighters and financing to terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq. The United States and Malaysia have strengthened cooperation in tracking financial flows and information sharing to combat terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq. This includes joint military exercises, ship visits, and military education exchanges. Malaysian officers study at U.S. military institutions through IMET programs to enhance professionalism. Cooperative activities between the U.S. and Malaysian militaries include jungle warfare training, bilateral exercises like Kris Strike, and multilateral exercises like Cobra Gold in Thailand. Since 2010, Malaysia has participated in multilateral naval exercises like RIMPAC near Hawaii with the United States. U.S. military vessels dock in Malaysia for re-supply and maintenance, fostering ties with Malaysian counterparts. Cooperation extends to peacekeeping, counter-piracy, and reconstruction operations globally. Malaysia deployed military medical personnel to Afghanistan from 2010 to 2013, contributing to public health and clean water access. The U.S. and Malaysian navies collaborate to combat piracy in the Malacca Strait and off the Horn of Africa. Malaysia is a significant contributor to U.N. peacekeeping operations and has purchased high-technology weapons systems from the U.S. and European countries. The Malaysian defense budget for FY2017 is $3.6 billion, representing a 13% drop from the previous year. Malaysia is a major trading partner for the United States, with the U.S. being an even more important trading partner for Malaysia. In 2016, Malaysia was the 24th largest market for U.S. goods exports and the 14th largest supplier of U.S. goods imports. In bilateral trade, the United States is Malaysia's 4th largest export market and supplier of imports. There are discrepancies in reported trade values, leading to a greater trade deficit for the U.S. and a smaller surplus for Malaysia. Electrical machinery dominates trade flows, reflecting Malaysia's role in consumer electronics. Over 600 U.S. companies operate in Malaysia, with a total FDI of $14.4 billion as of 2014, mainly in manufacturing. The FDI in Malaysia as of the end of 2014 was $14.4 billion, with one-third in manufacturing and another third in mining and energy extraction. Malaysia is mentioned in trade relations speculation along with India, Indonesia, and Vietnam. Deforestation for palm oil plantations is a major environmental issue in Malaysia, with palm oil and pulp wood companies responsible for over half of the deforestation in Malaysian Borneo. Malaysia lost significant forest cover on Borneo between 1973 and 2015, with a large portion converted to plantations. The country overall lost 14.4% of its forest cover between 2000 and 2012. Malaysia aims to maintain 50% forest cover and reduce carbon intensity by 40% by 2020. The country signed the Paris Climate Agreement in 2016 and faces challenges from carbon emissions due to palm oil plantations. The draining and burning of carbon-rich peatlands associated with palm oil production release carbon and methane into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming emissions for decades. Forest fires from the conversion of native forests to palm plantations have led to over 100,000 premature deaths in Southeast Asia in 2015 due to exposure to fine particle pollution. The European Parliament voted for a single Certified Sustainable Palm Oil scheme for European-bound palm oil to ensure environmentally sustainable production. Malaysia opposes the resolution linking palm oil to deforestation, with concerns for biodiversity in Borneo. The Heart of Borneo Initiative aims to conserve 240,000 km of land in Borneo's central highland forests. The Heart of Borneo Initiative aims to conserve 240,000 km of land in Borneo's central highland forests to protect the biodiversity, including the critically endangered Bornean Orangutan. Illegal logging and habitat destruction are major threats to the orangutan population, which is estimated to decline by 86% between 1973 and 2025. Malaysia's economy has recovered from the 2009 downturn and is close to pre-crisis levels. Prime Minister Najib faces pressure to achieve the goal of becoming a developed nation by 2020 while addressing regional disparities. Economic growth has been affected by a slowdown in China and declining commodity prices. The most prosperous regions in Malaysia are Selangor, Kuala Lumpur, Johor, and Sarawak. Malaysia's economy has recovered from the 2009 downturn and is close to pre-crisis levels. Prime Minister Najib aims to achieve developed nation status by 2020 while addressing regional disparities. The most prosperous regions, Selangor, Kuala Lumpur, Johor, and Sarawak, contribute significantly to the GDP. In contrast, poorer regions like Kedah, Kelantan, Perak, and Perlis, as well as Sabah, have less manufacturing and services activity. Urban centers like Kuala Lumpur are prosperous, while rural areas are underdeveloped. Ethnic groups also face differing economic conditions, with Chinese-Malaysians playing a key role in commerce and trade. Malaysia's economy is divided between wealthy Indian-Malaysians and economically disadvantaged Malays and indigenous people. The services sector contributes significantly to the GDP, with trade-related services and tourism dominating. Malaysia is a major exporter of oil, natural gas, consumer electronics, cocoa, palm oil, and rubber. Malaysia exports cocoa, palm oil, and rubber. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement was signed in February 2016, but the United States under President Trump decided not to ratify it. The TPP included commitments on trade, investment, labor, and environmental standards. Malaysia, without an existing U.S. FTA, would have benefited economically from adhering to the TPP. The U.S. withdrawal from the TPP has created uncertainty in the U.S.-Malaysia trade relationship. Points of contention included commitments on state-owned enterprises, government procurement policies, intellectual property rights protection, and market access. The Trump Administration is reviewing trade ties with Malaysia due to bilateral trade deficits. The U.S. withdrawal from the TPP has created uncertainty in the U.S.-Malaysia trade relationship. Malaysia may be interested in an economic dialogue such as a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) with the U.S. Another regional trade grouping, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), is currently negotiating a pact that includes Malaysia. Malaysia's focus on RCEP has increased since the US withdrawal from the TPP. Observers believe this move may allow China to strengthen its economic influence in Asia. Malaysia plays a significant role in ASEAN as a mediator and regional leader. Malaysia plays a significant role in ASEAN, chairing in 2015 and actively participating in various initiatives such as the ASEAN Defense Ministers Meeting-Plus. Key issues include managing relations with Singapore, addressing the insurgency in southern Thailand, combating piracy in the Straits of Malacca, repelling Philippine armed groups in Sabah, and managing immigration and migrant labor communities. Malaysia's role in ASEAN involves managing relations with neighboring countries, addressing various security issues, and handling immigration and labor communities. The country faces challenges such as territorial claims in Sabah and a large influx of refugees from Burma and Bangladesh. Malaysia maintains a delicate balance in its relations with China and the United States, with significant investments and military agreements with China. Minister Najib's visit to Beijing in November 2016 resulted in Malaysia purchasing four naval vessels from China. Some see this as Malaysia shifting towards China due to increasing Chinese investment and Najib's frustration with the U.S. Justice Department's pursuit of the 1MDB case. This move is seen as diluting U.S. influence in the region and signaling a strategic shift by Malaysia. Recent diplomatic moves by Malaysia and the Philippines to improve relations with Beijing may signal a new balance of power in Asia. Malaysia's engagement with China is being closely watched to determine if it signifies a tilt towards China or a balanced approach with the United States. Malaysia, along with Brunei, the Philippines, and Vietnam, has maritime territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea. Malaysia has pursued a less forceful diplomatic approach and has been involved in negotiations for a Code of Conduct to manage behavior in disputed waters. In 2013, Malaysia's claims in the South China Sea overlapped with Chinese claims, as well as with claims by the Philippines, Vietnam, and Taiwan. Despite being geographically farther from China, Malaysia has had fewer incidents at sea with Chinese vessels. However, Chinese naval vessels have been operating closer to Malaysian waters since 2013. Malaysia did not heavily criticize China's reclamation activities in the South China Sea in 2014. Malaysia has economic interests in the South China Sea, particularly in oil and gas development. Chinese maritime vessels have interfered with Malaysia's state energy company operations. Malaysia has sought cooperation among Southeast Asian claimants to resolve disputes with China. Relations between Malaysia and North Korea soured after the assassination of Kim Jong-nam in Kuala Lumpur airport in 2017. Two women from Vietnam and Indonesia were charged with his murder, believed to be hired by someone else. Malaysia revoked visa-free entry for North Koreans following the incident. Malaysia's income from North Korean migrant workers, particularly in the mining sector in Sarawak, has been a significant revenue source for Pyongyang. The Malaysian military engages in various security activities with partners in Southeast Asia and beyond, including participation in the Five-Power Defense Arrangement (FPDA) with Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. Malaysia also conducts military exercises with China and India, and actively participates in regional security dialogues through ASEAN-led groupings. Malaysia actively participates in regional security dialogues and cooperative activities, including establishing communication links with Vietnam and collaborating with Indonesia and Singapore on anti-piracy measures in the Straits of Malacca. Kuala Lumpur promotes itself as a leading voice for moderate Muslim countries and maintains good relations with the United States and other Western countries. Malaysia is also involved in the Organization of Islamic Conferences (OIC) and has launched the Global Movement of Moderates (GMM) to counter extremist voices and improve the public image of Muslims worldwide. Malaysia has been active in mediating conflicts in Southeast Asia, such as between rebel Muslim groups and central governments in Thailand and the Philippines. The United States and Malaysia have made efforts to maintain a good relationship, but deeper cooperation may be hindered by U.S. concerns about Prime Minister Najib's standing and a growing U.S.-China strategic rivalry. The United States faces challenges in balancing its relationship with Malaysia, considering allegations of corruption and restrictions on civil liberties. Questions arise about maintaining ties with Najib, using public or private pressure to improve governance, and engaging a broader political spectrum. The future of Malaysian politics is uncertain, with the ruling coalition losing power and a fragmented opposition. The future of Malaysian politics is uncertain, with the ruling coalition losing power and a fragmented opposition. Dissatisfaction with government inefficiency and corruption could boost the opposition's popular support. Corruption allegations against Najib could make him a liability for UMNO. The NEP's ethnic preferences remain a key issue, fostering resentment among minorities. Former Prime Minister Mahathir's \"Vision 2020\" aimed to develop Malaysia by that year, but challenges persist. Malaysia faces competition from low-wage countries in manufacturing and struggles with an inadequate education system. Many top students leave for higher education or work abroad. Malaysia faces challenges in balancing regional trade and investment agendas while providing leadership on security issues in the South China Sea and promoting economic integration in Southeast Asia."
