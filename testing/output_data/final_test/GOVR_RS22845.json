Japanese government initially dismissed reports, but concerns grew as diplomatic relations with Pyongyang were being re-established. Unconfirmed reports from North Korean defectors suggested Japanese nationals were held captive. Support groups for victims' families formed in Japan, and politicians debated the issue. In 1998, Pyongyang's missile test over Japan raised security fears and increased public suspicion. Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi traveled to Pyongyang in 2002 to address the abduction issue. North Korean leader Kim Jong-il admitted to abducting 13 Japanese citizens between 1977 and 1983, claiming only five were still alive. The Japanese public was shocked and fixated on the drama. In May 2004, Koizumi returned to Pyongyang to secure the release of five abductees' children. Coverage of the abductees saturated the press, becoming Japan's top priority in North Korea policy. Kim Jong-il admitted the kidnappings, but provided forged death certificates and remains of dubious origin when pressed for proof. This deception angered the Japanese public. The Japanese public's anger at North Korea grew due to inconsistency and deception in the abduction issue. Tokyo decided to base its policy on the assumption that all remaining abductees are alive. Different Japanese prime ministers have handled the issue with varying approaches, influenced by public sentiment and international relations. Koizumi's visit to Pyongyang in 2002 initially brought attention to the problem, leading to a hardening stance towards North Korea. Shinzo Abe also took a tough stance on North Korea, which contributed to his rise in prominence. Since assuming office, Shinzo Abe has taken a hardline stance on North Korea, focusing on the abduction issue. He established a headquarters to coordinate abductee affairs, imposed sanctions on North Korea for missile and nuclear tests, and called for the return of all abductees. Yasuo Fukuda, his successor, has shown interest in re-engaging in talks but has not indicated a change in policy. Advocacy groups doubt his approach will mirror Abe's, but there has been little public opposition to the official policy on abductions. Advocacy groups, including the Association of the Families of Victims Kidnapped by North Korea and the National Association for the Rescue of Japanese Kidnapped by North Korea, have gained influence as the controversy over abductions has grown. Megumi Yokota, a 13-year-old girl reportedly abducted by North Korean agents, has become a symbol for the outrage over the abductees' fates. Megumi Yokota, 13, was reportedly abducted by North Korean agents on her way home from school. North Korean officials claimed she committed suicide in 1993. Her case drew widespread media attention and her parents have become advocates for abductee causes. President Bush met with the Yokotas in 2006, calling it a moving encounter. Yokota's high profile makes any progress or setbacks in resolving her case symbolically important. The public outrage over Megumi Yokota's case is significant. North Korea provided what they claimed were her remains to Japan, but they were not hers. A possible path to reconciliation is a reunion of Yokota's parents with their granddaughter. The Bush Administration's efforts to reach a deal with North Korea have caused concern in Japan. The removal of North Korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism is likely, which has created distance between Washington and Tokyo. The removal of North Korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism is likely, with the U.S. considering it as part of agreements in the Six-Party Talks. The issue of abduction has been linked to North Korea's inclusion on the list, but State Department officials claim it is not a legal obstacle for removal. Japan has expressed concerns about the potential delisting, fearing it could affect the Japan-U.S. alliance. Japanese analysts believe that the U.S.-Japan relationship could be impacted if Washington accepts a weak deal with North Korea. The Japanese public's perception of the U.S. handling of the abduction issue could affect support for strategic interests, including U.S. military bases in Japan. However, if North Korea makes concessions on disarmament and the U.S. continues to push for information on the abductions, the Japanese public may be more accepting. A working group established in the Six-Party Talks aims to resolve bilateral controversies between Tokyo and Pyongyang. The working group established in the Six-Party Talks aims to resolve bilateral controversies between Tokyo and Pyongyang, focusing on the normalization of relations and settlement of outstanding issues, including abductions and compensation for Japan's colonial rule. Despite two rounds of consultations yielding no major progress, the abduction issue remains politically sensitive in Japan, with some acknowledging \"abductee fatigue\" among the public. Government officials and opinion leaders in Japan are concerned about the abductee issue leading to the country's marginalization in North Korea negotiations. There is a fear of diplomatic isolation and security threats from North Korea, prompting support for potential policy shifts. Prime Minister Fukuda's pragmatic approach suggests a willingness to compromise on North Korea, moving away from the singular focus on abductions. Fukuda's focus on the abductions issue has isolated Japan in the Six-Party talks, leading to criticism that Japan plays the victim without taking responsibility for historical offenses. However, recent efforts by Abe and Fukuda have improved relations with South Korea and China, with signs of easing historical controversies. Fukuda visited China in January 2008 amid improving Sino-Japanese relations. During Fukuda's visit to China in January 2008, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao expressed understanding of Japan's position on the abductions issue and emphasized the potential for resolution through dialogue. South Korean President Lee Myung-bak indicated he would not pressure Japan for historical apologies and supported Japan's stance on the abductee issue. Lee also showed willingness to address human rights issues with North Korea. Chinese and South Korean negotiators are unlikely to actively advocate for the abductees, but both countries acknowledge the importance of Japanese involvement. Both Tokyo and Seoul recognize the need for Japanese involvement in any diplomatic arrangement with North Korea. Optimistic observers believe that new leadership in Tokyo and Seoul, along with Beijing's interest in maintaining smooth relations before the 2008 Summer Olympics and the Bush Administration's determination to reach a negotiated agreement this year, create a favorable environment for a breakthrough."
