    "content": "Federal campaign finance law, established in the 1971 Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), focuses on limits on contributions, funding source restrictions, and public disclosure. Amendments in 1974, 1976, and 1979 expanded the presidential public-financing system and imposed limits on campaign contributions and expenditures. The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, also known as \"BCRA\" or \"McCain-Feingold,\" was the first major change to campaign finance laws since 1979, banning large corporate and union donations (soft money) in federal elections. The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA) banned corporate and union donations to political parties in federal elections and restricted certain political advertising before elections. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) faced challenges in executing its functions due to a lack of quorum in 2008 but regained full strength with new appointments. Pending issues for the FEC include implementing portions of the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 (HLOGA). The Federal Election Commission (FEC) faced challenges in 2008 due to a lack of quorum but regained full strength with new appointments. The Senate considered four nominations for the FEC during the first session of the 110th Congress, but controversy surrounding one nomination led to the Senate declining to confirm or reject any of the nominees. The FEC faced challenges in 2008 with a lack of quorum. Three recess appointees' terms expired, leaving only two commissioners. In April 2008, Lenhard withdrew his nomination, followed by President Bush withdrawing other nominations. This left the Walther nomination pending and Weintraub in holdover status. In May 2008, President Bush nominated Bauerly, Hunter, and McGahn to the Commission. The Senate committee confirmed all three nominations on May 22, 2008. The Senate confirmed Bauerly, Hunter, McGahn, Petersen, and Walther on June 24, 2008. McGahn was elected as the Commission's chairman. The FEC's operating status was crucial between January and June 2008 due to the requirement of at least four Commissioners to approve agency rules and decisions. Legislative activity on campaign finance occurred during the 110th Congress. During the 110th Congress, legislative activity on campaign finance focused primarily on the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act (HLOGA) and the AFP extension. Approximately 50 bills related to campaign finance were introduced, with S. 1 becoming law as P.L. 110-81 on September 14, 2007, containing provisions on bundling and travel. The Honest Leadership and Open Government Act (HLOGA) passed during the 110th Congress includes provisions on campaign finance related to bundling, travel aboard private aircraft, and attendance at presidential convention events. The law prohibits Members from attending events paid for by registered lobbyists or private entities that hire lobbyists. Additional disclosure requirements for lobbyists' contributions exceeding $200 to political committees, presidential inaugural committees, and presidential libraries are also mandated. FEC rulemaking is needed to implement the bundling and campaign travel provisions of HLOGA. HLOGA requires disclosure of bundling activities by registered lobbyists, with political committees reporting the name, address, and employer of each lobbyist who made bundled contributions totaling over $15,000 in specified reporting periods. HLOGA mandates disclosure of bundling by registered lobbyists for contributions over $15,000 in specified reporting periods, providing more transparency. The FEC issued proposed rules requiring political committees to report bundled contributions meeting certain criteria. The FEC proposed rules to expand disclosure requirements for political committees, including \"lobbyist/registrant PACs,\" to address bundling issues. The NPRM raised questions about the scope of disclosure and whether it should apply beyond registered lobbyists. The FEC proposed rules to expand disclosure requirements for political committees, including \"lobbyist/registrant PACs,\" to address bundling issues. Interested parties, including Members of Congress, submitted comments on the NPRM. A FEC hearing in September 2008 discussed how bundling activities should be reported and the reporting of fundraising involving multiple individuals. The FEC has yet to announce final bundling rules despite the deadline set by HLOGA. The FEC faced delays in implementing bundling regulations due to a lack of quorum in 2008. Congress had the option to legislate bundling-disclosure details instead. HLOGA restricted campaign travel on private aircraft, requiring reimbursement at non-discounted coach or charter rates if first-class service was unavailable. The HLOGA restricts campaign travel on private aircraft, requiring reimbursement at fair market value. House Members, candidates, and staff are banned from flying on private, non-commercial aircraft. Senate, presidential, and vice-presidential campaign travel must be reimbursed at the charter rate. Political committees related to House candidates are prohibited from reimbursing campaign travel on private aircraft. The HLOGA restricts campaign travel on private aircraft, requiring reimbursement at fair market value. Senate, presidential, and vice-presidential travel reimbursement is based on candidate committees represented on a flight. Political committees must reimburse campaign travelers' shares of charter fare. Travel on government aircraft must also be reimbursed. Exceptions exist for certain types of travel. The Federal Election Commission requires reimbursement for campaign travel on private aircraft, with exceptions for candidate-owned or leased planes. Approval of an \"explanation and justification\" document summarizing public comments is needed before final travel rules are published. The FEC approved travel rules in 2007 but did not consider the E&J document, which requires at least four Commissioners' affirmative votes. The matter is still pending, and the FEC's authority to conduct administrative tasks will be extended until 2013 by P.L. 110-433. The House passed H.R. 6296 (Brady) to extend the FEC's Administrative Fine Program until 2013. The Senate and President Bush also approved the bill. The program sets penalties for financial-reporting violations and has processed over 1,600 cases, collecting $3.1 million in fines. Revenues go to the U.S. Treasury, not the FEC. Congress has extended the program multiple times with a \"sunset\" date. The House passed H.R. 6296 to extend the FEC's Administrative Fine Program until 2013, with penalties for financial-reporting violations. The program, not permanent, has collected $3.1 million in fines and revenues go to the U.S. Treasury. Other campaign finance measures have not passed the Senate during the 110th Congress. The Senate committee considered several bills related to campaign finance, including lifting limits on coordinated expenditures by political parties, proposing a voluntary system to publicly finance Senate campaigns, and discussing automated political telephone calls. These bills have not seen further legislative action. In contrast, the House passed three bills containing campaign finance provisions, in addition to lobbying reform measures. The House FY2008 Commerce, Justice, Science appropriations bill included an amendment to prohibit funds for enforcing BCRA's electioneering communication provision. Another bill, H.R. 2630, would restrict candidate campaign committees from paying spouses for campaign work and hold candidates personally liable for violations. H.R. 2630 and H.R. 3032 are bills that aim to change campaign finance regulations. H.R. 2630 shifts responsibility for compliance from campaign organizations to candidates. H.R. 3032 allows candidates to designate someone to handle campaign funds in case of their death, aiming to prevent asset disputes. H.R. 3032 allows candidates to provide instructions for disbursing campaign funds in the event of their death, giving them more control over their assets. Currently, treasurers are responsible for fund disbursement, but this bill would provide a legal mechanism for candidates to bypass the treasurer after their death. However, it does not offer additional remedies for candidate involvement in financial decisions while they are alive. H.R. 3032 allows candidates to have more control over their campaign funds, even after their death. Congress could amend FECA to clarify candidates' roles in directing campaign spending. Additionally, there have been discussions in the 110th Congress about regulating automated political calls, which also ties into campaign finance laws. Several bills in the 110th Congress aimed to address automated political calls, with hearings held by the House Administration Subcommittee on Elections and the Senate Rules and Administration Committee. Discussions focused on the constitutionality of restricting these calls and the frustration of voters and candidates. The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) prohibits corporate and union involvement in campaign finance. The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) prohibits corporate and union funds from financing political advertising known as electioneering communications, targeting specific federal candidates within a certain timeframe. The U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. (WRTL II) on June 25, 2007, questioned the constitutionality of this provision. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the electioneering communication provision was unconstitutional as applied to Wisconsin Right to Life (WRTL) ads in the 2004 election cycle. Following this decision, the FEC revised its electioneering communications rules, allowing certain payments for ads focusing on public policy issues. Reporting requirements for spending and donations on these ads to the FEC were also established. The FEC requires reporting of spending and donations for electioneering advertisements, with disclaimers identifying the responsible person or organization. Ads paid for with corporate or union funds must meet specific criteria to avoid direct candidate support. Ads should focus on policy issues or propose a commercial transaction. The new rules allow corporations and unions to fund issue-oriented advertising, potentially influencing elections. The FEC's rules suggest that even general references to elections or candidates could void safe harbor protection for corporate and union spending. Ads funded by corporate or union treasury funds must be strictly related to public policy. The new rules allow corporations and unions to fund issue-oriented advertising related to public policy during election periods. The implications of the rules will become clearer over time as advertisers test them during the 2008 election cycle and beyond. Litigation may also follow, as seen in the case of the unconstitutional \"Millionaire's Amendment\" declared by the U.S. Supreme Court in Davis v. Federal Election Commission. The FEC announced that the Millionaire's Amendment, allowing unlimited coordinated expenditures by political parties for self-financed opponents, is no longer enforceable. A rulemaking process will repeal related rules, clarifying its inapplicability in House campaigns. The FEC announced that the Millionaire's Amendment is no longer enforceable in House and Senate elections. The public comment period for the repeal of the FEC's rules on the Amendment will close on November 21, 2008. HLOGA is a significant campaign finance development in the 110th Congress, with other campaign finance bills introduced but receiving less attention. FEC activity has focused on rulemakings in response to congressional actions, particularly regarding HLOGA and campaign travel rules. The FEC is working on rulemakings related to lobbying and ethics laws, bundling, and electioneering communications. While some rules are straightforward, others are more complex and unclear. The agency is still considering how to implement certain sections of the law, and the interpretation of final rules will depend on future enforcement decisions. The FEC's ability to address major policy questions may be impacted by the addition of new Commissioners. The FEC is facing a substantial rulemaking and enforcement backlog due to the inability to consider major policy questions between January and June 2008. The agency's new Commissioners may further delay activities, with the HLOGA rulemaking being a prominent issue. The absence of bundling rules hinders disclosure required under HLOGA, which may not take effect until the 2010 cycle. Even with bundling-disclosure rules in place, fundraising practices may not necessarily change. Recent changes in campaign finance policy have been incremental since the 1970s. HLOGA requires more transparency about bundling but does not restrict the practice. The travel rules under HLOGA are still pending finalization, but the relevant portion of the law is already in effect. Congress has not focused on campaign finance legislation immediately after passing major laws like FECA and BCRA, as replicating the momentum needed for such laws is challenging in the short term. The pattern could also apply to HLOGA, with fundraising practices potentially remaining unchanged. Non-legislative activity is likely to keep campaign finance in the public eye, especially with the upcoming 2008 elections and heavy spending. Litigation and the FEC's actions will continue to shape policy, showing that campaign finance policy evolves beyond just Congress. As long as campaigns exist, Congress will face questions on regulating political money."
