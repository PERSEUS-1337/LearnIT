    "content": "Despite improvements in air quality in many polluted cities, clean air remains a challenge in the United States. Ozone and fine particles are the main concerns, with millions living in areas not meeting air quality standards. Since the Clean Air Act in 1970, emissions of major pollutants have decreased significantly. However, stricter standards for ozone and fine particles have been implemented due to increased understanding of their health effects. The Environmental Protection Agency attributes thousands of premature deaths annually to PM 2.5 pollution. Recent research links ozone pollution to premature mortality as well. There is pressure to tighten air quality standards, with a focus on major sources of pollution like coal-fired power plants and vehicles. The report discusses seven key air quality issues in the 109th Congress, including revising particulate standards and addressing pollution from power plants. The report provides an overview of key air quality issues in the 109th Congress, including legislation for electric power plants, mercury emissions, gasoline additives, ozone deadlines, and transportation planning conformity. EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson revised the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for particulate matter in 2006, citing health risks associated with particulate pollution. The EPA revised the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for particulate matter in 2006 due to health risks like reduced lung function, irregular heart beat, heart attacks, and premature death in people with heart or lung disease. The new standard for fine particles (PM 2.5) will cut the allowable concentration in the air over 24-hour periods from 65 to 35 \u00b5g/m3, but it will not be as strong as recommended by the agency's staff or scientific advisors. The CASAC panel recommended lowering the annual standard for PM 2.5 to 13-14 \u00b5g/m3, but the Administrator disagreed, citing insufficient scientific evidence. The Administrator acknowledged the health risks associated with higher PM 2.5 levels but emphasized the need for more research before considering a lower standard. EPA is conducting research to better understand the effects of PM-related pollution on mortality and morbidity for future evaluations. The EPA is considering modifying the annual PM 2.5 standard based on a fuller body of information. The PM NAAQS also includes thoracic coarse particles, known as PM 10-2.5. The PM 10 standard was remanded to EPA by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals for being a poorly matched indicator for thoracic coarse particles. EPA proposed a 24-hour standard in response to this decision. The EPA proposed a 24-hour standard for PM 10-2.5 at 70 \u00b5g/m 3, but ultimately kept the current PM 10 standard at 150 \u00b5g/m 3. The agency revoked the annual component of the PM 10 standard and defended its use of PM 10 as a coarse particle indicator. CASAC objected to the Administrator's decisions on both PM 10 and PM 2.5 standards. CASAC objected to the Administrator's actions regarding PM 10 and PM 2.5 standards. They expressed concern that the annual PM 2.5 standard was not protective of human health and recommended a reduction based on scientific evidence. The decision to retain the standard without change was deemed inadequate to protect public health. CASAC expressed surprise at the decision to revert to using PM 10 as the indicator for coarse particles, stating that retaining the existing daily PM 10 standard was not discussed during the advisory process. The Administrator is not required by statute to follow CASAC's recommendations, but must provide an explanation for any important differences. Courts generally defer to the Administrator's judgment on scientific matters. CASAC's objections to the Administrator's decisions could impact court challenges. EPA produced a Regulatory Impact Analysis for the new PM standards, estimating 1,200 to 13,000 prevented premature deaths annually. Critics argue that more stringent standards could prevent up to 30,000 premature deaths yearly. The EPA estimates the cost of meeting new air quality standards at $5.4 billion annually in 2020, with potential benefits ranging from $8 billion to $76 billion annually. A more stringent alternative would increase costs by 50% to $7.9 billion annually but nearly double the estimated benefits. The agency identified 141 counties with air quality worse than allowed standards. The EPA identified 141 counties with air quality worse than allowed standards. These nonattainment areas may require emissions control in 2-3 times more counties, impacting metropolitan areas with larger populations. 88 million people live in nonattainment counties, about 30% of the U.S. population. The new standards may affect even more areas. The EPA's new standard for National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) may impact a larger percentage of the population. States and EPA must identify nonattainment areas and submit State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to achieve attainment by 2015, with a possible extension to 2020. Various issues were raised during consideration of the standards. Issues were raised during consideration of the proposed standards, with some groups advocating for stronger standards while others questioned the agency's decision to strengthen the standard for all fine particles without differentiation based on source or chemical composition. These concerns may lead to court challenges or congressional oversight. The Clean Air Subcommittee of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee held oversight hearings on the PM proposal in July 2006. Congressional attention focused on the Clear Skies Act, which aimed to regulate pollutants from coal-fired power plants. A tie vote in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee blocked the bill from advancing in March 2005, ending further attempts to find a compromise. The Clear Skies Act, aimed at regulating pollutants from coal-fired power plants, faced postponements for discussions on a compromise. The bill proposed a cap-and-trade system for emissions and changes to existing regulations. Coal-fired power plants are major sources of air pollution in the US, subject to varying control requirements under the Clean Air Act. Multiple programs could be utilized to control emissions. Power plants, particularly older ones, are significant sources of pollution with limited emission control equipment. Compliance with Clean Air Act programs is complex for utilities, leading to delays in regulation. Power plants accounted for a large portion of sulfur dioxide, mercury, and nitrogen oxide emissions in 2003. Power plants are major sources of nitrogen oxides, fine particles, and carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S. With new air quality standards in place, reductions in NOx and SO2 emissions are necessary to meet regulations. Mercury emissions from power plants have also raised concerns, leading to fish consumption advisories in 44 states. The controversy over New Source Review requirements for power plants is pushing for more predictable regulations. Legislation like \"Clear Skies\" aims to address power plant pollution comprehensively through coordinated schedules and tradeable allowances. Key questions include the stringency of emission caps and whether CO2 will be included. Legislation like \"Clear Skies\" aims to reduce NOx emissions by 70%-80% and sulfur dioxide emissions by 70%-80% from 1998 levels. Mercury emissions would be reduced by 70%-90% from current levels. The most stringent bills would require these reductions by 2009 or 2010. CO2 emissions would also be capped. The Clear Skies bill (S. 131) proposes less stringent standards for NOx, sulfur dioxide, and mercury emissions, with phased reductions over a longer period of time. Senators Voinovich and Inhofe suggested changes to the deadlines and sulfur dioxide cap. The Clear Skies bill proposes a Phase 3 SO2 cap of 2.5 million tons in 2018. The Administration's analysis shows utilities may \"overcomply\" initially, leading to banked emission allowances that could delay required reductions. EPA does not expect full 70% emission reductions until 2026 or later. Clear Skies would also eliminate or restrict existing Clean Air Act requirements for electric generating units. Clear Skies bill proposes changes to Clean Air Act requirements for electric generating units, allowing opt-in to cap-and-trade program and removing certain deadlines for ozone and particulate standards. It does not include a cap on CO2 emissions. The Clear Skies bill does not include a cap on CO2 emissions, unlike other bills that address multiple pollutants. The Administration opposes CO2 controls due to potential economic impacts on U.S. industries, leading to different compliance strategies and support from the utility and coal industries. Some view CO2 controls as inevitable and desirable. Some utilities support cap-and-trade programs for CO2 and other pollutants. Clear Skies bill failed in the 109th Congress due to lack of consensus. Negotiations included offers to adjust Phase 2 caps and add a third phase for SO2. Opponents of the bill included all committee members. The opponents of the bill, including committee Democrats, Senators Jeffords, and Chafee, were willing to accept less stringent CO2 caps. However, compromises were not enough to pass the bill. EPA announced final regulations for utility emissions of SO2 and NOx through the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which projects significant reductions in emissions by 2015. The EPA projects a significant decline in SO2 and NOx emissions by 53% and 48% respectively by 2015 through the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). The rule is expected to result in $85-$100 billion in health benefits annually by 2015, preventing 17,000 premature deaths each year. EPA's analysis of the costs and benefits of Clear Skies and two Senate bills addressed concerns raised by opponents. The EPA analysis compared the costs and benefits of three bills, including Clear Skies, introduced by Senator Carper and Senator Jeffords. Adjusting for regulations, Clear Skies would have minimal costs and added benefits of $6 billion in 2010 and $3 billion in 2020. Senator Carper's bill would have significantly higher net benefits at costs of $4.2 billion in 2010 and $3 billion in 2020, while Senator Jeffords' bill would have even greater benefits at higher costs. In 2020, EPA finalized a cap-and-trade program for mercury emissions from electric utilities, relying on co-benefits of the Clear Skies rule. Less than 1% of coal-fired power plant capacity would install mercury pollution control equipment within 10 years, increasing to only 4% by 2020. EPA reversed course multiple times before deciding on its final approach to mercury regulation. The EPA was required to determine if regulating mercury from power plants under the Clean Air Act was necessary. In December 2000, it concluded that regulation was necessary, triggering the proposal of MACT standards for electric power plants. The proposed standards aimed to reduce mercury emissions by 30% from 1999 levels, with a facility-by-facility approach. The EPA proposed MACT standards in 2008 to regulate mercury emissions from power plants, but later chose to use Section 111(d) of the act instead. They argued that MACT standards were not necessary, leading to the establishment of a national cap-and-trade system for mercury emissions, aiming for a 70% reduction from 1999 levels by 2018. The EPA proposed a national cap-and-trade system for mercury emissions, aiming for a 70% reduction from 1999 levels by 2018. The caps will be implemented through an allowance system similar to the acid rain program, allowing utilities to either control pollutants directly or purchase excess allowances. Early reductions can be banked for later use, potentially delaying full compliance with the 70% reduction until after 2018. The EPA proposed a national cap-and-trade system for mercury emissions, aiming for a 70% reduction from 1999 levels by 2018. However, full compliance with the reduction would be delayed until after 2025. Critics argue that the cap-and-trade system may not address \"hot spots\" with high mercury concentrations, as facilities can purchase allowances instead of implementing emission controls. Some suggest that a MACT standard would be more effective in reducing mercury levels, calling for stricter regulations or faster implementation. The EPA's proposed cap-and-trade system aims to reduce mercury emissions by 70% from 1999 levels by 2018, with full compliance delayed until after 2025. Critics argue that this system may not address high mercury concentration \"hot spots\" effectively. The EPA's preference for controlling SO2, NOx, and mercury simultaneously would maximize emission control co-benefits, reducing the need for specific mercury controls before the 2020s. This approach would lead to minimal costs for controlling mercury emissions and a decline to about 50% of 1999 levels by 2020. The technology to control mercury emissions, such as activated carbon injection (ACI), has been successfully demonstrated in various tests at coal-fired power plants. Manufacturers and experts believe that implementing ACI and fabric filters could lead to a 90% reduction in mercury emissions at a reasonable cost in the near future. Cost considerations have influenced the EPA's analysis, but calculations suggest that a more stringent standard may be warranted. The EPA projected MACT compliance costs at $945 million per year, with benefits of more than $15 billion. However, the final rule changed this analysis, stating that the benefits of mercury control are at most $43 million per year, with costs as high as $896 million. Questions have arisen regarding the agency's legislative authority to establish a cap-and-trade program for mercury emissions. Several Senators and House members requested the EPA to withdraw the mercury proposal due to concerns about industry lobbyists' influence. The EPA Inspector General criticized the agency for instructing staff to develop a standard resulting in higher emissions. Opponents, including 15 states, have filed suit to overturn the weakened final rule. Congress could potentially reverse the rule under the Congressional Review Act. On June 29, 2005, Senator Leahy and 31 cosponsors introduced S.J.Res. 20 to disapprove the EPA's rule on regulating mercury from fossil-fueled electric utility units. A similar resolution (H.J.Res. 56) was introduced in the House by Representative Meehan. The Senate rejected S.J.Res. 20 on September 13, allowing the EPA rule to proceed despite pending judicial challenges and petitions for reconsideration. Groups petitioned EPA to reconsider the mercury rules due to parts of the final rules not being included in the proposal, denying the public the opportunity to comment. EPA agreed to reconsider on October 21, 2005, and announced completion on May 31, 2006, with minor changes. This allows court proceedings to move forward. The debate over power plant emissions regulation includes issues such as the enforcement of existing regulations like New Source Review. EPA has taken different stances on this under different administrations, with critics arguing that proposed changes will weaken the review process for plant modifications. The controversy surrounding New Source Review (NSR) involves EPA's application of standards to existing stationary sources of air pollution. Industry has avoided NSR by claiming modifications are routine maintenance. EPA began reviewing records in the 1990s to determine if changes were routine, leading to lawsuits against polluting sources for major modifications since late 1999. The EPA has charged utilities with NSR violations for making modifications to their plants without required reviews or pollution controls. 11 utilities have settled, agreeing to spend $5 billion on controls to reduce emissions by 775,000 tons annually. Petroleum refiners have also settled, eliminating 315,000 tons of pollution. Half of the utilities charged have not settled. The utilities charged with NSR violations have not settled with EPA, claiming that a strict interpretation of routine maintenance rules hinders them from making changes without costly permit reviews and pollution control equipment. Ohio Edison was found to have violated the Clean Air Act and settled by agreeing to spend $1.1 billion on pollution controls. In a case settled in April 2004, Duke Energy was found not to have violated the Clean Air Act despite increasing total emissions without undergoing New Source Review. The court ruled that since the maximum hourly emissions rate did not increase, the company was not required to install more stringent pollution controls. The Bush Administration made changes to NSR regulations to make future enforcement less likely. In December 2002 and October 2003, the agency made changes to NSR rules, including controversial regulations on routine maintenance exemptions for industrial facilities. These changes were seen as favoring older, more polluting facilities by some, while others viewed them as streamlining the program. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit struck down the \"equipment replacement / routine maintenance\" rule in March 2006, stating that the EPA's attempt to change NSR regulations was against the Clean Air Act. Proposed changes to NSR regulations in October 2005 and September 2006 have not been finalized yet, with a focus on hourly emissions achievable after modifications. The EPA's proposed rule change focuses on hourly emissions rather than annual emissions, potentially allowing increases in annual emissions with facility modifications. Internal documents show opposition from the Air Enforcement Division, citing concerns about enforcement effectiveness. This creates a conflict between regulatory actions and enforcement stance. The EPA's regulatory actions may conflict with its enforcement stance regarding the equipment replacement rule. Despite denials that the rule would impact ongoing investigations, EPA's enforcement chief indicated dropping actions against facilities with violations prior to the rule's promulgation. The EPA's regulatory actions may conflict with its enforcement stance regarding the equipment replacement rule. Investigations of possible violations at 70 power companies were affected by the prospect of an NSR rollback, causing delays in emission reductions. The National Academy of Sciences began a review of the NSR program in response to Congress's direction. The final report, issued July 21, 2006, found that over 60% of coal-fired electricity-generation capacity in the US lacks controls for SO2 and NOx emissions required under NSR. Older facilities are more likely to undergo maintenance, repair, and replacement, potentially affecting a significant portion of emissions. The report concluded that the proposed Equipment Replacement Provision could lead to emission increases in some cases. The committee concluded that due to a lack of data and limitations of current models, it is not possible to quantify the potential effects of NSR rule changes on emissions, human health, and energy efficiency. The National Academy of Public Administration recommended ending the \"grandfathering\" of major air emission sources and installing Best Available Control Technology or Lowest Achievable Emissions Rate control equipment. The NAPA panel recommended ending \"grandfathering\" of major air emission sources and implementing Best Available Control Technology or Lowest Achievable Emissions Rate control equipment. Congress addressed Clean Air Act issues in H.R. 6, focusing on ethanol and reformulated gasoline, while stripping provisions related to MTBE. In 1995, areas with severe or extreme ozone pollution were required to use reformulated gas with at least 2% oxygen by weight, commonly using MTBE. By 2004, 46% of RFG contained MTBE, which has also been used in non-reformulated gasoline as an octane enhancer since the late 1970s. MTBE leaks from underground gasoline storage tanks have led to groundwater contamination in the US. It can cause taste and odor issues in water and may pose a cancer risk. 25 states have banned or regulated its use, with California, New York, and Connecticut implementing significant bans in 2003. There is widespread support for eliminating the oxygen requirement nationwide and setting uniform regulations for MTBE and its potential replacements like ethanol. Opposition to legislation removing the oxygen requirement for gasoline came from agricultural interests due to ethanol production using corn. If MTBE use decreased but the oxygen requirement remained, ethanol demand would rise. Members of Congress from corn states were involved in MTBE and RFG legislation. H.R. 6, passed by the House in 2005, included provisions on MTBE and ethanol. The bill H.R. 6 in 2005 contained provisions banning MTBE as a fuel additive, except in authorized states, and required 5 billion gallons of ethanol in gasoline by 2012. It also repealed the Clean Air Act requirement for MTBE in RFG, with a focus on maintaining emissions reductions and assisting MTBE production facilities in converting to other fuel additives. The Senate version of H.R. 6 in 2005 included provisions for MTBE and ethanol, with differences from the House bill. It aimed to increase the renewable fuels standard to 8 billion gallons by 2012, phase out MTBE sooner, and did not include a nationwide presidential exception to the MTBE ban. The Senate version of H.R. 6 in 2005 differed from the House bill by omitting the safe harbor for MTBE producers and authorizing different amounts for cleanup of MTBE releases and transition assistance. Ultimately, the final version of the bill, signed into law as P.L. 109-58, did not ban MTBE use, provide a safe harbor for producers, or offer transition assistance, but it did address other issues. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 repealed the RFG program's oxygen requirement and mandated that motor fuels contain 7.5 billion gallons of ethanol or other renewable fuels by 2012. This could result in up to 30% of the nation's corn crop being used for ethanol production. The Act did not provide transition assistance for MTBE producers or ban MTBE use. The House-passed version of H.R. 6 included a provision to extend deadlines for areas not meeting ozone air quality standards if upwind areas significantly contribute to their nonattainment. This would allow for deadline extensions without requiring more stringent controls on emissions. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 did not include the House provision to extend deadlines for areas affected by upwind pollution. Instead, it established a demonstration project in Western Michigan to address ozone transport from Chicago and Milwaukee. EPA is required to work with state and local officials to assess compliance alternatives without imposing additional requirements or sanctions during the project. The House passed provisions in H.R. 3893 to extend deadlines for areas affected by upwind pollution, but the Senate has not taken action on this bill. The 109th Congress also considered the conformity of metropolitan area transportation plans with the Clean Air Act, with many areas needing State Implementation Plans to reach air quality standards. In nonattainment areas, federal funding for projects is contingent on conformity to State Implementation Plans (SIPs) under the Clean Air Act. Transportation Improvement Programs (TIPs) must demonstrate conformity to SIPs to receive funding for highway and transit projects. Prior to H.R. 3, TIPs had to be revised every two years to ensure compliance. Highway and transit projects in nonattainment areas must be part of a conforming TIP to receive federal funds. The transportation bill H.R. 3 (P.L. 109-59) signed in 2005 requires less frequent conformity demonstrations, shortens the planning horizon to 10 years in many cases, and establishes a 12-month grace period for conformity failures. Local air pollution control agencies must be consulted and public comments solicited if the planning horizon is to be shortened."
