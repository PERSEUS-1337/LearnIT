The House and Senate passed a bill with appropriations of $27.33 billion, which was signed into law on December 1. Additionally, the omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 included seven of the 13 programs. The omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 (H.Rept. 108-401) included seven of the 13 regular appropriations bills not yet passed. Energy and Water Development programs were affected by several provisions in the bill. The House and Senate approved the conference report on H.R. 2673, with the President signing the bill into law on January 23 (P.L. 108-199). The Energy and Water Development bill funds civil works projects for various agencies, with the Bush Administration requesting $26.946 billion for FY2004 compared to $26.198 billion appropriated for FY2003. The Energy and Water Development bill for FY2004 received $27.328 billion in funding, with the House recommending $27.080 billion and the Senate proposing $27.378 billion. The final bill, signed into law on December 1, also included a 0.59% rescission for non-defense programs. The Administration requested $4.19 billion for the Corps of Engineers in FY2004, focusing on construction projects like the Florida Everglades. The final funding amount was $4.571 billion in P.L. 108-137, with only one project receiving the full amount requested. The Department of the Interior programs requested $891 million for FY2004. The FY2004 Energy and Water Development bill included funding for Department of the Interior programs, with a final amount of $917 million. The DOE budget request for FY2004 was $21.689 billion, with major activities in energy research, general science, environmental cleanup, and nuclear weapons programs. The final bill funded these programs at $21.570 billion. Funding for fossil fuels, energy efficiency, and energy statistics was included in a separate appropriations bill. The FY2004 Energy and Water Development bill included funding for Department of the Interior programs totaling $917 million. The request for funding independent agencies in Title IV was $148 million, with the final bill providing $229 million. The President's request for FY2004 for the civil works program of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was also included. The President's FY2004 request for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' civil works program was $4.19 billion, a decrease of $445 million from FY2003. The final appropriations for the Corps totaled $4.57 billion, with an increase in construction funding. The omnibus FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations bill included $14 million in additional appropriations for the Corps' construction account. The FY2004 budget for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers included funding for various projects, with a focus on completing construction for priority projects. The budget also allocated funds for the design of new projects, but some projects would have proceeded more slowly due to limited funding. The FY2004 budget for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers included funding for priority projects, with a focus on completing construction. The Administration's request aimed to defer work on some design efforts and prioritize navigation, flood control, storm damage reduction, and ecosystem restoration projects over environmental infrastructure projects. The final legislation provided funding for several environmental infrastructure projects. The Administration's $70 million request for the Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies account was significantly higher than previous appropriations. The account finances response and recovery activities for flood and storm events, preparedness, and support for FEMA. P.L. 108-137 contained no funding for this account, citing recent replenishment with $60 million through P.L. 108-83 as the reason. The Conference report directed the Secretary of the Army to consider changes to the management of the depleted account with $60 million through P.L. 108-83 as the reason. Funding for the Corps' civil works program has been a contentious issue between the Administration and Congress, with final appropriations typically providing more funding than requested. Congress has consistently added additional funding to the Corps' budget, exceeding the amounts requested by the administrations in FY2001, FY2002, FY2003, and FY2004. The FY2004 budget request proposed a 10% cut from the initial appropriation amount enacted for FY2003. P.L. 108-137 restored appropriations to an amount closer to the Corps' FY2003 budget. Savings and Slippage and Reprogramming are included in the Corps' budget to account for delays or cost savings on projects. Congress has increased the S&S rates from the rates proposed by the Administration for the General Investigations and the Construction accounts since FY2002. The enacted S&S rates for FY2004 were higher than the Administration's requested rates for the Construction account. The Corps reprograms funds within accounts to reallocate money from projects not progressing as planned to those moving forward. Congress has provided guidance on reprogramming funds in the past, and exceeding S&S rates could impact project progress due to appropriations constraints. The enacted appropriations for FY2004 highlighted dissatisfaction with the Corps' reprogramming procedures. The Administration proposed legislative changes to utilize unused balances in the Inland Waterway Trust Fund and Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, but these proposals were dismissed. The Corps faced criticism during the 107th Congress for its project evaluation and implementation processes. The Corps faced criticism for project evaluation and implementation processes, with efforts to address issues through testimony and budget allocations for peer review panels. The Corps allocated $3 million for a peer review panel and $2 million for ex post facto studies of completed projects. Funding concerns arise as the Corps expands its role in environmental restoration programs, potentially displacing funding for other water resources activities. The Corps is heavily involved in the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, authorized by the Water Resources Development Act of 2000. The annual Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill provides funding for the Corps' participation in efforts related to water quality in the Everglades. The President's request for FY2004 included $145 million for construction projects in the region, with specific allocations for the Kissimmee River and Everglades restoration projects. The enacted legislation for FY2004 provided $137.5 million for the Corps' construction projects in the Everglades, including $39.0 million for CERP activities. $105 million was allocated for the Central and Southern Florida Project, with $17.7 million for the Kissimmee River restoration project and $14.8 million for the Everglades and South Florida ecosystem restoration project. Additionally, $0.5 million was included for the Florida Keys Water Quality Improvements project. The conference managers included $0.5 million for the Florida Keys Water Quality Improvements project in the FY2004 legislation. Funding for Everglades restoration is conditioned on water quality requirements, with specific conditions that must be met for federal funding to be available. The Energy and Water Development bill provides funding for the Bureau of Reclamation and the Central Utah Project Completion Account. The President requested $44.2 million for the Central Utah Project Completion Account for FY2004. The FY2004 budget for the Central Utah Project (CUP) Completion Account saw an increase of $8 million, with $6 million transferred from WAPA to DOI for the Utah Reclamation Mitigation and Conservation Fund. The total budget authority for the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) was $878 million, $37 million less than FY2003. The House-passed bill included $909.7 million for BOR, an increase of $31.7 million from the FY2004 request. The final bill for FY2004 included $948.3 million for the Bureau of Reclamation, with $863 million allocated for water resources management activities and $15 million for the California Bay-Delta Restoration Account. The House bill proposed an increase of $51.2 million for water resources management activities, while the Senate bill suggested an increase of $86.8 million. The FY2004 request also included a $30.8 million offset for the Central Valley Project Restoration Fund, resulting in a net current authority of $847.2 million for BOR. The final bill for FY2004 allocated $857.5 million for the Bureau of Reclamation, with the largest account being Water and Related Resources. The House bill proposed $817.9 million, while the Senate bill suggested $859.5 million. This included funding for various programs such as operations and maintenance, Dam Safety Program, Water and Energy Management Development, and Fish and Wildlife Management and Development. The Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) manages numerous dams and water diversion projects in the West, providing water to 10 million acres of farmland and 31 million people. BOR is the largest water supplier in the 17 western states and the second largest hydroelectric power producer in the nation. BOR facilities also offer flood control, recreation, and wildlife benefits, although they can be controversial due to their impact on sensitive species. The CALFED program, which focuses on water issues in California's Bay-Delta region, has not received funding since FY2000. Despite a request for $15 million in FY2004, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended no funds be allocated as the program lacks authorization. However, legislation has been passed to permanently authorize the Secretary of the Interior to undertake related activities. The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to conduct feasibility studies for water projects in California, including Sites Reservoir, Los Vaqueros Reservoir Enlargement, and Upper San Joaquin Storage. Funding for these projects is included in the FY2003 appropriation for the Bureau of Reclamation. The FY2003 appropriation for the Bureau of Reclamation authorized feasibility studies for water projects in California, including Sites Reservoir, Los Vaqueros Reservoir Enlargement, and Upper San Joaquin Storage. The FY2004 bill extended these feasibility studies indefinitely. Additionally, $28.6 million was requested for heightened safety and security efforts at BOR facilities, with a focus on facility operations/security and national security cyber systems. The BOR received an additional $25 million for homeland security expenses in P.L. 108-11, and a settlement was reached between the federal government and the Westlands Water District regarding irrigation water buildup issues. The $107 million settlement has been controversial due to its initial sum and potential for additional suits. The $107 million settlement between the federal government and Westlands Water District has sparked controversy due to the initial sum and potential for additional suits. The agreement involves retiring land from farming, with Westlands holding title to the land and water rights, plaintiffs retaining commodity base acreage, and the federal government receiving easements to prevent future farming use. Payment for the settlement faced obstacles, with the first installment being paid from the federal government Judgment Fund after a provision in the FY2003 omnibus appropriations bill blocked the use of appropriated funds. Future settlement payments remain uncertain. The conference committee directed the Bureau of Reclamation to expedite modifications to the Yuma Desalting Plant on the Colorado River near the U.S.-Mexico border. The plant, built in the early 1990s, has not been operated due to technical problems and high costs. Interest in using the treated water to fulfill U.S. treaty obligations has increased due to the region's drought conditions. The Yuma Desalting Plant near the U.S.-Mexico border is being prepared for operation to meet increased treaty obligations caused by drought conditions. The plant modifications are controversial due to cost and environmental concerns, with completion expected in 36 to 48 months at a cost of $24 to $28 million. Operating the plant annually is estimated to cost between $26 and $34 million, with an additional $5 million for standby maintenance. Environmental groups are worried about the impact on wetlands in Mexico from the plant's operations. The Yuma Desalting Plant near the U.S.-Mexico border is being prepared for operation to meet increased treaty obligations caused by drought conditions. The plant's discharge water supports protected wetlands in Mexico, but if operational, the treated water would be discharged into the Colorado River and the saline effluent into the wetlands. Environmental groups advocate for alternatives to plant operation, while supporters argue for the high demand for water in the United States. The Energy and Water Development bill includes funding for DOE's programs, with major activities focused on renewable energy, nuclear power, general science, environmental cleanup, and nuclear weapons programs. The FY2004 appropriation for DOE's programs was $21.57 billion, slightly lower than the Senate bill's allocation of $22.15 billion. The Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill for FY2004 included $1.7 billion for the Department of Energy. The budget request highlighted hydrogen energy as a promising solution to reduce dependence on imported oil. The DOE's Renewable Energy Program aims to accelerate progress in hydrogen technologies to make them cleaner, safer, and more cost-effective. The program also supports the National Climate Change Technology Initiative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through competitive solicitations in applied research. The budget request for FY2004 sought $444.2 million for the Renewable Energy Program, including funding for Renewable Energy Technologies and the Electric/Storage sub-program, with an increase of $24.7 million from the previous year. This included additional funding for hydrogen as part of the President's Hydrogen Fuel Initiative. The FY2004 budget included increased funding for Hydrogen and a National Climate Change Technology Initiative. The Concentrating Solar Power Program was terminated, and the Biomass and Biorefinery Program was cut. The House approved $407.5 million, with $330.1 million for Renewable Energy Technologies and $77.4 million for a new Office of Electricity Transmission and Distribution. The Senate approved $458.9 million, with $358.5 million for Renewable Energy Technologies and $100.4 million for OETD. Three floor amendments were approved, but did not propose funding changes. The final bill for FY2004 appropriated $426.8 million, with $344.4 million for Renewable Energy Technologies and $82.4 million for the Office of Electricity Transmission and Distribution (OETD). Specific funding allocations were made for wind farm transmission study, Clean Energy Technology Exports (CETE) Initiative, and grants for transmission system planning. The renewables total included funding for biomass/biofuels and solar energy. The agreement did not specify funding allocations as in the House and Senate reports but adopted the Senate proposal for the Clean Energy initiative. The agreement for FY2004 appropriated $426.8 million, with $344.4 million for Renewable Energy Technologies and $82.4 million for the Office of Electricity Transmission and Distribution (OETD). The agreement adopted the Senate proposal for the Clean Energy Technology Exports (CETE) Initiative, requiring a status report by January 15, 2004. The overall conference agreement was $17.4 million less than the request, with specific funding allocations for renewables and OETD. The FY2004 Appropriations Act allocated $3.8 million for Geothermal, $3.3 million for Program Direction, and additional funding earmarks totaling nearly $20 million for projects under DOE's Renewable Energy Program in the omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act. This includes funding for various renewable energy projects such as the Energy Center of Wisconsin Renewable Fuels Project, Wind Energy Transmission Study, Hawaii Hydrogen Center, and biomass restoration initiatives. The FY2004 Appropriations Act allocated funding for various renewable energy projects, including geothermal, program direction, and projects for renewable fuels, wind energy, hydrogen, and biomass restoration. Additionally, funding for nuclear energy research and development, advanced reactors, fuel cycle technology, and nuclear hydrogen production was requested, with a total of $390.6 million allocated, including $268.0 million for nuclear energy and $112.3 million for defense-related activities at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. The Senate increased the funding request for nuclear energy programs to $437.4 million, with $300.8 million allocated for nuclear energy programs and $112.3 million for defense-related activities at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. Critics argue that the nuclear research program provides wasteful subsidies to an industry they believe should be phased out. The Administration requested $48 million for nuclear energy technologies program, focusing on new reactor development. The Senate increased funding for nuclear energy programs to $437.4 million, with $300.8 million for nuclear energy programs and $112.3 million for defense-related activities at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. The request included $35.0 million for Nuclear Power 2010 and $9.7 million for Generation IV reactor designs. The House cut the request to $42.7 million, while the Senate increased it to $55.7 million. Conferees approved $44.0 million for nuclear energy technologies, with $20 million for Nuclear Power 2010 and $24 million for Generation IV. The Nuclear Power 2010 program aims to deploy new power plants in the US through cost-shared demonstration of regulatory processes and advanced reactor technologies. DOE is seeking proposals for joint DOE/industry teams with up to half of the costs covered. The Generation IV program is focusing on six advanced reactor designs, including gas-cooled, water-cooled, liquid-metal-cooled, and molten-salt concepts. Some reactors may use plutonium recovered from spent nuclear fuel. The Administration's National Energy Policy report supports plutonium recovery from spent nuclear fuel to reduce environmental impact and increase energy supplies. However, opponents argue that separating plutonium poses environmental risks and undermines nuclear weapons proliferation policy. The Generation IV program aims to develop plutonium-fueled reactors closely linked to the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative, with a budget increase for FY2004 to develop advanced fuel treatment technologies by 2015. The Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative (AFCI) aims to develop technologies for reducing the long-term hazard of spent nuclear fuel by separating plutonium, uranium, and other radioactive materials for re-use in nuclear reactors or transmutation. The program received funding from the House, Senate, and conferees, with a budget of $68.0 million. Additionally, the Department of Energy requested $4.0 million in FY2004 for a new \"Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative\" to support President Bush's program for hydrogen-fueled vehicles. The DOE's Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative aims to use high-temperature nuclear reactors to produce hydrogen from water, with estimates suggesting it could be cost-competitive with gasoline and reduce air pollution. Planned activities include developing a roadmap for nuclear hydrogen technologies and testing thermo-chemical processes. Despite potential success, significant quantities of nuclear-produced hydrogen may not be available until 2020-2030. Funding for the initiative was approved at $6.5 million by the conference committee, with support for the INEEL hydrogen production reactor. The conference committee approved $6.5 million for the Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative, in addition to the $15 million for the INEEL hydrogen reactor. The Nuclear Energy Research Initiative (NERI) provides grants for innovative nuclear energy technologies, with funding of $11.0 million provided by the conferees. The Nuclear Energy Plant Optimization program (NEPO) did not receive new funding in FY2004, after receiving $5.0 million in FY2003. The House rejected the proposed elimination of NEPO, voting to provide $4.0 million for the program. The Senate supported the Administration position, and the conferees provided $3.0 million for the DOE Office of Science, which conducts basic research in various program areas. The FY2004 request for Science was $3.311 billion, a net increase of 1.5% from FY2003. The House bill provided $3.480 billion for Science. The FY2004 budget request for basic energy sciences was $1.009 billion, with a decrease of $15 million from FY2003. Nanoscience received $193 million in funding, including $85 million for construction of three Nanoscale Science Research Centers. The final appropriation for basic energy sciences was $3.452 billion, a 5.9% increase from the initial request. The House bill increased funding by $8 million, while the Senate bill provided funding at the requested level. The conference report specified an additional $8 million increase to support nanoscience, including the full request of $125 million for the Spallation Neutron Source construction. The FY2004 budget included a request for $125 million for the Spallation Neutron Source construction at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The House bill funded the program at $748 million, while the Senate bill provided the requested amount. The final appropriation for biological and environmental research was $592 million, with increases for microbial pathogens. The final appropriation for biological and environmental research in FY2004 was $592 million, with increases for specific programs like the Genomes to Life program, Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, and new molecular imaging probes. Directed funding for 90 projects totaled $88 million. The House bill provided $399 million for nuclear physics, while the Senate bill matched the requested amount of $389 million. Fusion energy sciences received $257 million, including a $9 million increase for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor negotiations. In FY2004, the budget for fusion energy sciences included $12 million for ITER, with future U.S. contributions expected to be between $50 million to $100 million annually. The final bill allocated $264 million, limiting ITER activities to $8 million. Advanced scientific computing research received $173 million, with $5 million more than the previous year. The Laboratory, previously funded at $3 million in FY2003, was transferred to the Department of Homeland Security. The final bill for the program in FY2004 was $203 million, with additional appropriations for the Science account including $50 million for the Iowa Environmental/Education Project and $3.25 million for other items. The Stockpile Stewardship Program, established by Congress in FY1994, aims to preserve U.S. nuclear weapons competencies and is operated by the National Nuclear Security Administration. The Stockpile Stewardship Program, operated by the National Nuclear Security Administration, aims to maintain the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear stockpile. It consists of Directed Stockpile Work, Campaigns, and Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities. Funding for Weapons Activities was $4,908.7 million for FY2001 and $5,560.2 million for FY2002. NNSA also manages Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation and Naval Reactors programs. The FY2004 budget for Weapons Activities included various programs such as Facilities and Infrastructure Recapitalization, Secure Transportation Asset, and Safeguards and Security. The House and Senate passed H.R. 2754 without amending the Weapons Activities section, accepting the recommended amounts by the House Appropriations Committee. The House and Senate passed H.R. 2754 without amendments to the Weapons Activities funding levels. The conference report was agreed upon by both chambers and signed into law on December 1. Stewardship activities primarily occur at the nuclear weapons complex, managed by NNSA and operated by contractors at various sites. The NNSA operates eight sites for Directed Stockpile Work (DSW) on nuclear weapons, including monitoring, maintenance, refurbishment, and dismantlement. The FY2004 DSW request supports life extension programs for four warheads. The Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP) study, controversial for its ability to destroy underground targets with less explosive yield, received funding for FY2003 and FY2004. The Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP) warhead is controversial for its ability to attack deeply buried targets with less explosive yield. Supporters argue it is necessary for national security, while critics fear it could lower the threshold for nuclear weapon use and prompt other nations to develop their own nuclear weapons. The FY2003 National Defense Authorization Act fully funded the $15.0 million request for RNEP but required a study on military requirements, employment policy, targets, and conventional weapon alternatives before funds could be obligated. The Consolidated Appropriations Resolution for FY2003 provided the requested amount for the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP) warhead. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the schedule and military justification for the W80 life extension project, leading to a reduction in the weapons activity budget. The committee reduced the weapons activity budget for the W80 LEP, slowed W80 LEP activity, and recommended reducing RNEP funding and eliminating funds for ACI. They expressed concerns about NNSA starting new activities with significant budget impacts before specific requirements were articulated for stockpile modifications. The committee felt the Administration was prematurely requesting funds for new nuclear programs and expanded missions for nuclear weapons. They stated they would not support redirecting resources to new initiatives. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended increasing DSW by $3.0 million, with adjustments to Stockpile Maintenance and Production Support. Senator Feinstein's amendment to eliminate funds for RNEP and the Advanced Concepts Initiative was tabled. Senator Reed's amendment barred funds for advanced nuclear weapon concepts including RNEP. The conference bill allocated $7.5 million for RNEP and $6.0 million for Advanced Concepts (excluding RNEP), with $4.0 million available after a detailed report is provided to Congress on activities planned for FY2004. For FY2004, there are 16 campaigns focused on specialized scientific knowledge and technical support for the nuclear weapons stockpile. Examples include Enhanced Surveillance, Advanced Design and Production Technologies, and Advanced Simulation and Computing, with increased funding allocated for each campaign compared to FY2003. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended reductions in funding for various nuclear weapon campaigns, citing concerns about project delays and unwarranted acceleration. The largest increase in funding was for the construction of the Microsystem and Engineering Science Applications facility at Sandia. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended reductions in funding for various nuclear weapon campaigns, citing concerns about project delays and unwarranted acceleration. The largest reductions were for Inertial Confinement Fusion and Advanced Simulation and Computing. Funding for Campaigns was reduced by $12.0 million, with details on appropriations actions for the Pit Manufacturing and Certification Campaign discussed next. This campaign supports two pit projects at Los Alamos National Laboratory and planning for a Modern Pit Facility. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended reductions in funding for various nuclear weapon campaigns due to project delays and cost overruns. The Pit Manufacturing and Certification Campaign, supporting projects at Los Alamos National Laboratory and planning for a Modern Pit Facility, attracted congressional interest. The House committee criticized the project for being behind schedule and over budget, while the Senate committee recommended increased funding to meet national security needs. In FY2003, NNSA planned to certify a W88 pit without nuclear testing by FY2009, with a goal of FY2007. The appropriation for this campaign was $219 million in FY2002 and $194.5 million in FY2003. The funding included $112.5 million for manufacturing the W88 pit, $78.0 million for certification, and $2.0 million for planning the Modern Pit Facility. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $246.0 million for pit manufacturing and certification in FY2003. The House Appropriations Committee provided $194.5 million for pit manufacturing and certification in FY2003, while the final appropriation was $220.6 million. The increase aims to ensure the NNSA's commitment to producing a certifiable W88 pit by 2003 and a certified W88 pit by 2007. The Committee expressed concerns about the NNSA's funding request not aligning with its project plan, leading to budget reductions in other areas. The Administration requested a substantial increase for the W88 pit campaign in FY2004, including funding for manufacturing the pit, certification, Pit Manufacturing Capability, and planning for the Modern Pit Facility. The total request for FY2004 is $320.2 million, a 35.7% increase from FY2003. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the rapid pace of the pit campaign. The House Appropriations Committee recommended reducing the request for the pit campaign by $47.0 million, praising NNSA and Los Alamos National Laboratory for their progress but urging cost reduction. They suggested a less aggressive approach to the Modern Pit Facility and questioned spending on technologies for manufacturing pits other than the W88. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the full amount for the pit campaign, including $10.0 million for Pit Manufacturing Capability. The conferees agreed with the House Report to reduce MPF funding to $10.8 million, citing the need to review the revised future Stockpile plan before making further decisions. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is a key project for the stockpile stewardship program and is set to be the world's largest laser. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is the world's largest laser and a key project for the stockpile stewardship program. It aims to achieve nuclear fusion for energy production but has faced criticism for technical problems, delays, and cost overruns. In 1999, the project required an additional $1 billion and several years to complete due to original cost estimate issues. Despite early criticism, concerns have since decreased. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) project has faced delays and cost overruns, with the total project cost remaining at $2,248.1 million. The project was reported to be on schedule and budget in 2002, with no technical obstacles remaining. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed concerns in FY2003 about the project's scope shifting. The first stockpile stewardship experiments on NIF were planned for 2004. The NIF project faced concerns about shifting focus from ignition to general physics research. Committees added funds to prioritize ignition as the primary objective. The final budget for FY2003 was $489.7 million for inertial confinement fusion. The final budget for FY2003 was $489.7 million for inertial confinement fusion, including $214.0 million for NIF construction. For FY2004, the Administration requested $466.8 million for the Inertial Confinement Fusion Ignition and High Yield Campaign, with the House Appropriations Committee recommending $511.8 million for the campaign, including $150.0 million for NIF construction. The FY2004 House report acknowledged recent successes on the NIF project and urged NNSA to focus on the core project to maintain cost and schedule performance. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $432.8 million, with $150.0 million allocated for construction. Concern was expressed over the growth in other NIF-related activities funded elsewhere in the inertial confinement fusion campaign. Conferees provided $517.3 million for the campaign, expressing concerns about funding various NIF-related projects within the overall NIF program. They suggested future requests should fund these activities as separate line items. The RTBF program provides infrastructure and operations at nuclear weapons complex sites, with subprograms including Operations of Facilities, Program Readiness, and Material Recycle and Recovery. Construction is a separate category within RTBF, with a reduction in funding recommended for FY2004. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a reduction of $102.4 million from the request for the RTBF program. This includes specific allocations for Operations of Facilities, Program Readiness, Material Recycle and Recovery, and construction projects. The Senate Appropriations Committee, on the other hand, recommended adding $118.1 million to RTBF, with a significant portion allocated to Operations of Facilities. The increase in funding for Operations of Facilities included allocations for various facilities such as the National Center for Combating Terrorism, Pantex Plant, Y-12 Plant, Kansas City Plant, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Sandia National Laboratories. The RTBF program received $1,664.2 million, with notable differences in funding for Operations of Facilities, Special Projects, and the Chemistry and Metallurgy Facility Replacement Project at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The RTBF program received $1,664.2 million in funding, with allocations for various facilities including the National Center for Combating Terrorism, Pantex Plant, Y-12 Plant, and national laboratories like Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos, and Sandia. $88.4 million was appropriated for Nuclear Weapons Incident Response in FY2003, and $89.7 million in FY2004. The FY2004 request did not include funds for the National Center for Combating Terrorism due to uncertainty, but the Senate Appropriations Committee added $25.0 million for it. The issue of maintaining weapons through the Stockpile Stewardship Program without nuclear testing is a key concern. The FY2004 budget request included $303.5 million for Weapons Activities at the Nevada Site Office, an increase from $292.5 million in FY2003. The administration maintained its policy against nuclear testing and opposed CTBT ratification. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld emphasized the importance of ensuring the safety and reliability of nuclear weapons without testing. The FY2004 budget included $303.5 million for Weapons Activities at the Nevada Site Office, with a focus on Test Readiness for nuclear testing within 18 months. The Senate Armed Services Committee's bill for FY2004 national defense authorizations required this readiness transition. The Senate Armed Services Committee's bill for FY2004 national defense authorizations required an 18-month posture for nuclear testing unless the Secretary of Energy determined otherwise. NNSA conducted a study in April 2003 supporting the 18-month posture. Funds in the \"Nevada Site Readiness\" account maintained a 24- to 36-month posture through FY2003. The Enhanced Test Readiness and Nevada Site Readiness accounts had to be kept separate due to the lack of a policy decision on reducing testing time. The accounts were expected to be merged into \"Test Readiness\" in FY2004, pending congressional language. The FY2004 NNSA budget request did not reflect the merger of the Enhanced Test Readiness and Nevada Site Readiness accounts. The House Appropriations Committee criticized the plan for enhanced test readiness in its FY2004 report and recommended eliminating funds for it. The committee expressed concerns about the lack of budget analysis and program plan, as well as the difficulties in maintaining test readiness during a testing moratorium. The Senate Appropriations Committee did not address nuclear test readiness in the FY2004 NNSA budget request, but provided the requested funds for Program Readiness. The committee expressed concerns about maintaining test readiness during a testing moratorium and questioned the feasibility of implementing a revised 18-month test readiness posture. The Feinstein amendment, which aimed to prevent funds from being used to modify the test readiness posture, was tabled. The conferees provided $24.9 million for test readiness, expecting the NNSA to focus on restoring a rigorous program capable of meeting the 24-month requirement before pursuing an 18-month readiness posture. The NNSA's FYNSP was criticized for weaknesses in its structure and focus on activities rather than programs and products. The NNSA budget and FYNSP are criticized for focusing on activities rather than programs and products, making it difficult to determine how resource allocation impacts performance. The Congress directs an independent assessment of the NNSA's planning, programming, and budgeting system, comparing it to the Department of Defense. In its FY2003 budget request, NNSA mentioned implementing a new PPBE process for resource management and decision-making. The FY2004 budget cycle included a five-year budget projection. The House Appropriations Committee praised NNSA's efforts in implementing a PPBE structure and budgeting by weapon type. The committee found flaws in the process for setting priorities in nuclear weapons, with DOD setting requirements without having to pay for them. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed DOE to retain the Institute for Defense Analyses to assess the process and structure of NNSA's planning, programming, and budgeting system. Nonproliferation and national security programs provide technical capabilities to support U.S. efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons worldwide. Funding for these programs in FY2003 was provided in the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution. In FY2003, funding for DOE Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Programs was provided in the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution and the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act. The Administration requested $1.3402 billion for FY2004, with the final bill appropriating $1.328 billion. The Nonproliferation and Verification R&D program received $283 million for FY2003. The FY2004 budget for DOE Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Programs was $204 million, with $105.7 million allocated for Nonproliferation and International Security programs. The final bill appropriated $233.4 million for R&D and $110.7 million for Nonproliferation and International Security, including International Materials Protection, Control, and Accounting efforts. The President's request for the Accounting (MPC&A) program was $226 million, compared to $233 million appropriated for FY2003. The House bill increased MPC&A to $255 million, including $28 million for the Megaports initiative. The final bill appropriated $260 million, including $28 million for the Megaports initiative and funding for Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention and the Nuclear Cities Initiatives in the former Soviet Union. The Russian Transition Initiative and the Nuclear Cities Initiatives would have received $40 million under the President's request for FY2004, compared to $39.3 million in FY2003. The Fissile Materials Disposition program saw an increase in funding to $656.5 million for FY2004, compared to $448 million in FY2003. This funding is for the disposal of U.S. surplus weapons plutonium by converting it into fuel for commercial power reactors, including the construction of a facility at Savannah River, SC. The final bill appropriated the requested amounts for these programs. The Department of Energy (DOE) has been responsible for managing environmental contamination from nuclear weapons production since the Cold War. In 1989, the Environmental Management Program was established to clean up defense nuclear waste and civilian nuclear energy research waste. DOE must comply with numerous regulations in this effort. The Department of Energy (DOE) is responsible for managing environmental contamination from nuclear weapons production and civilian nuclear energy research. DOE has signed legally binding compliance agreements with the EPA and states for cleanup activities at 114 sites across 31 states and one U.S. territory. Cleanup activities have been completed at 75 sites by the end of FY2002, costing over $60 billion. DOE has completed cleanup at 75 sites by the end of FY2002, costing over $60 billion. However, the remaining sites are more severely contaminated, and without reforms, cleanup may take 70 years and cost up to $300 billion. DOE's reform initiative aims to accelerate cleanup, save $50-100 billion, and complete cleanup by 2035 by assessing exposure risks for selecting cleanup remedies. Using risk as the primary factor in selecting cleanup remedies could lead to decisions to contain waste on site to prevent exposure, rather than removing it. While containment may be quicker and cheaper, there are concerns about future exposure if containment fails. Questions have been raised about how DOE's risk-based approach will achieve faster and cheaper cleanups without compromising environmental protection. Some fear that relying solely on risk may result in more contamination being left on site. Arguments have been raised about the long-term consequences of leaving radioactive contamination on site instead of removing it. Some believe that completely removing contamination for unrestricted land use is not economically feasible or technologically possible. The Department of Energy proposed a risk-based cleanup reform strategy in FY2003, which raised questions about environmental protection during the appropriations debate. DOE signed letters of intent with EPA and states to accelerate cleanup at its sites, criticized for implementing cleanup reform strategy before funds were appropriated. Congress provided funding under existing account structure for FY2003, not under separate cleanup reform account as proposed by DOE. Concerns raised about fund distribution if given unallocated lump sum. DOE requested $7.24 billion for Environmental Management Program in FY2004, $290 million more than FY2003. Budget proposed new appropriations account structure to focus on reform initiative for cleanups. The DOE proposed new appropriations accounts to focus funding on accelerating cleanup schedules and lowering costs. The accounts were structured for \"Site Acceleration Completion\" and \"Environmental Services,\" with separate \"Defense\" and \"Non-defense\" categories. The budget request included nearly $6.0 billion for Site Acceleration Completion to complete cleanup faster. Additionally, there was a proposal for a Uranium Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund Account to support cleanup efforts at uranium and thorium processing sites. The conference agreement on H.R. 2754 approved the Administration's proposed account structure for cleanup of uranium and thorium processing sites. However, funding was reduced by $130 million overall, with defense sites receiving $168 million less than requested and non-defense sites receiving a $40 million increase. Concerns were raised about DOE's progress in cleanup agreements with EPA and states. Negotiations were needed to revise cleanup agreements with EPA and states to allow for altering cleanup remedies based on risk. Concerns were raised about inaccurate estimates of cleanup costs, particularly at the Hanford Waste Treatment Plant. DOE was directed to transfer $2.5 million for increased oversight of cleanup projects. The Senate recommended $5 million for increased oversight of cleanup projects. DOE is directed to prepare a report on potential statutory restrictions that may delay cleanup acceleration projects. The House raised questions about long-term stewardship needs post-cleanup and directed DOE to consider these needs in accelerated cleanup plans. The House report raised concerns about long-term stewardship post-cleanup, emphasizing the need for resources to manage legacy waste left behind. The Bush Administration requested $591 million for the DOE civilian nuclear waste disposal program for FY2004. The DOE requested $591 million for the civilian nuclear waste disposal program in FY2004, with a 30% increase over FY2003. The budget increase was primarily for preparing a construction permit application for a national nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. Additional funds were needed for detailed repository design work, performance studies, and transportation planning. The House Appropriations Committee approved an additional $174 million for a total of $765 million in FY2004 to ensure the DOE could meet its 2010 target date for shipping nuclear waste to Yucca Mountain. The House Appropriations Committee approved additional funding for the DOE to submit a license application for the Yucca Mountain repository by December 31, 2004. The Senate voted to cut the Administration's request to $425 million, leading to a confrontation with the House. The conference committee agreed to provide $580 million for the nuclear waste program between FY2005 and FY2010. The Administration proposed increasing funding for the nuclear waste program to $1.3 billion per year between FY2005 and FY2010 to keep the Yucca Mountain repository on schedule. President Bush recommended DOE submit an application to NRC for the repository, but Nevada Governor Guinn submitted a \"notice of disapproval\" to Congress. The Yucca Mountain project was allowed to proceed to the licensing phase after an approval resolution was signed into law. Funding for the nuclear waste program comes from the Nuclear Waste Fund and the defense nuclear waste disposal account. The House increased the Nuclear Waste Fund portion of the budget request, while the Senate and conference committee made adjustments to the funding allocations. The conference committee allocated $190 million from the Waste Fund and $390 million from the defense account. The 2010 target for opening a permanent repository is 12 years later than the Nuclear Waste Policy Act deadline of January 31, 1998. Utilities have won court decisions upholding DOE's obligation to meet the deadline and compensate for damages. Nevada has filed lawsuits to block the Yucca Mountain project, arguing against the federal government's authority to force acceptance of nuclear waste. The DOE lacks authority to force Nevada to accept the nation's nuclear waste. Power Marketing Administrations were established to market excess power generated by dams and water projects. The PMAs sell power at wholesale rates to utilities and federal agencies. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) sell power at wholesale rates to utilities and federal agencies, with priority given to \"preference customers\" like municipal utilities and co-ops. The PMAs do not own generating facilities but generally own transmission facilities. The 104th Congress debated selling PMAs, authorizing divestiture of one in 1995. Funding levels for PMAs were set at $203.5 million in FY2003 and $207.3 million in FY2004. No further divestitures are likely due to uncertainties in electric utility restructuring. In FY2004, funding for the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) was $171 million, with an additional $2.6 million for hydroelectric facilities at Falcon & Amistad Dams. The increase in funding was mainly for Program Direction at WAPA due to workload requirements from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The House bill funded PMAs at the requested level, while the Senate bill added $6.95 million for WAPA, including $6.2 million for the Utah Reclamation Mitigation and Conservation Account. The enacted legislation provided $750,000 for a transmission study on wind energy in North and South Dakota. The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) received increased borrowing authority in FY2003 but did not request additional authority in FY2004. BPA plans to borrow $528 million in FY2004 for various programs. Other agencies funded by the Energy and Water Development bill include the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Appalachian Regional Commission, and the Denali Commission. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requested a budget of $626.1 million for FY2003, including funds for safety regulation, licensing of nuclear reactors, and oversight of nuclear materials users. The focus on security of nuclear power plants increased after the September 11, 2001 attacks. NRC's FY2004 budget request included $53.1 million for homeland security activities. NRC's FY2004 budget request included $53.1 million for homeland security activities, a 50% increase over FY2003. NRC plans to conduct full security performance reviews at nuclear power plants on a 3-year cycle instead of an 8-year cycle post-9/11. The conference report directs NRC to study the safety and security of spent fuel storage at commercial reactor sites. NRC also proposed $33.5 million for licensing activities for new commercial reactors, in line with DOE's Nuclear Power 2010 program. The NRC's FY2004 budget included about $25 million for new reactor licensing, up from $10 million in FY2002. The funding will be used for early site permits, reactor pre-licensing and licensing reviews, and updating the nuclear licensing infrastructure. The FY2001 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act phased down the agency's fee recovery to 90% over 5 years. The NRC's FY2004 budget will be offset by fees on licensees, with 92% of the budget covered by fees. $33.1 million was transferred from the Nuclear Waste Fund for waste repository licensing. Various issue briefs and reports on nuclear energy policy, civilian nuclear waste disposal, renewable energy, endangered species, nonproliferation, South Florida ecosystem restoration, Army Corps of Engineers reform, water resource issues, and water infrastructure funding were also mentioned. Water infrastructure funding issues, including water supply, wastewater treatment, terrorism and security concerns, and vulnerability of nuclear power plants to terrorist attacks are discussed in various CRS reports. The Klamath River Basin water use conflicts are also highlighted in one of the reports."
