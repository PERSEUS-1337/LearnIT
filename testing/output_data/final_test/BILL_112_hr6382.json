    "content": "The Act titled \"War Crimes Accountability Act of 2012\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 expresses the Sense of Congress. The Sense of Congress is that the US should actively encourage prosecution of war crimes suspects and Nazi war criminals, commend the Simon Wiesenthal Center for its work in advancing justice, emphasize the importance of pursuing and prosecuting war crimes suspects globally, and enforce arrest warrants issued by international tribunals against such suspects. SEC. 3. IDENTIFICATION OF COUNTRIES FAILING TO COOPERATE IN EXTRADITING WAR CRIMES SUSPECTS OR NAZI WAR CRIMINALS. The President must submit a report to Congress annually from 2013 to 2017 identifying countries failing to cooperate in extraditing or deporting war crimes suspects or Nazi war criminals, enforcing arrest warrants from international tribunals, accepting deported Nazi war criminals, or prosecuting war crimes suspects effectively. The President must submit an annual report to Congress identifying countries that fail to cooperate in extraditing or deporting war crimes suspects or Nazi war criminals. The report includes detailed information on the suspects and criminals, submitted in an unclassified form with a possible classified annex if needed. SEC. 4 prohibits government-to-government sales of defense articles to countries identified in the report under section 3. The President cannot issue offers to sell defense articles over $7,000,000 to such countries unless waived for national security reasons. The Act defines \"Nazi war criminal\" as a person involved in persecuting individuals based on race, religion, national origin, or political opinion during the Nazi regime. It also defines \"war crimes suspect.\" The term \"war crimes suspect\" refers to individuals accused by an international tribunal of involvement in war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide, or other serious human rights violations. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE: This Act will be in effect 90 days after its enactment."
