    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds that a national institution dedicated to women's heritage in Washington, D.C. does not exist. Only 2 exhibits on women's history were authorized at the National Museum of American History in a 34-year period. Less than 5% of National Historic Landmarks and only 40 public outdoor statues in the US are dedicated to women. Women's historic contributions have been overlooked, leading to a gap in the nation's historical record. Knowledge of women's heritage is crucial for personal development. (6) Lack of recognition for women's historic contributions results in a lack of value, understanding, and respect for women, leading to discrimination or violence against females. (7) A National Museum of Women's History is necessary to highlight the specific achievements of women in all areas of human endeavor and to celebrate their contributions in family and society. An advisory committee called the National Museum of Women's History Advisory Committee is established. The National Museum of Women's History Advisory Committee is composed of 5 ex officio nonvoting members and 21 voting members. Ex officio nonvoting members are appointed by various government officials, while voting members are appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Minority Leader. The National Museum of Women's History Advisory Committee consists of 21 voting members appointed by various government officials and the President of the National Museum of Women's History, Inc. These members include representatives from the House and Senate, founding members of the Board, and private citizens chosen for their ability to contribute to the success of the Advisory Committee. The Advisory Committee for the National Museum of Women's History consists of 21 members appointed by government officials and the President. 5 members are appointed after consultation with various academic and professional organizations, and 2 members are appointed based on financial expertise. Members must be appointed within 30 days of the Act's enactment, and failure to appoint a member after 30 days will result in limitations. The ability of the Advisory Committee to function under the Act is not affected by delays in appointing members. The Commission's duties are outlined in Section 4. The Advisory Committee will study matters related to identifying a site, developing a business plan, and assisting with the collection and programs of the National Museum of Women's History. The first meeting must be held within 90 days, and a final report submitted to Congress within 6 months after the first meeting. SEC. 5. ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS: The Secretary of the Interior will provide necessary administrative services, facilities, and funds for the Advisory Committee. \n\nSEC. 6.
