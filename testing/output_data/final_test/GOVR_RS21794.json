The new Prime Minister, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, promised to withdraw Spanish troops from Iraq unless under U.N. sanction, leading to speculation that other coalition partners may face similar pressures. The upcoming June 2004 elections to the European Parliament may see terrorism, the Madrid bombings, and Iraq as prominent issues for voters across Europe. The United States aims to increase international participation in Iraq to ease the burden on U.S. forces as sovereignty is set to be transferred to Iraqis by July 2004. Public opinion polls in key European countries show strong opposition to military involvement in Iraq, with some governments supporting U.S. policy despite public sentiment at home. The Bush Administration supports U.S. policy in Iraq despite public opposition in Europe. Public opinion surveys show that the war in Iraq has increased the threat of global terrorism. Support for military operations in Iraq would rise in Europe if the United Nations led peacekeeping efforts. The survey data comes from various sources with differing methodologies. Multiple country surveys are referenced at the end of the report. The United Kingdom, under British Prime Minister Tony Blair, strongly supported the U.S. in the Iraq war and led stabilization efforts. Despite initial public approval, criticism grew over Blair's alleged misleading about the threat from Saddam Hussein. The Pew Center's survey in February 2004 showed increasing negative British views on Iraq. 43% believed using military force was right, 47% thought it was wrong. 36% said the war helped the war on terrorism, while 50% said it hurt. 82% believed the U.N. could do the best job at helping Iraq form a stable government. Italy contributes the third largest national contingent of troops to Iraq, with nearly 3,000 military and paramilitary troops serving in the U.K.-led multinational division in the south. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi pledged to keep Italian troops in Iraq after a suicide bomb attack in 2003. The Italian public seemed split on the war in Iraq in April 2003, with 55% disapproving. The Italian public was split on the war in Iraq, with 55% disapproving and 42% supporting. Polls showed a divide on withdrawing Italian troops, with a slight majority in favor of withdrawal. However, there was a growing resolve to uphold Italy's commitment to Iraqi stabilization after the November 2003 attacks. Spain's decision to withdraw its troops influenced Italian public opinion, with 67% favoring a similar withdrawal by June 30. In a poll, 67% of respondents favored Spain's decision to withdraw troops by June 30, while 26% opposed it. A February 2004 poll in Italy showed that 65% believed military action in Iraq increased the threat of terrorism, with 6% saying it decreased and 20% seeing no effect. Poland has contributed 2,500 troops to the peacekeeping operation in Iraq since 2003 and pledged to stay \"as long as needed\" after the Madrid terrorist attacks in March 2004. President Kwasniewski criticized intelligence discrepancies on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Polish officials and the public are increasingly concerned about potential terrorist attacks at home. With the resignation of Prime Minister Leszek Miller in May 2004, Polish policy on Iraq is becoming a political issue. A coalition partner has called for a timetable for the withdrawal of Polish troops from Iraq. Polls show varying levels of support and opposition to Polish troop involvement in Iraq, with slightly more Poles opposing their presence in multinational stabilization forces. In early March 2004, 42% of Poles supported Poland's involvement in Iraq, while 53% were opposed. A November 2003 survey showed that 75% of Poles feared a terrorist attack. Spain, with 1,300 troops in Iraq, had strong opposition to the U.S.-led war in March 2003, exceeding other European countries. In the run-up to the March 2004 elections in Spain, opposition to the war was a prominent issue. In the lead-up to the March 2004 elections in Spain, polls indicated former Prime Minister Aznar's party was slightly ahead of the Socialist opposition. However, the terrorist attacks in Madrid on March 11 led to a surge in support for the Socialists, attributed to the bombings and the government's response. A February 2004 poll showed that 66% of Spaniards believed the Iraq war increased the terrorism threat. In a poll, 8% believed the threat of terrorism had decreased, 17% said it had no effect, and 9% were unsure. 85% of respondents expressed worry about terrorism in their home country. Turkey initially denied US troops entry into Iraq in 2003 but later allowed access. Turkey has not sent troops to coalition operations in Iraq but maintains a small presence in northern Iraq. The country remains concerned about instability along its southern border and was targeted by terrorist attacks in 2003. Strong anti-war sentiment in Turkey led to the parliament blocking access for coalition forces during the 2003 Iraq war. In September 2003, nearly two-thirds of Turks opposed sending troops to Iraq, with 73% believing the US would fail in stabilizing Iraq. In March 2004, opinions were divided on whether Iraqis would benefit from Saddam's removal. A February 2004 survey showed 72% believed Turkey made the right decision not to use military force against Iraq. According to a survey, opinions were divided on the war in Iraq: 22% believed it was the right decision, while 56% believed it hurt the war on terrorism. When asked who could help Iraq form a stable government, 59% said the United Nations, while 11% said the U.S. and its allies. The survey also highlighted concerns from neighboring countries and Europe about the increased terrorist threat from Iraq. Muslim anger persists regarding military action in Iraq, with European opinions mostly negative."
