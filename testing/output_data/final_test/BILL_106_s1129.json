    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that the Bureau of Land Management has authority to sell or exchange land identified for disposal under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. The agency has also identified certain public land tracts for disposal, and the Department of the Interior has the authority to acquire land consistent with land use plans. The Bureau of Land Management has the authority to sell or exchange land for disposal under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. Congress recognizes the benefits of acquiring non-Federal land to reconfigure ownership patterns for better resource management and administrative efficiency within Federal land management units. Private individuals owning land within Federal boundaries desire to sell to the government, and a more expeditious process for land disposal and acquisition would benefit the public interest. Federal land management agencies are facing increased workloads due to growing public demand for land use. In many cases, both inholders and the Federal Government would benefit from the government acquiring land on a priority basis. Proceeds from the disposal of public land could be used to acquire inholdings and improve resource management abilities. The Bureau of Land Management and adjacent landowners can benefit from using proceeds from public land sales to purchase inholdings and other land, promoting cooperation with private landowners and better resource management. Selling identified public land can ensure fair market value, while minimizing disruption to existing land management programs. The Bureau of Land Management may utilize non-Federal entities to prepare appraisal documents for agency review and approval in resource management programs, following the Uniform Standards for Federal Land Acquisition. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"exceptional resource\" refers to a resource of scientific, historic, cultural, or recreational value requiring extraordinary conservation. \"Federally designated area\" includes land in Alaska and eleven Western States under the Secretary's administration. The term \"inholding\" refers to any non-Federal entity's right, title, or interest in a tract of land within the boundary of a federally designated area, which includes various types of protected areas managed by different federal agencies. The term \"public land\" refers to lands within federally designated areas, as defined in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior. SEC. 4. IDENTIFICATION OF INHOLDINGS. The Secretary will establish a procedure to identify inholdings within federally designated areas where the landowner wants to sell to the Federal Government. Periodic notices will be provided to the public regarding this policy, and inholdings will only be considered if the landowner notifies the Secretary of their desire to sell in response to public notice. The Secretary will establish a procedure to identify inholdings within federally designated areas for potential sale to the Federal Government. Inholdings will be considered if the landowner notifies the Secretary of their desire to sell in response to public notice. Private land within specified areas will be deemed as inholdings for the purposes of the Act if funds become available under a specific section. The identification of an inholding under this section does not require the landowner to sell it or the United States to acquire it. SEC. 5. DISPOSAL OF PUBLIC LAND. The Secretary will establish a program to complete appraisals and legal requirements for the sale of public land identified for disposal under approved land use plans. The sale will be conducted in accordance with specific sections of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, with exceptions to competitive bidding requirements in certain cases. The Secretary will provide a report of activities under this section in the annual publication of Public Land Statistics. The authority provided under this section shall terminate 10 years after the date of enactment of this Act. SEC. 6. FEDERAL LAND DISPOSAL ACCOUNT. The gross proceeds from the sale of public land under this Act will be deposited into the Federal Land Disposal Account in the Treasury. The Secretary can use the funds in the account without needing further appropriation to carry out the Act, including purchasing inholdings. The Federal Land Disposal Account will use funds from the sale of public land for acquiring inholdings and National Forest System land within each State. Up to 20 percent of the funds can be used for administrative expenses related to the land disposal program. The Federal Land Disposal Account will use funds from the sale of public land for acquiring inholdings and National Forest System land within each State. At least 80 percent of the remaining funds must be spent within the State where they were generated, with the option to use any excess funds to purchase land within national recreation or scenic areas on behalf of the Secretary of Agriculture. The Secretary may acquire land within the National Forest System based on priority criteria such as inholding date, exceptional resources, and management efficiency. Acquisitions must be from willing sellers and have acceptable title conveyance. The Federal Land Disposal Account can be used to acquire National Forest System land based on priority criteria and must be purchased at fair market value. Funds cannot be used for contaminated or difficult-to-manage sites. Amounts in the account will earn interest determined by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Federal Land Disposal Account earns interest based on market yields of US obligations. Funds from this account are supplemental to the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act. Upon termination, the account will close, and any remaining balance will be available for appropriation under the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act. SEC. 7. SPECIAL PROVISIONS. This Act does not exempt any limitations on land acquisition under Federal Law. It does not apply to land eligible for sale under specific laws. It also does not limit land exchanges authorized by certain acts and does not create any new rights or benefits enforceable by law. The curr_chunk states that any rights or benefits enforceable by law against the United States or its agencies are included."
