    "title": "AB 1626",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 905.2 of the Government Code is amended to apply to claims against the state filed with the Department of General Services. Claims for money or damages must be presented in accordance with the specified chapters, including claims for reissuance of warrants which must be filed with the original issuing entity. Claims can be made for express contracts or injuries for which the state is liable. Claimants filing claims against the state must pay a $25 filing fee, except for certain types of claims. The fee is deposited into the Service Revolving Fund for the Department of General Services' support. The fee does not apply to certain individuals. The fee does not apply to individuals receiving benefits from specific programs or whose income is 125 percent or less of the current monthly poverty line. Persons sentenced to imprisonment or confined in a state institution with a balance of $100 or less in their trust account may request a fee waiver by submitting a signed affidavit and financial information. No hearing is allowed for fee waiver denials. The Department of General Services will begin processing the claim when the filing fee is submitted or the fee waiver is granted. Upon approval of the claim by the Department of General Services, the filing fee will be reimbursed to the claimant, except for claims for expired warrants. The state entity against which the claim was filed will pay the reimbursement. If a fee waiver was granted, the state entity will pay the fee to the department. Payment will be made when the claim is paid by the state entity or added to an equity claims bill. The Department of General Services may assess a surcharge of up to 15% on approved claims, excluding refunded filing fees. The surcharge is deposited into the Service Revolving Fund for department support. The surcharge does not apply to reissued expired warrants. The Controller transfers fees from the state entity's appropriation to support the department upon request. The filing fee and surcharge apply to claims filed after a certain date. The section does not apply to claims under the California Whistleblower Protection Act. Comprehensive services include shelter, hotline, and temporary housing. The Human Trafficking Victims Assistance Fund provides temporary housing, psychological support, referrals to community services, and emergency transportation. The Director of the Office of Emergency Services oversees the Fund, and a qualified nonprofit organization must meet specific criteria to receive assistance. The Human Trafficking Victims Assistance Fund offers services to victims of human trafficking, including housing assistance, counseling, and social services. A victim of human trafficking is defined as someone trafficked in the state or who fled to the state. Participating counties must contribute a minimum of 10% to adult local criminal justice facilities, with potential reductions for smaller counties. The BSCC determines funding and scoring criteria for counties eligible for financing programs. $20 million is set aside for Napa County from the authorized amount. The funding criteria for counties eligible for financing programs include documenting pretrial inmate percentages and describing risk assessment-based pretrial release programs. Preference is given to counties prepared to proceed with financing in a timely manner. Counties must provide a resolution authorizing matching funds for financing and approving necessary project documents to the BSCC. Matching funds must be compatible with the state's lease-revenue bond financing. Counties seeking funding for housing capacity replacement or renovation must provide documentation of CEQA compliance and a letter from county counsel certifying challenges have been resolved. Funding priority will be given to projects adding treatment space or providing mental health services. (d) Participating counties can use financing authority to replace existing housing capacity if a deficiency is documented. Counties must certify they will not lease capacity to others for 10 years after completion. Locked facilities funded by the state must include onsite visitation space meeting or exceeding state regulations. Napa County is awarded $20 million for its adult local criminal justice facility without the need for further proposals. This funding can be combined with a partial award previously granted to the county. The total state contribution for the facility in Napa County is capped at this amount. The sum of $3,000,000 is appropriated from the Gambling Control Fund to the Department of Justice to address the backlog in investigations related to cardroom licensing. This act is a bill providing appropriations related to the Budget Bill and shall take effect immediately."
