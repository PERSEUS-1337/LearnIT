    "content": "The Multi-Scale Stacked Hourglass (MSSH) network is proposed for human pose estimation, highlighting the differentiation capabilities of each Hourglass network. Different scales of feature maps are processed and dispatched to various locations within the network, with small-scale features at the front and large-scale features at the rear. A new loss function is introduced for this multi-scale approach, considering different weight coefficients for different keypoints. The proposed method, the multi-scale stacked hourglass network, adjusts weight coefficients for different keypoints at different scales. Experimental results show competitiveness with other algorithms on MPII and LSP datasets. Single-person pose estimation in a single RGB image remains challenging due to body flexibility, diverse viewpoints, and occlusions. The deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) has advanced human pose estimation, with the stacked hourglass network BID7 showing promising results. This network extracts global and local information using convolution and deconvolution layers in an hourglass structure. The hourglass structure in the stacked hourglass network enhances human pose estimation by improving context constraints among body keypoints. Increasing the stacked depth theoretically expands the receptive field and strengthens context constraints. However, simply increasing depth may not effectively improve accuracy due to difficulties in forming differentiated collaboration mechanisms for each hourglass network. The Multi-Scale Stacked Hourglass (MSSH) network enhances human pose estimation by incorporating multi-scale features into different stacked hourglass networks. Small-scale features focus on global information like body keypoints type and context constraints, while large-scale features focus on local information like body keypoints location. The iterative relationship between the loss is improved through the top-down route of body keypoints estimation. The iterative relationship between loss functions of different scales in the MSSH network establishes a top-down route for body keypoints estimation. The weight of the loss function on pre-level hourglass network affects the weight of the loss function on the current hourglass network, controlling the optimization process of model training with adaptive weighted loss function. The main contribution includes generating features of different scales in a multi-scale stacked hourglass network. The MSSH network utilizes hourglass networks to process global and local information, with each hourglass forming a unique function. A new loss function is proposed, adjusting weight coefficients for model training optimization. The paper reviews human pose estimation, details the MSSH network structure, and describes the new loss function. The MSSH network utilizes hourglass networks to process global and local information. It introduces a new loss function for model training optimization. Previous works have used CNNs for pose estimation, with approaches like Joint train and Convolutional Pose Machines. The hourglass network stacks hourglass modules for human body pose estimation. Researchers aim to improve pose estimation results based on this network. Researchers are designing complex networks for human body pose estimation, utilizing multi-stage processing, multi-scale features, and loss functions. The stacked hourglass network generates attention maps with different resolutions, while the pyramid structure increases the network's receptive field. Different networks like BID1 and BID5 improve detection results through multi-scale feature prediction and structure-aware enhancements. The proposed MSSH network utilizes multi-scale features and pre-processing networks to optimize network performance. It draws inspiration from chain prediction BID3 and incorporates small and large-scale features in a stacked hourglass network. The Multi-Scale Stacked Hourglass (MSSH) network utilizes a new loss function to adjust keypoints weight coefficients and focuses on hard keypoints. It promotes functional collaboration and reduces information loss for human pose estimation. The network processes features across all scales and captures context relationships associated with the body. The pre-processing network generates feature maps of different scales, dispatching them to each hourglass network where small-scale features reach the front and large-scale features reach the rear. The input to each hourglass network in the MSSH network consists of dispatched features from the pre-processing network and the output of the pre-level hourglass network. The inception-resnet is proposed to enhance network performance. The hourglass network captures information at different scales through convolution and pooling processes, downsampling operations, and feature resolution increase. The stacked hourglass network utilizes multiple upsampling operations to increase image resolution and predict object positions accurately. Intermediate supervision integrates body keypoints information into output feature maps, enhancing context information capture. The network consists of multiple hourglass networks connected serially, repeating subsampling and upsampling processes to capture information at different scales and continuously enhance body keypoints information. The multi-scale pre-processing network enhances body keypoints information as the stack number increases in the stacked hourglass network. It generates different-scale feature maps to differentiate collaboration mechanisms and avoid information loss. The pre-processing network sends different scale feature maps to different levels of hourglass networks for processing. The hourglass network utilizes multiple branches with different depths to generate multi-scale feature maps. Inception-resnet is used as the basic building block in each hourglass network, consisting of convolutional layers, batch norm layers, and Relu units. The concatenation of features across different channels is normalized by subsequent convolutional layers, with the benefit of maintaining the same resolution for input and output. The inception-resnet architecture enhances the unit structure by adding convolution layers to improve context relationships and the implicit space model. Inception-resnet-B utilizes subsampling and upsampling layers to extract different levels of information on feature maps. A new loss function with adaptive weight coefficients focuses on hard keypoints for improved performance. The method of BID10 is used to generate a 2-D Gaussian heatmap centered on the position of keypoints, with adaptive weight coefficients designed to pay more attention to hard keypoints. The weight coefficients are dynamically adjusted from small to large scales, increasing focus on hard keypoints gradually. The Gaussian heatmap of keypoints is generated with adaptive weight coefficients to focus on hard keypoints gradually. The MSE loss function is used to calculate the loss function for each keypoint at different levels in the hourglass network. Weighting is necessary based on the scale of the heatmap in the MSSH network structure. The weighted loss function in the MSSH network structure assigns weight coefficients to keypoints at different levels based on the detection effect, using the adaboost regression algorithm for iterative weight adjustments. Formulae are used to calculate weight coefficients and normalization factors for each keypoint. The MSSH network structure utilizes a weighted loss function with adaptive weight coefficients for keypoints based on detection effect. The weight adjustment process is calculated using formulae, and the overall structure includes a multi-scale stacked hourglass network. Experimental sections cover database details, criteria, and implementation, with discussions on weight coefficient adjustments, pre-processing network impact, and hourglass network structure comparisons. Quantitative assessments are conducted on baseline datasets for performance analysis. The MPII dataset is a benchmark for human pose estimation with 25K images and 40K annotated people. It covers 410 activities with activity labels and includes unannotated frames. The LSP dataset has 2000 pose annotated images of sports people. The MPII dataset is a benchmark for human pose estimation with 25K images and 40K annotated people. It covers 410 activities with activity labels and includes unannotated frames. The LSP dataset has 2000 pose annotated images of sports people. Images in the dataset have been scaled with the most prominent person roughly 150 pixels in length and annotated with 14 joint locations. PCP is a criterion for human pose estimation that evaluates localization accuracy of body parts, requiring estimated endpoints to be within half of the part length from ground truth endpoints. PCK is similar to PDJ, measuring the detection rate of body joints. The PCK measure evaluates the accuracy of body part localization by comparing the detected joint positions with the true joint positions using a matching threshold. PCKh is a modified version that uses a matching threshold of 50% of the head segment length. The input image is cropped and resized to 256*256 according to body position and scale. Data augmentation includes rotation, flipping, rescaling, and color jittering. Models are trained using pyTorch with RMSProp optimization on a 1080 GPU. MSE loss is used to compare predicted scoremaps with Ground-Truth scoremaps. The network's effectiveness is validated through various aspects such as adaptive weight coefficient adjustment and pre-processing network performance. The study focuses on the adaptive adjustment of weight coefficients and the performance of a pre-processing network in comparison to an hourglass network structure. Testing annotations for MPII are not publicly available, so training is done on a subset of images with evaluation on a validation set of around 3000 samples. The hourglass network is trained as a baseline model with a PCKh score of 88.78% on the validation set. The pre-processing network dispatches feature maps of different resolutions into each hourglass network and uses an adaptive weighting function to optimize the relationship between loss functions of different scales. Increasing the input image size provides more location details of human keypoints to the network. The study introduces unit structures inception-resnet-A and inception-resnet-B to enhance the hourglass network for improved pose estimation. Experimental results show that the new method achieves a PCKh score of 89.25%, outperforming the original structure by 0.47%. Comparing the PCKh scores of inception-resnet-A, inception-resnet-B, and the residual network, they are 89.91%, 82.95%, and 89.19% respectively. Inception-resnet-A improves context relationships and implicit space model by adding convolution layers. Inception-resnet-B's subsampling destroys key feature map consistency. Inception-resnet-C is not suitable for human pose estimation. Pre-processing network crucial for multi-scale feature maps in MSSH network. Design influenced by FPN network for gradual feature map reduction. The FPN network idea is utilized for gradual feature map reduction in the Inception-resnet building block. Horizontal connections are tested for optimal pre-processing network fit with the MSSH network. Results show 88.66% accuracy with horizontal connections and 89.91% without. The pre-processing network should focus on local information over semantic information. Stacked hourglass network integrates new information from the pre-processing network to enhance each hourglass network's performance. Information fusion between these two parts is crucial. In the benchmark hourglass network, pixel-wise addition is used for information fusion, outperforming concatenation with an accuracy improvement of 0.66%. Results show 89.91% accuracy with pixel-wise add and 89.36% with concatenation. The method achieves improvements on elbow and ankle detection, with ankle being a challenging part. The proposed method's performance is compared with state-of-the-art methods on MPII and LSP datasets. The proposed method involves dispatching multi-scale feature maps to stacked hourglass networks, enhancing convergence performance with adaptive weight loss functions. Evaluation on benchmarks shows improved accuracy and convergence compared to traditional methods. Future work includes exploring complex loss function constraints. Detection results on MPII validation set and LSP dataset vary based on body joint twisting and occlusion. Results are shown in FIG8 and FIG9 for different scenarios."
