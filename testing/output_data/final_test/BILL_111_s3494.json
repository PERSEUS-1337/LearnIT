    "content": "The \"Senior Financial Empowerment Act of 2010\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The Congress finds that the population of seniors in the United States is increasing, with millions being abused, neglected, or exploited each year, including financial fraud targeting seniors. Seniors are often targeted for fraud, with cases being underreported and no national statistics available. The FBI states that seniors may not report fraud due to not knowing who to report to, feeling ashamed, or not realizing they have been victims. A 2009 report estimated that victims of senior financial abuse lose at least $2.6 billion annually. Perpetrators of fraud use mail, telemarketing, and the internet. Perpetrators target vulnerable seniors for mail, telemarketing, and Internet fraud, leading to financial loss and emotional distress. The Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act strengthens measures against deceptive mailings. During fiscal year 2007, analysts responded to over 27,000 mail fraud complaints by preparing letters and postcards. Postal inspectors investigated 2,909 mail fraud cases, leading to 1,236 arrests and 1,118 convictions. Additionally, there were 162 telemarketing fraud investigations, resulting in 83 arrests and 61 convictions. The United States Senate Special Committee on Aging reported that consumers lose around $40 billion annually to telemarketing fraud, with an estimated 10% of telemarketing firms being fraudulent. Researchers suggest that only one in 10,000 fraud victims report the crime. The Federal Bureau of Investigation reports that fraud targeting seniors is increasing, with criminals using various techniques including traditional phone calls, mailings, phishing, and email spam. The IC3, a partnership between the National White Collar Crime Center and the FBI, receives and refers fraud reports. The IC3 processes over 219,553 Internet crime complaints annually, referring 90,008 cases with a total loss of $239,090,000 to law enforcement agencies. Consumer awareness is crucial in preventing fraud. Centralized service for consumer education on mail, telemarketing, and internet fraud targeting seniors is essential for preventing fraud. The Federal Trade Commission, in consultation with other agencies, is required to disseminate information on fraud targeting seniors and how to report complaints to law enforcement agencies. The Federal Trade Commission, along with other agencies, must provide information on fraud targeting seniors and establish a national hotline for reporting fraud. They are also required to offer public information on any law enforcement actions against entities involved in fraud and maintain a website for seniors and their caregivers regarding fraud targeting seniors. The Federal Trade Commission must establish procedures to address fraud targeting seniors within one year of the enactment of the Act. $10,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2011 to 2015 for this purpose. SEC. 4. Grants to prevent mail, telemarketing, and internet fraud. The Attorney General will establish a grant program to fund fraud prevention education for seniors through mail, telemarketing, and Internet programs. Eligible organizations include State Attorneys General, law enforcement agencies, senior centers, and nonprofit organizations. $20,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2011 to 2015. The Congress recognizes the need for increased awareness of mail, telemarketing, and Internet fraud impacting senior citizens. They propose designating a week in May as \"National Senior Fraud Awareness Week\" with educational activities. The President is encouraged to issue a proclamation supporting prevention of fraud against seniors."
