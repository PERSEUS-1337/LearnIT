    "content": "The Department of Labor issued a final rule in 2016 expanding the definition of investment advice within pension plans and IRAs, holding individuals to a fiduciary standard. This higher standard requires acting solely in the interests of plan participants. The rule's applicability date was delayed by 60 days in 2017. The Department of Labor's final rule in 2016 expanded the definition of investment advice within pension plans and IRAs, imposing a fiduciary standard. The rule includes the impartial conduct standard and the best interest contract exemption. Additional requirements, such as specific disclosures and written contracts, will become applicable on January 1, 2018. Workers can prepare for retirement through tax-advantaged methods like employer-sponsored pension plans (defined benefit and defined contribution) or contributing to IRAs for retirement income. The payment amount in pension plans is calculated using a formula based on factors like length of service, accrual rate, and final salary. Single-employer plans differ from multiemployer plans in their payment calculation methods. Participants receive monthly payments in retirement, with married participants receiving joint-and-survivor annuities. Some participants may have the option to receive a lump-sum benefit instead of monthly payments. Employees in pension plans can choose to receive a lump-sum benefit payment. Private-sector DB pension plans are funded by employer contributions, with some workers required to contribute. Assets in private-sector DB pension plans totaled $3.3 trillion in 2016. In DC pension plans, workers contribute to individual accounts, with employers possibly matching contributions. DC plans like 401(k) do not guarantee lifetime income unless an annuity is purchased. Individuals can establish tax-advantaged IRAs for retirement savings, with contributions and distributions varying between traditional and Roth IRAs. Lump-sum payments from pension plans can be rolled over to an IRA or another employer-sponsored plan for continued investment. A rollover is the transfer of assets from an IRA or employer-sponsored plan to another upon separation from the original employer. Rollovers are a significant source of funds in IRAs, with $7.8 trillion in assets in IRAs as of September 30, 2016. Participants in DC pension plans and IRAs have various investment options such as mutual funds, company stock, and variable annuities, which are regulated by the SEC. An annuity is an insurance product where an investor receives regular payments for life, either through a one-time purchase or series of payments. Fixed annuities provide a set payment, while variable annuities' payments fluctuate based on chosen investments. Annuities are regulated by states, with variable annuities also under SEC regulation. Investment products are typically bought and sold through securities brokers. Securities can be bought and sold through brokers and dealers. Brokers act as agents for investors, while dealers trade securities using their own inventory. The term broker-dealer is common due to the overlap in their duties. Investment advisers provide advice on financial securities and are regulated by the SEC. Congress passed the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to protect pension plan participants. ERISA, passed in 1974, sets standards for pension plans regarding participation, vesting, funding, and fiduciary duties to protect plan participants' interests. It requires prudent operation in the sole interest of participants by plan sponsors, administrators, and others overseeing pension plans. ERISA, passed in 1974, sets standards for pension plans to protect participants' interests. It established the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) to insure DB pension plans. ERISA covers private-sector pension plans and exempts government and church plans. IRAs were authorized by ERISA, with provisions found in the IRC. DOL oversees employer-sponsored IRA plans like SIMPLE and SEP IRAs, while the IRS oversees contributions and taxes. The Treasury oversees most issues regarding IRAs, but certain issues regarding prohibited transactions are overseen by the Secretary of Labor due to a 1978 executive order. ERISA prohibits certain transactions between a plan and fiduciaries, who are not allowed to deal with plan assets in their own interests or for their own accounts. DOL can issue exemptions to prohibited transactions under ERISA. The Department of Labor (DOL) can issue exemptions for prohibited transactions under ERISA, allowing individuals or groups to engage in transactions that would otherwise violate the law. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates various aspects of investing in financial securities, including securities offerings, trading, and market oversight. Registered investment advisers must act as fiduciaries under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, while securities brokers and dealers have different regulatory requirements. Brokers and dealers are not covered by the act if the advice they provide is incidental to the transaction and they do not receive a fee for the advice. FINRA requires recommendations by brokers and dealers to be suitable for the customer. Section 913 of the Dodd-Frank Act required the SEC to study the regulatory environment for providing recommendations and investment advice to retail customers. In 2011, the SEC recommended brokers and dealers be subject to a fiduciary standard no less stringent than that of investment advisers. Financial professionals assist with retirement plans, helping with investment choices in 401(k) plans and advising on rollovers upon job change or retirement. Some financial professionals may have conflicts of interest due to their compensation structures, potentially leading to recommendations that do not benefit clients. Different standards apply to individuals transacting with pension plans, depending on their roles and actions. For example, those providing investment advice are held to a high fiduciary standard. ERISA Section 3(21)(A) establishes fiduciary duties for individuals managing pension plans, including the duty of loyalty, prudence, diversification, and following the high fiduciary standard. The fiduciary duties under ERISA include loyalty, prudence, diversification, and following plan documents. Other individuals may be held to different standards, such as brokers who must meet a suitability standard when making recommendations. Routine plan services providers may not be under any specific standard, and certain decisions related to plan formation are considered settlor functions and are not governed by ERISA. ERISA Section 3(21)(a) establishes situations where a person qualifies as a fiduciary, such as providing investment advice for a fee. The DOL issued a rule on April 8, 2016, replacing a 1975 rule that determined fiduciary status based on a five-part test for providing investment advice regularly. The DOL proposed an update to the fiduciary regulation in 2010, aiming to expand the types of activities subject to the fiduciary standard. This proposal generated controversy, with 202 public comments received and a public hearing held in March 2011. The DOL proposed an update to the fiduciary regulation in 2010, aiming to expand the types of activities subject to the fiduciary standard. Following a public hearing in March 2011, DOL received 114 public comments, including input from Members of the House and Senate. The rule was re-proposed in 2011 and forwarded to OMB for review in 2015. President Obama called for updating rules to prioritize clients' best interests. The re-proposed rule was published in April 2015. The DOL issued the 2016 final rule on April 8, 2016, with an effective date of June 7, 2016, and an applicability date of April 10, 2017. President Trump directed DOL to review the fiduciary rule's impact on access to retirement information and financial advice in February 2017. The DOL proposed a delay of the fiduciary rule's applicability date, followed by a Temporary Enforcement Policy. A delay was issued on April 7, 2017, pushing the applicability date to June 9, 2017, for specific sections. The DOL proposed a delay of the fiduciary rule's applicability date to June 9, 2017, for specific sections. The Best Interest Contract exemption requirements will become applicable on January 1, 2018. DOL indicated advisers do not need additional time to provide advice in the retirement investor's best interest. The 2016 final rule replaced the 1975 rule's five-part test with language describing fiduciary investment advice activities. The 2016 final rule outlines activities that constitute fiduciary investment advice if done for a fee, including recommendations on buying, selling, or managing investments, as well as directing rollovers, distributions, and transfers from IRAs. The advisor must acknowledge acting as a fiduciary and base advice on the recipient's needs. The 2016 final rule defines fiduciary investment advice as recommendations on buying, selling, or managing investments, directing rollovers, distributions, and transfers from IRAs, tailored to the recipient's needs. Certain activities, like marketing to a plan without considering individual needs, do not constitute investment advice under the rule. The 2016 final rule defines fiduciary investment advice as recommendations on buying, selling, or managing investments, directing rollovers, distributions, and transfers from IRAs. The rule also outlines exceptions where advice is not considered fiduciary, such as when given to independent fiduciaries with financial expertise or by employees of the plan sponsor without additional compensation. ERISA prohibits fiduciaries from engaging in specified transactions likely to harm a pension plan, with exemptions like the Best Interest Contract (BIC) exemption and Principal Transactions Exemption. DOL issued a BIC exemption in 2016 to allow broker-dealers to receive commissions and other forms of compensation previously prohibited. The 2016 final rule issued a BIC exemption allowing fiduciaries to receive commissions and fees for advice, with conditions including acknowledging fiduciary status, adhering to Impartial Conduct Standards, and disclosing conflicts of interest. The BIC exemption allows fiduciaries to receive commissions and fees for advice under certain conditions, including acknowledging fiduciary status, adhering to Impartial Conduct Standards, and disclosing conflicts of interest. Additionally, advisers must provide disclosures to retirement investors, including information on the Best Interest Standard of care, services provided, how the investor will pay for services, conflicts of interest, fees, and compensation. The financial institution must provide contact information to the retirement investor and explain how they will monitor investments. Compliance conditions include maintaining a public website with business model details, account fees, and contract terms. Contracts cannot waive the investor's right to participate in class actions or require arbitration in distant venues. Financial institutions selling proprietary products may use the BIC exemption. The BIC exemption allows financial institutions selling proprietary products to inform retirement investors of any conflicts of interest and adopt policies to mitigate them. The institution must notify EBSA of their intent to rely on the exemption and maintain compliance records for 6 years. A principal transactions exemption permits individuals and institutions to engage in purchases and sales of assets from their own inventory, which would otherwise violate ERISA's self-dealing prohibitions. The PTE allows for principal transactions to occur, with limitations on securities sold and adherence to specified conditions. PTE 84-24 was amended to allow for commissions on fixed annuities, subject to Impartial Conduct Standards. Other annuities require compliance with the more stringent BIC. Variable and index annuities must adhere to the stricter Best Interest Contract (BIC) exemption if commissions are involved, due to their complexity and potential conflicts of interest. The Department of Labor (DOL) received over 6,000 public comments and made changes to the 2016 final regulation based on feedback, such as clarifying that marketing oneself without giving investment advice is not fiduciary advice. The definition of investment education was expanded to include asset allocation models for ERISA plans, but not IRAs. The new fiduciary rule aims to identify investment alternatives for ERISA plans, make the BIC exemption available to small plans, modify contract requirements, streamline disclosures, grandfather compensation, and allow a negative consent procedure. The rule has sparked controversy over the Obama Administration's rationale, impact on small businesses and investors, and calls for the DOL to wait for the SEC to issue a similar rule. The Obama Administration proposed updating the definition of investment advice due to changes in retirement preparation, concerns about conflicted financial advice costs, and rollovers from DC plans to IRAs. Some stakeholders questioned the evidence used to justify the rule, while DOL argued that the definition needed updating because retirement preparation methods had evolved since 1975. In the mid-1970s, most Americans in employer-sponsored pension plans had DB pensions, but now more have DC plans. The shift from DB to DC plans has led to participants facing more decisions, such as contributions, investments, and withdrawals. DC plan sponsors may offer investment advice to help with these complex decisions. The Obama Administration sought to update the investment advice rule based on concerns about conflicted advice and the need to adapt to modern retirement preparation methods. The 2015 report from the Council of Economic Advisers estimated that conflicted investment advice costs IRA investors about $17 billion per year due to lower returns and higher fees. Some critics argue that the analysis overlooks the nuanced benefits brokers provide under current regulations. The Regulatory Impact Analysis by DOL supports the proposal by highlighting conflicts of interest in the retirement plan market structure. The retirement plan market faces conflicts of interest not adequately addressed by current regulations. Plan sponsors may be unsure if their advisers follow a fiduciary standard. Platform providers offering advice on investment options may have fee arrangements creating conflicts of interest, like revenue sharing. Enforcement challenges arise from proving individuals meet all elements of the five-part test. For example, when a DB plan terminates, annuity contracts must be purchased for participants' future benefits. The plan involved purchasing annuity contracts for participants, which were one-time events not meeting the requirement for regular advice. Advisers recommending these contracts might not be considered fiduciaries. IRA investors were vulnerable to conflicts of interest and could benefit from a new rule. The RIA estimated gains of $40-44 billion for IRA investors over 10 years, with compliance costs of $2.7-5.7 billion for financial institutions. The RIA also analyzed changes in investment advice regulation in Great Britain and their impact on investors with smaller account balances. The RIA analyzed changes in investment advice regulation in Great Britain and their impact on investors with smaller account balances. Some stakeholders questioned the evidence in the RIA and challenged the adoption of the 2015 proposed rule. Concerns were raised about rollovers from DC plans to IRAs by the Obama Administration and other policymakers. The SEC's 2014 examination priorities included investigating the sales practices of investment advisers targeting retirement-aged workers for rollovers to higher-cost investments. In 2013, 86% of traditional IRAs were opened through rollovers from employer-sponsored plans, with $424 billion transferred in 2014. A GAO report in 2013 highlighted concerns that individuals do not always receive recommendations in their best interests when rolling over 401(k) account balances to IRAs. Pension plan participants face challenges when considering rolling over their 401(k) account balances to IRAs, including confusion, lack of employer assistance, and potentially misleading marketing by financial institutions. Factors to consider include lower fees in 401(k) plans, more investment options in IRAs, consolidation of multiple 401(k) plans into a single IRA, and the absence of ERISA's fiduciary protections for IRAs. FINRA issued guidance in 2013 to address concerns in the IRA rollover market. The DOL issued guidance on broker-dealers' recommendations for rollovers into IRAs, superseding a 2005 advisory opinion. The 2016 final rule considers rollover recommendations as investment advice subject to fiduciary standards. The Trump Administration reviewed the rule for potential harm to retirement investors. The DOL delayed the applicability date of the expanded definition of investment advice and the Impartial Conduct Standard of the Best Interest Contract exemption until June 9, 2017. Other aspects of the exemption will become applicable on January 1, 2018. The Secretary of Labor stated that there was no legal basis to further delay the applicability date. Until January 1, 2018, the DOL will not pursue claims against fiduciaries who are working diligently to comply with the fiduciary duty rule. Stakeholders had varied views on the 2015 proposed rule and the 2016 final rule. Financial services professionals support a best-interests standard, with many already operating in the best interests of their clients. The company supports a best interest fiduciary standard, but some financial services professionals found the 2015 proposed rule challenging to implement. They felt it could hinder providing necessary investment assistance for retirement. The rule could also restrict marketing materials from financial institutions, limiting information about products offered. The final rule addressed concerns about conflicts of interest in selling financial products. Fiduciary advisers using the BIC exemption must disclose costs, compensation arrangements, and maintain investment records for six years. The final rule addressed conflicts of interest in selling financial products by requiring fiduciary advisers to disclose costs, compensation arrangements, and maintain investment records for six years. The Department of Labor (DOL) made changes to address concerns about disclosures, such as streamlining online disclosure requirements. However, some stakeholders, like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, find the final rule's disclosures more burdensome than previous requirements. Consumer advocacy groups, like the Consumer Federation of America, support the DOL proposal, citing benefits already seen from the final rule. The AARP, AFL-CIO, and financial services companies supported the DOL's proposal and final rule on investment advice, emphasizing the benefits for plan sponsors, workers, and retirees. Prior to the rulemaking, there were calls for better coordination between the SEC and DOL to create a uniform fiduciary standard for all advisers. During the Obama Administration, DOL addressed the need for a uniform fiduciary standard for all advisers, including registered investment advisers and broker-dealers. SEC Chair Mary Jo White also advocated for a uniform fiduciary standard of conduct for personalized securities advice to retail investors. The SEC worked on developing rulemaking recommendations for implementing a uniform fiduciary goal. Chair White emphasized the importance of coordination with the DOL's rules. President Trump's nominee, Jay Clayton, succeeded Chair White in May 2017. On June 1, 2017, Chair Clayton addressed the potential impact of the DOL Fiduciary Rule on retail investors and SEC-regulated entities, emphasizing the SEC's role in protecting investors and maintaining market efficiency. He expressed willingness to collaborate with the Department of Labor on standards of conduct for investment advisers and broker-dealers. Clayton acknowledged the challenges posed by evolving investment advice practices in future decision-making processes. Chair Clayton addressed the challenges posed by evolving investment advice practices and the wide range of possible actions the agency could take. He invited the public to share their views on standards of conduct for investment advisers and broker-dealers. The chair invited the public to share their views on the standards of conduct for investment advisers and broker-dealers providing advice to retail investors. Questions were raised about the implementation of the DOL Fiduciary Rule and how it should inform the Commission's analysis. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to prevent or delay the rule's implementation. Legislation introduced in the 115th Congress aims to prevent or delay the fiduciary rule, define investment advice in U.S. Code, and establish a best-interest PTE. Similar bills were proposed in the 114th Congress to rescind or delay the fiduciary rule and define investment advice with a best-interest PTE."
