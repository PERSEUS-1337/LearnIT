    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 17053.50 of the Revenue and Taxation Code allows a 30% tax credit for qualified taxpayers for costs related to at-risk properties, defined as buildings at risk of collapse in an earthquake. Qualified buildings include those certified as at-risk properties and mobile homes registered with the Department of Housing and Community Development. Qualified costs for seismic retrofit construction on a qualified building are defined as costs paid by the taxpayer, excluding maintenance, repair of earthquake damage, seismic retrofit required by local building codes due to changes, and other improvements mandated by local codes. The curr_chunk discusses various aspects related to seismic retrofit construction costs, including rent reductions, replacement of building components, bracing nonpermanent contents, cost offsets, and payments to building code enforcement for certifications. The curr_chunk defines a \"qualified taxpayer\" as an owner of a qualified building in the state, allowing them to claim a credit for seismic retrofit construction costs incurred after January 1, 2017. Seismic retrofit construction includes anchoring structures, bracing walls, and installing safety measures. To be eligible for the seismic retrofit construction credit, the qualified taxpayer must obtain certification from the local building code enforcement authority that the building is at risk. This includes anchoring fuel storage and installing earthquake resistant bracing systems for mobilehomes registered with the Department of Housing and Community Development. To qualify for the seismic retrofit construction credit, the taxpayer must obtain certification from the building code enforcement authority confirming the completion of seismic retrofit construction. The taxpayer must then request an allocation of the credit from the Franchise Tax Board and retain copies of the certifications for their records. The jurisdiction with building code enforcement authority must have an agreement with the state to provide certifications for seismic retrofit construction. The credit amount can be claimed over five years, and any excess credit can be carried over to the following years until exhausted. The total credit allocation under this section and Section 23650 is limited to $12,000,000 annually. The Franchise Tax Board will notify taxpayers of the allocated credit amount on a first-come-first-served basis. Taxpayers must claim the credit on their original return, and the Board's decisions on credit allocation and timely filing cannot be challenged in any proceeding. The credit claimed may be disallowed if determined by the Franchise Tax Board, treated as a mathematical error, and assessed accordingly. This credit replaces any other credit or deduction for qualified costs. The Board can establish rules for implementing this section, including credit allocation guidelines. Section 23650 of the Revenue and Taxation Code allows a 30% tax credit for qualified taxpayers for at-risk properties from January 1, 2017, to December 1, 2022, when it will be repealed. A qualified building is certified as an at-risk property and includes mobile homes. Qualified costs are expenses for seismic retrofit construction, excluding maintenance and repair of earthquake damage. Seismic retrofit construction includes repair of earthquake damage, work required by local building codes, rent reductions, replacement of building components, bracing nonpermanent contents, and cost offsets. The qualified taxpayer must pay the jurisdiction for building code enforcement to issue certifications for seismic retrofit construction on a qualified building in California. Seismic retrofit construction involves altering the building to mitigate seismic damage, such as anchoring the structure to the foundation and bracing walls and hot water heaters. Seismic retrofit construction in California includes bracing cripple walls, hot water heaters, installing gas shutoff valves, repairing foundation, anchoring fuel storage, and earthquake resistant bracing for mobilehomes. To be eligible for the tax credit, the taxpayer must obtain certification from the local building code enforcement authority that the building is at risk. To qualify for a tax credit for seismic retrofit construction in California, the taxpayer must obtain certification from the local building code enforcement authority confirming the completion of seismic retrofit construction. The taxpayer must then request an allocation of the credit from the Franchise Tax Board by submitting an application along with the certification. Additionally, the taxpayer must retain copies of the certifications for their records. The jurisdiction where a qualified building is located must have an agreement with the state to provide certifications for seismic retrofit construction. The tax credit can be claimed over five years, and any excess credit can be carried over to the following years until exhausted. The tax credit for seismic retrofit construction is limited to $12 million annually and any unallocated credits from previous years. The Franchise Tax Board allocates the credit on a first-come-first-served basis upon receiving the application. Taxpayers must claim the credit on their original return, and the Board's allocation decision is final and not subject to review. The Franchise Tax Board may disallow a claimed credit under certain circumstances, treating it as a mathematical error on the return. This credit is exclusive and replaces any other credits or deductions for qualified costs. The Board has the authority to establish rules and guidelines for administering this credit, including allocation guidelines. Section 3 states that the tax credits will be in effect until December 1, 2022, and then repealed. It outlines the goals of leveraging private investment, creating engineering or construction jobs, and mitigating seismic damage. Performance indicators include measuring private sector investment and job creation. The data collection requirements for determining the effectiveness of tax credits for seismic retrofitting include measuring the number of engineering or construction jobs created, estimating lives saved, and reviewing information from relevant state entities. The Franchise Tax Board and state entities must provide data to the Legislative Analyst for seismic retrofit construction of at-risk properties. This act constitutes a tax levy and takes immediate effect."
