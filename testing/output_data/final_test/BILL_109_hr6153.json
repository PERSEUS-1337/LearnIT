The Congress found issues with the coordination of training and technical assistance to countries vulnerable to terrorist financing, as well as accountability in blocking terrorist assets. The Comptroller General highlighted the lack of a strategic plan for coordinating this assistance. The Terrorist Financing Working Group, chaired by the Secretary of State, coordinates training and assistance to priority and nonpriority countries vulnerable to terrorist financing. Disagreements between the Secretary of State and Treasury have led to ineffective leadership in delivering counterterrorism financing assistance. The disagreement between the Secretary of State and the Department of Treasury has hindered the delivery of training and technical assistance to countries vulnerable to terrorist financing. In May 2005, the Department of State denied entry to a Treasury employee in response to a request from a central bank to set up a financial intelligence unit. The Secretary of State wanted to conduct a Terrorist Financing Working Group assessment before allowing the Treasury to continue its work. The United States Ambassador to a country requested a delay in the assessment by the Department of the Treasury, causing a delay in their work. The Comptroller General testified that the interagency coordinating effort on terrorist financing training lacked key elements for effective strategic planning. The Comptroller General's October 2005 report highlighted disagreements on providing legislative drafting assistance for counterterrorism financing legislation, emphasizing the need for alignment of resources and processes to measure results. The State and the Attorney General prefer legislative drafting by Department of Justice officials over contractors, citing past deficiencies in contractor work. The Secretary of the Treasury, however, sometimes advocates for contractors for nonpriority countries. In April 2006, officials from the State and Treasury Departments testified before the House Financial Services Committee that they did not act on recommendations for a strategic plan for counterterrorism financing training. They believe an integrated plan already exists and see no need to reinvent the process. The Comptroller General recommended that Congress require the Secretaries of State and Treasury to submit an annual report on the status of interagency efforts for the Terrorist Financing Working Group's seamless functioning. SEC. 3. MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT REQUIRED. The Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury will negotiate a Memorandum of Agreement outlining their respective roles in providing counterterrorism financing training and assistance to foreign countries. The Agreement will specify leadership roles and agency responsibilities in delivering this assistance. Counterterrorism financing training and technical assistance will be provided to all countries, regardless of priority status. A dispute resolution methodology will be established for interagency disputes, with specific timeframes for resolution. Coordination of funding and resources will be ensured. The coordination of funding and resources for counterterrorism financing and anti-money laundering training will be provided to all countries, regardless of priority status. A procedure will be established to determine the appropriateness of using contractors for delivering training and technical assistance. The bill includes a process for evaluating the quality of work by contractors providing counterterrorism training and technical assistance, as well as a system for measuring performance and results of such training. SEC. 4. ANNUAL REPORT. The Secretary of the Treasury must report to Congress on terrorist assets, detailing activities blocking access to financial assets due to terrorism connections. The report includes performance evaluations, differences in blocked amounts, reasons for asset unblocking, and US Government achievements and obstacles in asset location and blocking. The Secretary of the Treasury reports to Congress on terrorist assets, including activities blocking access to financial assets due to terrorism connections, performance evaluations, differences in blocked amounts, reasons for asset unblocking, and US Government achievements and obstacles in asset location and blocking.
