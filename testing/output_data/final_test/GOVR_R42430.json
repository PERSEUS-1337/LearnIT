    "content": "COMPETES 2010 authorized $45.5 billion in funding for federal research in physical sciences, engineering, STEM education, and related programs between FY2010 and FY2013. Provisions of the law, including funding authorizations, expired in FY2013. The law increased funding for NSF, NIST, and DOE Office of Science, and authorized new technology transfer activities. It also allowed for inducement prizes, established a loan guarantee program for manufacturers, and promoted commercialization activities at federal agencies. COMPETES 2010 authorized funding for federal research in physical sciences, engineering, and STEM education. It established programs like inducement prizes, a loan guarantee program for manufacturers, and a Regional Innovation Program. The law also focused on coordinating federal STEM education programs and supporting academic programs for teacher certification in STEM fields. The President's FY2013 budget requested increased funding for certain accounts but provided limited support for COMPETES 2010 authorized STEM education programs. The President's FY2013 budget request was generally consistent with prior year Obama Administration requests and appropriations activity for COMPETES acts. The budget included support for the Regional Innovation Program at the Department of Commerce but did not seek funding for certain authorized programs like the NIST Green Jobs Act and STEM-Training Grant program. COMPETES 2010 also authorized programs without defined funding amounts, such as the Green Chemistry Basic Research program at NSF, which received funding in the FY2013 budget request. The President's FY2013 budget request included funding for a green chemistry program at NSF and highlighted the Administration's budget request for selected research programs and accounts authorized by COMPETES 2010. The request for NIST in FY2013 was $857.0 million, an increase of $106.2 million from FY2012 enacted levels. In FY2013, the President requested $857.0 million for NIST, which was $106.2 million more than FY2012 enacted levels. The request included funding for core laboratories, construction, Industrial Technology Services, and the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership. The President did not seek funding for the Baldrige Performance Excellence Program or the NIST Green Jobs Act in FY2013. The FY2013 budget request for the NSF's Research and Related Activities account was $5.983 billion, $225.0 million more than FY2012. Funding for two COMPETES 2010 programs, EPSCoR and PFI, was included in the budget request. The President requested $158.2 million for EPSCoR in FY2013, $7.3 million more than FY2012. The FY2013 NSF budget requested $158.2 million for EPSCoR, an increase of $7.3 million from FY2012. The budget also included $8.2 million for PFI, with an additional $200,000 allocated for the Building Innovation Capacity track. Funding was provided for a new Sustainable Chemistry, Engineering, and Materials program in response to Section 509 of COMPETES 2010. The FY2013 NSF budget requested $76.7 million for SusCHEM and other SEES programs under the OneNSF Framework, focusing on seamless operations across boundaries. The budget also proposed $67.0 million in research program terminations, including reductions in various areas like CISE and MPS. The NSF FY2013 budget requested realignment of research programs, moving some to research directorates and merging others. The impact of these changes on foundation activities is still unclear. The NSF's FY2013 budget request did not reflect consolidations in research programs, unlike the foundation's current plan. The President's FY2013 budget for the DOE Office of Science was $4.992 billion, slightly higher than the FY2012 funding level. Additionally, $350.0 million was sought for the ARPA-E account, aiming to increase federal funding for research in physical sciences and engineering. The Bush and Obama Administrations aimed to double funding for targeted accounts through the COMPETES acts, with a compound annual growth rate of 6.3%. The President's FY2013 budget requested a 4.1% increase for these accounts, supporting the doubling path policy. The President's FY2013 STEM education request aimed to increase the number of well-prepared college graduates with STEM degrees by one-third and prepare 100,000 STEM teachers over the next decade. This involved program and funding changes to existing COMPETES 2010 authorized programs and agencies. No specific requests for new STEM education programs were included in the budget. The President's FY2013 budget did not include specific requests for new STEM education programs authorized by COMPETES 2010. The proposed reorganization of the Department of Education would have eliminated and consolidated certain programs, including Teachers for a Competitive Tomorrow and Advanced Placement programs. The status of these programs, as authorized by COMPETES acts, is unclear. The President's FY2013 budget did not specify funding for the TCT program authorized by COMPETES Act. The AP program operated by ED under ESEA is different from the COMPETES-authorized AP program. The FY2013 ED request for CPAL, including the AP program, was $81.0 million, with $24.1 million for advanced course test fees. DOE does not typically request funding for COMPETES-authorized STEM education programs. The DOE Office of Science operates STEM education programs, including the Science Graduate Fellowship program. The President's FY2013 budget did not include funding for the SCGF program, which received $5.0 million in FY2012. The House Committee on Appropriations questioned why fellowships should be funded within the Office of Science when other agencies like the National Science Foundation are primary entities for such purposes. The DOE terminated the DOE ACTS program in FY2012 based on a recommendation from a 2010 DOE Committee of Visitors report. The President did not seek funding for the program in FY2013. The Office of Science supports Early Career Research Program awards, with approximately $16.0 million allocated for this purpose. The Office of Science provides approximately $16.0 million per year for Early Career Research awards. In FY2013, the Fusion Energy Sciences budget requested $9.2 million for the \"Other\" activity, a decrease from the previous year. The Senate Committee on Appropriations suggested redirecting funds from terminated education programs to the Distinguished Scientist Program in FY2012. The President's FY2013 request for Office of Science did not include funding for the Scientist Program authorized by the COMPETES acts. The primary source of funding for STEM education activities at NSF is the Education and Human Resources (E&HR) account, with a requested budget of $875.6 million in FY2013. This amount was $45.1 million more than the FY2012 actual level and $166.2 million less than the COMPETES 2010 authorized level. The FY2013 NSF budget request highlighted proposals for STEM education, including the new Expeditions in Education (E 2 ) initiative. In FY2013, NSF requested increased funding for the Graduate Research Fellowship program, with $243.0 million allocated, up by $45.1 million from FY2012. The funding would support 2,000 new fellows at a cost of education level of $12,000 per fellow. Other E&HR initiatives included coordination with the Department of Education on STEM education programs. In FY2013, NSF proposed a new $60.0 million K-16 mathematics education program funded by E&HR and ED. E&HR sought to reframe programs into three categories and requested $20.0 million for a \"Core Launch Fund.\" Existing STEM education programs were also included in the FY2013 budget request. The Administration's FY2013 requests for NSF programs were below the FY2012 estimates, including IGERT, Noyce, REU, and STEP. The America COMPETES acts authorized NSF programs for Hispanic-serving institutions and other minority-serving institutions. The NSF's FY2013 budget request included funding for various programs, such as the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) and the Division of Human Research Development within E&HR. However, there was no specific program established for Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs). The President's FY2013 budget also requested funding for other COMPETES 2010 provisions, including $25.0 million for the RIP program at the DOC's Economic Development Administration. The FY2013 budget request did not include specific funding for the new Federal Loan Guarantees for Innovative Technologies in Manufacturing program at the DOC or for activities authorized by the NIST Green Jobs Act of 2010, both authorized by COMPETES 2010. Funding for COMPETES 2010 programs and agencies is typically included in three appropriations acts: Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS), Energy and Water Development (Energy-Water), and Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies (Labor-HHS-Education). The FY2013 appropriations for COMPETES 2010-related agencies were provided in two acts, with funding levels detailed in Table A-1. The President signed two laws, P.L. 112-175 and P.L. 113-6, which provided appropriations to federal agencies at FY2012 levels with a slight increase until March 27, 2013. The FY2013 appropriations for COMPETES 2010-related agencies were provided in two acts, with funding levels detailed in Table A-1. P.L. 113-6 provided regular appropriations for some federal agencies and continuing appropriations for others, including certain rescissions that applied to COMPETES 2010 accounts. The Chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations published an explanatory statement in the Congressional Record to resolve conflicts between House and Senate FY2013 appropriations committee report recommendations. Agencies funded through CJS provisions received regular appropriations, while those funded through Energy-Water and Labor-HHS-Education received continuing appropriations. This distinction is important for congressional policymakers assessing the status. The FY2013 appropriations for COMPETES 2010-related agencies were provided in two acts, with funding levels detailed in Table A-1. P.L. 113-6 provided regular appropriations for some federal agencies and continuing appropriations for others, including certain rescissions that applied to COMPETES 2010 accounts. The topic of across-the-board federal budget cuts (sequestration) dominated much of the FY2013 congressional budget and appropriations debate. Agencies funded through CJS provisions received regular appropriations, while those funded through Energy-Water and Labor-HHS-Education received continuing appropriations. This distinction is important for congressional policymakers assessing the status of proposed changes to agency activities included in the President's FY2013 budget request. The House passed H.R. 5326 (Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2013) by a vote of 247-163 on May 10, 2012. The act would have provided FY2013 appropriations for the Department of Commerce (including NIST), NSF, and other CJS agencies. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported a bill to provide FY2013 CJS appropriations on April 19, 2012 (S. 2323), but the full Senate did not consider that measure. This section compares FY2013 post-rescission, post-sequestration CJS funding levels for selected COMPETES 2010 accounts with enacted, current, or actual FY2012 funding levels, and FY2013 COMPETES 2010 authorized funding levels. The FY2013 funding status for COMPETES-related provisions at the DOC is described, including top line funding for NIST programs and accounts. Post-rescission, post-sequestration funding for NIST was $769.4 million, $18.6 million more than FY2012 enacted funding, and $270.3 million less than COMPETES 2010 authorized funding. In FY2013, NIST received $830.6 million, $4.6 million more than the Senate recommendation and $26.4 million less than the Administration's request. Post-rescission, post-sequestration funding for STRS was $579.8 million, $12.8 million more than FY2012 enacted funding. H.R. 5326 would have provided $621.2 million to STRS in FY2013, $1.8 million less than the Senate recommendation and $26.8 million less than the Administration's request. In FY2013, NIST received $830.6 million, $4.6 million more than the Senate recommendation and $26.4 million less than the Administration's request. Post-rescission, post-sequestration funding for STRS was $579.8 million, $12.8 million more than FY2012 enacted funding. The March 11, 2013, explanatory statement included language allowing NIST to locally transport Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) participants. CRF (construction) funding for FY2013 was $56.0 million, $4.6 million more than FY2012 enacted funding level. MEP program funding for FY2013 was $119.4 million, $9.0 million less than FY2012 enacted funding level. In FY2013, H.R. 5326 would have provided $128.4 million to the MEP, which was about the same as the Senate recommendation and $400,000 more than the Administration's request. The Regional Innovation Program (RIP) and Innovative Technologies in Manufacturing received $5.0 million each in funding, equal to FY2012 levels. The DOC's FY2014 budget request anticipated initial execution of loan guarantees in FY2015. H.R. 5326 authorized unspecified funding for the RIP and up to $5.0 million for the manufacturing loan guarantee program in FY2013. S. 2323 and S.Rept. 112-158 allocated $25.0 million for RIP and up to $7.0 million for science park loan guarantees. The House committee report directed EDA to provide details on implementing the manufacturing loan guarantee program with its FY2014 budget request. The Senate committee report directed EDA to continue providing grants and technical assistance for clean energy technology commercialization, consider new competitions in different industries, and prioritize geographic equity in award decisions. NSF's FY2013 funding was $6.884 billion, which was lower than previous years. There was a $59.4 million difference in funding for the main research account between H.R. 5326 and S. 2323, resulting in different top line allocations. In FY2013, the House and Senate Committee on Appropriations had a difference in funding levels for the NSF, with the House proposing $7.333 billion and the Senate proposing $7.273 billion. Both were lower than the President's request of $7.373 billion. The Senate directed NSF to report on progress implementing Inspector General recommendations. House amendments aimed to eliminate funding for NSF's Climate Change Education program and political science research. In FY2013, NSF's Research and Related Activities (R&RA) funding was $5.544 billion, which was less than the FY2012 level and COMPETES 2010 authorized funding. H.R. 5326 proposed $5.943 billion for R&RA, with priorities in cybersecurity, advanced manufacturing, and materials research. House committee report also directed I-Corps participants to focus on domestic production of goods. The Senate committee report directed NSF to focus on core programs and infrastructure, reduce funding for new OneNSF activities, and allocate adequate funding for domestic radio astronomy facilities. It also provided funding for astronomical sciences, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, and required NSF to report on interdisciplinary activities at NSF-funded research facilities. The Senate committee report allocated funding for cybersecurity research, the Academic Research Fleet, and scientific facilities. EPSCoR would receive $158.0 million under the proposal. Provisions in the explanatory statement included terminations of NSF's R&RA, advanced manufacturing language, cybersecurity research, and I-Corps. The explanatory statement rejected Senate report limitations on OneNSF initiatives and encouraged NSF to balance core functions and OneNSF initiatives in future budget requests. It provided funding for astronomical sciences and EPSCoR, with $247.6 million for infrastructure and $158.2 million for EPSCoR. STEM Education received $833.3 million in FY2013 post-rescission funding for NSF's Education and Human Resources account. In FY2013, the E&HR funding level was $875.6 million, equal to the President's budget request. The House committee report included STEM education provisions and encouraged NSF to make changes to the Informal Science Education program. The House committee report encouraged NSF to promote collaboration between research institutions and STEM-focused K-12 schools. The Senate committee report supported undergraduate science and engineering education, rejected proposed cuts to the ISE program, and directed funding for specific programs at FY2012 levels. The March 11, 2013 explanatory statement incorporated most of NSF's proposed reductions, except for the ISE program. It directed funding for AISL as per the Senate report, allocated $69.0 million for ATE, and adopted House and Senate report language on STEM education and the Federal Cyber Service program. NSF had not published post-rescission, post-sequestration FY2013 funding levels for broadening participation programs, with total FY2012 funding at $761.1 million. In FY2013, funding for NSF broadening participation programs totaled $761.1 million. Specific program funding levels included $30.3 million for HBCU-UP, $12.3 million for TCUP, $42.1 million for Stokes, and $23.0 million for CREST. The House committee report provided this information. In FY2013, NSF broadening participation programs received funding totaling $761.1 million. The House committee report detailed funding levels for HBCU-UP ($30.3 million), TCUP ($12.3 million), Stokes ($42.1 million), and CREST ($23.0 million). The Senate committee report provided different funding levels for these programs, with additional funding for HSI needs and proposals with demonstrated maturity. The March 11, 2013, explanatory statement incorporated Senate report funding levels. The House passed H.R. 5325 (Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill, 2013) providing FY2013 appropriations for the Department of Energy's Office of Science and ARPA-E. P.L. 112-175 and P.L. 113-6 provided continuing appropriations to Energy-Water agencies in FY2013. Comparisons of FY2013 post-rescission, post-sequestration Energy-Water funding levels were made. The Office of Science received $4.621 billion in FY2013 post-rescission, post-sequestration funding, which was 6.4% less than the FY2012 current funding level of $4.935 billion and 23.0% less than the COMPETES 2010 authorized funding level of $6.001 billion. H.R. 5325 would have provided $4.801 billion for the Office of Science in FY2013. The Office of Science funding in FY2013 was $4.801 billion, which was less than the Senate Committee on Appropriations' recommendation and the President's request. The House and Senate committee reports highlighted support for minority serving institutions and research priorities in new materials, biofuels, and computing, but also expressed concerns about managing lower priority research activities. In FY2013, the Office of Science's Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists (WDTS) account received $17.5 million, a decrease from the previous year. The House committee recommended $14.5 million for WDTS, aligning with the Senate committee and FY2013 request. No funds were allocated for the Office of Science Graduate Fellowship (SCGF) as per the FY2013 budget request. The House committee report in FY2013 commended the Office of Science for evaluating its science workforce development programs. It also listed educational activities as a major concern for the Department of Energy, along with competitiveness and intellectual property issues. The House directed DOE to provide a comprehensive listing of all funded educational activities in FY2012. Additionally, DOE was prohibited from funding fellowship and scholarship programs in FY2013 unless specifically requested in the budget justification and not excluded from funding. In FY2013, ARPA-E received $250.6 million in funding, which was less than the authorized levels. H.R. 5325 proposed $200.0 million for ARPA-E, significantly lower than the recommended and requested amounts. The House committee expressed support for ARPA-E's focus on transportation technologies, but an amendment aimed to restrict the use of federal funds by awardees. The House committee expressed concerns about DOE's failure to produce requested reports on Office of Science activities in a timely manner and encouraged the adoption of ARPA-E project management practices. They also raised competitiveness concerns about foreign manufacturers benefiting from ideas developed in DOE labs. The House committee raised concerns about DOE's failure to produce timely reports on Office of Science activities and competitiveness issues with foreign manufacturers benefiting from ideas developed in DOE labs. H.Rept. 112-462 directed DOE to report on controlling intellectual property and improving domestic intellectual property transfer. S.Rept. 112-164 expressed concerns about contractor support at the Office of Science and directed DOE to maintain small business contracting practices at national laboratories. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported S. 3295 (Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2013) on June 14, 2012. The Senate committee report did not specify funding amounts for COMPETES acts-related Department of Education (ED) programs. Continuing appropriations were provided to Labor-HHS-Education agencies through P.L. 112-175 and P.L. 113-6, but neither act made specific provisions for COMPETES 2010 authorizations at ED. Under COMPETES 2010, targeted account funding was set to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 6.3%. In 2010, targeted account funding was projected to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 6.3%, taking approximately 11 years to double. However, actual appropriations slowed during the COMPETES 2010 authorization period, with FY2013 funding levels generally below FY2010 levels. Only the NIST core laboratory account saw an increase in funding. The COMPETES acts aimed to enhance US competitiveness through scientific and technological innovation by increasing funding for research and STEM education. The debate over FY2013 funding for COMPETES 2010 provisions was part of a broader discussion on federal support for innovation and competitiveness. A coalition of leaders suggests that the federal government should support physical sciences and engineering research to boost national competitiveness. They argue that external pressures and internal weaknesses threaten the US innovation advantage, pointing to countries like China and India competing for high-value jobs. The US STEM workforce and leading-edge industries are seen as potential areas of weakness. The COMPETES acts proponents raise concerns about funding for research in physical sciences and engineering, as well as the supply of scientists, engineers, and technicians in the US. Opposition to the innovation policy approach embodied in the COMPETES acts falls into three categories: questions about assumptions, preferences for alternative policies, and cost. Some analysts dispute assumptions about increasing the supply of STEM workers, arguing that the real challenge lies in demand. Increased investment in publicly funded research is also questioned. Increased investment in publicly funded research is questioned by some analysts, who argue that it may not increase U.S. competitiveness as the research is publicly available. Opponents prefer alternative policy tools like regulatory changes and tax policy, citing concerns about cost and market distortion. FY2013 marked the end of major funding authorizations from COMPETES 2010, with debates over funding increases and the impact of sequestration. The final FY2013 appropriations act (P.L. 113-6) decreased funding levels for many COMPETES accounts below FY2010 levels. The gap between COMPETES act authorizations and appropriations widened in FY2013, raising questions about future funding and reauthorization discussions."
