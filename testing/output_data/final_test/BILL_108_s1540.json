    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Indian Trust Payment Equity Act of 2003\". It includes findings and purposes. Congress finds that the United States has treaty obligations to Indian tribes and individuals, functioning as a trustee with a fiduciary duty to protect their assets. The US has failed in its obligations regarding trust fund management and historical accounting, leading to longstanding mismanagement issues spanning multiple administrations. The mismanagement of trust funds for Native Americans has been a longstanding issue, with a civil action filed in 1996 to address the situation. The individual Indian money fund currently holds around $3 billion and distributes over $500 million annually to account holders. The individual Indian money account holders receive funds from Indian trust land royalties. Disagreements exist on the amount owed and the number of beneficiaries in the United States. The United States estimates around 300,000 beneficiaries but has not disclosed the total amount owed. The Secretary of the Interior established the Office of Historical Trust Accounting to conduct a full accounting of individual Indian money accounts, which could take over a decade and cost at least $2.4 billion. The completion of a comprehensive accounting of funds owed to individual Indian money account holders is not expected for at least 5 years after the enactment of the Act. The Act acknowledges the debt owed to Indian tribes and individuals, aims to promptly pay the debt, respects tribal sovereignty, and ensures payments are made to those owed by the United States. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This section defines key terms such as accounting, Fund, Indian, Indian tribe, and Secretary. SEC. 4. INDIAN TRUST PAYMENT EQUITY. In fiscal years 2004 through 2008, the Secretary will use $2 billion from the Fund to pay Indian tribes for mismanagement of individual Indian money accounts. The Secretary can also contract with tribes to assist in auditing these accounts. The \"Single Audit Act of 1984\" allows partial payment from the Fund if an audit is accepted. This does not affect the Department of the Interior's accounting requirement or settle individual Indian money account disputes. SEC. 5. INDIAN TRUST PAYMENT EQUITY FUND.
