Unlike previous nuclear accidents, this disaster was triggered by natural disasters rather than human error. The destruction led to fuel melting, hydrogen explosions, and radioactive releases. Studies have highlighted design flaws and safety improvements that could have mitigated the release of radioactivity. Fukushima has prompted a global reevaluation of nuclear plant safety standards. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station disaster in Japan on March 11, 2011, caused a significant release of radioactivity due to a massive earthquake and tsunami. Radioactive contamination from the Fukushima plant forced the evacuation of communities up to 25 miles away, affecting up to 100,000 residents. Workers at the plant site were exposed to high radiation levels, with some suffering radiation burns and others drowning during the tsunami. Recovery efforts have focused on restoring cooling systems and halting radioactive emissions. The damaged Fukushima reactors achieved \"cold shutdown\" in December 2011, reducing the threat of further radioactive releases. Japan allocated $15 billion for decontaminating the area around the plant, with complete decommissioning expected to take 40 years and cost over $75 billion. The Fukushima accident, estimated to cost over $75 billion, was detailed by the INPO in November 2011. The report highlights response actions, reactor core damage, and radioactive releases. Some details remain unknown due to extensive damage. The purpose of the CRS report is to discuss the implications for U.S. nuclear plant safety and policy. The Fukushima events, including new details from the INPO report, consequences of the disaster, and U.S. assistance to Japan are discussed. Additional CRS reports provide information on nuclear plant design, seismic safety, radioactive releases, U.S. nuclear safety responses, and effects of radiation on the U.S. marine environment. The earthquake on March 11, 2011, off the east coast of Honshu, Japan's largest island, caused an automatic shutdown of 11 reactors. The earthquake off the east coast of Honshu, Japan caused an automatic shutdown of 11 nuclear power plants, with the Fukushima Daiichi plant suffering severe damage and releasing radioactive material. The Fukushima complex consists of six nuclear units at the Fukushima Daiichi station and four units at the Fukushima Daini station, all boiling water reactors. The Fukushima Daiichi reactors, part of the General Electric Mark I design, began commercial operation between 1971 and 1979. Nuclear reactors produce power through fission of heavy isotopes like uranium-235 and plutonium-239, creating a continuous chain reaction. Control rods are used to shut down the reaction, but radioactive isotopes in the core continue to generate heat through decay. The Fukushima Daiichi reactors, operating on General Electric Mark I design, continued to produce heat through radioactive decay after automatically shutting down during the earthquake. Reactors 1, 2, and 3 were operating at the time, while reactors 4, 5, and 6 were shut down for inspections. The earthquake exceeded design levels at units 2 and 3, but all units maintained normal cooling until a tsunami struck the station. The Fukushima Daiichi station was struck by a tsunami, reaching a height of 14 meters, which devastated the area and overtopped the plant's seawall. The station lost access to the national electricity grid, relying on backup diesel generators for power. The tsunami flooded most generators and electrical switchgear rooms, causing a loss of backup power for cooling the nuclear reactors in units 1-5. Unit 6's air-cooled diesel generator survived, providing backup power for units 5 and 6. The plant's backup batteries were designed to provide DC power for eight hours, but most was lost when the tsunami flooded the distribution systems. TEPCO faced challenges cooling the Fukushima Daiichi reactors after losing power to the control rooms and backup systems. Despite efforts to cool the reactor cores with seawater and boron, the fuel in Unit 1 melted and leaked, with melting likely in Units 2 and 3 as well. The primary containments of units 1 through 3 at Fukushima Daiichi experienced high pressure and venting to relieve it, leading to hydrogen explosions that hindered cooling efforts. Each unit produced 800-1,000 kilograms of hydrogen, causing significant damage and impacting the plant's ability to cool the reactor cores and spent fuel pools. The loss of cooling at Fukushima Daiichi affected the plant's spent fuel pools, which hold fuel rods removed from reactors. If water in the pools boils away or leaks out, the fuel rods may overheat and release radioactive material. Efforts were made to spray water into the pools to prevent this, but later analysis showed they retained sufficient cooling water. The explosions of reactor buildings exposed the pools to the atmosphere. The explosions at reactor buildings 1, 3, and 4 exposed spent fuel pools to the atmosphere, potentially causing damage to the stored fuel. Radioactive material releases occurred at the plant, likely from leaking or venting from the containment structure. Contamination was found in seawater, agricultural products, and Tokyo drinking water. Radioactive cesium depositions were comparable to Chernobyl levels, extending beyond the evacuation zone. All units of the Fukushima plant were reconnected to off-site electrical power by March 23, with top priorities being restoring core cooling and eliminating contaminated water discharges. Reactors were declared in \"cold shutdown\" by December 16, 2011. Unit 1 experienced a shutdown after the earthquake, leading to hydrogen production and increased radiation levels. After a sharp rise in radiation levels, preparations were made to vent the containment at the Fukushima plant. The population within 10 kilometers was evacuated, and a hydrogen explosion occurred in the reactor building. Seawater and freshwater were injected into the reactor vessel, and off-site power was restored. TEPCO estimated that all nuclear fuel in Unit 1 had melted and fallen to the bottom of the reactor pressure vessel. TEPCO estimated that molten fuel from Unit 2 may have eaten into the concrete at the bottom of the primary containment to a depth of up to 70 centimeters. Unit 2 was generating electricity during the earthquake but suffered a power failure due to a hydrogen explosion in Unit 1, rendering backup generators inoperable. Workers attempted to vent the Unit 2 containment on March 15. On March 15, workers attempted to vent the Unit 2 containment, hearing a loud noise near the torus and a reduction in containment pressure. It was later determined not to be an explosion but possibly a breach of the primary containment. A blowout panel rupture allowed hydrogen to escape, preventing explosions in adjacent units. Core cooling was lost for over six hours, causing the reactor core to melt. Seawater injection began on March 14 after a delay due to a hydrogen explosion in Unit 3. Offsite power was restored on March 20. TEPCO estimates that 57% of the fuel in Unit 2 melted during the cooling loss period, with some possibly dropping to the bottom of the reactor vessel. Most of the melted fuel remained in the reactor vessel as of November 30. Unit 3 lost high-pressure water injection after 36 hours, leading to severe fuel damage and hydrogen generation. Severe fuel damage and hydrogen generation led to a large hydrogen explosion at the reactor site, injuring workers and damaging equipment. The explosion destroyed the secondary containment structure, necessitating seawater injection to restore cooling to the reactor. Unit 3 had been operating with plutonium-based mixed-oxide fuel. The use of mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel in Unit 3 raised concerns about plutonium release after the accident. Three workers were exposed to high radiation levels while installing cables. TEPCO estimates that much of the reactor core melted but was contained in the reactor vessel. The primary containment structure is intact, and no damage has been found in the spent fuel. Unit 4 was out of service for maintenance during the earthquake, with all nuclear fuel moved to the spent fuel pool. A hydrogen explosion damaged the reactor building, initially suspected to be from the spent fuel pool. However, later findings showed no significant overheating or water loss in the pool. Water spraying into the pool began on March 20 to prevent further issues. TEPCO's analysis revealed that the hydrogen explosion in Unit 4 came from Unit 3 during venting the day before. Due to a shared exhaust stack, when Unit 3 was vented, hydrogen and gases flowed back into Unit 4. Units 5 and 6 were not operating during the earthquake, with four emergency diesel generators rendered inoperable by the tsunami. The tsunami rendered five emergency diesel generators at units 5 and 6 inoperable, but one air-cooled diesel generator continued working, supplying power to both units. Cold shutdown was declared on March 20, with holes opened in the roofs to prevent hydrogen buildup. No other damage was reported to the reactor buildings or spent fuel. Fukushima Daini station, located 12 kilometers south of Daiichi, sustained damage to emergency core cooling systems at reactors 1, 2, and 4. Reactor 3 shut down without issues and retained offsite power for cooling water circulation. Makeup water and condensate systems were used as emergency measures. Radioactive material escaping from the damaged Fukushima-Daiichi reactor cores caused widespread contamination. Large releases of radioactive material into the atmosphere resulted from containment venting and hydrogen explosions. Contaminated water was discharged into the ocean. Precautionary evacuations were ordered, with elevated dose rates detected at the plant site boundary. The evacuation zone around the Fukushima-Daiichi plant was expanded due to deteriorating reactor conditions. Dose rates spiked at the site boundary and inside the plant, complicating recovery efforts. Radioactive contamination in the ocean raised international concerns. Japan allowed TEPCO to release contaminated water into the harbor, sparking controversy. TEPCO was allowed to release low-radioactivity water into the sea to make space for storing more contaminated water. Treatment facilities were built to remove radioactive material, allowing water to be recycled for cooling reactors. Land contamination around Fukushima was concentrated to the northwest, rendering large areas uninhabitable. Radioactive cesium depositions were comparable to Chernobyl's most contaminated areas. The French IRSN reported that the land around Fukushima with high cesium deposits is only 8.5% of that of Chernobyl. 84,000 residents within 20 kilometers were evacuated by April, with an additional 15,000 residents evacuated from the heavily contaminated area up to 40 kilometers from the plant. The Japanese government plans to decontaminate the area to reduce radiation doses to international standards. The United States and other countries, along with the International Atomic Energy Agency, are assisting Japan with the nuclear crisis. The U.S. provided various forms of aid, including equipment, advice, evacuation support, and medical assistance. The National Nuclear Security Administration sent a team of experts and equipment to help manage the crisis. The United States provided aid to Japan during the nuclear crisis, including equipment, analysis, and environmental remediation efforts. Deputy Secretary of Energy Daniel Poneman mentioned sharing experience in environmental cleanup at nuclear sites. Cooperation between the two countries is expected to continue for many years."
