The National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 is amended to allow for additional recreational activities on National Forest System land under ski area permits.

The National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 is amended to allow for additional recreational activities on National Forest System land under ski area permits. These activities must be authorized in accordance with land and resource management plans and applicable laws. Authorized activities may include zip lines, mountain bike terrain parks, frisbee golf courses, and ropes courses. Prohibited activities include tennis courts, water slides, and water parks. The Secretary may authorize recreational activities like tennis courts, water slides, swimming pools, golf courses, and amusement parks on National Forest System land under ski area permits. However, these activities must not detract from the primary recreational purpose of skiing and snow sports. The acreage for these authorized activities is not considered in determining the ski area permit boundaries. The Secretary can authorize recreational activities on National Forest System land under ski area permits, but these activities must not detract from skiing and snow sports. The Secretary must promulgate regulations to implement this section within 2 years of enactment. The amendments made by this Act do not establish a legal preference for ski area permit holders to provide authorized activities and facilities."
