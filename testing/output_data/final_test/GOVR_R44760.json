    "content": "A state may apply to waive certain provisions of the ACA for plan years starting in 2017, including sections related to qualified health plans, health insurance exchanges, cost-sharing reductions, premium tax credits, and shared responsibility. The ACA allows states to waive certain provisions related to health insurance exchanges, qualified health plans, and shared responsibility for large employers and individuals. This includes requirements for health plans, essential health benefits, cost-sharing limitations, and eligibility for catastrophic health plans. The ACA allows states to waive provisions related to health insurance exchanges, qualified health plans, and shared responsibility for large employers and individuals. The Secretary of HHS reviews and grants waiver requests for provisions not included in the IRC, while the Secretary of the Treasury reviews and grants requests to waive provisions in the IRC. Waiver applications are assessed based on coverage, affordability, comprehensiveness, and federal-deficit neutrality requirements outlined in statute. The Secretaries may grant a state innovation waiver if the application meets these requirements. The Secretaries will \"consider favorably\" any waiver that incorporates principles to provide increased access to affordable private market coverage, encourage sustainable spending growth, foster state innovation, support those in need, and promote consumer-driven health care. Their assessment of a state's waiver application does not consider policy changes dependent on further state action or federal determinations, such as changes to Medicaid or CHIP. The waiver process for state innovation waivers does not consider savings from changes to Medicaid or CHIP for deficit-neutrality. Technical enhancements now allow CMS to support some federally facilitated health insurance exchange variations, such as states creating their own websites to replace HealthCare.gov. States can work with HHS to replace HealthCare.gov with their own websites, incorporating CMS's enrollment functionalities. States are responsible for funding modifications to the exchange, with federal operational considerations limiting the scope of waivers. IRS may not accommodate state-specific changes to tax rules. The IRS may accommodate small changes to federal tax provisions that overlap with its current capabilities. States must fund changes to IRS administrative processes for waiver implementation, which are assessed for deficit neutrality. States seeking a waiver must enact a law allowing them to carry out waiver actions before applying. States seeking a waiver must enact a law allowing them to carry out waiver actions before applying. The state must provide public notice, conduct hearings, and submit the application to the Secretary of HHS for review. The application must include specific materials outlined in regulations for completeness. The state must enact legislation allowing waiver actions, submit a complete application to the Secretary of HHS, and provide analyses to show compliance. The final decision on a state's application must be made within 180 days. Approved waivers could result in federal funding for the state. State innovation waivers allow states to receive pass-through funding equivalent to the subsidies residents would have received without the waiver. This funding is determined annually and can be used for implementing the waiver plan. Waivers cannot exceed five years unless extended by the state. State innovation waivers can be extended beyond five years if a state requests continuation and the appropriate Secretary does not deny the request within 90 days. The Secretaries must coordinate applications for state innovation waivers and other health care-related waivers under federal law. States can submit a single application for multiple waivers, following the procedures for each waiver type. HHS and the Treasury assess state innovation waiver applications independently, not considering the impact of changes requiring separate federal approval. 14 states have submitted applications, with 8 approvals so far. Out of the 14 states that have submitted state innovation waiver applications, 8 have been approved. Massachusetts, Ohio, and Vermont received incomplete application notifications and have not made any modifications yet. California, Iowa, and Oklahoma have withdrawn their applications. Further review of any modified applications would be under updated state innovation waiver guidance."
