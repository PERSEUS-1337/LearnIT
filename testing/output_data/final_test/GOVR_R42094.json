    "content": "The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) is a brutal armed group led by Joseph Kony, operating in remote border areas between CAR, DRC, South Sudan, and Sudan. Known for massacres, abductions, sexual assault, and looting, the LRA has caused humanitarian suffering and instability. Despite Ugandan military efforts, the LRA still has around 150-200 core combatants and has killed over 2,900 civilians and abducted more than 6,000 since December. The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) has caused significant humanitarian suffering and instability, killing over 2,900 civilians and abducting more than 6,000 since December 2008. In response, Congress enacted the Lord's Resistance Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-172) to work towards a lasting resolution to the conflict. The Administration's approach to the LRA is organized around four broad objectives closely aligned with provisions of the legislation. The Obama Administration has shown commitment to preventing and responding to mass atrocities, including support for efforts to counter the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). In 2011, about 100 U.S. military personnel were deployed to assist Ugandan-led military operations against the LRA. Members of Congress have expressed support for this deployment, despite initial concerns about its duration, cost, and unintended consequences. The Obama Administration supported efforts to counter the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) by deploying U.S. military personnel in 2011. This deployment was directed to provide support for multilateral efforts to apprehend or remove Joseph Kony and his commanders. U.S.-based advocacy groups and international actors, including African governments, the United Nations, the African Union, and the European Union, have also contributed resources to address the LRA issue. The African Union Regional Task Force (AU-RTF) led by Uganda is combating the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) but has not reached its full troop strength. The Ugandan military is considered the most effective, but there are doubts about its capacity. Other LRA-affected countries have more pressing security concerns. The LRA's strength has decreased, and U.S. funding supports early-warning mechanisms in communities. Despite U.S. funding supporting various activities to combat the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) and improve civilian protection, Joseph Kony remains at large. The LRA has shown resilience and the ability to regenerate, making it challenging to capture Kony in the remote region. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper noted in 2014 that the LRA was on the run, but in 2015, he expressed concerns about their agility and potential to bounce back if counter-LRA operations are reduced. Analysts agree that the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) is a brutal group causing human suffering and instability. Questions arise about the extent of the LRA's threat to U.S. interests and the appropriate level of U.S. response. Key considerations include the priority of counter-LRA activities compared to other goals and the funding for such efforts. Key questions regarding the appropriate level of funding and benchmarks for success in counter-LRA efforts, as well as the potential impact of Uganda's withdrawal on U.S. response. Additionally, considerations for advancing civilian protection, supporting ex-LRA combatants, and regional military capabilities in defeating the LRA are discussed. The LRA, led by Ugandan nationals, operates in small, mobile bands with abductees serving various roles. The group's command structure is unclear, but its capacity has decreased due to military operations. Civilian killings by the LRA have significantly reduced. The LRA's strength has decreased to 200-300 fighters, with a significant decrease in civilian killings. The number of displaced people due to LRA attacks has also declined. However, attacks and abductions by the group increased in 2014 and 2015, posing a continued threat. The recent report by the U.N. Secretary-General raises concerns about the LRA's movement into DRC, where most attacks occurred in 2015. Incidents mainly involved looting and abductions around Garamba National Park, a former refuge for Kony and his fighters. Poachers, including LRA members, have targeted the park's elephant population, with over 170 elephants killed since 2014. LRA Crisis Tracker analysts warn of the group exploiting instability in CAR. In 2014, LRA Crisis Tracker analysts warned that the group is likely resupplying through looting and trafficking in illegal ivory, gold, and diamonds in CAR. Ugandan operations in CAR were halted in 2013 due to political and security challenges but later resumed. Reports indicate the LRA is now operating in areas beyond Ugandan troops' reach in the north and west of CAR. Independent analysts reported the LRA had a safe-haven in Kafia Kingi, a disputed area on the Sudan-South Sudan border, suggesting Sudanese government support. In 2014, analysts warned that the LRA is resupplying through illegal ivory trafficking in CAR. Ugandan operations in CAR were halted in 2013 but later resumed. The LRA is now operating in areas beyond Ugandan troops' reach in CAR. Reports suggest the LRA has a safe haven in Kafia Kingi, with possible Sudanese government support. The LRA uses Kafia Kingi as a transit point for ivory trafficking to Asia. Joseph Kony and senior LRA commanders have sought safe haven in Sudanese-controlled areas of Kafia Kingi. In September 2015, the AU Special Envoy for LRA Issues led a delegation to Khartoum at the invitation of the Sudanese government to discuss Kafia Kingi allegations. International humanitarian assistance to LRA-affected areas increased between 2009 and 2013, but access remains limited in remote areas. Insecurity in CAR and South Sudan has further reduced access since 2013, while NGOs are phasing out from some LRA-affected areas in DRC. The LRA emerged in northern Uganda in 1987. After Yoweri Museveni took power in Uganda, Joseph Kony, inspired by Alice Lakwena, formed the LRA. The group targeted Acholi civilians and sought support from Sudan. Museveni's recruitment of Acholis into defense forces led to increased LRA attacks and distrust between the government and northern communities. The LRA, under Joseph Kony, targeted Acholi civilians in northern Uganda and sought support from Sudan. President Museveni's recruitment of Acholis into the defense forces led to increased LRA attacks and distrust between the government and northern communities. Some analysts believe Museveni initially had little interest in defeating the LRA, allowing them to exploit the conflict for political and economic gain. The Ugandan military eventually pushed the LRA out of the country in 2005-2006, leading the LRA to move to other regions like DRC and CAR. The LRA's current area of activity has minimal government influence and limited international humanitarian presence, with vague political demands reflecting long-standing northern grievances. The LRA, led by Joseph Kony, has exploited long-standing northern grievances for political and economic gain. The group lacks a clear agenda and operates through violence and protection of leaders. Kony claims to receive commands from spirits and uses Christian rhetoric. LRA commanders are known for brutal killings and mass abduction of children for atrocities. In the 1990s, the Ugandan government conducted counterinsurgency operations against the LRA in the north and targeted LRA rear bases in southern Sudan. The International Criminal Court unsealed warrants for five LRA commanders, including Kony, with three reportedly dead and one surrendered to face war crimes charges. Joseph Kony, leader of the LRA, faces seven counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity at the ICC in The Hague. Despite reports of his declining health, Kony is still alive. Peace talks between the LRA and the Ugandan government mediated by Southern Sudan broke down in 2008 when Kony refused to sign a final agreement due to ICC warrants against him. Some analysts saw the warrants as a key obstacle in the negotiations, while others doubted Kony's sincerity in engaging in peace talks. In late 2008, the UPDF launched \"Operation Lightning Thunder\" to capture or kill senior LRA leaders in northeastern DRC with US support. The operation failed, leading to LRA splintering and brutal attacks on civilians. Uganda faced criticism for poor planning and failure to protect civilians. The UPDF launched \"Operation Lightning Thunder\" in late 2008 with US support to capture or kill senior LRA leaders in northeastern DRC. The operation failed, leading to LRA splintering and brutal attacks on civilians. Uganda faced criticism for poor planning and failure to protect civilians. Subsequently, the UPDF deployed to LRA-affected regions of South Sudan and CAR with renewed U.S. support. Uganda has encouraged Ugandan nationals within the LRA to desert and return through various programs, including an Amnesty Act. Over 27,000 ex-LRA members have reportedly been granted amnesty, with some being recruited by the UPDF for military operations. Many ex-LRA combatants who have returned to Uganda remain in poverty and face trauma and social ostracizing. Uganda has passed legislation to try senior LRA commanders for war crimes and has called for traditional justice and reconciliation mechanisms to end the conflict. The LRA is present in areas covered by U.N. peacekeeping operations, with MONUSCO supporting counter-LRA efforts and facilitating regional military coordination. MONUSCO also runs programs for disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of ex-LRA members. The United States has supported efforts to counter the effects of the LRA for over a decade, with a focus on DDRRR programs for ex-LRA combatants. U.S. involvement increased significantly after the Juba peace talks broke down in 2008, as the LRA expanded its operations in Central Africa. This engagement is tied to the group's infliction of human suffering and a security partnership with Uganda, which is also the leading troop contributor to the U.S.-supported AU stabilization operation in Somalia. The U.S. has supported efforts to counter the LRA for over a decade, focusing on DDRRR programs for ex-LRA combatants. The Administration's Strategy to Support the Disarmament of the Lord's Resistance Army outlines strategic objectives including protecting civilians, apprehending LRA leaders, promoting defections, and providing humanitarian relief. The U.S. will collaborate with national governments and regional organizations to achieve these goals. The U.S. will collaborate with national governments and regional organizations to counter the LRA, acknowledging limited capabilities of forces. Implementation involves the State Department, Defense Department, USAID, and intelligence community. The Administration urges prioritization of LRA-related efforts by regional governments, donors, and multilateral entities. The U.S. supports U.N. peacekeeping operations in DRC, South Sudan, and CAR. The United States supports U.N. peacekeeping operations in DRC, South Sudan, and CAR to coordinate counter-LRA activities. U.S. diplomacy mediates disputes between host countries and the Ugandan military over UPDF deployments. The U.S. has provided logistical support for African counter-LRA operations since 2008, primarily assisting the UPDF. The UPDF operates from bases in CAR and South Sudan with U.S. assistance for supplies, equipment, and logistics support. The U.S. embassy in Uganda oversees U.S. support for counter-LRA operations, with funding allocated by the State Department and Department of Defense. The Department of Defense (DOD) funds logistical support, supplies, and services for African counter-LRA operations, freeing up State Department resources. Funding totaled $22.5 million in FY2012 and $17.7 million in FY2013, below the authorized level of $35 million per year. Congress increased the authorized funding level to $50 million through FY2017, with DOD allocating approximately $25 million in both FY2014 and FY2015. In FY2011, DOD provided $4.4 million in counter-LRA-related training and equipment to the UPDF. In FY2011, DOD provided $4.4 million in counter-LRA-related training and equipment to the UPDF. Starting in October 2011, approximately 100 U.S. military advisors deployed to Uganda and LRA-affected areas to assist in counter-LRA operations. U.S. forces have also provided training to small teams of DRC and South Sudanese forces engaged in counter-LRA operations. The U.S. military deployed advisors to Uganda and LRA-affected areas for Operation Observant Compass (OOC) to assist in counter-LRA operations. In March 2014, U.S. military aircraft were deployed to provide air mobility support to partner forces, with a total of 280-300 personnel involved. The deployment of CV-22 Ospreys was in response to perceived UPDF capability gaps. The cost of Operation Observant Compass (OOC) totaled roughly $78 million in FY2013 and over $98 million in FY2014, with no FY2015 figure available yet. U.S. advisors deployed to Uganda and LRA-affected areas to assist in counter-LRA operations, including the deployment of CV-22 Ospreys to address UPDF capability gaps. Administration officials and Members of Congress have expressed support for the operation, with ongoing reviews to assess its effectiveness. U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) Commander General David Rodriguez has noted progress in weakening the LRA, calling the effort a \"good success story.\" In 2015, U.S. involvement in efforts to combat Joseph Kony's impact on civilian populations has significantly decreased. The United States has provided over $87.2 million in humanitarian assistance to LRA-affected populations in CAR, DRC, and South Sudan between 2010 and 2014. This aid includes support for food security, health programs, economic initiatives, and relief activities, and is closely coordinated with other donors such as the European Union and United Kingdom. The State Department and USAID have funded communication networks in LRA-affected areas to increase coordination and support early warning mechanisms. This includes high-frequency radios, cell phone towers, and community radio networks. The United States is also working with U.N. peacekeeping missions, the AU, and regional governments to facilitate the return, repatriation, and reintegration of those who desert the LRA's ranks. The State Department and USAID have funded communication networks in LRA-affected areas to increase coordination and support early warning mechanisms. Efforts to promote desertions by LRA combatants include leaflet drops, radio broadcasts, and establishing reporting sites for surrender. Desertions have been successful, with individuals choosing to bypass nearby towns to reach areas where U.S. troops are based. The U.S. has funded communication networks in LRA-affected areas to support early warning mechanisms and promote desertions by LRA combatants. Former abducted youth in CAR and DRC have been rehabilitated with U.S. funding. Targeted sanctions and financial incentives are part of U.S. policy towards the LRA, with Kony being on the \"Terrorist Exclusion List\" and \"Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons\" list. The U.S. offered a reward for information leading to the arrest of top LRA leaders, contributing to ending impunity and promoting justice. Odhiambo was reportedly killed in 2013, while Ongwen surrendered to U.S. forces in CAR in 2015 and was delivered to The Hague. The United States provided substantial humanitarian assistance to northern Uganda during the LRA's active years. Aid totaled over $436 million between 1997 and 2009, with a shift from relief to recovery starting in 2006. Development assistance in the north, totaling over $435 million between FY2009 and FY2011, continues as part of overall U.S. foreign aid efforts. Development assistance to northern Uganda continues as part of overall U.S. foreign aid efforts. U.S. military civil affairs teams have contributed to post-conflict recovery and development in the area. Congress has played a key role in U.S. policy towards the LRA, enacting legislation such as the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012, which allocated funds for programs addressing issues related to the Lord's Resistance Army. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 and the Department of State Rewards Program Update authorized funding and support for programs addressing issues related to the Lord's Resistance Army, including improving physical access, telecommunications infrastructure, early-warning mechanisms, and supporting the disarmament and reintegration of former LRA combatants. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 authorized monetary rewards for information leading to the arrest or conviction of foreign nationals accused of war crimes. It also expressed support for U.S. operations to combat the Lord's Resistance Army in Africa. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 allocated an additional $50 million for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance support to AFRICOM's Operation Observant Compass, aimed at combating the Lord's Resistance Army in Africa. The Secretary of Defense is authorized to provide logistic support, supplies, and intelligence support to foreign forces involved in the operation, with a requirement to report on specific goals and progress metrics before utilizing funds. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 allocated funds for programs in areas affected by the Lord's Resistance Army, including support for disarmament and reintegration of former combatants. It provided $10 million for counter-LRA programs and required a progress report on implementing the counter-LRA strategy. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (P.L. 113-291) expresses support for Operation Observant Compass in countering the Lord's Resistance Army. It emphasizes the need for continued assistance, including key enablers like mobility assets and intelligence support. The act also calls for integrating Operation Observant Compass into a comprehensive strategy for regional security and stability. Additionally, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235) appropriates funds for foreign assistance to support these objectives. Funds appropriated for foreign assistance in areas affected by the Lord's Resistance Army are to be used for various programs and activities, including improving physical access, telecommunications infrastructure, and supporting the disarmament and reintegration of former LRA combatants. Legislative resolutions condemning Joseph Kony and the LRA for crimes against humanity are pending, along with provisions addressing Department of Defense support for counter-LRA efforts. The Department of Defense is urged to provide details on the plan for transitioning or terminating the counter-LRA mission if Joseph Kony is removed or when the authority expires in September 2017. The AU-RTF's progress in combatting the LRA is noted, and the Department of Defense is encouraged to continue providing support to foreign forces in counter-LRA efforts. The Department of Defense is urged to continue supporting foreign forces in counter-LRA efforts. Funding is allocated for Operation Observant Compass in various appropriations bills, including $30 million in the FY2016 Department of Defense Appropriations Act and $10 million for counter-LRA programs in the FY2016 Department of State Appropriations Act. This includes support for improving infrastructure and the reintegration of former LRA combatants, especially child soldiers. The deployment of U.S. military personnel in support of regional counter-LRA efforts may raise questions about legal authorization. Congress is considering authorizing resources for LRA-related matters, including funding for operations and the commitment of military personnel, equipment, and intelligence assets. The relative importance of LRA-related policies compared to other strategic, humanitarian, and security goals is a key question for Members. The Administration's Strategy document does not define this importance. The Strategy document does not prioritize the LRA issue compared to other U.S. policy initiatives. Funding for LRA objectives has not been specified in the annual budget justification. Congress has authorized funds for some aspects of the U.S. response to the LRA, while others have been funded through reallocation of resources. U.S. military advisors are involved in regional counter-LRA efforts. The U.S. military advisors and assets have deployed in support of African counter-LRA operations amid discussions on global projection of U.S. force and foreign policy priorities. Members may seek strategic benchmarks and a timeframe for declaring a draw-down of efforts, judge achievement of benchmarks, prioritize U.S. response aspects, and weigh LRA-related activities against competing policy goals and resource constraints. Recent defense authorization measures require the Administration to report on strategic aspects of the U.S. military advisor deployment. Efforts to empower African security forces to respond to regional crises align with recent U.S. national security policy emphasis on strengthening security. The U.S. military is supporting African counter-LRA operations to strengthen partner countries' defense capabilities and promote regional security. Policymakers must balance LRA-related goals with other policy objectives in Uganda and the wider region, including conflict-resolution efforts in eastern DRC, CAR, and South Sudan. Tensions between Uganda, South Sudan, and Sudan could complicate counter-LRA efforts. Consideration should also be given to Ugandan forces' engagements in Somalia and the potential impact of increased U.S. military support for Uganda. The U.S. military is supporting African counter-LRA operations to strengthen partner countries' defense capabilities and promote regional security. Administration officials emphasize close coordination with other donors and partners to avoid duplicative efforts and encourage burden-sharing. Progress has been made in addressing the LRA's regional impact at the U.N. Security Council and African Union since 2011, but coordination levels may vary. Uganda is seen as a key partner for the U.S. in the region, with the UPDF playing a significant role in regional stability. The UPDF is a key force in regional stability, but past abuses and allegations of support for rebel groups complicate its role. Questions have been raised about its capacity to defeat the LRA due to competing priorities and reliance on U.S. military aid. Some analysts believe U.S. support has led Uganda to maintain an unsustainably large military. The UPDF is seen as essential for regional stability but is criticized for its role in defeating the LRA. Concerns have been raised about the UPDF's profiting from U.S. military assistance and involvement in resource smuggling. U.S. support to the UPDF may have unintended consequences for U.S. policy and the region, impacting diplomatic leverage on Uganda's democracy, governance, and human rights record. U.S. officials have expressed concerns about Uganda's governance and human rights record, particularly regarding restrictions on speech, press freedoms, and rights of assembly. The U.S. policy of supporting regional military operations relies on local partners' ability to end the LRA conflict, with coordination among the UPDF, host country forces, and civilian communities seen as crucial for success. Despite efforts to foster regional cooperation, African states have not fully met troop commitments to the AU Regional Task force, leading to coordination challenges in counter-LRA efforts. Factors such as competing priorities, lack of capacity, language barriers, and distrust among civilian communities and political leaders contribute to these difficulties. The inability of military operations to neutralize transnational armed groups, like the LRA, strains trust among regional leaders, with tensions between Congolese and Ugandan militaries also present. Tensions between Congolese and Ugandan militaries have led to restrictions on UPDF operations in DRC since 2011. Despite allegations of UPDF using LRA as an excuse to exploit resources, reported LRA attacks continue in northeastern DRC. DRC security forces, with U.S. support, have conducted counter-LRA operations in coordination with South Sudanese counterparts. Accusations highlight Congolese concerns over Uganda's regional role and history in DRC. The United States has provided training and assistance to DRC and South Sudanese militaries for counter-LRA operations, despite limited capacity and competing security priorities. President Obama waived parts of the Child Soldiers Protection Act to facilitate their participation. Policymakers may need options to address human rights abuses by partner militaries when receiving U.S. support. Some anti-LRA advocates suggest reallocating resources from military operations to recovery and development efforts in LRA-affected areas due to lack of funding for protection and development programs. Overseeing implementation in remote areas, like CAR, could pose challenges for U.S. development assistance. Some advocates are concerned about potential fading international support for programs in remote regions like CAR after military objectives are met. Key questions for U.S. policy include the ultimate end-game of regional military efforts, safeguards against human rights abuses, encouraging African states to fulfill troop commitments, and operational challenges in U.S. operations. The practical and operational challenges for U.S. military advisors in the area of operations are being questioned, along with the adequacy of U.S. policies and precautions. There is a concern about meeting intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) needs and whether counter-LRA efforts are diverting assets from other U.S. missions. The success of regional operations raises questions about future funding for humanitarian, recovery, and development assistance. Additionally, the potential of P.L. 111-172 and the LRA Strategy as a model for addressing other groups responsible for mass atrocities is being considered."
