It allowed for enhanced sentencing of federal sex offenders, mandated restitution to victims, and provided grants to law enforcement for investigating and prosecuting crimes against women. The report gives a history of VAWA, describes earlier reauthorizations, and discusses the 2013 reauthorization. It also mentions reauthorization activity in the 116th Congress and provides a five-year funding history from FY2015 to FY2019. The enactment of VAWA in 1994 was driven by concerns about rising violent crime rates, particularly violence against women. In the 1960s, the violent crime rate doubled, sparking public and government unease. Grassroots organizations in the 1970s emphasized the need for attitude changes towards violence against women. Researchers in the 1970s and 1980s focused on the issue, attributing declines in spousal assault to increased awareness among men and the criminal justice system. In 1984, Congress and President Reagan enacted the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA) to address family violence as a crime. This act aimed to prevent incidents of family violence and provide shelter and assistance to victims. In 1994, VAWA was included in the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, creating programs to help law enforcement combat violence. The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) was enacted in 1994 to address the insufficient response to violence against women by police and prosecutors. It has been reauthorized three times, with the most recent reauthorization in 2013. This reauthorization expanded programs under VAWA and enhanced measures to combat trafficking in persons. The reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act in 2013 included enhanced measures to combat trafficking in persons, expanded grant purpose areas to include sex trafficking, gave American Indian tribes authority to enforce tribal laws on domestic violence, established a nondiscrimination provision for grant programs, and addressed states' rape kit backlogs. VAWA, as originally enacted, impacted federal investigations and prosecutions of violence against women by establishing new offenses and penalties, requiring enforcement of protection orders across states, enhancing sentencing for repeat federal sex offenders, funding training programs for probation and parole officers, and mandating pretrial detention for defendants in federal sex offense cases. VAWA, as originally enacted, impacted federal investigations and prosecutions of violence against women by establishing new offenses and penalties, requiring enforcement of protection orders across states, enhancing sentencing for repeat federal sex offenders, funding training programs for probation and parole officers, and mandating pretrial detention for defendants in federal sex offense cases. The reauthorization of VAWA also included modifications to the Federal Rules of Evidence to restrict the admissibility of a victim's past sexual behavior in federal criminal and civil cases of sexual misconduct. Additionally, it mandated restitution for victims of specified federal sex offenses, established new provisions for civil remedies for victims of sexual assault, and allowed rape victims to demand HIV testing for their alleged assailants. Grant programs were created for various activities, including those aimed at preventing domestic violence. VAWA created and reauthorized grants for various programs aimed at preventing domestic violence and sexual assault, promoting collaboration among law enforcement and service providers, investigating and prosecuting domestic violence crimes, implementing arrest policies, and preventing crime in public transportation and parks. Grants were also provided for youth education, community intervention, the National Domestic Violence Hotline, and prevention programs. VAWA authorized grants for the National Domestic Violence Hotline, battered women's shelters, research and education for judges on gender bias, training programs for state and tribal judges on violence laws, data entry on stalking and domestic violence, expansion of grants for rape prevention education under the Public Health Service Act. VAWA of 1994 expanded grant funding for rape prevention education and addressed immigration issues faced by battered aliens, allowing for self-petitioning and suspension of deportation for abused foreign national spouses and their children. VAWA of 1994 expanded grant funding for rape prevention education and addressed immigration issues faced by battered aliens, allowing for self-petitioning and suspension of deportation for abused foreign national spouses and their children. The 1994 VAWA also included provisions for various activities such as ensuring confidentiality of domestic violence shelters' addresses, federal research on violence against women, and special studies on campus sexual assault and battered women's syndrome. The Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) was created in 1995 within the Department of Justice to administer grants authorized. The Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) was administratively created within the Department of Justice (DOJ) to administer grants authorized under VAWA. Since its creation through FY2018, OVW has awarded more than $8 billion in grants to address domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking. OVW administers the majority of VAWA-authorized grants, while other federal agencies also manage VAWA programs. These programs largely focus on the criminal justice system and community response to these crimes, with some addressing prevention as well. The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) legislation and programs primarily focused on women victims, but recent efforts aim to meet the needs of all victims. National data on domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking are available from various surveys and programs. The Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program by the FBI provides data on crimes reported to law enforcement, including domestic violence which is often labeled as family or intimate partner violence. Under VAWA, domestic violence includes felony or misdemeanor crimes committed by spouses, ex-spouses, boyfriends, girlfriends, and ex-partners, such as sexual assault, assault, and homicide. The rate of serious intimate partner violence victimization has significantly declined from 1993 to 2017, with a 70% decrease for females and an 87% decrease for males. The violence includes crimes committed by current or former spouses, intimate partners, or individuals cohabitating with the victim. The CDC estimates that 21.4% of women and 14.9% of men have experienced severe physical violence by an intimate partner in their lifetime. The violent crime rate, including homicide and intimate partner homicide, has declined since the early 1990s. Researchers attribute the decline in intimate partner homicide rates to factors such as the decrease in marriage rates among young adults. The decline in intimate partner homicide rates is attributed to factors such as decreased marriage rates. Homicide is mostly committed by males, with males making up 84% of offenders and victims. In 2017, 78% of intimate partner homicide victims were female. Approximately 55% of female homicides from 2003-2014 were related to intimate partner violence. Sexual assault encompasses various crimes and is defined as any nonconsensual sexual act. Sexual assault, termed as \"sexual abuse\" and \"aggravated sexual abuse\" under federal law, includes intimate partner violence. The FBI revised its definition of rape in 2012 to include any nonconsensual penetration of the vagina, anus, or oral cavity. This definition is more inclusive, covering both male and female victims or offenders, and those unable to consent due to mental or physical incapacity. The revised definition of rape includes nonconsensual sexual penetration and excludes statutory rape. In 2017, 135,755 forcible rapes were reported using the revised definition, with a rate of 41.7 per 100,000 people. The number of rapes increased by 19.4% from 2013-2017. Using the legacy definition, 99,856 forcible rapes were reported in 2017. According to the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), there were 393,980 sexual assaults in 2017, nearly triple the number of forcible rapes reported in the UCR. NCVS data show a decline in sexual assaults since 1993, with only 40% of rape/sexual assaults reported to police each year. In 2017, 40% of rape/sexual assaults were reported to the police, double the percentage from 2016. Dating violence under VAWA involves violence in romantic or intimate relationships, determined by factors like relationship length and frequency of interaction. Teenagers are often affected by dating violence, with 8.0% of high school students reporting being victims according to CDC's 2017 Youth Risk Behavior Survey. The prevalence of physical dating violence victimization among high school students has declined since 2013, with 8.0% reporting being victims in 2017. Female students had a higher rate (9.1%) compared to male students (6.5%). All 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories have stalking laws, with varying definitions. Federal law prohibits traveling across state lines or using mail/computer services to harm or intimidate others. Stalking is defined as a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to feel fear. Unwanted stalking behaviors include making unwanted phone calls, sending unsolicited letters or emails, following or spying on the victim, and posting information about the victim online. In 2006, an estimated 3.3 million individuals aged 18 and older were victims of stalking. In 2006, an estimated 3.3 million individuals aged 18 and older were victims of stalking, with more females than males being stalked. The CDC defines stalking as experiencing multiple tactics or a single tactic multiple times by the same perpetrator and feeling very fearful or believing harm could occur. Stalking tactics include unwanted communication, surveillance, and unwanted gifts. According to the CDC, stalking tactics include spying with listening devices, cameras, or GPS, showing up in unwanted places, leaving threatening items, sneaking into homes or cars, damaging property, and making threats of physical harm. In 2015, 16.0% of women and 5.8% of men have been stalked by an intimate partner in their lifetimes, with approximately 4.5 million women and 2.1 million men being victims of stalking in the 12 months preceding the survey. The fundamental goals of VAWA are to prevent violent crime and respond to the needs of crime victims. The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) aims to prevent violent crime, support crime victims, gather information about crime, and change public attitudes through collaboration among various organizations. The federal government primarily achieves these goals through grant programs administered by the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW), as well as other federal agencies like the Office of Justice Programs (OJP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Since 1995, OVW has awarded over $8 billion in grants to various entities. In FY2018 and FY2019, $553 million and $559 million were allocated for VAWA programs. In FY2018 and FY2019, $553 million and $559 million were appropriated for VAWA programs administered by OVW, OJP, and the CDC. The Administration has requested $492.5 million for OVW, $9.0 million for OJP, and $49.4 million for the Rape Prevention and Education Program at the CDC for FY2020. VAWA has been reauthorized three times since 1994. The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) has been reauthorized three times since 1994. The reauthorizations in 2000 and 2005 had broad bipartisan support, while the 2013 reauthorization faced greater opposition. The 2013 reauthorization included additional protections for battered nonimmigrants, new programs for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, and mandatory funds for rape prevention and education programs. VAWA 2000 expanded interstate stalking and domestic violence laws to include various scenarios involving travel and violence against spouses or intimate partners. The amendment also mandated funds for rape prevention and education programs. In 2005, VAWA was reauthorized through the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act (P.L. 109-162), adding protections for battered nonimmigrants, programs for American Indian victims, and public health initiatives. It emphasized collaboration among law enforcement, health professionals, and community initiatives to address domestic violence, enhanced penalties for repeat stalking offenders, and expanded the federal criminal definition of stalking to include cyberstalking. The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (VAWA 2013) expanded the federal criminal definition of stalking to include cyberstalking and added provisions for surveillance with harmful intent. VAWA 2013 reauthorized grant programs at a lower level and consolidated some programs while introducing new ones. The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 expanded grant programs by creating new programs like Grants to Support Families in the Justice System and Creating Hope Through Outreach for Children and Youth. These programs aim to improve responses to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, and child sexual abuse. The SMART Prevention program aims to enhance the safety of youth exposed to violence and prevent future violence by engaging men as leaders and role models. It consolidates programs to prevent domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking through awareness and education programs. The Grants to Strengthen the Healthcare System's Response to Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, and Stalking aims to improve training and education for health professionals in preventing and responding to violence. VAWA 2013 established new provisions for all VAWA grant programs to ensure victims are not denied services or discriminated against. The 2013 reauthorization of VAWA aimed to ensure victims are not denied services or discriminated against based on various factors. It also enhanced protection of victims' personally identifiable information and specified information sharing guidelines for grantees. Additionally, it added, modified, or expanded definitions of terms in VAWA, such as including \"intimate partners\" in the definition of domestic violence. The 2013 reauthorization of VAWA expanded services for culturally specific communities, added terms for population specific services and organizations, redefined underserved populations, and broadened the definition of cyberstalking. It also included a definition for rape crisis centers to provide assistance to victims of sexual assault without age discrimination. The 2013 reauthorization of VAWA expanded services for culturally specific communities, added terms for population specific services and organizations, redefined underserved populations, and broadened the definition of cyberstalking. It also included definitions for different age groups and rural states, imposed new accountability provisions, and required OVW to establish a biennial conferral process with state and tribal coalitions. VAWA 2013 strengthened audit requirements for sexual assault evidence backlogs and mandated that 75% of Debbie Smith grant amounts be used for DNA analyses. It also expanded the purpose areas of VAWA grants to address rape kit backlogs and set new funding requirements for the STOP program and Grants to Encourage Arrest Policies. VAWA 2013 allocated 25% of funds to programs addressing sexual assault, amended the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, and granted new provisions for American Indian tribes to exercise domestic violence jurisdiction. VAWA 2013 established a pilot program for tribes to have special criminal jurisdiction over domestic violence cases, with the Attorney General's approval. It also introduced a grant program to support tribes in exercising this jurisdiction and expanded grant purposes to include sex trafficking and enhancing responses to violent crimes against Indian women. VAWA 2013 expanded coverage for Indian women victims of domestic and sexual violence, including sex trafficking. It provided benefits for derivative children and exempted certain petitioners from being classified as inadmissible for permanent resident status. The definition of the U visa was broadened to include victims of stalking. New purpose areas were added to improve the criminal justice system response to immigrant victims of domestic violence. VAWA 2013 aimed to improve the criminal justice system response to immigrant victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking by expanding grant provisions and adding housing rights for victims. It also allocated funding for outreach to underserved populations and required demographic data on underserved populations within states. The VAWA 2013 included provisions to protect victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking in public housing. It allowed victims to be transferred to a safe unit of assisted housing and receive Section 8 assistance. The act also ensured that victims receiving transitional housing assistance are not subjected to prohibited activities for eligibility. VAWA 2013 made changes to eligibility criteria for transitional housing services, removing the requirement to be \"fleeing\" from a violent situation. It also included provisions for employment assistance. The act amended higher education policies, requiring institutions to report data on domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking in annual security reports. Newly reportable crime categories were added, including national origin and gender identity for hate crime reporting. The VAWA 2013 required institutions to have policies on preventing sexual assaults, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. It also mandated reporting of crime statistics based on prejudice categories and providing victim services and support options. VAWA 2013 mandated institutions to have policies for preventing sexual violence and required officials to receive training on conducting investigations to protect victims. It also amended rules for sexual acts in federal custodial facilities and mandated adoption of national standards for detention facilities. The Rape Survivor Child Custody Act, established under the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, increases grant funding for states allowing mothers of children conceived through rape to seek termination of parental rights of the rapist. Funding is provided for up to eight years, with 25% for STOP grants and 75% for SASP grants. The Rape Survivor Child Custody Act authorized $5 million annually for grant increases for FY2015 through FY2019. Congress may consider improvements to data collection, tribal jurisdiction over VAWA-related crimes, new law enforcement approaches for victims, and enforcing firearm prohibitions for domestic violence offenders. The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2019 (H.R. 1585) addresses these issues by reauthorizing funding and adding new programs. The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2019 aims to reauthorize funding for VAWA programs, amend federal criminal laws related to firearms, custodial rape, and stalking, and expand tribal jurisdiction over certain crimes on tribal lands. Congress is addressing limited law enforcement data on domestic violence and stalking, with plans to collect data through the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) by 2021. The FBI is transitioning its UCR program to NIBRS only data collection by 2021. Congress may consider expanding the NIBRS program sooner or adjusting the UCR program. Data on the sexual assault kit backlog is unavailable due to various reasons, including the lack of a national system for collecting data and antiquated tracking processes in many jurisdictions. The Joyful Heart Foundation has been addressing the issue of untested rape kits by attempting to count the backlog in various cities and states. They have identified approximately 41 jurisdictions with known rape kit backlogs totaling 40,000 untested kits. Congress may assess the backlog and consider changes to the federal response, as highlighted in H.R. 1585. Activities to improve data collection include establishing an interagency working group to study federal efforts on sexual violence data, funding for tribal governments to enhance data collection, and requiring a report on women in federal incarceration. VAWA 2013 granted American Indian tribes authority over domestic violence criminal jurisdiction and protection orders. As of March 2018, 18 tribes were exercising this authority. As of March 2018, 18 tribes have jurisdiction over domestic violence criminal cases involving non-tribal members. These tribes have made 143 arrests, resulting in 74 convictions and five acquittals, with 24 cases pending. The National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) has noted that tribes are following federal law and protecting defendants' rights. Congress may assess the implementation of this authority and could grant tribes jurisdiction over additional crimes like sexual assault and stalking. Many tribes have faced challenges in prosecuting non-tribal members. H.R. 1585 would expand tribal criminal jurisdiction to include domestic violence, obstruction of justice, assaulting a law enforcement officer, sex trafficking, sexual violence, and stalking. Researchers and practitioners are developing new approaches for working with victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking. Congress may consider these developments in criminal justice and public health. Congress may consider new approaches for addressing domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking, such as trauma-informed policing and response policies. This could involve requiring law enforcement grantees to incorporate trauma-informed training and policies, or creating new funding opportunities for these initiatives. Other emerging approaches include new protocols for police officers interacting with victims and \"red flag\" laws. OVW has supported initiatives related to trauma-informed approaches. H.R. 1585 authorizes a new program under OVW for trauma-informed training for law enforcement to prevent re-traumatization of crime victims and improve communication. The Gun Control Act prohibits certain individuals from possessing firearms. The Gun Control Act prohibits certain individuals from possessing firearms, including those convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors or under protective orders. Enforcement of these prohibitions varies among states and local jurisdictions, with no federal process for surrendering firearms by these individuals. VAWA 2005 established a provision requiring notification of firearms prohibitions to domestic violence offenders. H.R. 1585 aims to reduce firearms-related intimate partner violence by prohibiting those convicted of misdemeanor stalking from possessing firearms. H.R. 1585 aims to prohibit individuals convicted of misdemeanor stalking from possessing firearms and ammunition. Congress may consider additional changes to VAWA programs, such as adding new grant purposes or crimes like female genital mutilation. Congress may consider changes to VAWA programs, including making female genital mutilation a crime for services eligibility and streamlining grant funding. There is potential to support domestic violence courts and improve data collection for grant programs. The CDC-administered Rape Prevention and Education (RPE) formula grant program may have reporting requirements under H.R. 1585. The bill aims to define FGM/C for VAWA grant purposes, expand purpose areas of VAWA grant programs, and classify FGM/C as a part II crime in the UCR. It also includes provisions for culturally specific victim services and reporting on activities funded by grants for rape prevention and education. H.R. 1585 would make various changes related to VAWA grant definitions, housing protections for victims, and new grant programs. It would reauthorize funding for most VAWA programs for FY2020-FY2024. Tables provide descriptions of funded VAWA programs, unfunded programs, and funding history."
