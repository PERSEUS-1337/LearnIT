    "content": "This report compares recommendations of the President's Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors (PCCWW) and the Veterans' Disability Benefits Commission (VDBC) related to injured servicemembers transitioning to civilian life or veteran status. It focuses on issues with continuity and quality of care and services provided by the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 addresses issues related to the care and treatment of injured servicemembers and veterans. It focuses on efficient maintenance and transfer of health records between departments and separate disability evaluations. These actions are in response to recommendations from various commissions and task forces. The PCCWW and VDBC recommendations led to initial congressional and administrative responses. The PCCWW, established in 2007, focused on services for injured servicemembers from OEF/OIF. It examined services from DOD, VA, and the private sector, including health care, disability, education, and employment benefits. The PCCWW studied experiences of servicemembers transitioning to civilian life and recommended benefits for seriously injured OEF/OIF veterans. Implementing these recommendations may conflict with existing policies on compensating disabilities and prioritizing VA healthcare for veterans. The VDBC was established to study benefits for veterans and their survivors. The VDBC was established to study benefits for veterans and their survivors, regardless of when or how a disability or death occurred. It focused on a comprehensive assessment of veterans' benefits, making broader recommendations compared to the PCCWW. The VDBC made 113 recommendations to improve benefits for veterans and their families, including implementing recovery plans for injured servicemembers, restructuring disability systems, improving care for PTSD and TBI, supporting families, transferring patient information, and supporting WRAMC until its closure. Recommendations covered disability evaluation, eligibility, level of benefits, survivors, claims administration, transition, and establishing an oversight group. The attached Table 1 compares selected action steps from the PCCWW and recommendations from the VDBC related to the transition of injured servicemembers from military service to civilian life or veteran status. The table is organized according to the PCCWW's six broad recommendations and notes the entity to whom the recommendation is directed. The commissions had distinct charges and areas of emphasis, so a direct comparison of their recommendations is not possible. The commissions largely agreed on the proposed end point for a revised disability compensation system, with DOD evaluating fitness for duty and VA evaluating disability compensation. However, they differed in their priorities for implementation, focusing on different populations. PCCWW recommendations apply initially to OEF/OIF servicemembers, while VDBC recommendations apply to all servicemembers or veterans eligible for the service or benefit discussed. The CRS Reports discuss various DOD and VA programs and benefits related to disability evaluation, military medical care, military support for the severely disabled, military pay and benefits, military retirement, veterans' benefits, veterans' health care issues, and basic eligibility for disability benefits. The curr_chunk provides a list of CRS Reports related to veterans' benefits, disability programs, federal employment assistance, pension programs, and military personnel policy issues. The curr_chunk lists CRS Reports on Walter Reed Army Medical Center realignment under BRAC 2005 and options for Congress."
