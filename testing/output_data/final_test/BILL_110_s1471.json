    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Improved Medical Decision Incentive Act of 2007\". Congress finds that the US spends the most on healthcare per capita but has mediocre health outcomes, including high infant mortality. Best practices improve healthcare delivery and patient outcomes. Current payment systems do not prioritize quality care or best practices. Adherence to best practices can enhance healthcare quality and reduce costs. Administrative proceedings with knowledgeable professionals will improve healthcare best practices. Control of medical practices through denial of claims by insurance companies has proven wasteful and confusing, failing to motivate adequate development and use of best practices for health care. SEC. 3. VOLUNTARY STATE DEVELOPMENT AND APPROVAL OF QUALIFYING BEST PRACTICES; INCENTIVES FOR PRIVATE INSURERS. State health departments can approve best practices as the standard of care for a specific condition to qualify for differential payment rates and private insurance incentives. The approval process includes meeting certain criteria set by the State health department. State health departments can approve best practices for specific conditions, allowing medical societies or specialty groups to submit treatment courses. This process includes hearings and is applicable to health insurers and representatives of Medicare and Medicaid programs. State health departments can approve best practices for specific conditions, allowing medical societies or specialty groups to submit treatment courses. This process includes hearings and involves the intervention of Medicare and Medicaid program representatives. The State health department may approve a treatment course if it lowers costs and improves care quality. State health departments prioritize approving best practices that reduce costs and enhance care quality for specific conditions. Approved best practices serve as the basis for different payment rates under Social Security sections 1898 and 1902(dd). Under sections 1898 and 1902(dd) of the Social Security Act, states can approve best practices that impact payment rates for health insurers. Private insurers must pay provider charges promptly for services aligned with approved best practices. The term \"State\" includes regional or local areas as determined by the State health department. Health insurers must pay provider charges promptly for services aligned with approved best practices, regardless of internal review procedures. Providers can take legal action to enforce payment in federal court if insurers challenge or delay payment for services provided in accordance with approved best practices. The court may award costs and attorney's fees to a provider or specialty group in a civil action if it finds that a challenge or delay in payment was a willful violation of the Act. Implementation of differential rates of payment for qualifying best practices under the Medicare program is addressed in Title XVIII of the Social Security Act. The Secretary will establish differential rates of payment for items and services under the Medicare program based on qualifying best practices approved by a State. Regulations for this will be in place by March 31, 2008, ensuring budget neutrality. The Secretary may establish differential rates of payment for items and services under the Medicare program based on national best practices, ensuring budget neutrality. The Secretary may establish differential rates of payment for items and services under the Medicare program based on national best practices, ensuring budget neutrality. Qualifying best practices approved by the State health department will be applicable within the State, forming the basis for differential payment rates. National best practices will only apply within the State if approved by the Secretary after a hearing that meets procedural requirements. The amendment made by this section shall apply to items and services furnished on or after March 31, 2008. SEC. 5. Implementation of differential rates of payment for qualifying best practices under the Medicaid program. The State Plan Amendment to the Social Security Act allows for differential rates of payment for medical assistance under the Medicaid program, favoring treatment consistent with qualifying best practices approved by the State health department. The Improved Medical Decision Incentive Act of 2007 allows for differential rates of payment for medical assistance under the Medicaid program, ensuring that payments do not exceed what the State would have paid without differential rates. The Secretary is authorized to establish these rates for qualifying best practices. The Secretary is required to establish procedures for differential rates of payment for medical assistance under the Medicaid program, based on qualifying best practices approved by the State. Regulations must be promulgated by March 31, 2008, to implement this provision while ensuring budget neutrality to prevent increased expenditures under the State plan. The Secretary must establish procedures for differential rates of payment for medical assistance under the Medicaid program, based on qualifying best practices approved by the State. National best practices adopted by the Secretary must be applicable within a State as a qualifying factor. The Secretary must establish procedures for differential rates of payment for medical assistance under the Medicaid program, based on qualifying best practices approved by the State. These best practices must be applicable within a State and serve as the basis for payment rate differentiation in the State plan, with amendments effective from March 31, 2008. The State plan is not considered non-compliant with Medicaid requirements solely for not meeting additional requirements before the first day of the first calendar quarter after the State legislature's regular session following the enactment of the Act. Each year of a 2-year legislative session is treated as a separate regular session. SEC. 6. Oversight by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The Secretary conducts an annual review of qualifying best practices to assess their effectiveness in improving outcomes and reducing care costs under Medicare and Medicaid programs.
