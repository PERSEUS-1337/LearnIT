The House and Senate passed H.J.Res. 59 for continuing appropriations in FY2014, but failed to resolve differences before the fiscal year began on October 1, 2013. This led to a funding gap and limited Congressional action on appropriations until October 15. The partial government shutdown in October 2013 began due to the Antideficiency Act, restricting legislative branch activities to those necessary to protect life and property. The Senate passed H.R. 2775 on October 16, 2013, providing interim continuing appropriations for the previous fiscal year's projects and activities. The House agreed to the Senate amendment to H.R. 2775 on October 17, 2013, terminating the funding gap that same day.
