    "content": "Managing stormwater in cities is a major and costly issue in the United States. It involves addressing both water quantity and pollution problems. Stormwater can carry contaminants and pollutants into waterways, either directly or through the sewer system. Cities must find ways to prevent stormwater from entering sewers to avoid overflows and remediate any existing issues. Many communities are exploring green infrastructure to manage stormwater, using natural processes to reduce flows to sewers. Rainwater is absorbed into the ground or flows as runoff into rivers. Success stories exist, but feasibility, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness are concerns. Urbanized areas with impervious surfaces like pavement and rooftops generate significant runoff, with only about 15% infiltrating into the ground for groundwater recharge. This increased runoff carries pollutants harmful to aquatic life and public health into streams, rivers, and lakes. Stormwater runoff carries pollutants like sediment, oil, grease, toxic chemicals, road salts, pesticides, nutrients, bacteria, pathogens, and heavy metals into water bodies. Two main types of sewer systems in the US are combined sewers and sanitary sewers, with combined sewers found mostly in the upper Midwest, mid-Atlantic states, and New England. During wet weather events, the volume of wastewater and stormwater in combined sewers can exceed capacity. The volume of wastewater and stormwater in combined sewers often exceeds capacity, leading to untreated overflow discharge into surface waters or city streets. These overflows pose health risks near drinking water sources and are subject to Clean Water Act permit requirements. Sanitary sewer systems are more commonly used in the US. Sanitary sewer systems convey wastewater to treatment works, separate from stormwater runoff. They are prevalent in the eastern US and West Coast. Overflows can occur due to blockages or defects, leading to system overload. MS4s collect runoff in urban areas and must comply with CWA permit requirements. Operators must implement stormwater best management practices. Green infrastructure, also known as Low Impact Development (LID), is gaining attention as a cost-effective alternative to traditional gray infrastructure for stormwater management. EPA estimates a funding need of $106 billion over the next 20 years for stormwater projects. Green infrastructure utilizes natural landscape features to capture and treat rainwater where it falls, reducing the reliance on expensive engineered structures like pipes and storage tanks. Green infrastructure, defined by the EPA as using natural hydrologic features for water management, includes green roofs, rain gardens, and permeable pavements. It aims to reduce stormwater entering sewers, extend the lifespan of gray infrastructure, save money, and create green jobs. Green infrastructure complements conventional infrastructure by minimizing runoff volume and peak discharges, controlling flood flows, and reducing costs associated with stormwater management. The use of green infrastructure practices is cost-effective in managing urban stormwater problems compared to gray infrastructure. Green infrastructure practices are cost-competitive with conventional stormwater controls, offering equivalent hydrological management at lower costs. Green infrastructure is estimated to be 5%-30% less costly to construct and 25% less costly over its life cycle than traditional infrastructure. Benefits include reducing energy costs and protecting local economies by reducing pollutant loadings. Green infrastructure practices offer various non-water benefits such as improved air quality, reduced atmospheric carbon dioxide, and lowered air temperature. They also help in reducing the heat island effect in urban areas. Additionally, green infrastructure is believed to enhance urban aesthetics, increase property values, and provide wildlife habitat and recreational space for urban residents. When considering green infrastructure options, decisionmakers face obstacles and challenges related to skepticism about the benefits, uncertainty about returns, lack of information on performance and cost-effectiveness, and doubts about water quality improvements. Technical obstacles include unsuitable soil conditions, steep slopes, and limited space for green infrastructure implementation. Stormwater management with green infrastructure is complex due to local factors like soil, climate, and lack of technical knowledge. Engineers are hesitant to invest in green infrastructure due to a lack of performance data. Despite growing literature, there is still a need for more information on the effectiveness of these systems over time. From a design standpoint, systems must function without excessive maintenance to prevent abandonment. A central repository of best practices and design standards could aid local developers and engineers. Barriers include legal and regulatory issues such as local ordinances and codes favoring gray infrastructure over green. Barriers to implementing green infrastructure include technical and legal challenges related to maintenance on private properties, state-level water and land-use policies, federal guidelines and funding limitations, and financial constraints at the local level. Stormwater fees are difficult to develop and enforce as a revenue source for green infrastructure projects. Many communities face challenges in funding and implementing green infrastructure projects due to financial constraints. Lack of funding for design and testing, along with perceptions of high costs, hinder investment in projects with longer paybacks. There is a need for better understanding of the costs and benefits of green infrastructure compared to traditional approaches. Green infrastructure faces challenges due to insufficient economic analysis, uncertainties in long-term maintenance costs, and community and institutional barriers such as public perception and lack of public acceptance. Transitioning to green infrastructure requires enhanced public outreach and inter-governmental cooperation. Transitioning to green infrastructure faces challenges in funding and financing, with various federal programs available but no dedicated funding source. For example, FEMA offers flood mitigation assistance grants, while the Federal Highway Administration has a congestion mitigation program. The Administration administers a program for congestion mitigation and air quality improvement, incorporating green infrastructure components. Federal financial assistance for water infrastructure projects is authorized by the CWA and SDWA, providing grants for State Revolving Fund loan programs. SRF programs are managed by EPA at the federal level, with project decisions made by individual states. SRF assistance covers capital costs, including green infrastructure like tree plantings and green roofs. Federal SRF capitalization grants are dependent on congressional appropriations, which have been flat or declining in recent years. Municipalities have found it difficult to secure SRF loans for projects with green infrastructure components. Dedicated funds for green infrastructure have been provided through the SRF programs, originating in the 2009 economic recovery act. Congress has directed a portion of SRF grants to go towards green infrastructure projects since FY2010. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Utilities Service provides grant and loan assistance for wastewater and drinking water projects in rural communities. Funds may be used for green infrastructure projects, but there is no required set-aside. Local ratepayers fund most wastewater treatment needs, while municipal bonds are commonly used for water infrastructure financing. Municipal bonds are the primary tool for water infrastructure financing, with at least 70% of U.S. water utilities relying on them. In 2011, bonds issued for water projects totaled $29.6 billion, with stormwater utilities increasingly charging fees for funding. These fees are controversial and can be based on property size or impervious surface area. In many locations, stormwater fees are controversial and have faced legal challenges over whether they are a reasonable charge or a tax. Other funding sources for stormwater projects include special assessments, development fees, impact fees, and permit and inspection fees. Municipalities offer incentives to encourage green infrastructure practices for both existing and planned developments. Incentives such as fee discounts, credits, and subsidies are used to encourage developers and homeowners to implement green infrastructure practices. These incentives aim to reduce stormwater runoff and promote cost savings for private businesses and homeowners. Examples of incentive mechanisms include fee reductions for decreasing impervious cover and adding green infrastructure practices. Cities like Portland, Seattle, Columbus, and Chesapeake offer fee reductions to support on-site green infrastructure. Municipalities can provide incentives to developers such as waiving permit fees, expediting the process, allowing higher density development, or exemptions from stormwater permitting requirements. Examples include Chicago's Green Permit Program and Portland's Floor Area Ratio Bonus for green roof additions. Knox County, Tennessee offers credits for disconnecting impervious areas. Knox County, Tennessee, offers credits to developers for disconnecting impervious areas from the stormwater control system. Some municipalities provide rebates or financing for specific green infrastructure practices, such as rain barrels and rain gardens. Examples include Santa Monica, CA, Palo Alto, CA, Rock Island, IL, Chicago, and Minneapolis. Community award programs can encourage local participation in green infrastructure projects. EPA's support for green infrastructure projects grew in the 2000s, with successful examples in U.S. cities leading to increased endorsement. In 2007, EPA signed a memorandum of understanding with state water quality regulators, wastewater utilities, and environmental groups. The EPA collaborated with a group representing publicly owned wastewater utilities and environmental groups to promote green technology approaches. In 2013, the agency released a Green Infrastructure Strategic Agenda, focusing on federal coordination, regulatory support, research, funding, and capacity building. Green infrastructure is a priority for the administration, with grants awarded to communities for stormwater management projects. In 2012, EPA announced a $4 million grant to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation for a Green Infrastructure Showcase Project in the Chesapeake Bay region. EPA supports research on green infrastructure practices in urban areas and stormwater management. Other federal agencies have programs to assist green infrastructure projects, but EPA is the most focused on this area. The Office of Community Planning and Development administers programs supporting community initiatives, including green infrastructure projects. The U.S. Department of Energy promotes green infrastructure for energy efficiency. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service focuses on urban sustainability, including green infrastructure. The White House has shown interest and support for green infrastructure, hosting a conference in 2012 and announcing support in 2013. In 2013, the White House announced support for green infrastructure to create jobs, build strong future for U.S. cities, and aid municipalities in investing in sustainable infrastructure. Administration officials promoted green infrastructure for resilience in changing climatic conditions and discussed financing water infrastructure improvements. EPA intended to apply a rule for urban stormwater management in communities with municipal separate storm sewer systems. The EPA intended to apply a rule for urban stormwater management in communities with municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s) to prevent harmful pollutants from entering MS4 systems. The rule was in response to recommendations for changes in stormwater control programs and a settlement agreement to expand regulated stormwater discharges. Despite efforts to develop a regulatory proposal, the EPA abandoned the \"post-construction rule\" in 2014. The EPA proposed a rule for urban stormwater management in communities with MS4s, aiming to set a retention performance standard and offer compliance options like green infrastructure. This rule would be integrated into MS4 permits upon renewal, with support from environmental advocates and some government representatives. Developers, however, criticized the EPA's approach. The EPA proposed a national rule for stormwater management, considering standards for new construction to retain stormwater runoff. Some groups criticized the EPA's efforts, citing concerns about state and local regulation of land use. EPA examined existing state performance standards as models for the national rule, with precedent in legislation enacted in 2007. The Independence and Security Act (EISA, P.L. 110-140) mandates federal agencies to implement strict stormwater runoff requirements for development projects involving federal facilities to reduce pollutant loadings to water resources. EPA issued technical guidance in 2009, offering two options for meeting the performance objective of preserving or restoring site hydrology. Under a 2010 settlement with environmentalists, EPA was supposed to propose a national rule by September 2011 and complete it by 2014. However, deadlines were renegotiated multiple times, leading to a legal impasse in June 2013 when EPA missed a proposed regulation deadline. Challenges faced by EPA in developing the post-construction rule included determining percentiles, treating greenfield and redevelopment differently, and expanding regulations. After nearly four years of work, EPA announced in mid-March 2014 that it would defer action on the national post-construction rule. Instead, the agency would provide incentives, technical assistance, and other approaches for cities to address stormwater runoff themselves, leveraging existing requirements to strengthen municipal stormwater permits and promote green infrastructure. EPA discontinued developing a national stormwater rule but continues to promote on-site retention of stormwater and green infrastructure in individual MS4 permits. States are encouraged to strengthen stormwater management through CWA permits, with examples in Washington DC and Massachusetts. EPA delegates permitting authority to states in most cases. In recent years, there has been a push for states to enhance MS4 permits with green infrastructure measures, supported by legislation and oversight hearings. EPA appropriations acts have directed funds towards projects focusing on green infrastructure, water efficiency, and other environmentally innovative activities. The Innovative Stormwater Infrastructure Act of 2015 aims to promote research and implementation of green stormwater infrastructure. The legislation aims to establish centers for excellence for research on green stormwater infrastructure and provide grants for development. It also directs the EPA to promote green infrastructure in its offices and programs, establish measurable goals, and increase water management using innovative techniques. Similar bills have been introduced in previous Congresses, and there is ongoing discussion on federal funding for water infrastructure projects. The 113th Congress enacted amendments to the Clean Water Act for water infrastructure projects, allowing use of State Revolving Fund monies for stormwater management. Concerns were raised about the focus on green infrastructure's cost, feasibility, and environmental benefits. Environmental advocates have recommended actions that Congress could take to encourage and support green infrastructure, including legislation to assist demonstration projects, improve knowledge about performance and cost-effectiveness, and require federally funded roads to control runoff pollution. They also support legislation for federal assistance for water and wastewater infrastructure. Environmental advocates and stakeholders have supported federal legislation for water and wastewater infrastructure investment, including funding for State Revolving Funds for green infrastructure projects. Stakeholder groups favor federal policies and programs that come with associated costs, such as grants for infrastructure assistance and research on green infrastructure practices. Securing funds for existing and new programs in the current budgetary context is a challenge. Some are hesitant about investing in green infrastructure, citing uncertainty over its effectiveness and associated costs. Advocates argue that without funding for green infrastructure, the economic and water quality impacts of stormwater will be more costly. The appendix includes images of green infrastructure practices and a bibliography on the topic.
