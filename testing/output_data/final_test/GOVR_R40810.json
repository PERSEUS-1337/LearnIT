    "content": "The Stafford Act (P.L. 93-288) is the main federal law for responding to disasters and emergencies declared by the President. It authorizes preparedness, response, and recovery efforts, including infrastructure repair, temporary housing, and mitigation projects. The Act allows the President to utilize resources from other federal departments to assist states in disaster response and recovery. It establishes a partnership between federal and state governments to address the severe impacts of disasters on communities and individuals. The Stafford Act authorizes recovery programs for individuals and families affected by disasters, including Individual Assistance, Public Assistance, and Hazard Mitigation Assistance. Assistance for emergency sheltering falls under the Public Assistance program, while temporary housing assistance is part of the Individual Assistance program. Federal disaster housing assistance, including through Stafford Act Section 408, is primarily focused on home repairs and financial aid for rental units. Direct assistance like trailers and mobile homes is rare and considered a last resort. The challenges faced during Hurricane Katrina led to a reevaluation of FEMA's housing assistance programs. This report reviews FEMA's traditional approach for temporary housing following a disaster, exploring alternatives being developed. It questions the effectiveness and equity of FEMA's current hierarchy of help for disaster victims and discusses new housing-related authorities granted post-Katrina. The 111th Congress is urged to consider approaches to improve disaster housing for future events, as federal assistance often comes late in the cycle of aid. Federal assistance for disaster victims may not be immediate, even after a Presidential declaration. In cases where no declaration is made, housing responsibility falls on the state and local community, often provided by organizations like the American Red Cross. Victims may move from emergency to temporary shelters while awaiting more permanent housing help from FEMA. Federal disaster assistance for housing is based on a partnership between the federal government and the state, with input from local and state officials. FEMA's housing approaches consider practical and theoretical factors to safely house displaced residents near their original residences and places of employment, providing necessary support such as food assistance, transportation help, and security arrangements. FEMA provides housing assistance to displaced residents to help them resume their lives while waiting for their homes to be repaired. The President determines the type of assistance based on cost effectiveness and other factors, but FEMA offers options to applicants to tailor the housing solution to their needs. Federal help is meant to complement state efforts, recognizing that states can also be affected by disasters. Federal assistance is crucial in disaster recovery efforts, as states may be limited in their response capacity. FEMA emphasizes the partnership with local and state governments in providing temporary housing assistance. Accountability of funds and appropriate program stewardship are key considerations in providing practical help to families and individuals. Disaster housing assistance is best managed at the local level, with support from states and regional organizations when needed. States may face limitations in their ability to assist in housing victims of major disasters. Cooperation among multiple states is necessary for sheltering and providing temporary housing. States vary in their capacity and commitment to disaster recovery work, influenced by factors such as size, resources, government structure, and allocation of authorities. Myriad authorities exist at the state level for working with the federal government and using state resources for disaster response. States vary in their capacity and commitment to disaster recovery work, influenced by factors such as size, resources, government structure, and allocation of authorities. Governors are authorized to accept federal funds and resources for disaster response, which can impact a state's ability to partner effectively with FEMA for providing housing assistance after a disaster. Lack of state assistance, poor preparedness efforts, inadequate authority for action, and lack of cooperation from local officials can hinder post-disaster housing development. The federal government, specifically FEMA, may be better suited to lead post-disaster housing efforts due to its experience, relationships with states, and ability to assess state capacity. States may struggle to respond effectively to multiple disasters in a year. FEMA has shown collaboration abilities post-Hurricane Katrina. FEMA has demonstrated collaboration with HUD for disaster housing missions. Sheltering and housing are carried out under different authorities. Immediate sheltering is typically done by state and local governments or NGOs, eligible for federal reimbursement. FEMA provides emergency shelter assistance under the Stafford Act's Section 403, which includes large emergency shelters, rental assistance, and other supporting services. They work in partnership with the American Red Cross to organize sheltering information and have developed a national shelter system for responding to initial emergency shelter requirements. The National Shelter System (NSS) tracks shelter locations and capacities, containing data for over 55,000 potential shelter buildings nationwide. It records shelter openings, closings, and populations daily, used for planning and operational decisions. Special needs shelters may be available for those with medical or special needs, including service animals or pets. The NSS is free for FEMA and all states, also utilized by 12 national non-government partners. Immediate federal help for sheltering under Section 403 covers 75% of costs, with state and local resources covering the rest. This short-term sheltering does not require an eligibility test before providing shelter. Local organizations also use hotel rooms for temporary shelter, allowing time for more suitable housing arrangements. The Federal Assistance to Individuals and Households Program (IHP) provides up to 18 months of temporary housing assistance for disaster victims, which is reimbursable by FEMA if declared a major disaster. Registration is required to determine eligibility based on disaster-related housing needs. The Stafford Act provides financial assistance for disaster-related housing needs of individuals and households displaced from their primary residences. FEMA records the address of the residence and dispatches a housing inspector to verify damage and assess habitability. Financial assistance is the most common form of aid available to homeowners and renters who have lost their primary residence. Financial assistance provided to disaster victims, including homeowners and renters who have lost their primary residence, is based on the average fair-market rent in the area. Victims use this assistance to rent temporary housing while their homes are repaired and they pursue employment. FEMA and HUD have taken steps to help victims find suitable housing close to their original homes, schools, and workplaces. HUD has an online housing locator system for this purpose. The housing locator is an online tool that helps HUD, state, and public housing authorities find rental housing for emergencies. FEMA has a Housing Portal to assist individuals and families displaced by disasters in finding available rental units. In some cases, there may be a shortage of affordable rental properties for disaster victims. The Stafford Act authorizes direct assistance for disaster victims' housing needs, providing temporary housing units directly to individuals or households. After Hurricane Katrina, FEMA's provision of temporary housing raised concerns about formaldehyde levels in some units. FEMA noted the lack of established indoor air health levels for formaldehyde in housing. FEMA has adopted more stringent standards for formaldehyde levels in temporary housing units, requiring levels to be less than 0.016 parts per million. Manufacturers must certify compliance, and FEMA will implement a testing program to confirm levels meet the new standard. This change was prompted by concerns raised after Hurricane Katrina about formaldehyde levels in temporary housing units. Direct assistance for disaster housing is seen as a last resort when rental housing is unavailable or home repairs are not feasible. FEMA incurs high costs for direct assistance, including purchasing trailers, transport, installation, maintenance, deactivation, refurbishing, and contractual expenses. The total cost for direct assistance from 1998 to 2008, excluding outliers like Katrina and Rita, was around $1.1 billion. Temporary housing units can be sited in various ways by FEMA. FEMA provides temporary housing units in various ways, including smaller trailers for homeowners to use while repairing their homes. Units can be parked in driveways or yards. Mobile homes and travel trailers can also be placed in existing commercial mobile home parks with infrastructure. If necessary, FEMA may establish temporary group sites with utilities and security. FEMA defines \"Wrap-Around Services\" as a variety of human and social support provided at temporary housing community sites during disasters, including healthcare, schools, security, social services, maintenance, public transportation, and employment counseling. Discussions between FEMA, state and local partners, and NGOs have focused on the level of support for these services at group sites of varying sizes. During the Katrina recovery, FEMA focused on public safety issues, limiting community services. The disposition of mobile homes and trailers purchased after the 2005 hurricane season remains unresolved, with some units unusable due to wear and tear or indoor air quality issues. Congress is working on legislation to address the issue. FEMA is taking steps to reduce its inventory of excess temporary housing units, which will save approximately $133 million annually. Congress is working on legislation to require FEMA to determine its stock needs and develop criteria for usable units. FEMA will also develop a plan to store necessary units and dispose of unnecessary ones within specified timeframes. FEMA is selling excess manufactured housing units to current residents to reduce inventory. About 1,150 families live in units classified as mobile homes and park models, offered for sale at $5 and $1 respectively. An additional 600 to 700 units will be donated. Refunds will be offered to previous buyers. Local zoning ordinances may pose challenges for siting units. Many local jurisdictions are hesitant to change zoning ordinances to allow small manufactured homes. Concerns arise from FEMA selling trailers for salvage, with uncertainty about their potential use for housing. A congressional study on inventory issues brings up past debates on retaining temporary housing units. FEMA previously refurbished and reused mobile homes and trailers, storing thousands at various sites. In 1995, a recommendation was made to close these sites and end FEMA's direct involvement in owning, storing, and refurbishing mobile homes. FEMA was recommended to eliminate permanent storage sites for mobile homes and travel trailers due to difficulties in maintaining and reusing units. The agency now acquires units for disasters on an as-needed basis. The policy of acquiring units for disasters on an as-needed basis led to rapid purchases for those displaced by the 2005 hurricanes. FEMA provides repair assistance in addition to temporary housing, with no cap on repair assistance under the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act. Repair funds are separate from any SBA disaster loan funds. Repair assistance is a key form of disaster housing aid, with spending on repairs exceeding all other forms of assistance in the last 10 years. The average cost for emergency home repairs ranged from $1,565 to $9,912 per home, with an overall average of $4,245 per home. The amount of aid for repairs is based on FEMA's housing inspection. Housing assistance under Section 408 is based on FEMA's inspection to determine damage and necessary work. It includes aid for private access routes and hazard mitigation measures. Replacement assistance is available for disaster victims whose homes are destroyed, with funds for purchasing a new residence. Originally capped at $10,000, this aid is beneficial for mobile home owners without adequate insurance coverage. Section 408 of the Stafford Act authorizes FEMA to provide financial or direct assistance for permanent housing construction, with replacement grants now capped at $25,000. FEMA does not count direct assistance costs towards an individual's IHP cap, as it is considered a physical resource. This form of aid was traditionally limited to insular areas outside the continental United States and remote locations until 2006. FEMA has the authority to provide financial or direct assistance for permanent housing construction in insular areas and remote locations where alternative resources are unavailable. This authority has been sparingly used in places like Guam and Puerto Rico, where FEMA provided funds for homeowners to build disaster-resistant homes after Hurricane Hugo. The rationale behind this assistance was to minimize recurring federal disaster costs by investing in more permanent solutions. Since PKEMRA was enacted, FEMA has only initiated one significant program for constructing permanent residences in American Samoa after a major disaster in 2009. The DHS IG expressed concerns about the pilot program, citing a lack of staff with home construction expertise and high costs associated with operations on remote islands. The PKEMRA amendment allows for the construction of \"semi-permanent\" housing, broadening FEMA's options for temporary housing. This flexibility is crucial in disaster-affected areas where traditional housing may not be feasible. The PKEMRA Act allows FEMA to provide safe and secure housing for disaster survivors in a timely and cost-effective manner. It also includes provisions for leasing private apartment units and making necessary repairs to meet federal housing standards, potentially increasing the inventory of available rental units in a disaster area. The Individuals and Households Pilot Program discusses the increase in available rental units in a disaster area. Other Needs Assistance (ONA) under the IHP program aims to provide flexible assistance for basic needs like medical expenses, funeral costs, transportation, and replacement of damaged personal property. This includes furniture, clothing, and appliances to help restore habitability after a disaster. The Other Needs Assistance (ONA) program is a cost-shared partnership between states and the federal government to help restore habitability after a disaster. States pay 25% of the costs while the federal government covers the remaining 75%. States work with FEMA to determine eligibility and costs for replacement items, and can choose to administer the program themselves. For example, in 2004, Florida was directly involved in key aspects of the program despite not administering it. The ONA program, implemented in 2003, has provided $1.5 billion in assistance for families and individuals after disasters. Florida, for Hurricane Frances, had FEMA administer the program while retaining influence over eligible items, pricing for repairs, and award levels. Technical agreements for ONA costs are determined through state administrative plans or cooperative agreements before a disaster event. The ONA program, implemented in 2003, has provided $1.5 billion in assistance for families and individuals after disasters. The predecessor for ONA, the Individual and Family Grant (IFG) program, expended approximately $1.3 billion between 1998 and 2003, bringing the total for this form of cost-shared assistance to aid families and individuals to about $2.8 billion. Excluding Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, total costs for housing and assistance to families and individuals over the decade totals approximately $8 billion. The National Disaster Housing Strategy was requested from FEMA in the PKEMRA and delivered to Congress in January 2009. Analysts and some policy makers attached great expectations to the strategy, perhaps heightened by its delay. The strategy states the challenge and broader issues that surface as housing emerges within the post-disaster environment. The Disaster Housing Strategy section of PKEMRA mandated a detailed description of disaster housing resources available at all levels of government. It provides an overview of past practices and various options that have been employed, highlighting best practices. The Disaster Housing Strategy section of PKEMRA outlines past practices and various options employed in disaster housing. It emphasizes collaboration between federal, state, and local governments, as well as non-governmental and private sector efforts. The strategy highlights best practices and innovative approaches to address housing issues for disaster victims. The Disaster Housing Strategy aims to enhance cooperation and efficiency in disaster operations by establishing professional standards and operational principles. It emphasizes managing expectations for assistance delivery to affected families and governments, aligning with the partnership message of the Obama Administration. The report, released at the end of the Bush administration, does not make commitments for new leadership and defers some topics for action by a proposed task force. The Senate ad hoc subcommittee report criticized FEMA for not developing a catastrophic disaster housing response plan, despite improvements in the final Strategy released in 2009. The new Administration was left without essential operational housing plans, as FEMA deferred key planning components to a proposed Task Force. FEMA has disregarded its own advice on housing response planning, despite recognizing the need for a plan and admitting its programs are inadequate for catastrophic events. The strategy report on temporary housing post-disaster has raised concerns among emergency management practitioners, state managers, and members of congress. W. Craig Fugate criticized FEMA's housing plan as insufficient, stating that surviving the disaster and then dealing with FEMA's housing plan may be too much to ask. The Administrator now has the opportunity to shape the strategy and its implementation. The National Disaster Housing Strategy introduces a vision for addressing disaster housing needs, emphasizing expanded state and local involvement in response to large events. However, there is a call for a more comprehensive federal commitment in light of recent catastrophic events. Congress may need to address fundamental housing questions with the new leadership at FEMA. The National Disaster Housing Strategy explores alternatives to FEMA as the primary provider of long-term housing, including states assuming housing responsibility, HUD coordinating the housing function, FEMA using permanent housing options, and FEMA providing lump sum payouts for disaster victims to find longer-term housing. The National Disaster Housing Strategy focuses on state roles and partnerships with FEMA, guided by federal housing resources and expertise. Congress will assess the strategy as FEMA provides more details for its application. The implementation plan for FEMA's National Disaster Housing Joint Task Force is being developed to improve post-disaster housing. Congress has supported new approaches like the Alternative Housing Pilot Program (AHPP) to provide disaster housing alternatives. A FEMA-HUD relationship is also being explored for new ways to assist displaced individuals. The collaboration between FEMA and HUD has led to innovative housing programs after hurricanes like Katrina and Rita. Congress authorized FEMA to test the Alternative Housing Pilot Program in Gulf Coast states, allowing for experimentation in different housing approaches. The collaboration between FEMA and HUD resulted in innovative housing programs after hurricanes like Katrina and Rita. FEMA's funding formula for housing projects faced criticism for not awarding proportional amounts based on hurricane damage. Mississippi received up to $281.3 million, Louisiana up to $74.5 million, Texas up to $16.5 million, and Alabama up to $15.7 million for various projects. The projects offered a range of alternatives, including temporary and permanent structures. The AHPP projects offer a variety of housing alternatives, including temporary and permanent structures with steel framing, expandable options, and units that can be quickly assembled or stored. State grantees must prioritize 2005 hurricane victims for these homes and have the option to sell, transfer, or lease the units. Evaluation of the program is conducted by FEMA's Joint Housing Solutions Group in partnership with HUD, focusing on the relationship between pilot programs and the hosting community. The potential for cottages to become a permanent housing solution post-2005 Gulf Coast disasters is being explored, with local officials cautiously optimistic. Local officials are hesitant to approve cottages as permanent housing solutions due to concerns about property values. Some jurisdictions have tried to force cottages into mobile home parks or out of city limits, but after legal action, most are now allowing residents to stay in their cottages with restrictions. The evaluation group for cottages is considering factors like durability, cost, indoor air quality, and energy efficiency. The pilot program's implementation period is from April 2007 to January 2010. Final evaluations by HUD and FEMA are due to Congress by December 31, 2011. FEMA will assess the units' future use compared to current direct assistance, while HUD is conducting research to evaluate the success of the units and their impact on recovery. Congress may review these models for additional support, and FEMA may recommend increased use of prototypes post-disaster. Since the passage of PKEMRA in October 2006, FEMA has conducted a limited pilot program in Iowa and Texas to repair and subsidize rental housing for disaster victims. The Iowa project involved rehabilitating seven apartment units, while the Texas project involved a 32-unit apartment complex. FEMA compared the cost of housing families in mobile homes to the costs of each project, with the Iowa project estimated at $76,854. The estimated cost for the Iowa project is $76,854, while the estimated cost for the Texas pilot project is $897,358. The total estimated savings to the federal government for providing manufactured homes is $363,522 for Iowa and $1,753,266 for Texas. Congress may consider encouraging more pilot applications of this authority or working with the Administration to include it in permanent legislation. FEMA has shown a growing partnership with HUD in large disaster events. The Disaster Housing Assistance Program (DHAP) is a federal housing assistance grant program implemented by HUD and FEMA to provide temporary rent subsidies for families displaced by Hurricane Katrina. Administered by Public Housing Agencies, the program is expected to be completed by August 2009, lasting more than four years. DHAP demonstrates a growing partnership between FEMA and HUD in large disaster events. The DHAP program, lasting over four years, is an extended housing assistance initiative beyond the usual 18-month period under the Stafford Act. The agreement between FEMA and HUD for DHAP was announced 20 months after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. DHAP has evolved into FEMA's primary alternative for large housing programs, as seen with the DHAP-Ike program announced shortly after Hurricane Ike. The DHAP-Ike program was created in response to the extensive damage in the Galveston area after Hurricane Ike. It is a rental program with case management, providing extended housing assistance beyond FEMA's traditional short-term response. FEMA is solely responsible for determining eligibility for assistance under DHAP-Ike, fostering a working relationship with HUD for a more comprehensive disaster housing approach. The Senate ad hoc subcommittee report noted questions about the partnership between FEMA and HUD in disaster housing. While FEMA called for HUD to play a greater role, concerns were raised about the lack of tools and funding for HUD to assume this responsibility. Despite uncertainties, both agencies are exploring a potential partnership, with advocates suggesting that HUD is best suited for running temporary housing voucher programs post-disaster. However, doubts remain about expanding HUD's role without increased funding and expertise. HUD does not directly run housing programs but contracts with public housing authorities, local governments, and nonprofits. The quality of administration varies widely. A complementary approach between FEMA and HUD could be beneficial, with FEMA providing initial assistance and HUD assuming rental assistance work during a transitional period. This collaboration could prevent lapses in assistance and address special needs populations and disaster housing challenges. HUD could partner with local organizations for housing assistance and case management services during a transitional period. FEMA's case management authority under PKEMRA could be utilized, and coordination with HUD could help transition households receiving direct FEMA assistance. Congress should explore the FEMA-HUD relationship further. Further exploration of the FEMA-HUD relationship in disaster recovery, potential legislative adjustments for proper authority and funding, and consideration of the KDHAP-SN program for post-disaster housing assistance. Clarification of state and local roles, managing expectations, and addressing special needs in the Stafford Act's IHP program. The Stafford Act's IHP program limits assistance to those displaced from their homes due to a disaster, excluding homeless individuals. The KDHAP-SN program is the first to address housing needs for special needs persons after a disaster, recognizing the challenges faced by individuals with disabilities during such events. The PKEMRA Act established the Disabilities Coordinator within FEMA to address the special needs of individuals with disabilities during disaster events. Congress may need to review the Coordinator's work and its impact on FEMA's policies. Disaster housing has been focused on short-term missions, leading to limited resources for longer-term housing needs. The media often focus on dramatic events that are easy to cover, such as crime and political events, while ignoring more complex and slowly developing issues. FEMA's disaster housing work, which involves planning and execution with state and local governments, is an example of a diffuse issue that doesn't always receive extended media coverage. Some observers note that FEMA has focused on mitigating disaster damage and improving logistics, but not on disaster housing. The lack of state and local cost-share for housing projects may contribute to the lack of engagement from states. Some observers suggest that the housing mission lacks investment and state involvement, leading to limited resources and innovative administration of disaster housing assistance. A federal-state partnership similar to ONA could improve program decisions and implementation. Since the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act (PKEMRA), new authorities have brought a renewed focus on disaster housing issues. Technological advances at the National Processing Service Centers have improved response times and fraud prevention. Privately contracted housing inspection services have also increased speed and coverage in disaster areas. However, housing options have remained largely unchanged for three decades, with home repair assistance being a common solution. New legislative authorities and potential options from pilot projects may offer improvements in the future. The Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act (PKEMRA) authorized new authorities for FEMA, including case management, transportation cost coverage for evacuees, and flexibility in housing programs. These additions expanded FEMA's capabilities, but it is unclear if they were fully utilized before PKEMRA's passage. Until then, FEMA faced constraints within the Stafford Act on disaster housing beyond basic repairs. PKEMRA, FEMA faced constraints within the Stafford Act on disaster housing beyond basic repairs. Options for improving FEMA housing include an IA pilot program for restoring rental units and the \"Katrina cottages\" program for creating new temporary housing. Another suggestion is providing victims with a one-time cash settlement based on historical costs of transitional housing. This approach could empower victims to make their own choices for their future. However, it is essential to consider the diverse needs of the population being served, as this option may not be suitable for everyone. Congress provided FEMA with case management authority to address the disparate needs of disaster victims. The DHS IG notes that a one-time cash settlement for housing assistance would require careful pre-screening to avoid fraud. FEMA's \"2009 Disaster Housing Plan\" includes transitional sheltering assistance and revised criteria for travel trailers. The \"2009 Disaster Housing Plan\" includes criteria for travel trailers and critical needs assistance, acknowledging past problems and demonstrating changes for future challenges. It emphasizes the need for state-led housing task forces to define disaster housing policy. Voucher programs like those from HUD offer flexibility for post-disaster assistance. The Alternative Housing Pilot Program (AHPP) along the Gulf Coast offers new options for disaster housing, but evaluation results may not be available to Congress for over five years. Congress may consider an accelerated evaluation timeline for additional housing options. In the near future, FEMA's work with HUD and Public Housing Authorities in disaster areas may also benefit smaller non-catastrophic events. Housing is a critical post-disaster need that will receive increased attention for safety, quality, and location during the recovery period."
