    "content": "Article II Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution, as modified by the 12th Amendment, outlines the indirect election of the President and Vice President by presidential electors. These electors, collectively known as the electoral college, are elected by qualified voters in all states. Candidates must secure a majority of electoral votes to win. The electoral college system has been a longstanding institution, delivering a majority of electoral votes in 53 out of 54 presidential contests since 1804. The electoral college system, established by the Constitution's framers, has been criticized as undemocratic and archaic. Despite this, it has elected the popular vote winner in 49 out of 54 elections since 1804. Congress considered reform for nearly 30 years between the late 1940s and 1979. College reform was considered by Congress for nearly 30 years between the late 1940s and 1979, but advocates were unable to achieve the two-thirds vote required for a constitutional amendment. The question of reforming electoral college provisions gradually disappeared from the congressional agenda by the early 21st century. However, in 2016, a President and Vice President were elected with a majority of electoral votes but fewer popular votes, highlighting the system's requirement for electoral vote majority to win the presidency. The electoral college system, original to the Constitution, has faced criticism and calls for reform. In 2016, the discrepancy between electoral and popular votes reignited interest in direct popular election. Several proposals for reform have been introduced in Congress, aiming to replace the electoral college with a popular vote system. The Constitution allows states discretion in electoral college elements, with many features determined by federal and state laws and party actions. The electoral college system is governed by federal and state laws and party actions. A majority of 270 electors is needed to elect the President and Vice President. Electors are chosen by voters in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, nominated by political parties. The electors cast their votes in December, five weeks after the general election. Maine and Nebraska award electors based on congressional district and statewide popular vote winners. Critics of the electoral college have proposed reforms due to its undemocratic nature, as it can result in candidates winning the electoral college but losing the popular vote. If no candidate receives a majority of electoral votes, a contingent election is held with the House of Representatives electing the President and the Senate electing the Vice President. Critics of the electoral college advocate for reforms to address issues such as the \"wrong winner\" scenario where a candidate wins the electoral college but loses the popular vote. They also highlight concerns about under- and over-representation of states in electoral votes, the potential for \"faithless\" electors, winner-take-all systems disenfranchising voters, biases favoring certain states and groups, and the perceived advantage of the electoral college \"lock\" for political parties. Public opinion has historically supported reform of the electoral college system. Gallup polls show a shift in support post-2016 election, with Republicans favoring the electoral college and Democrats supporting direct popular election. Various reform options have been proposed to address perceived flaws. Various reform options have been proposed for the electoral college system, including eliminating the office of presidential elector to prevent faithless electors. Three principal reform options include the automatic plan, district system, and proportional system. The most popular proposal since the late 20th century has been to eliminate the electoral college system altogether. The most popular proposal since the late 20th century has been to eliminate the electoral college system entirely and replace it with direct popular election of the President and Vice President, with either a plurality or majority of the popular vote necessary to win. Supporters of the electoral college system argue that it is a key component of American federalism, ensuring a federal election of the President where votes are tallied in each state. They also defend the allocation of electors among the states as a way to uphold federalism. Supporters of the electoral college system reject claims of advantage for certain groups or parties, arguing that it promotes moderate political parties. They dismiss concerns about faithless electors influencing elections, noting that most reform plans would eliminate this possibility. Additionally, they argue that the system magnifies the winning candidate's legitimacy and brings closure to the election process. The electoral college system has been a topic of controversy since the first presidential elections. Reform proposals were introduced as early as 1797 to address issues with electors casting undifferentiated votes. The 12th Amendment, ratified in 1804, required distinct ballots for President and Vice President. Numerous reform proposals have been introduced in Congress, with at least 752 proposals through the 115th Congress. During the mid-20th century, Congress actively considered electoral college reform proposals, with various approaches such as direct popular election or reforming controversial provisions. The question of reform or replacement was prominent, with the idea of keeping electoral votes but eliminating the system also being considered. During the mid-20th century, Congress actively considered electoral college reform proposals, including the automatic plan, district plan, and proportional plan. Proposed amendments were discussed in Senate and House Judiciary Committees multiple times between 1948 and 1979. College reform proposals were debated in Congress multiple times between 1948 and the early 21st century. Despite being approved by the necessary majority in the Senate and House at different times, no consensus was reached on revising electoral college provisions. The number of proposed amendments to reform or abolish the electoral college declined over the years, with no proposals introduced in recent Congresses. Since the late 20th century, there has been a decline in proposed amendments to reform or abolish the electoral college. No electoral college reform proposal has been acted upon since 1979, with a resurgence in proposals for direct popular election of the President and Vice President in the 114th and 115th Congresses. These proposals aim to establish direct popular election without significant changes to the Constitution or with additional federal authority provided by Congress. The 114th Congress introduced amendments to enhance federal authority over election-related issues, including direct popular election of the President and Vice President. Introduced by Representative Gene Green, the resolution aimed to establish direct popular election without significant constitutional changes. The 114th Congress introduced amendments for the direct popular election of the President and Vice President, allowing for electors with less restrictive qualifications. Congress could establish uniform residence and age requirements, with a plurality requirement for election. Joint candidacies were required, voters cast a single vote, and provisions were made for candidate death or tie votes. The effective date for the amendment was set for one year after ratification. H.J.Res. 102, a presidential election reform measure, proposed direct popular election and congressional authority over election processes. It included provisions for establishing uniform age and residence qualifications, potentially allowing for a lower voting age than 18. The proposed legislation, H.J.Res. 102, seeks to establish uniform age and residence qualifications for elections, potentially allowing for a lower voting age than 18. This could extend federal authority over a traditionally state-administered process. Additionally, the resolution includes a seven-year ratification deadline for constitutional amendments, which can be extended by congressional action. The proposed H.J.Res. 103, introduced by Rep. Charles Rangel in 2016, aimed to allow direct election of the President and Vice President, expand voting rights, and give Congress authority over certain aspects of the election process. It proposed joint tickets for President and Vice President, extended voting rights to territories, and defined \"electors\" as those qualified to vote for the legislature. Congress would have the power to determine election details and ballot inclusion. H.J.Res. 103 proposed eliminating the electoral college system and implementing direct popular election of the President and Vice President. It also aimed to extend voting rights to qualified electors in U.S. territories. No further action was taken after it was referred to the Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice. The resolution aimed to expand the presidential electorate by authorizing voting for presidential electors in the District of Columbia and proposed additional authority to regulate presidential elections. It also extended Congress's authority over ballot inclusion and election result ascertainment. H.J.Res. 103 and H.J.Res. 104 proposed changes to the presidential election process, including the elimination of the electoral college system and the implementation of direct popular election of the President and Vice President. These resolutions aimed to extend Congress's authority over ballot inclusion and election result ascertainment. The preamble of the resolution argued for replacing the electoral college system with direct popular election, citing the evolution of democratic government, constitutional amendments guaranteeing universal suffrage, advancements in information technology, Thomas Jefferson's belief in adapting institutions to changing times, and the growth of voting rights in the United States. Notably, the resolution did not set a ratification deadline, making it eligible for ratification indefinitely. The resolution proposed direct popular election, set qualifications for electors, allowed joint candidacies for President and Vice President, established a plurality requirement for popular vote winners, and authorized Congress to determine election logistics. H.J.Res. 104 proposed amendments for presidential elections, including direct popular election, joint tickets, and congressional authority over voter qualifications. It did not include a seven-year ratification deadline, allowing for indefinite ratification after proposal. The 27th Amendment, proposed in 1789 without a ratification deadline, was ratified in 1992. Senator Barbara Boxer introduced a resolution in 2016 for direct popular election of a joint ticket for President and Vice President. The resolution defined electors and authorized Congress to determine election procedures. No further action was taken after it was referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. S.J.Res. 41, introduced in 2016, proposed direct popular election of a joint ticket for President and Vice President, expanding voting rights in U.S. territories and giving Congress authority over election procedures. No further action was taken after referral to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary.

H.J.Res. 65 follows traditional amendment procedures by establishing a seven-year ratification window in its preamble, making it possible for Congress to extend the deadline. The issue of electoral college reform has been largely absent from the congressional agenda but has seen action in states and the non-governmental sector in recent years. In recent years, several states have considered electoral college reform, including the district system in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Virginia. Colorado voters rejected a proportional system, while Nebraska debated returning to a winner-take-all method. The National Popular Vote initiative proposes direct election of the President and Vice President through an interstate compact. These initiatives are analyzed in CRS reports. The Popular Vote Initiative proposes the direct election of the President and Vice President through an interstate compact. Recent trends show a shift towards embracing direct popular election over the electoral college. There is a lack of interest in reform proposals for the electoral college, possibly indicating a decline in support or a lack of urgency among its defenders. Advocates of the electoral college may defend the current system if direct election gains momentum in Congress. Some reform proposals include enhancing federal authority in areas traditionally managed by states. Since the 1970s, reform proposals have included provisions for broad national election standards, potentially superseding current state practices for presidential elections. This expanded federal role raises several potential issues. The potential issues raised by expanded federal involvement in presidential elections include unfunded mandates on state and local governments, possible transfer of election-administration functions to the federal government, and the need for federal funding to meet increased expenses. The potential issues of federal assumption of presidential election management include concerns about costs, federal intrusion in state and local responsibilities, and the efficiency of a nationwide election administration system. Supporters argue that a national election administration structure is suitable for national elections. The electoral college system has endured since 1789 despite numerous reform proposals and two recent elections where the President won with fewer popular votes. The durability of the electoral college is attributed to Article V of the Constitution, which makes it difficult to amend. The Constitution intentionally makes it difficult to revise, requiring super-majority votes in Congress and states for amendments. Congress also influences the process by choosing ratification method. Successful amendments often result from transformative events. The successful proposal and ratification of constitutional amendments often result from a combination of factors, including term limits for Presidents, public awareness, advocacy from senior Members of Congress, and national consensus on the need for reform. The 25th Amendment, governing presidential succession, is an example where these factors played a role. The 12th Amendment was a response to the turmoil of the 1800 presidential election, leading to a constitutional crisis. While public opinion favored direct popular election, there is no national consensus or urgency for electoral college reform. Successful amendments require support and effort from congressional leaders. Successful constitutional amendments have historically relied on support and effort from congressional leaders, such as the 25th and 26th Amendments which had the backing of key figures. Factors like demonstrated need, urgency, public awareness, and congressional involvement have been crucial for amendment success. These factors would also be necessary for advancing electoral college reform in the 115th Congress.
