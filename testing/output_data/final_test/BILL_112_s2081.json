    "content": "The \"Extended Unemployment Benefits Reform Act of 2012\" emphasizes the value of work and public service, stating that involvement in public service after initial unemployment benefits eligibility will not hinder the individual's ability to work or search for employment. The \"Extended Unemployment Benefits Reform Act of 2012\" requires individuals to perform 20 hours of public service and engage in 20 hours of active job searching to receive extended compensation. The \"Extended Unemployment Benefits Reform Act of 2012\" mandates individuals to complete 20 hours of public service for organizations or agencies described in section 501(c)(3) to qualify for extended compensation. Tangible evidence of service must be provided weekly to the State agency. Individuals can satisfy the weekly public service requirement by providing tangible evidence of inability to perform due to illness, family emergency, child care responsibilities, lack of transportation, telephone, or internet services. The weekly public service requirement can be reduced by performing work activities. The minimum public service requirement remains in place. For the purposes of reducing the total public service hours required, work activities can decrease it by up to 15 hours per week. The definition of work activities excludes job searching. Active job searching is necessary for subsection (a)(19)(B). The term 'active job searching' refers to an ongoing search for employment with evidence provided weekly to the State agency, including contact information for potential employers. The State agency may reduce job search hours for individuals meeting certain requirements for at least 12 weeks. The amendments made by this section shall take effect on July 1, 2012, unless a State requires legislation to meet the new requirements. In such cases, the State law will not be considered non-compliant solely for not meeting the additional requirements immediately. The calendar quarter begins after the 1st regular session of the State legislature following the enactment of this Act. For a State with a 2-year legislative session, each year is considered a separate regular session."
