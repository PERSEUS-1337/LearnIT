    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 245.5 of the Labor Code is amended to exclude certain employees from the definition of \"employee\" under a valid collective bargaining agreement. This agreement must include provisions for wages, hours of work, working conditions, paid sick days, paid leave, paid time off, final and binding arbitration for disputes, premium wage rates for overtime, and a regular hourly rate of pay of at least 30% more than the state minimum wage rate. An employee in the construction industry covered by a valid collective bargaining agreement must have wages, hours of work, and working conditions specified in the agreement. The agreement should also include premium wage rates for overtime and a regular hourly pay of at least 30% more than the state minimum wage rate. The agreement must have been entered into before January 1, 2015, or expressly waive the requirements of this article in clear terms. Employees covered by specific sections of the Welfare and Institutions Code or the federal Railway Labor Act are eligible for compensated time off. An employee of a public entity receiving a retirement allowance can be employed without reinstatement into their retirement system. The definition of an employer includes the state and municipalities. A family member is defined as a child, regardless of age or dependency status. An employee in California working for the same employer for 30 or more days within a year is entitled to paid sick days. Family members eligible for paid sick days include parents, spouses, registered domestic partners, grandparents, grandchildren, and siblings. Paid sick days are compensated at the same wage as regular work hours. An employee in California accrues paid sick days at a rate of one hour per every 30 hours worked, starting at the beginning of employment. Exempt employees are deemed to work 40 hours per week for sick day accrual, unless their normal workweek is less than 40 hours. An employer in California can use a different accrual method for paid sick leave as long as the employee has at least 24 hours accrued by the 120th day of employment or each calendar year. Employees can start using accrued paid sick days on the 90th day of employment. Accrued paid sick days can carry over to the following year, but an employer can limit use to 24 hours or three days per year. If the full amount of leave is given at the start of the year, no carry over is required. Employers with a paid leave policy satisfying accrual, carry over, and use requirements are not obligated to provide additional paid sick days. Provided paid sick leave or paid time off before January 1, 2015, with accrual method different than one hour per 30 hours worked. Accrual must ensure at least one day or eight hours accrued within three months of employment each year. If accrual method is modified, comply with new method or provide full amount of leave at the beginning of each year. The employer can increase the accrual amount or rate for a class of employees covered by this subdivision each year, calendar year, or 12-month period. Sick leave and annual leave benefits provided by specific Government Code sections or a memorandum of understanding meet the requirements. Employers are generally not required to compensate employees for unused sick days upon termination. If an employee is rehired by the same employer within one year of separation, previously accrued and unused paid sick days will be reinstated for use. Additional paid sick days can be accrued upon rehiring, subject to limitations. Employers are not obligated to reinstate paid time off that was paid out upon termination. Employers have the option to lend paid sick days to employees in advance of accrual with proper documentation. An employer must provide written notice to employees regarding the amount of paid sick leave available or paid time off in lieu of sick leave. If unlimited leave is provided, it can be indicated as \"unlimited\" on the notice. Penalties for non-compliance apply to employers covered by Wage Order 11 or 12 starting January 21, 2016. An employer is not required to allow an employee to accrue more than 48 hours or 6 days of paid sick leave. Employees can decide how much sick leave to use, with a minimum increment set by the employer. Paid sick leave for nonexempt employees is calculated based on the regular rate of pay for the workweek. Paid sick time for nonexempt employees is calculated based on total wages divided by total hours worked in the prior 90 days. For exempt employees, sick time is calculated like other paid leave. Employees must give advance notice for foreseeable sick leave and payment must be provided no later than the next regular payday. Labor Code Section 247.5 is amended. Section 247.5 of the Labor Code is amended to require employers to keep records of hours worked and sick days accrued by employees for at least three years. Employers must allow access to these records by the Labor Commissioner and provide them to employees upon request. Employers are not required to inquire about the purposes of paid leave or time off used by employees. The provisions of this measure are severable, meaning that if any part is deemed invalid, it will not affect the rest. This act is an urgency statute necessary for public peace, health, or safety, specifically to clarify provisions of the Labor Code for the implementation of the Healthy Workplaces, Healthy Families Act of 2014."
