    "content": "The Act titled \"21st Century Firearm Technology and Safety Act of 1998\" is referred to as the short title. The Congress finds that the National Institute of Justice Science and Technology program has played a critical role in improving law enforcement technology, developing standards for soft body armor, and assisting in the development of personalized firearms for safety. The focus should continue on improving technology to assist law enforcement in reducing crime and enhancing firearm safety. Grants are provided to improve gun safety. Grants will be provided by the Director of the National Institute of Justice to enhance firearms safety technology, weapons detection technology, and other related technology to reduce firearms violence. The grants will be awarded over a 3-year period with a limit of $20,000,000 for each fiscal year from 1998 to 2002. Additionally, an independent panel on firearms safety will be established. The Independent Panel on Firearms Safety is established in the Department of Justice to research technology for weapons safety improvements and oversee the Technical Study Group on Firearms Safety. The Panel will report to Congress on the findings of the Technical Study Group within 90 days. The Independent Panel on Firearms Safety, established in the Department of Justice, will forward recommendations on firearm safety locks to the National Institute of Justice. The Panel will submit annual reports to Congress detailing findings and recommendations for firearms safety improvements. Membership on the Panel includes individuals from the National Institute of Justice. The Independent Panel on Firearms Safety includes representatives from various organizations and experts in relevant areas. Panel members serve for the life of the Panel and without pay. Federal employees on the Panel cannot receive additional compensation. The Independent Panel on Firearms Safety members do not receive additional pay, allowances, or benefits for their service.

The Panel is exempt from the termination rule in the Federal Advisory Committee Act. SEC. 5. TECHNICAL STUDY GROUP ON FIREARMS SAFETY. Established in the Department of Justice, the Technical Study Group on Firearms Safety is tasked with studying improvements in firearms safety technology to reduce deaths and injuries from unintended discharges. The group's initial research focuses on the reliability of firearm safety locks. The Technical Study Group on Firearms Safety is studying the reliability of firearm safety locks to prevent unintended discharges. Within 9 months of organization, they will submit a report to the Independent Panel on Firearms Safety with findings and recommendations for standards. The group is appointed by the Director of the National Institute of Justice. The Technical Study Group on Firearms Safety is investigating the effectiveness of firearm safety locks in preventing accidental discharges. Experts from NIST, BATF, and CPSC with technical or scientific knowledge are appointed to the group by their respective directors. The Technical Study Group on Firearms Safety includes experts appointed by HHS, DOJ, and Independent Panel with technical or scientific expertise in law enforcement, firearms manufacturing, and weapons detection. The Technical Study Group on Firearms Safety, with experts in law enforcement, firearms manufacturing, and weapons detection, may designate team leaders and preserve confidentiality of information provided. The Technical Study Group on Firearms Safety must adhere to certain subsections of section 4, similar to the Independent Panel on Firearms Safety."
