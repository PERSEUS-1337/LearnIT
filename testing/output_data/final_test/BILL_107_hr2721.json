    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Arsenic-Treated Wood Mandatory Labeling Act\" and includes findings related to the subject. Inorganic arsenic compounds like chromated copper arsenate (CCA) are used as wood preservatives. The Environmental Protection Agency states that inorganic arsenic is a human poison, exposure to it can be fatal, and even low levels of exposure can cause nausea, vomiting, decreased blood cell production, abnormal heart rhythm, and blood vessel damage. The Department of Health and Human Services has classified arsenic as a known carcinogen, and breathing inorganic arsenic increases the risk of lung cancer. To protect against health risks, chromated copper arsenate (CCA) is classified as a restricted use chemical, requiring certified applicators to purchase and use it. Individuals using arsenic to treat wood must wear protective clothing and a respirator if the level of arsenic in the air is unknown. Producers of pressure-treated wood must provide consumer information sheets to retailers, including instructions on handling the products safely to prevent exposure to arsenic. A consumer warning label should be attached to each piece of arsenic-treated wood to alert buyers of potential hazards. SEC. 282 of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 requires labeling of arsenic-treated wood with a consumer warning label. SEC. 282 of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 mandates labeling of arsenic-treated wood with consumer warning statements about health risks and proper handling.

The Administrator and Secretary must submit a report to Congress within 60 days on the ongoing review of arsenic health risks, including interim guidelines for arsenic-treated wood use. The Administrator and Secretary must submit a report to Congress within 30 days on the results of the review of arsenic health risks and recommendations for guidelines on the use of arsenic-treated wood in public and recreational facilities."
