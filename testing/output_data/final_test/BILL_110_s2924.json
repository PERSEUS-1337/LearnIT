    "content": "The Act is named the \"Original Saint-Gaudens Double Eagle Ultra-High Relief Bullion Coin Act\". It includes findings related to the Act. The Congress finds that the Augustus Saint-Gaudens $20 gold pieces of 1907 with ultra-high relief are considered the most beautiful coins ever produced. Two separate \"pattern\" versions of the ultra-high relief Double Eagle were made in 1907, with a 34-millimeter version hand-struck resulting in low mintage, and a 27-millimeter version deemed illegal to produce. The 27-millimeter pattern pieces of the ultra-high relief Double Eagles are considered among the most beautiful coins ever produced. None are in private hands, and none have ever been sold. The introduction of this famous piece as a numismatic proof coin would give collectors a chance to own a legendary coin that has never been available before. The modern coin version of the $20 gold piece, a legendary coin never before available for private ownership, would feature updated design elements to prevent counterfeiting. Palladium, a rare precious metal, is part of the platinum group metals with unique characteristics. Palladium, part of the platinum group metals, is the least dense with the lowest melting point. Major mining nations include Russia, South Africa, USA, and Canada. It is used in various applications like industrial catalysts, automotive catalytic converters, dentistry, jewelry, and surgical instruments. Demand for precious metals is driven by practical use and as a store of value, with various investment options available. Palladium investors have various investment options including coins, bars, and exchange-traded funds. Several countries have issued palladium coins for investment purposes, with Canada being the only country minting palladium bullion coins currently. The price of palladium ranged between $148 and $404 per troy ounce from 2003 to 2007, with an average price of $355 per troy ounce in 2007. Platinum bullion coins have become too expensive for the average investor due to high metal prices. The Royal Canadian Mint stopped production of platinum bullion coins in 2001 because of high prices and declining sales. The American Eagle Platinum Bullion Coin launched in 1997 when the average price for platinum was $395 per troy ounce. Demand for platinum coins has dramatically declined over the past decade, with sales dropping from 80,050 ounces in 1997 to 9,050 ounces in 2007. SEC. 3.
