    "content": "This report provides an overview of the FY2019 budget request and appropriations for the International Trade Administration (ITA), the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC), and the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR). The three trade-related agencies are funded through the annual Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) appropriations. The FY2018 funding levels were provided in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, with $482.0 million for ITA, $93.7 million for USITC, and $72.6 million for USTR. The FY2019 appropriations for the three CJS trade-related agencies totaled $647.0 million, a 0.2% decrease from FY2018. The President's FY2019 budget request included a total of $590.8 million for ITA, USITC, and USTR, representing an 8.9% decrease from the previous year's funding. The FY2019 budget proposed reduced funding for ITA, USITC, and USTR trade agencies, with increases in trade enforcement activities for ITA and USTR. The rationale for the decrease in funding for USITC was not provided. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees reported their CJS appropriation bills in the spring of 2018, largely rejecting the budget cuts proposed by the Administration for the trade agencies. The House bill allocated $647.6 million for the agencies, slightly more than the Administration's request. The Senate bill allocated $655.6 million, also exceeding the Administration's request. The Senate committee recommended $488.0 million for ITA, $95.0 million for USITC, and $72.6 million for USTR in FY2019 appropriations, which totaled $647.0 million for the three trade-related agencies. This amount represented a slight decrease from FY2018 appropriations. In FY2019 appropriations, the Senate committee recommended $488.0 million for ITA, $95.0 million for USITC, and $68.0 million for USTR. ITA's mission is to improve U.S. prosperity by strengthening industry competitiveness, promoting trade, and ensuring compliance with trade laws. ITA underwent organizational changes in 2013 to align units functionally. The Executive and Administrative Directorate of ITA is responsible for policy leadership, IT support, and administration services. The FY2019 budget requested $440.1 million in direct funding with an additional $11.0 million in user fees, totaling $451.1 million. This represents a decrease from the previous year. The Administration proposed increasing enforcement efforts while closing some US&FCS offices. The House committee-reported H.R. 5952 proposed $491.0 million for ITA, $39.9 million more than the Administration's request. The Senate committee-reported S. 3072 included $499.0 million for ITA, $47.9 million more than the Administration's request. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 provided $484.0 million for ITA. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 allocated $495.0 million for ITA, including $11.0 million in user fees. ITA's Global Markets unit combines US&FCS and SelectUSA to promote U.S. exports and attract foreign investment. GM provides export promotion services, market research, and business connections for U.S. companies. The Global Markets unit promotes U.S. commercial interests through trade shows, fairs, and missions. It engages with foreign governments, resolves market barriers, and advocates for U.S. firms. The Administration proposed reducing funding for Global Markets in FY2019, with a 13.4% decrease in direct funding and a reduction of 133 positions. The House and Senate Appropriation Committees did not adopt the proposed cuts for the Global Markets unit in FY2019. The House committee recommended $319.0 million, $42.5 million more than the Administration's request, and did not support reducing staff or closing offices. The Senate committee recommended funding at the highest possible level and did not adopt the proposal to close offices. The Senate committee did not adopt the Administration's proposal to close offices in fiscal year 2019. The final agreement for FY2019 appropriations included \"no less than $320 million\" in funding for Global Markets and required ITA to report quarterly on staffing levels within the US&FCS. ITA's Industry and Analysis unit aims to advance the competitiveness of U.S. industries through international trade and investment policies. The Industry and Analysis unit focuses on international trade and investment policies, export promotion, and investment promotion. It serves as a liaison between U.S. industries and the federal government, administering programs to support small and medium-sized enterprises. The Administration requested $52.3 million for FY2019, with a proposed shift towards trade enforcement over export promotion activities. The House committee proposed $52.0 million for Industry and Analysis, slightly less than the Administration's request. The Senate committee did not provide a specific recommendation. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 did not give exact funding guidance. The Enforcement and Compliance unit enforces U.S. trade laws, oversees trade remedy laws, assists with unfair trade matters, and administers the Foreign Trade Zone program. The Administration requested $90.6 million for the Enforcement and Compliance unit in FY2019, citing an increase in AD/CVD investigations and workload due to tariffs. The House proposed $85.5 million, $2.1 million less than the request. The Senate recommended $91.5 million. The Senate recommended $91.5 million for Enforcement and Compliance in FY2019, which was $1.0 million more than FY2018 funding and $2.1 million less than the Administration's request. USITC is an independent agency responsible for trade-related investigations and providing advice on U.S. international trade policy. The US International Trade Commission (USITC) is an independent agency that investigates imports, protects domestic industries, and provides trade analysis to the President and Congress. It also maintains the US tariff schedule and serves as a resource for trade data. USITC's budget for FY2019 was $87.6 million, a decrease from the previous year. The US International Trade Commission (USITC) requested $97.5 million for FY2019, citing an increase in import injury cases. Both the House and Senate recommended $95.0 million, which was approved in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019. This amount was $7.4 million more than the President's request and $1.3 million more than the FY2018-enacted amount. The Office of the President, through the USTR, is responsible for developing and coordinating U.S. international trade policies. USTR negotiates trade agreements, resolves disputes, and participates in global trade organizations. In 2018, USTR led negotiations for NAFTA modernization and investigated Chinese intellectual property practices. Funding for USTR is supplemented by the Trade Enforcement Trust Fund. The Administration requested $63.0 million for USTR's salaries and expenses for FY2019, representing a $9.6 million decrease from FY2018. The budget outlined the Trump Administration's trade agenda goals, including defending U.S. sovereignty, enforcing trade laws, and negotiating better trade deals. Both House and Senate committee-reported bills recommended $72.6 million for USTR in FY2019. The Administration requested $63.0 million for USTR's salaries and expenses for FY2019, a decrease from FY2018. The total funding provided by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 was $63.0 million, including $53.0 million for salaries and expenses and an additional $15.0 million from the Trade Enforcement Trust Fund. Congress has also funded specific trade-related programs over the past decade. ITA's Office of China Compliance was established in 2004 to enforce U.S. AD/CVD laws and counter unfair trade practices in China. The China Countervailing Duty Group was created in 2009 to handle the workload from countervailing duty law applications to imports from nonmarket economies. The Office of China Compliance enforces countervailing duty laws on imports from nonmarket economy countries. ITA's FY2019 budget did not specify funding for China AD/CVD activities, but $16.4 million was allocated for enforcement. SelectUSA, under ITA's Global Markets unit, promotes the U.S. as an investment market and addresses investor concerns. SelectUSA, part of ITA's Global Markets unit, advocates for U.S. cities, states, and regions as investment destinations. The Senate committee recommended $10.0 million in funding for SelectUSA, contingent on updating protocols to prevent foreign investments by state-owned entities. The final agreement in the conference report for the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 adopted the Senate committee report language regarding SelectUSA. ITA's Survey of International Air Travelers (SIAT) collects statistics on air passenger travelers in the U.S. The Administration requested $5.0 million for FY2019 for SIAT to expand the survey and data collection, proposing to redirect $5 million in fee revenues from the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) to fully fund SIAT. The House committee-reported bill did not make a specific recommendation for SIAT. The Senate Committee on Appropriations did not adopt the Administration's proposal to seek alternative funding sources for ITA's Survey of International Air Travelers (SIAT). Instead, they directed ITA to continue funding SIAT out of its base budget and encouraged increasing the sample size. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 did not mention SIAT specifically but established the Trade Enforcement Trust Fund (TETF) in 2016 to provide additional funding for USTR's trade enforcement activities. The Trade Enforcement Trust Fund (TETF) is used to monitor and enforce trade agreements, support trade capacity-building assistance, and transfer funds for trade enforcement activities. The FY2019 budget requested no funding from TETF, while both House and Senate proposed $15.0 million for enforcement activities. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 provided $15.0 million from TETF for USTR's enforcement activities. The Trade Enforcement Trust Fund (TETF) is utilized for monitoring and enforcing trade agreements, supporting trade capacity-building assistance, and funding trade enforcement activities. The International Trade Enforcement Center (ITEC) was established in 2012 to enforce U.S. trade rights, succeeded by the Interagency Center on Trade Implementation, Monitoring, and Enforcement (ICTIME) in 2016. ICTIME investigates disputes under the World Trade Organization and regional trade agreements, advancing U.S. trade policy through coordinated enforcement efforts. Funding for ICTIME is now appropriated through USTR. The USTR and ITA collaborate in the ICTIME to address economic issues important to U.S. industries. Funding details for ICTIME were not specified in the USTR's budget justification or in the House and Senate committee-reported bills. The Senate committee expressed support for ICTIME within the funds allocated for USTR, but specific funding language was not included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019."
