    "content": "A clean energy standard (CES) is proposed to enhance domestic energy sustainability, reduce emissions, and position the US as a clean energy leader. Proponents believe it could boost economic growth. Opponents fear it may increase electricity prices, pose grid reliability issues, require new transmission lines, and rely on unproven technologies. President Obama urged Congress to establish a CES in 2012. Senators Bingaman and Murkowski presented a white paper on a CES in 2011. Senator Bingaman and Murkowski issued a white paper on a clean energy standard (CES) to gather input and explore potential design elements. Bingaman introduced the Clean Energy Standard Act of 2012, requiring utilities to increase clean energy sources to 84% by 2035, including nuclear, natural gas, and clean coal. This expands on the concept of a national renewable energy standard (RES) and has been a topic of congressional discussion since the 105th Congress. The Clean Energy Standard Act of 2012 proposed by Senator Bingaman aims to increase clean energy sources to 84% by 2035, including nuclear, natural gas, and clean coal. Renewable sources made up 12% of electricity generation in 2011, with wind and biomass expected to drive growth in renewable electricity generation by 2035. Congressional action may be needed to implement key features of a Clean Energy Standard. The Clean Energy Standard Act of 2012 proposed increasing clean energy sources to 84% by 2035, including nuclear, natural gas, and clean coal. Congressional action may be required for various aspects of a Clean Energy Standard, such as determining eligible energy sources and how a federal CES would interact with state power provisions. The cost, regional resources, and technical challenges of different energy sources need to be considered in this debate. The report provides an overview of potential sources eligible for a Clean Energy Standard (CES), including biomass, fossil fuels with carbon capture, geothermal, nuclear, solar, water, and wind. It details the availability, technologies, advantages, disadvantages, and policy implications of each source for electricity generation. Additionally, there is a section on energy efficiency and its potential impact. The report discusses the differences between clean energy, renewable energy, and alternative energy sources, highlighting their varying characteristics such as point of origin, replenishment time frame, supply, and environmental impact. It explains that while renewable energy sources are naturally replenishing but flow-limited, clean energy sources typically produce little to no air pollution. The term \"alternative\" is used to describe non-conventional energy sources, with most renewable energy sources qualifying as clean energy depending on their electricity production methods. Clean energy sources vary in their characteristics and can include non-renewable sources like nuclear. The selection criteria for clean energy sources for a Clean Energy Standard (CES) can depend on the goal of the CES, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Congress may consider various criteria when evaluating energy sources for inclusion in a CES, including geographic location, supply levels, job creation, implementation time frame, EPA regulations, environmental issues, greenhouse gas emissions, energy balance, scalability, and cost. The section discusses selected energy resources for a Clean Energy Standard (CES), including renewable and technology-aided sources like biomass, clean energy fossil fuels, geothermal, nuclear, solar, water, and wind. Cross-cutting issues for large-scale electricity production include technology upgrades and financial investments. Electricity transmission for clean energy sources may require significant investment in upgrading infrastructure. Variability in sources like wind and solar can impact grid stability without sufficient backup generation. Project economics and regional market prices also play a role in the feasibility of clean electricity investments. Biomass is a type of organic matter that can be converted to energy for electricity generation. Various types of biomass include wood, agricultural residues, aquatic biomass, animal manure, and industrial wastes. Different conversion processes like combustion, gasification, and anaerobic digestion can be used to produce biopower. Biomass resources are abundant in certain regions of the United States, with technologies at different stages of maturity. The availability and cost of materials for clean electricity projects can impact market prices and supply. Biomass can be converted to electricity through various technologies like combustion, gasification, and anaerobic digestion. In 2011, biomass accounted for 1.4% of electricity generation in the US, making it the third-largest renewable energy source. The EIA predicts a 5.6% growth in biomass electricity generation from 2009 to 2035. Advantages of using biomass for electricity generation include availability in over 35 states, creating a new market for producers, and incentivizing the use of pest-infested woody biomass. Some concerns exist regarding the sustainability of using biomass for electricity generation, as it may compete with traditional uses and raise carbon emissions. Managing biomass sources sustainably is crucial to ensure availability, especially for woody residues. Some policy questions arise when considering biomass as a CES energy source, such as potential conflicts with other energy mandates and the economic competitiveness for entities requiring feedstock collection and transportation. Some discussions about a CES focus on electricity, but there are suggestions to include other non-electric energy applications like heating. Natural gas, mainly methane, is found in all 50 states and is produced commercially in 33 states. Shale-gas resources have boosted U.S. reserves and production, leading to lower prices. Uncertainty exists due to potential changes in regulations on hydraulic fracturing. Natural gas plays a significant role in electric power generation in the United States, with NGCC facilities being highly efficient. It ranked second behind coal in 2011, accounting for almost 25% of U.S. electricity generation. Despite having the most electric generation capacity at 41%, many natural gas power plants are not operated at full capacity, unlike coal-fired plants. NGCC facilities operate at 43% of their capacity due to natural gas prices and flexibility. They have advantages in efficiency, quick installation, and operational flexibility for CES. The decline in natural gas prices has led to a shift towards natural gas-fired electric generation. The decline in natural gas prices since 2008 has led to utilities and generators substituting natural gas-fired electric generation for other types. Natural gas emits fewer greenhouse gases and pollutants compared to coal and oil, but methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is released when combusted. Policy questions may arise regarding the availability of enough natural gas for a CES, with shale gas development being crucial. The development of shale gas is crucial for long-term natural gas use. Some companies are proposing to export natural gas to increase demand, but environmental concerns may limit shale gas resources. Including natural gas as a CES energy source could conflict with other energy mandates and potentially raise prices, negatively impacting industrial and residential consumers. Increased demand for natural gas could lead to the development of additional resources, with some producers halting production due to low prices in recent years. There is ongoing debate about including clean coal as a qualifying energy source for a CES, with coal being a significant fuel source for electricity generation in the US. Coal deposits are primarily found in three main regions, with top coal-producing states including Wyoming, West Virginia, and Kentucky. In 2009, a small percentage of coal produced in the US was exported, mainly to Canada, Brazil, and European countries. Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) involves capturing carbon at its source, transporting it, and storing it to prevent its release into the atmosphere. Three main approaches for capturing CO2 are post-combustion capture, pre-combustion capture, and oxy-fuel combustion capture. CO2 is mainly transported through pipelines in the United States, and it is sequestered in geological reservoirs like depleted oil and gas reservoirs, deep saline reservoirs, and unmineable coal seams. Coal-fired electricity plants are prime candidates for CCS or CO2 reuse. Plants are strong candidates for CCS or CO2 reuse due to being large, stationary sources of emissions. The US produces over 5.1 billion metric tons of CO2 annually from fossil fuel combustion, with nearly 42% from electricity generation. The country can potentially store CO2 for decades at current emission rates, with estimates ranging from 1.65 trillion to 20.2 trillion metric tons for deep saline reservoirs. This capacity could store all electricity generation emissions for the next 770 to 9,400 years. CCS can potentially store CO2 emissions for the next 770 to 9,400 years in saline reservoirs at current emission rates. Questions about CCS as a clean energy standard include its long-term viability, impact on coal-fired generation efficiency and cost, and the need for economic incentives to spur adoption and deployment in the energy sector. CCS deployment commercially depends on cost reduction. Legal framework for storing CO2 underground is in development. Experts call for industrial-scale projects to demonstrate safe and efficient CO2 capture, transport, and storage. Geothermal resources use hot fluid for electricity generation from wells drilled into heated rocks. Geothermal resources above 150\u00b0C are used for electricity. The United States is the largest producer of electricity from geothermal resources, with most capacity in California and Nevada. The Geysers in California is a significant geothermal complex with multiple power plants. Geothermal resources above 150\u00b0C are used for electricity generation. In a 2008 assessment, the USGS estimated that the US has a mean electric power generation potential of over 9,000 MW from identified geothermal systems in 13 states. California has the largest share at nearly 60%, followed by Nevada (15%) and Alaska (7.5%). Undiscovered geothermal resources could add over 30,000 MW of potential production capacity. Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) require engineering to access hot water or steam for electricity generation, expanding the nation's geothermal resource base. Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) require elevated temperatures at drillable depths, expanding the potential resource base outside conventional geothermal resources. The USGS estimated a mean electric power-generating capacity from EGS of over 517,000 MW. Geothermal resources offer the advantage of using heat without combustion, reducing carbon dioxide emissions. However, geothermal plants are limited to locations where resources occur in the United States. Geothermal resources in the United States are limited to specific locations, unlike fossil fuel power plants that can be built almost anywhere. Policy questions for including geothermal in a CES portfolio revolve around factors affecting its expansion and deployment for electricity generation. Significant investment and long lead times are required to discover, characterize, and engineer geothermal reservoirs for efficient energy extraction. Factors such as accessibility and distance to electricity consumers play a role in the development of geothermal resources. Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) face technical challenges and require significant investments, with potential constraints on water resources in arid regions. The role of the federal government in advancing EGS technology remains uncertain. Nuclear energy is generated through the fission of heavy radioactive isotopes like uranium-235 and plutonium-239. Nuclear power plants in the United States use enriched uranium to generate electricity, with 104 licensed reactors producing 19% of the country's electricity in 2011. Most uranium fuel is sourced from Australia, Canada, and Russia, with about 8% coming from domestic suppliers. Worldwide uranium resources are estimated to last for about 80 years at current consumption rates. France and other countries are exploring reprocessing and recycling spent nuclear fuel to extend their energy supply. Research on technologies to extend uranium supplies is being conducted by DOE and other countries, with concerns about potential nuclear weapons production. U.S. nuclear power generation growth is expected to be small without favorable federal policies. EIA projects a rise in nuclear power capacity from 101 to 112 gigawatts by 2035, with new reactor construction and increased capacity at existing reactors contributing to the increase. Watts Bar 2 reactor, owned by Tennessee Valley Authority, is currently under construction in the United States. Construction of Watts Bar 2, owned by the Tennessee Valley Authority, began in the 1970s but was recently resumed. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved licenses for new U.S. commercial reactors at the Vogtle nuclear power plant in Georgia. Nuclear power offers advantages such as low emissions and stable fuel prices, but the cost of building nuclear plants is higher than fossil-fuel plants. The future of new nuclear plant construction remains uncertain. The cost of building new nuclear power plants is higher than fossil-fuel plants, making them economically disadvantaged. Safety concerns have been raised following the Fukushima Daiichi disaster in Japan. Policy questions arise regarding the inclusion of existing nuclear power capacity in a CES. The Obama Administration has halted the development of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository and established the Blue-Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future to find an alternative waste management strategy. Spent nuclear fuel will continue to be stored at plant sites until a new strategy is implemented. Advanced nuclear fuel technology raises concerns about nuclear weapons proliferation. Advanced spent fuel reprocessing and reactor technologies could increase energy extraction from uranium supplies and reduce nuclear waste radioactivity. Concerns arise about weapons-useable plutonium separation. DOE nuclear research aims to minimize proliferation risks. Solar energy can be converted into electricity through photovoltaic or solar thermal methods. Solar energy can be converted into electricity through photovoltaic or solar thermal methods. Photovoltaic conversion uses semiconductor material to absorb photons and create electricity. Solar thermal electricity conversion uses heat from the sun to generate electricity through technologies like parabolic trough, power tower, linear fresnel, and dish stirling technologies. These technologies typically use thermal energy to heat water and make steam to power a turbine generator for electricity production. Dish stirling technology does not require water for electricity production. Stirling technology for electricity production relies on thermal expansion properties of gases like hydrogen or helium to power a Stirling engine. By the end of 2011, the total solar electricity capacity in the United States was around 4,460 megawatts, with photovoltaic and solar thermal technologies contributing approximately 1.8 million megawatt-hours to the total U.S. electricity generation. California, New Jersey, Arizona, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania are the top five states in terms of installed photovoltaic capacity. Concentrated solar power (CSP) is better suited for large utility-scale operations in high solar insolation areas like the desert Southwest. Some argue that solar electricity in high solar insolation areas like the desert Southwest provides benefits such as zero-emission electricity generation, peak power production, and on-site consumption. Critics mention limitations like cost, intermittent operation, water supply needs for some solar thermal technologies, and the challenge of connecting large-scale solar projects to electricity consumers. Policy questions for solar as a qualifying CES energy source include how the electricity grid will compensate for solar's intermittent nature and whether the federal government should fund research to reduce solar electricity production costs. Solar installations becoming a major electricity source could impact grid operations and reliability. Research and development initiatives may be necessary to reduce the cost of solar electricity production. Solar technology companies may seek government assistance for cost reduction activities. Policy considerations for off-grid solar generation and CES credits, as well as the interaction with natural resource policy, need to be addressed. Solar projects require large land areas for utility scale generation. Water energy technologies, including hydropower, hydrokinetic, tidal turbines, and ocean thermal energy, generate electricity using water resources. Hydropower harnesses flowing or falling water, while hydrokinetic utilizes river currents. Tidal turbines capture energy from tidal waves, and ocean thermal energy conversion uses heat from the oceans. Conventional hydropower is the most established form of water energy generation. The United States has used hydropower for over 100 years, with conventional hydropower being the largest renewable energy source for electricity generation in 2011. The potential for increased hydropower generation lies primarily in the western United States and Alaska, with roughly 33 states having the capacity to increase their hydropower generation by 100% or more. The Bureau of Reclamation has identified 70 sites on federal land that could be economically feasible for hydropower development. Conventional hydropower was the largest renewable energy source for electricity generation in 2011, accounting for nearly 9% of total electricity net generation. The growth rate of conventional hydropower generation is projected to be 0.5% annually from 2009 to 2035, but it is not expected to exceed 7% of total U.S. electricity generating capacity in 2035. Benefits of expanding hydropower include meeting peak demand, lower capital costs for upgrades, minimal carbon dioxide emissions, and potential multi-purpose use. Hydropower has advantages like meeting peak demand, low carbon emissions, and multi-purpose use. However, there are concerns about high capital costs, environmental impacts, and dam safety. Policy questions include whether existing hydropower facilities should qualify as clean energy sources. Some states could meet a proposed clean energy mandate largely through existing hydropower. The CES aims to increase clean energy generation by 2035, focusing on existing hydropower facilities. Concerns arise regarding licensing issues for new hydropower facilities, which operate under FERC licenses. Time and cost challenges exist in obtaining licenses for privately owned facilities. The inclusion of small and low-head hydropower resources, as well as new water energy technologies like hydrokinetic turbines, in a CES is being considered. Wind energy, along with hydropower, is a significant renewable source of electricity in the United States. In 2011, wind energy accounted for 2.9% of U.S. electricity generation, with nearly 120,000 million kilowatt-hours produced. Wind energy is harnessed through turbines and generators to convert kinetic energy into usable electricity. Offshore wind resources have not been fully utilized yet. Offshore wind resources in the United States have not been fully developed despite being close to coastal demand loads. The U.S. was the largest wind market in 2009, but China surpassed it in 2010 in installed wind capacity. By the end of 2011, the U.S. had approximately 47 gigawatts of wind capacity. Wind energy is expected to grow by 2.1% from 2009 to 2035, but it is not projected to exceed 5% of total U.S. electricity generating capacity by 2035. Onshore wind electricity is one of the lowest-cost renewable options, with a total levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of $97 per megawatt-hour (MWhr). Proponents of wind energy in the United States argue that it is clean, emission-free, and does not deplete finite resources. They also claim that wind power is essentially free, providing a hedge against volatile fossil energy costs and potentially creating jobs. However, opponents argue that wind energy is intermittent and may cause grid disruptions if not properly managed. They also point out that the best wind resources are in remote areas with inadequate transmission access. Wind energy projects have environmental consequences like noise and threats to avian species. The cost of wind electricity, including transmission and ancillary services, is generally higher than conventional sources. Policy questions include concerns about project location, wildlife, and potential hindrances to large-scale wind power development. Opponents cite avian threats, noise nuisance, and radar interference as reasons to limit wind development. The concerns surrounding wind development include radar interference and the intermittent nature of wind electricity generation. Grid operators may face challenges balancing the grid as wind capacity increases. Energy efficiency could help reduce the need for additional power plant capacity in a Clean Energy Standard (CES). Energy efficiency measures reduce energy consumption without reducing services provided by end-use devices. Efficiency improvements are often bundled into outreach programs by electric utility companies to target demand reductions. This can help balance the grid and reduce the need for additional power plant capacity in a Clean Energy Standard (CES). Energy efficiency measures provide demand-side power reductions equivalent to supply-side production from new power plants, reducing resource use and environmental impacts. There are advantages to energy efficiency, such as availability everywhere power demand is located and reducing the need for additional power plant capacity and transmission infrastructure. However, there are also disadvantages and barriers to its use. The disadvantages and barriers to energy efficiency measures include utility profit incentives to increase power sales, difficulty in estimating cost savings, and time delays in evaluating program impacts. Opportunities for improving demand-side efficiency exist in buildings, industry, and transportation sectors. Buildings in residential, commercial, and industrial sectors offer significant opportunities for efficiency improvements. Existing buildings can reduce power demand through upgrades to electrical end-use equipment and insulation. New buildings can incorporate design measures like passive heating and cooling features and solar photovoltaics. On-site power generation in industry can also help reduce electricity demand. Industrial processes, such as aluminum production, present a large opportunity for efficiency improvements. The transportation sector currently provides a smaller opportunity for efficiency gains. The transportation sector currently supports public transit systems, but the focus on electric and hybrid-electric vehicles may increase power use. Efficiency measures for electric vehicles would become more important, but the decoupling of electric utility profits from sales volume hinders energy efficiency resources development. Some states, like California, have experimented with innovative solutions. Some states, such as California, have implemented innovative rate-making policies to make energy efficiency profitable by decoupling utility profits from sales volume. This mechanism allows rates to increase slightly to compensate for reduced sales, aiming to reduce overall consumer bills. The role of energy efficiency in a CES involves potentially conflicting policy goals of using new clean energy technologies or reducing overall electricity demand. One proposed solution is to establish a fixed percentage cap for energy efficiency resources to provide flexibility to regulated entities and avoid diluting the focus on developing higher-cost power supply. Policy questions include the potential benefits of energy efficiency in lowering power costs and reducing overall consumer bills. The potential benefits of energy efficiency, such as lower power costs and reduced pollution, are being questioned for inclusion in a CES. Efficiency measures may not need new incentives like the CES, and a cap on their contribution could prevent hindering clean energy development. Some proposals have included energy efficiency in a CES with a maximum contribution cap to increase flexibility for states or regions. Including efficiency in a Clean Energy Standard (CES) could provide up to 20,000 MW of new generating capacity over 10 to 15 years, with the need for increased funding and alignment of utility incentives. Congress has discussed CES in the national energy debate, with bills like the Fulfilling U.S. Energy Leadership Act of 2011 (S. 1220) introduced during the 112th Congress. The Clean Energy Standard Act of 2012 (S. 2146) proposes a national market-oriented standard to reduce CO2 emissions from the U.S. electric power sector. It requires utilities to obtain a minimum percentage of electricity from clean energy sources, starting at 24% in 2015 and increasing to 84% by 2035. Compliance can be achieved by acquiring credits. The Clean Energy Standard Act of 2012 proposes a national market-oriented standard to reduce CO2 emissions from the U.S. electric power sector. Utilities can comply by acquiring credits for electricity from qualified clean energy facilities or making alternative payments. Certain utilities are exempt based on electricity sales. Clean energy is defined as electricity generated from renewable sources or qualified waste-to-energy facilities. The Clean Energy Standard Act of 2012 proposes a national market-oriented standard to reduce CO2 emissions from the U.S. electric power sector. Utilities can comply by acquiring credits for electricity from qualified clean energy facilities or making alternative payments. Clean energy is defined as electricity generated from renewable sources or qualified waste-to-energy facilities. The legislative examination of a CES could raise questions about which sources should be included, the amount of clean electricity that can be generated, and the consideration of a carbon accounting factor for each qualifying energy source. The consideration of whether renewable energy sources should be considered a \"free\" resource for generating clean electricity and the potential impact on meeting the CES mandate, including the competition with other clean energy sources like natural gas. The inclusion of energy efficiency in a CES and its interaction with state renewable electricity requirements, as well as the allocation of costs for new transmission capacity, are important factors that need further exploration to ensure the effectiveness of a CES if implemented."
