    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature submits an act to the electors, stating that the theft of firearms poses unique dangers to public safety. The value of handguns is often less than $950, but the threat they pose goes beyond monetary value. Restoring penalties for stolen firearms is deemed necessary. The intent is not to undermine voters' decisions. The Legislature proposes amending Penal Code Section 490.2 to restore penalties for firearm theft and receipt of stolen firearms, recognizing the unique dangers they pose to public safety. This amendment does not undermine voters' decision to decrease penalties for low-level theft and receiving stolen property. Section 490.2 of the Penal Code is amended to state that theft of property under $950 is considered petty theft and punishable as a misdemeanor, with exceptions for prior convictions. This does not apply to theft charges that can be classified as infractions under other laws. The theft of a firearm is considered grand theft and is punishable under Section 489 of the Penal Code. Section 496 is amended to address this issue. Section 496 of the Penal Code addresses the buying, receiving, or concealing of stolen property, with punishment ranging from misdemeanor to imprisonment based on the value of the property and prior convictions. A principal involved in the theft of property can be convicted under this section, but cannot be convicted of both this offense and the theft of the same property. Every swap meet vendor, person dealing in merchandise, or their representatives who buy stolen property over $950 without making reasonable inquiries can be imprisoned for up to one year.
