    "content": "Most spending on surface transportation infrastructure is funded through current revenue sources like taxes, tolls, and fares, with only a small portion financed through borrowing or private investment. Due to strained government budgets, there is a growing interest in financing large projects like major interstate highway bridges. For example, New York's $5 billion Tappan Zee Bridge replacement is being largely financed through municipal bonds and a federal loan. The federal government supports surface transportation infrastructure financing mainly through tax preferences for bonds issued by state and local governments, federal loan programs like TIFIA, and state infrastructure banks. Project financing relies on revenue streams at the state or local level to repay loans or provide returns to private investors, with tolls being a common revenue source. Federal grant funding is more costly compared to these financing mechanisms. This report discusses federal programs supporting surface transportation infrastructure investment, including options like tax credit bonds and a national infrastructure bank. In 2014, public-sector spending on this infrastructure totaled about $256 billion, with 75% on highways and 25% on public transportation. In 2014, about $256 billion was spent on surface transportation infrastructure, with 75% allocated to highways and 25% to public transportation. The spending was divided between capital investment and operations/maintenance, with capital costs making up more than half of total highway expenditures and about one-third of public transportation expenditures. Highway and street expenditures are mainly funded by state governments (50%), local governments (30%), and federal aid. Highway spending is primarily funded through user fees like fuel taxes and tolls or general funds. Bond issuance for highway purposes in 2014 accounted for only 12% of total revenue collected, mainly by state agencies. Public transportation spending relies on passenger fares, dedicated taxes, and general funds. In 2010, bond issuance for public transportation was around $4 billion, with local governments providing the most support. Financing mechanisms play a crucial role in funding large transportation projects, with state and local governments relying on various sources such as fares, government funding, and municipal bonds. Municipal bonds offer tax advantages by excluding interest from federal income taxes. Federal government typically does not directly finance transportation projects, leaving it to state and local entities to manage infrastructure financing. The tax preference for municipal bonds excludes interest from federal income taxes, reducing federal revenues significantly. Municipal bonds issued for transportation projects represent a significant portion of total issuance, with $39.1 billion issued in 2015. These bonds are typically backed by a specific revenue stream or the general obligation of the issuing entity. Private activity bonds (PABs) for transportation projects, such as airports, docks, mass commuting facilities, and highways, are limited to $15 billion, with $11.2 billion already allocated as of July 7, 2016. PABs carry a higher default risk than general obligation bonds due to project dependency for repayment, resulting in higher interest rates. Private activity bonds (PABs) for transportation projects have higher interest rates to compensate for the risk involved. Municipal bonds can lead to a loss in economic welfare as the reduction in federal revenue exceeds the benefit to the issuer. Holders of tax-exempt bonds receive a tax benefit based on their marginal tax rate. The issuer benefits from the difference between taxable and tax-exempt interest rates. For example, a tax-exempt bond with a 3.00% yield compared to a corporate bond with a 3.50% yield results in issuer benefits. An issuer of tax-exempt bonds saves money compared to taxable bonds due to lower interest rates. Tax credit bonds (TCBs) offer tax benefits to investors or direct payments to issuers. Qualified Zone Academy Bonds (QZABs) were created for school districts for specific uses like renovation and teacher training. The Build America Bonds (BABs) were created in 2009 for capital investments, with $40 billion used for transportation projects. BABs had a 35% credit rate and a direct pay option. Qualified Zone Academy Bonds (QZABs) had a 100% investor credit. Tax credit bonds (TCBs) have higher rates to offset taxability. The investor tax credit rate should be higher than municipal bond rates to attract investors. However, investors must consider their tax liability and the potential risk of not being able to offset it with the credit. Entities without U.S. income tax liability may find the credit of little value. Issuers of tax credit bonds should ensure that the interest cost is lower than other financing alternatives, such as tax-exempt bonds. For 100% tax credit bonds like QZABs, the federal government pays all interest for the issuer, resulting in lower interest costs compared to tax-exempt bonds. BABs introduced the direct-pay tax credit bond model, allowing issuers to receive the tax credit directly from Treasury. Municipal issuers prefer the option with the lowest net interest costs, such as issuer direct payment TCB with negotiated taxable interest rates. The issuer direct payment TCB offers an 8% rate on bond principal, with a 35% credit amount resulting in a $2,800 credit. The interest cost to the issuer is $5,200 if the tax-exempt rate is above 5.20%. BABs have saved municipal issuers $12 billion in interest costs, but recent developments have made them less attractive. Grant anticipation bonds, such as GARVEE bonds, are tax-exempt securities backed by future federal grants. Private investment in transportation projects can involve borrowing from banks, issuing bonds, or providing equity investment. Private involvement can be costly due to deal assembly expenses. Private financing, often used for large projects, involves private investments in public-private partnerships (P3s) with the public sector. P3s typically involve greater private-sector responsibility for project tasks, such as design-build contracts in surface transportation projects. Some public-private partnerships (P3s) in the United States involve long-term private financing, with 21 projects worth $24.6 billion listed by the Federal Highway Administration. P3s and private investment in surface transportation are more common in other countries like Portugal, Spain, and Australia. Private financing in P3s typically relies on project-related revenue streams like tolls, fees, and building rents. Availability payments from the government may also support private-sector financing. Examples include leasing existing assets for future revenue or developing new assets for a revenue stream. Facility user fees are crucial for attracting private-sector resources, especially in large-scale regional or national projects that combine public and private financing. Public-private partnerships in transportation projects often rely on a mix of public and private financing. An example is the $2 billion I-495 High-Occupancy Toll Lanes project on the Washington beltway, which involved private equity, private activity bonds, a federal TIFIA loan, and state funding. The federal government plays a role in influencing and supporting P3s through programs, funding, and oversight, with the TIFIA program being a key driver for encouraging private financing in transportation projects. The Department of Transportation (DOT) supports public-private partnerships (P3s) in transportation through programs like the TIFIA program, which offers low-interest loans to project sponsors. Legislation like MAP-21 and the FAST Act have authorized DOT to provide best practices, develop model contracts, and offer technical assistance for P3 agreements. The Build America Bureau, established in 2016, administers TIFIA and other financing programs to support P3s. The FAST Act authorizes various programs to support public-private partnerships in transportation, including the TIFIA program, private activity bonds allocation, and the Nationally Significant Freight and Highway Projects Program. It also provides assistance with DOT grant programs, promotes transparency and best practices for P3s, and offers technical assistance for innovative financing. Additionally, it allows formula highway funding for states to establish offices for P3 oversight and authorizes a Regional Infrastructure Accelerator Demonstration Program. The Accelerator Demonstration Program aims to assist entities in developing infrastructure priorities and financing strategies for projects eligible for TIFIA funding. P3s involve risk transfer to private partners, including cost overruns and revenue uncertainties. Private partners require compensation for assuming risks, but it can still be advantageous for the public agency. The private sector in P3 projects may require compensation for assuming risks, providing greater certainty for the public sector. However, not all risks can be shifted, such as delays in the environmental review process. Some P3 transfers of risk may prove illusory, leading to renegotiations or public sector ownership. Difficulties with the SH-130 extension near Austin, TX, financed by a P3, highlight these challenges. The SH-130 toll road project in Texas had lower traffic volumes than expected, leading to less revenue for the concessionaire. To attract more trucks, the state subsidized tolls for a year, but the concessionaire still declared bankruptcy in 2016. This may impact the $430 million federal loan repayment scheduled to start in June 2017. Critics argue that P3 projects often involve a small share of private money, with risks sometimes being shifted back to the public sector. The Build America Bureau will oversee P3 contracts for transportation projects, ensuring transparency and cost-benefit analysis. Critics fear new oversight requirements may hinder P3 development due to time and expense. Federal loan programs like TIFIA, RRIF, and Section 129 loans support surface transportation infrastructure projects. The TIFIA program, established in 1998, provides federal credit assistance for surface transportation projects, including loans, loan guarantees, and lines of credit. Projects eligible for TIFIA assistance include highways, bridges, public transportation, and intermodal facilities. As of July 2016, TIFIA had provided $24.5 billion in assistance to 60 projects. TIFIA has provided $24.5 billion in assistance to 60 projects with an estimated total project cost of $88 billion. The financing offers low fixed-rate funds for up to 35 years, with flexible repayment options. TIFIA typically serves as subordinate debt but has a \"springing lien\" provision in case of project bankruptcy, ensuring equal treatment with senior debt holders. TIFIA financing, typically subordinate debt, includes a \"springing lien\" provision for equal treatment with senior debt holders in case of project bankruptcy. Eligibility criteria include creditworthiness, fostering public-private partnerships, expediting project timelines, and reducing federal grant funding contributions. The TIFIA financing program provides funding for transportation projects with eligibility criteria such as creditworthiness, project readiness, and repayment with a dedicated revenue stream. Projects must generally cost $50 million or more, with lower thresholds for specific project types. The program aims to limit federal funding by encouraging private finance and enforcing creditworthiness standards. The TIFIA financing program aims to limit federal funding by relying on market discipline and leveraging a small budget authority into a large loan capacity. The subsidy cost is the estimated long-term cost to the government of a direct loan or loan guarantee. A typical rule of thumb is that the average subsidy cost of a TIFIA loan is 10%, allowing $1 million of budget authority to provide $10 million of loan capacity. The FAST Act reduced direct authorization of funding for TIFIA after it had been increased in MAP-21. The FAST Act reduced funding for TIFIA, impacting DOT's loan capacity by approximately $7.25 billion in FY2016. States can now use funds from other highway programs to cover subsidy and administrative costs, potentially increasing TIFIA financing beyond the $275 million direct authorization. RRIF allows the FRA to provide loans and guarantees up to $35 billion, with $7 billion reserved for freight projects. The Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF) program allows for up to $35 billion in loans and guarantees, with $7 billion set aside for freight projects benefiting railroads other than Class I railroads. Eligible borrowers include state and local governments, railroads, and joint ventures, with eligible projects including buying or improving rail facilities, developing new rail or intermodal facilities, and commercial and residential development around stations. Operating expenses are not covered. The RRIF program allows for up to $35 billion in loans and guarantees for eligible projects, excluding operating expenses. Project sponsors pay the credit risk premium, evaluated based on creditworthiness and collateral. Loans range from $56,000 to $967 million, mostly for Class II and Class III freight operators. Some loans go to passenger train operators. The RRIF program offers loans and guarantees up to $35 billion for eligible projects, with loans ranging from $56,000 to $967 million. Passenger train operators, including Amtrak, have received large loans. Recently, there has been interest from sponsors of privately owned high-speed rail projects, which may pose higher risks due to the large amounts of money involved and the lack of collateral in some cases. An example is a proposed high-speed rail service between Victorville and Las Vegas. The XpressWest high-speed rail project between Victorville and Las Vegas, estimated at $6.9 billion, faced challenges with meeting Buy America provisions for RRIF loan approval. In 2016, XpressWest ended its partnership with China Railway International U.S.A. Co. Ltd. and sought support from the Federal Railroad Administration. State infrastructure banks (SIBs) are another potential source of financing for transportation projects. State infrastructure banks (SIBs) were established in response to a program by Congress in 1995. 32 states had federally authorized SIBs in 2012, with some states having SIBs unconnected to the federal program. Local governments like Chicago and Dauphin County, PA have also set up infrastructure banks for public works projects. These banks are funded through various sources, including state taxes on liquid fuels. State infrastructure banks (SIBs) were established in response to a program by Congress in 1995. These banks are funded through various sources, including state taxes on liquid fuels. The FAST Act provides authority for a TIFIA loan to a state infrastructure bank (SIB) to capitalize a \"rural project fund\" within the bank. Most SIBs function as revolving loan funds, directly loaning money to project sponsors and using repayment with interest to make more loans. Some SIBs have the authority to use their initial capital as security for issuing bonds. State infrastructure banks (SIBs) were established in 1995 in response to a program by Congress. These banks are funded through state taxes on liquid fuels and can use their initial capital as security for issuing bonds. SIBs offer various types of credit assistance to project sponsors. SIB activity has varied widely among states, with some states accounting for the majority of loans and agreement value. State infrastructure banks (SIBs) were established in 1995 in response to a program by Congress. These banks are funded through state taxes on liquid fuels and can use their initial capital as security for issuing bonds. SIB activity has varied widely among states, with some states accounting for the majority of loans and agreement value. Three-quarters of the agreement value is attributed to states like Texas and California. 71% of projects helped by SIBs were highway projects, while other types of projects like aviation, water, transit, and rail accounted for the remaining activity. Factors contributing to the low activity of state infrastructure banks include the lagging capitalization due to federal funds being committed to traditional projects and the challenge of finding small, local projects with sufficient revenue to repay loans. Tolling, for example, may be infeasible or unpopular. Additionally, projects funded by federally authorized SIBs must comply with federal regulations on environmental review and prevailing wages. State infrastructure banks (SIBs) face challenges such as environmental review, prevailing wages, state debt limits, and credit ratings. Some states may have laws inhibiting SIB creation. Federal assistance for debt finance aims to reduce costs for borrowers through tax preferences or credit assistance. Federal tax preference and credit assistance for debt finance include excluding interest from investor income and providing tax credits. Federal credit assistance can involve guaranteeing debt instruments or providing direct loans. The budget impact of these mechanisms varies, with direct loans offering significant incentives for borrowers and loan guarantees benefiting issuers while limiting federal risk exposure. The nature of credit assistance for capital projects is crucial in determining the financial responsibility of the federal government. The federal government's financial responsibility in the event of default for credit assistance on capital projects is most attractive for high-risk projects. Tax preferences reduce government risk compared to credit assistance but still have a revenue impact. Tax credit bonds with high credit rates and long maturities offer the largest subsidy for issuers, leading to potential revenue loss. Tax-exempt bonds provide a smaller subsidy but also offer a tax preference for investors, resulting in combined revenue loss. The revenue loss from tax-exempt bonds can exceed that of tax credit bonds with low rates and limited terms when issuer and investor subsidies are considered together. The impact on the budget of different debt finance options depends on specific details. Direct loans could result in the largest budget impact as the government could potentially lose all proceeds loaned. Tax-exempt bond subsidies have a limited budget impact compared to tax credit bonds, which have been used to encourage investment in specific sectors. Public-sector debt finance has unlimited access to tax-exempt bond financing for infrastructure projects. The Obama Administration's FY2017 budget includes proposals for preferential tax treatment for bond-financed infrastructure projects, such as the America Fast Forward (AFF) Bond. AFFs would offer a 28% direct payment to issuers and allow issuance by nonprofit entities. The reduced credit amount of 28% for bond issuers may limit interest, especially with possible budget sequester in future years. BAB payments and other direct payments for tax credit bonds were reduced by 6.8% in FY2016. The introduction of AFF bonds is estimated to reduce budget deficits by $3 million over the 2017-2026 budget window. The Administration's FY2017 budget proposal includes provisions to increase tax-exempt private activity bonds for transportation projects beyond the current $15 billion limit. The Administration's FY2017 budget proposal includes provisions to increase tax-exempt private activity bonds for transportation projects to $19 billion. This includes a proposal for qualified public infrastructure bonds (QPIBs) that could be used for privately owned infrastructure like airports and mass commuting facilities, with a projected revenue loss of $4.54 billion over the 2017-2026 budget window. The FAST Act made changes to the TIFIA program, broadening project eligibility and providing funding for smaller projects. States may choose to use grant funding to cover loan costs if TIFIA exhausts its direct funding in the future. The FAST Act made changes to the TIFIA program, broadening project eligibility and providing funding for smaller projects. The RRIF program has seen little use in the past, but recent major borrowing for publicly funded projects by MTA and Amtrak has increased its utilization. Private freight railroads, the original focus of the RRIF program, have not borrowed extensively. Increasing the use of the RRIF program by both private and public borrowers may require providing an appropriation. The RRIF program may need an appropriation to cover subsidy costs and simplify the application process for smaller loans. TIFIA and PABs are crucial for P3s in surface transportation, with concerns about reaching the $15 billion PAB cap. Monitoring assistance availability from these programs is essential, along with assessing the impact of MAP-21 and the FAST Act on private investment in infrastructure. P3 skeptics may aim to limit federal financing for P3 development or enhance transparency requirements. Many different formulations of a national infrastructure bank have been proposed in Congress over the past few years. Proponents typically see such a bank as a way to provide low-cost, long-term loans, loan guarantees, and lines of credit on flexible terms to support infrastructure projects. Policy choices include the following: Infrastructure type, institutional form, and governance. An infrastructure bank can be structured in various ways, such as being a government corporation or a government-sponsored enterprise with an independent board. Funding can come from appropriations under the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, allowing for a 10% subsidy cost to support lending. The bank could also operate as a revolving fund, using repaid loans to make new loans. Some proposals suggest the bank raise capital through bond issuance and charge fees to offset costs. Five infrastructure bank proposals have been introduced. Five infrastructure bank proposals have been introduced in the 114th Congress, each proposing a national infrastructure bank with different governance, eligibility rules, and funding mechanisms. The Partnership to Build America Act of 2015 would create the American Infrastructure Fund (AIF) with $50 billion of repatriated foreign earnings, offering tax benefits to companies in return for investing in 50-year bonds. The AIF would support infrastructure sectors like transportation, energy, water, communications, and education, including equity investments up to 20% of projects. The National Infrastructure Development Bank Act proposes to create the NIDB as a government corporation to aid various infrastructure projects through loans, loan guarantees, and subsidizing interest on American Infrastructure Bonds. AIBs could be issued by project sponsors, with federal taxes paid by AIB holders credited to the NIDB for other projects. The NIDB would also receive $25 billion from the general fund. The BRIDGE Act (S. 1589) proposes creating the Infrastructure Financing Authority (IFA) as a government corporation to provide loans and loan guarantees for transportation, energy, and water projects. It authorizes $10 billion for the authority and allows for modifications to eligible project types. The act also establishes an Office of Technical and Rural Assistance within the IFA to assist rural projects. At least 5% of the budget authority must be used for rural projects. The Build USA Act (S. 1296) proposes establishing the American Infrastructure Bank as a government corporation to provide loans and loan guarantees for highway projects. The bank would be funded through taxes on repatriated foreign earnings, issuance of bonds, and federal highway formula funds. It aims to leverage state, local, and private-sector investment, with a focus on data-driven project selection and specialized infrastructure finance staff. The potential drawbacks of a national infrastructure bank include limited suitable projects, politically driven project selection, and duplication of existing programs like TIFIA. A national bank may not be the most cost-effective way to increase infrastructure spending, as noted by the Congressional Budget Office. Enhancing existing state infrastructure banks could be an alternative. Capitalization has been a challenge for federally authorized SIBs due to committed federal grant funds. It is uncertain if the FAST Act will address these issues. The FAST Act provision may help with capitalizing a State Infrastructure Bank (SIB). Other proposed ideas include dedicating federal funds to SIBs and authorizing SIBs to issue tax credit bonds."
