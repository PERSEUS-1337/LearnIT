    "content": "Several federal programs support child care, education, or related services, primarily for low-income working families. The tax code includes provisions to assist families with child care expenses. Programs like the Child Care and Development Block Grant and Head Start have been reauthorized in Congress. Funding for these programs and tax provisions over the past five years is detailed in Table 1. The NCLBA programs, including ESEA Title I, Part A, Early Reading First, Even Start, and Early Childhood Educator Professional Development, have received continued funding. Programs for young children under IDEA, such as Preschool Grants and Infants and Toddlers, are not up for reauthorization in the 110th Congress. The primary federal grant program for child care is CCDBG, overdue for reauthorization in the 110th Congress. The CCDBG program, administered by the Department of Health and Human Services, provides formula block grants to states to subsidize child care expenses for families with children under age 13. The program awaits reauthorization in the 110th Congress, with discretionary funding provided through the appropriations process. The CCDBG program provides sliding fee scale assistance to parents through vouchers or certificates, usable with any provider. States must establish licensing standards and health/safety requirements for providers receiving subsidies. Funding comes from discretionary and mandatory grants, with state matching requirements. The Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) program provides funding to states for child care assistance, with requirements for quality improvement and targeting funds towards welfare recipients or families at risk of welfare dependency. States must use at least 4% of funds for quality improvement and target 70% towards welfare or at-risk populations. State plans indicate that many states guarantee child care to welfare families, with a limit of 5% for administrative costs. The FY2006 Appropriations Act included roughly $2.1 billion for this program. The CCDBG program received $2.1 billion in discretionary funding under various legislative acts, with a 1% rescission bringing the total to $2.062 billion. Mandatory funding for FY2003-FY2005 was set at $2.717 billion annually, and a longer five-year funding period of $2.917 billion annually was established for FY2006-FY2010 under the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. The TANF program provides fixed block grants for state-designed aid to needy families with children. Congress included welfare provisions in the spending budget reconciliation bill (S. 1932) in 2006, maintaining the TANF block grant at $16.5 billion for FY2006-2010. States spent federal TANF funds for child care in FY2006, with the option to transfer funds to the CCDF program. The transfer from the FY2006 TANF allotment to the CCDBG totaled $1.9 billion, representing 12% of the TANF allotment. The CACFP provides federal funds for meals and snacks in licensed child care centers, family and group day care homes, and Head Start centers. Children under 12, migrant children under 15, and children with disabilities can participate. The CACFP is an open-ended entitlement administered by the Department of Agriculture, with obligations estimated at $2.289 billion for FY2008. Title XX of the Social Security Act authorizes Social Services Block Grants, which may be used for social services at the states' discretion. State allocations are based on relative population size, and funding for the SSBG has been held steady at $1.7 billion for the past seven years. Congress has appropriated amounts exceeding the entitlement ceiling in some years. The Social Services Block Grants (SSBG) funding has been steady at $1.7 billion for seven years. Additional funding of $550 million was provided for Gulf Coast Hurricanes in 2005. Head Start program provides early childhood education services to low-income children. The Head Start program was reauthorized through FY2012 in November 2007, with funding provided directly by HHS to local grantees. In FY2006, 909,201 children were enrolled in Head Start, with 10% under age 3 in Early Head Start. Temporary funding was extended through continuing resolutions until a fourth CR provided funding for FY2007. The Consolidated Appropriations Act 2008 (P.L. 110-161) provided $6.878 billion for the Head Start program, a decrease of $10 million from the previous year. ESEA Title I, Part A, is a significant federal program for disadvantaged children, including preschoolers, but preschool services are not separately funded under this program. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-161) provides $14.03 billion for Title I, Part A, an increase of almost $1.2 billion above the FY2007 level. The Early Reading First program supports school readiness for young children from low-income families through research-based strategies and professional development. Grants are awarded to eligible local educational agencies and organizations for up to six years. The Even Start program, authorized by ESEA Title I, Part B, Subpart 3, integrates early childhood education, adult basic education, and parenting skills into a family literacy program. It provides grants to states for eligible entities, serving children aged 0-7 and their parents with adult literacy instruction, early childhood education, and parent support. The program, first authorized in 1989, includes participant recruitment, staff training, and home-based instruction. The Even Start program, authorized in 1989, has faced criticism and funding cuts in recent years. The Education Department's FY2007 CR operating plan allocated $82 million, a decrease from the previous year. The Administration requested no funding for FY2008, but the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 provided $66 million. The Administration argues for the program's elimination due to lack of demonstrated effectiveness in improving child and adult learning outcomes. The Even Start program, facing criticism and funding cuts, has advocates arguing for its continuation. They emphasize the importance of providing integrated family literacy services to a disadvantaged population. The Department of Education has provided grants to improve early childhood educators' skills in high-poverty communities, with funding increasing to $14.6 million in FY2007. The Department of Education increased funding to $14.6 million in FY2007 for the Even Start program, which provides integrated family literacy services to a disadvantaged population. The majority of IDEA funding goes to school-age children, but there are also state grant programs for young children with disabilities. The Infants and Toddlers program serves children from birth to two years old, while the Preschool program serves children ages 3 to 5. States receiving grants must create a comprehensive system for early intervention services. Services focus on children with \"developmental delay\" in physical, mental, or other capacities, detailed in an Individualized Family Service Plan. Services are provided in \"natural environments,\" including the home, with other infants and toddlers. States qualify for Preschool grants under Section 619 of IDEA if they provide free appropriate public education to disabled children aged 3 to 5. Section 619 provides supplementary funding for services to this age group. Section 619 of IDEA provides supplementary funding for services to children aged 3 to 5 with disabilities. The program received $374 million in funding for FY2008, a decrease from the previous year. Additionally, the CAMPIS program supports low-income parents in post-secondary education through campus-based child care services. The CAMPIS program provides grants to institutions of higher education to offer campus-based child care services for low-income parents in post-secondary education. Funding for FY2007 was $15.8 million, the same as FY2006, and the program was last funded in FY2005 at $36 million. The program aims to enhance school readiness for children under five by improving their cognitive, physical, social, and emotional development. The DCTC is a non-refundable tax credit for employment-related expenses for child care. The maximum credit rate is 35% of expenses up to $3,000 for one child and up to $6,000 for two or more children. The rate decreases as income increases, reaching 20% for taxpayers with incomes over $43,000. The estimated tax expenditures for the DCTC are $3.1 million. The Department of the Treasury estimates tax expenditures for the DCTC will be $3.1 billion for tax year 2006. Payments made by a taxpayer's employer for dependent care assistance may be excluded from the employee's income under Section 129 of the tax code. The maximum exclusion is $5,000. Employers can include dependent care assistance in nontaxable flexible benefit plans under Section 125 of the tax code. Tax expenditures associated with the DCAP are estimated to be $660 million in tax year 2006. The FY2007 appropriations process included four continuing resolutions, with the final CR specifying a dollar amount of $6.889 billion for Head Start. In FY2008, appropriations for Head Start totaled $6.889 billion, slightly higher than the previous year. The appropriations process extended into the fiscal year, with temporary funding provided until the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 was signed into law on December 26, 2007. Funding levels in the act were subject to a 1.747% across-the-board reduction. In FY2008, appropriations for Head Start totaled $6.889 billion, with funding levels subject to an across-the-board reduction of 1.747%. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported a bill for Labor, HHS, and Education departments, which was later approved by the House but vetoed by the President. In November 2007, President Bush vetoed H.R. 3043, a bill for Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations. An attempt to override the veto failed in the House. In December, H.R. 2764 became the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008, with a 1.747% across-the-board cut to most programs. The funding levels for various programs were approved with a 1.747% across-the-board cut. The President's proposed budget for FY2009 included increases for some programs like Head Start and decreases for others like the Social Services Block Grant. The budget proposes a $500 million decrease for the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) and plans to eliminate the SSBG entirely in FY2010. Additionally, the Administration suggests eliminating the Even Start program and funding for Early Childhood Educator Professional Development in FY2009."
