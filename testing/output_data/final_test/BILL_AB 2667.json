    "title": "AB 2667",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Unruh Civil Rights Act in California ensures that individuals cannot be deprived of their rights through involuntary waivers. Contracts to waive these rights must be voluntary, not coerced. Section 51 of the Civil Code is amended to establish the Unruh Civil Rights Act. The Unruh Civil Rights Act in California, also known as Section 51, guarantees equal rights for all individuals regardless of sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sexual orientation, citizenship, primary language, or immigration status in all business establishments. This act does not grant any special privileges based on the mentioned characteristics. The Unruh Civil Rights Act in California ensures equal rights for all individuals in business establishments, regardless of various characteristics. The act does not require additional construction beyond what is mandated by other laws, and defines \"disability\" and \"genetic information\" for clarity. Genetic information includes genetic tests of individuals and their family members, as well as the manifestation of diseases in family members. It does not include information about an individual's sex or age. (4) \"Religion\" encompasses all aspects of religious belief, observance, and practice.\n(5) \"Sex\" includes pregnancy, childbirth, medical conditions related to pregnancy, gender identity, and gender expression.\n(6) \"Sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sexual orientation, citizenship, primary language, or immigration status\" includes perceptions of characteristics within these categories or association with someone who has these characteristics. (7) \"Sexual orientation\" is defined as in Section 12926 of the Government Code. Violating the Americans with Disabilities Act also violates this section. Discrimination based on immigration status required by federal law is not a violation. No requirement for services or documents in a language other than English, except as required by other laws. A person cannot force another person to give up any legal rights or remedies as a condition of a contract. They also cannot refuse to provide goods or services based on the other person's refusal to waive legal rights. Any waiver of legal rights or remedies for a violation must be voluntary, in writing, and not a condition of a contract for goods or services. This does not affect any legal rights that cannot be waived under state or federal law. Any waiver of legal rights, penalties, remedies, forums, or procedures for a violation of this section required as a condition of a contract for goods or services is deemed involuntary, unconscionable, against public policy, and unenforceable. The burden of proving that a waiver was knowing and voluntary falls on the person seeking to enforce it. This applies to agreements entered into on or after January 1, 2017. (7) A court may award reasonable attorney's fees to a plaintiff enforcing rights under this section. (8) If any provision of this section is held invalid, it will not affect other provisions that can still be enforced. (j) This section does not prohibit voluntary arbitration."
