    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Suspend Brazil GSP Act\". Congress finds that there are over 50 cases of children wrongfully removed to Brazil in violation of the Hague Convention, including David Goldman's son Sean who has been unable to return to the United States since 2004. Bianchi Ribeiro Goldman took Sean to Brazil in 2004. Mr. Goldman filed for Sean's immediate return to the United States under the Hague Convention. The Brazilian court refused to return Sean, despite acknowledging he was a habitual resident of the United States. On August 22, 2008, Mrs. Goldman passed away in Brazil, leaving Sean without a mother and separated from his biological father in the United States. Instead of returning Sean to his father David, Mrs. Goldman's second husband, Joao Paulo Lins e Silva, petitioned for custody rights over Sean. Mr. Goldman filed an application under the Hague Convention for Sean's return, and on June 1, 2009, a federal court judge in Brazil ordered Sean to be returned to his father in the United States. The court ordered Mr. Goldman to have full custody of Sean after a 30-day adaptation period in the United States. A Brazilian Supreme Court justice suspended the order, causing potential delays in the case and hindering the return of abducted children to the United States. Brazil received duty-free status for imports totaling $2.75 billion under the Generalized System of Preferences program in 2008. The purpose of this Act is to ensure the return of wrongfully held children to the United States in accordance with the Hague Convention, and to emphasize Brazil's obligation to abide by the Convention. Suspension of application of Generalized System of Preferences for Brazil. The President must notify the World Trade Organization of the suspension of duty-free treatment for Brazil within 7 days of the enactment of the Act. Within 30 days, the President must suspend the application of Generalized System of Preferences for Brazil, with the option to waive this if it is in the national interests of the United States. The President also has the authority to reinstate duty-free treatment. The President may reinstate duty-free treatment for Brazil under the Generalized System of Preferences if certain conditions related to international child abduction cases are met. The law enforcement system of Brazil is meeting its obligations under the Hague Convention regarding international child abduction cases involving children from the United States. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. This section defines \"appropriate congressional committees\" as specific committees in the House of Representatives and Senate, and \"Generalized System of Preferences\" as duty-free treatment for eligible articles from developing countries under the Trade Act of 1974."
