    "content": "Three royalty debates may be revived in the 114th Congress: increasing the statutory minimum rate for onshore federal oil and gas leases, enacting revenue sharing laws for Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) leases, and charging a royalty on hardrock locatable minerals produced on federal public domain lands. The onshore royalty rate has been at 12.5% since 1920, while offshore leases currently range from 12.5% to 18.75%. There is currently no royalty on locatable minerals from public domain lands, but a 5% gross revenue royalty on minerals from acquired federal lands. The federal government imposes a 5% gross revenue royalty on minerals extracted from acquired federal lands, including those from National Forests in some midwestern states. Revenue sharing from OCS leases is governed by the Gulf of Mexico Energy and Security Act, with Gulf coastal states collecting a percentage of leasing revenues. Coastal states also receive a share of leasing revenues from offshore leases within 3 miles of their boundaries. In FY2014, coastal states received about $38 million out of nearly $2.2 billion in total state disbursements. Oil and natural gas production on federal lands contribute 5% and 13% to total U.S. production, respectively. The volume and value of hardrock minerals produced on federal lands is unclear, but estimates have been made by various sources. Federal revenues from energy and mineral leases have ranged from $8.1 billion to $24.1 billion during the 10-year period from FY2004 to FY2013, with changing oil and gas prices being significant factors in revenue fluctuations. Changing prices for oil and gas are key factors in revenue swings. House and Senate bills in the 113th Congress proposed raising the minimum royalty rate on federal leases. This report serves as a primer on royalty issues likely to be faced in the 114th Congress. Minerals are an exhaustible resource, and miners must decide when to produce to consider the value of foregone future production. Miners must consider the value of foregone future production and explore for new minerals to replace those extracted. Mineral royalties are payments to resource owners based on production or income. Royalties can significantly impact mining operation costs and investment decisions. Various income-based royalties are applied to oil, gas, and hardrock mining on private and state-owned lands to generate revenue for society's needs. The federal government aims to generate revenue from mining operations on federal lands while considering the impact on the mining industry. Mining companies seek stable payment abilities and worry about how an increase in royalty rates could affect their cost structure. Balancing revenue generation with maintaining a viable mining industry and meeting environmental concerns is crucial. The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 governs oil and gas development on federal lands, with leasing auctions and activities managed by the Bureau of Land Management. Competitive and noncompetitive bidding processes are authorized for exploration and production leases, with rental rates starting at $1.50 per acre for the first five years. Revenue from onshore leasing is collected and disbursed by ONRR. The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 governs oil and gas development on federal lands, with leasing auctions and activities managed by the Bureau of Land Management. Rental rates start at $1.50 per acre for the first five years, then increase to $2.00 per acre until production commences or the lease expires. Royalty payments are based on the value of production. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 includes provisions governing energy development on federal lands. There is precedent for raising federal oil and gas lease royalty rates, with past increases by Interior Secretaries under different administrations. The federal onshore royalty rates for oil and gas are lower compared to state and private sector rates, with most states having a minimum rate of 12.5% but actual rates ranging from 16.67% to 25%. Private sector rates are typically around 18.75%. While the low federal royalty rate may not result in significant underpayment by the industry, higher rates could generate substantial revenue for states. This lower rate is seen as an incentive to attract industry investment and balance the lengthy permit application process. The federal onshore royalty rates for oil and gas are lower compared to state and private sector rates. Secretary Salazar increased the OCS new lease rate to 18.75% to spur technical change and innovations for deepwater drilling. Production in the OCS has fluctuated over the past 10 years but was lower in FY2013 than FY2004. One of the biggest deterrents to federal land development for oil and gas may be the lengthy and cumbersome permitting process, especially when compared to private lands. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 aimed to expedite oil and gas development on public lands, but some critics believe the permitting is now too fast without adequate environmental review. Additionally, there may be better prospects on private land. Onshore oil and gas exploration is more active on private and state lands than on federal lands. Despite lower costs and high prices, federal oil production is not proportional to its reserves. Natural gas production on federal leases has declined, accounting for 21% of total U.S. reserves. Lawmakers may push for higher royalty rates on federal lands. The Administration is considering raising the onshore royalty rate above the statutory minimum of 12.5%, with suggestions to increase it to as high as 18.75%. The possibility of a graduated rate increase over a five-year period for new leases is also being discussed. Factors such as improved technology, higher prices, and a more efficient permitting process are being evaluated to justify a higher rate. Lower royalty rates for federal onshore leases may be necessary to maintain interest in federal lands. An increase in royalty rates for federal oil and gas leases could impact high-cost marginal producers negatively. Two bills introduced in the 113th Congress aimed to raise the statutory rate from 12.5% to 18.75%. New royalty revenue sharing proposals focus on allocating more revenues to coastal states with offshore leases. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) of 1953 governs the leasing of OCS lands, ensuring environmental protection and revenue return to the federal government. The Secretary of the Interior submits five-year leasing programs specifying time, location, and size of areas. The offshore leasing system is managed by three agencies: BOEM, BSEE, and Office of Natural Resources Revenue. There are two revenue sharing systems for federal oil and gas leases, one for onshore and one for offshore leases. The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 governs revenue sharing for onshore federal energy and mineral resources, with states typically receiving 50% of revenues collected. Alaska, however, receives 90% of revenues from federal leases. The Bureau of Land Management administers the onshore mineral leasing program, contributing to the Reclamation Fund for water and irrigation projects in western states. Wyoming and New Mexico are major contributors to the Fund. The funding from mineral leasing revenue, mainly from Wyoming and New Mexico, is used for high-value projects to meet water needs and address climate change challenges. The U.S. Treasury receives 10% of onshore mineral leasing receipts annually, which are used to maintain infrastructure and mitigate environmental impacts. States use these revenues to support school systems and as substitutes for private taxes due to the tax-exempt status of federal property. The centralized offshore revenue system provides the U.S. Treasury with a significant portion of its energy and mineral leasing revenue. Coastal states receive a small percentage of revenue from federal offshore leases, with a modified approach under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act in 2006. Beginning in FY2017, Gulf producing states will receive 37.5% of revenues from selected leases. The Gulf producing states receive 37.5% of revenues from offshore leases, with an annual cap of $500 million. The Land and Water Conservation Fund gets 12.5% of revenues, and the U.S. Treasury receives 50%. Offshore revenues are allocated to coastal states, LWCF, National Historic Preservation Fund, and the Treasury. States receive 27% of OCS receipts closest to the shore. Proposals have been made to use OCS revenue receipts to provide support directly to all states that have oil and gas drilling and development off their coasts, similar to the allocation under the onshore system. Advocates of greater OCS revenue sharing argue that projects in affected coastal states funded from OCS revenues would benefit the national economy. States argue for a greater share of OCS revenues to mitigate environmental impacts and support offshore oil and gas infrastructure, including roads, pipelines, and conservation of coastal ecosystems. The economic interests of states affected by offshore oil and gas development are supported by firms paying royalties to the federal government. These payments help cover costs such as hurricane protection, rebuilding efforts, and conservation of barrier islands. Additionally, the industry provides employment opportunities, tax revenue, and support for local economies. States argue that revenues generated by the offshore oil and gas industry may not be sufficient to mitigate impacts and prevent infrastructure erosion. They suggest that the federal Treasury could share revenues with states or impose a user fee to address external costs associated with offshore development. The offshore revenue system does not necessarily need to mirror the onshore system. States argue that offshore oil and gas revenues may not cover costs, proposing a fair revenue system to address impacts. This system could allocate 50% of offshore revenues to states, considering their needs and federal treasury requirements. The General Mining Law of 1872 governs hardrock mineral mining on federal lands. Legislative proposals in the 113th Congress included revenue sharing provisions for offshore oil and gas development, but none were enacted into law. Further analysis is needed to determine the optimal federal support for states' roles in offshore development. The Mining Law of 1872 allows individuals and corporations to stake claims on mineral deposits on public lands, facilitating Western mineral development. Claimants must pay an annual maintenance fee of $155 per claim as of September 1, 2014. Hardrock mining on public lands remains a significant economic activity. Individuals with 10 claims or fewer can file for a waiver of the annual maintenance fee and perform annual assessment work instead. There is also a $37 fee for first-time locators to locate and record a claim. The fees are adjusted every five years based on the Consumer Price Index. Once a mineral deposit is economically recoverable and $500 of development work has been performed, the claim holder can file a patent application to obtain title to surface and mineral rights. A fee of $250 per patent application plus $50 per claim within each application is required. If the patent application is approved, the claimant can purchase surface and mineral rights at a rate of $2.50 per acre for placer claims. The Mining Law allows for the purchase of surface and mineral rights at $2.50 per acre for placer claims and $5 per acre for lode claims. There is no limit on the number of claims a person can locate, no requirement for mineral production, and claims can be held indefinitely. Congress has enacted moratoria on mineral patents since FY1995, but applications meeting certain requirements filed before September 30, 1994, are allowed to proceed. Third-party contractors can process mineral examinations on these applications. The annual one-year moratorium on patenting under the Mining Law continues, causing uncertainty in the industry. Environmentalists are concerned that the moratorium does not address current mining practices' environmental impact. Discussions on royalties, including gross proceeds/net smelter return and net income royalties, are ongoing. A gross proceeds (income) royalty or a net smelter returns royalty is based on revenue minus smelting and transportation costs. It guarantees royalty revenues during production, but could lead to mining only high-quality ore. A net income royalty is based on profitability after subtracting all costs, focusing on the operation's economic rent. A net income royalty is based on profitability after subtracting all costs, focusing on excess profits or rents. It may have less impact on marginal mines but could be difficult to administer due to potential creative accounting practices. The claim-patent system in the mining industry is supported by industry officials who argue that clear land title enhances economic production. Critics view it as a giveaway of publicly owned resources due to low charges and lack of royalties. Critics argue that the current claim-patent system in the mining industry creates land management problems and lacks adequate environmental protection. They believe that many mineral claims are held indefinitely for speculative purposes, while industry officials defend the system by stating that clear land title promotes economic production. Industry officials argue that mineral claims may remain idle until profitable to develop, opposing a leasing system that would give the government control, impose royalties, and retain ownership. The debate focuses on whether to charge royalties for minerals extracted from federal lands, with ongoing discussions on implementing a leasing system with royalties based on prices or retaining the claim-patent system with added royalties. The debate centers on whether to charge royalties for minerals extracted from federal lands, with discussions on implementing a leasing system with royalties based on prices or retaining the claim-patent system with added royalties. Legislation proposals have included a gross income royalty of 8% on new mining claims and 4% on certain existing claims, but these have not been enacted. An Administration proposal suggested a leasing process with a gross proceeds royalty of at least 5% on the value of production for new leases, exempting existing mining claims. The DOI ONRR collects receipts from leasing onshore leasable minerals. Competitive bonus bidding is used for lease sales, with leases awarded to the highest bidder. Rents are charged per acre leased until production starts, and royalties are set at 12.5% of the value of production. The Secretary of the Interior may adjust royalties to promote increased recovery. Permit fees are charged for drilling applications to recover administrative costs. 50% of receipts go to states, 40% to the Reclamation Fund, and 90% to Alaska. 2% of states' share is retained for federal administrative costs. The BLM retains 1% of receipts (1.8% in Alaska) for administrative costs of the leasing program. The remaining 10% goes to the Treasury. Leasing minerals on the Outer Continental Shelf is governed by the OCSLA. Competitive sealed bonus bidding is used for lease sales, with the highest bidder securing the lease with an up-front cash payment. The bid for offshore oil and gas leasing is determined by BOEM based on fair market value. If no bids meet the minimum, the lease is withheld for a later sale. Annual rents, royalties, and permit fees are charged for active leases. Royalty rates range from 12.5% to 18.75% of production value, with the highest rate used in recent sales. The Secretary of the Interior can adjust royalties to promote increased recovery. Up to $900 million annually is allocated to the Land and Water Conservation Fund from receipts. The Land and Water Conservation Fund receives up to $900 million annually from various sources like federal property sales and OCS leasing revenues. The National Historic Preservation Fund is allocated $150 million annually from OCS lease receipts. 27% of receipts from \u00a78(g) common pool lands is permanently appropriated to states. A 1978 OCSLA amendment ensures fair revenue sharing from common pool lands between federal and state jurisdictions. Gulf states like Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas receive 37.5% of receipts from specified federal oil and gas leases, while the National Park Service receives 12.5% for the LWCF Stateside Program. The Coastal Impact Assistance Program allocates $250 million annually for coastal producing states. The General Mining Law of 1872 allows free access for prospecting hardrock minerals on federal lands. Revenues from specified federal oil and gas leases are shared with coastal producing states and political subdivisions based on a formula. Any remaining funds are deposited in the Treasury. The General Mining Law of 1872 allows free access for prospecting hardrock minerals on federal lands. Receipts from hardrock/locatable minerals are generated from fees for locating, maintaining, and patenting claims. Fees are adjusted every five years for inflation. Patenting the claim includes a $250 application fee plus $50 per claim, and a land patent fee of $2.50 or $5.00 per acre. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) charges a land patent fee of $2.50 or $5.00 per acre, depending on the type of claim. BLM retains a portion of the receipts to cover the cost of collections, with any remaining funds deposited in the Treasury."
