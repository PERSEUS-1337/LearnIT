    "content": "The Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act (MDUFMA) of 2002 authorized the FDA to collect fees from the medical device industry to fund device reviews. Medical devices range from simple tools to complex technologies and require FDA approval before marketing in the US. The FDA requires medical devices to obtain approval before marketing in the US. The user fee program supports the FDA's premarket review process, reducing review times and benefiting both industry and patients. The program, modeled after the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, involves negotiation of performance goals between FDA and industry. The medical device user fee program, authorized in five-year increments, was last reauthorized through September 30, 2017, by MDUFA III. This legislation, enacted as part of FDASIA, also reauthorized PDUFA and created new user fee programs for generic and biosimilar drug approvals. MDUFA III included provisions regarding FDA's delegation of activities to third parties. The Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (P.L. 94-295) addressed premarket review of medical devices. User fees to support FDA's premarket review program were first authorized in 2002. MDUFA III reauthorized the program through September 30, 2017, with provisions on FDA's delegation of activities to third parties. User fees were authorized in 2002 to support the FDA's medical device premarket review program. Most medical devices listed with the FDA are exempt from premarket review and do not pay a user fee. About a third of listed medical devices require premarket review and payment of associated fees. Devices are classified based on their risk to the patient. FDA classifies medical devices based on risk to the patient: Class I for low-risk, Class II for medium-risk, and Class III for high-risk. Low-risk and some moderate-risk devices are exempt from premarket review. Manufacturers can use two pathways for moderate and high-risk devices: conducting clinical studies and submitting a premarket approval (PMA) application, or submitting a premarket notification (510(k)). In FY2015, 95% of PMAs accepted for filing were approved by FDA. The 510(k) process involves demonstrating substantial equivalence to a predicate device for FDA clearance. FDA evaluates over 4,000 510(k) notifications and 40 original PMA applications annually, with user fees funding a portion of the review process. Fees collected under MDUFA III in FY2015 funded 35% of the MDUFA program total costs. PMA supplements are fees for significant changes in approved devices. MDUFA II added annual fees for stability. MDUFA II added annual fees, including establishment registration fees and product fees for high-risk devices. It also introduced two application fees - the 30-Day Notice and 513(g) application. The fees were set as a percentage of the PMA fee to ensure a stable revenue stream for the FDA. Under MDUFA III, changes were made to user fees, including increasing the 510(k) fee to 2% of the PMA fee. The PMA fee amount rose to $268,443 in FY2017. The establishment registration fee also increased to $3,872 in FY2016 and FY2017. The total fee revenue for MDUFA III was set at $130,184,348 for FY2017. The MDUFA III total fee revenue for FY2017 was $130,184,348. MDUFA IV proposes changing the 510(k) fee to 3.4% of the PMA fee, with the PMA fee amount set at $294,000 in FY201. MDUFA IV proposes changes to the PMA fee and establishment registration fee amounts, with total fee revenue increasing to $213,687,660 by FY2022. Certain medical devices and manufacturers are exempt from fees, with small businesses paying reduced rates. HDE applications are exempt from user fees, except for establishment fees, and devices for pediatric use are also exempt. The FDA exempts certain entities from fees for premarket approval, such as devices intended solely for pediatric use. State and federal government entities, as well as Indian tribes, are exempt from certain fees unless the device is commercially distributed. Manufacturers are not charged fees for premarket applications for biologics licenses if products are exclusively for further manufacturing use. FDA accredits third parties to conduct initial reviews under a program authorized by Congress. Under the FDA's program authorized by Congress, third parties are accredited to conduct initial reviews of 510(k)s to classify certain devices, aiming to enhance the efficiency of the process. No FDA fee is charged for 510(k) submissions reviewed by accredited third parties, but manufacturers are charged a fee for their services. Small businesses receive fee discounts and exemptions based on their gross receipts. The MDUFA IV proposal continues efforts to improve the third-party review program. The FDA offers fee reductions and exemptions for small device companies based on their gross receipts. Small businesses with annual gross sales under $30 million are exempt from fees for their first PMA. Companies with sales under $100 million pay reduced fees for certain submissions. FDA can grant waivers or fee reductions for PMAs in the interest of public health. The FDA offers fee reductions and exemptions for small device companies based on their gross receipts. Small businesses with annual gross sales under $30 million are exempt from fees for their first PMA. Companies with sales under $100 million pay reduced fees for certain submissions. FDA can grant waivers or fee reductions for PMAs in the interest of public health. The fee waiver is intended for laboratory developed test (LDT) manufacturers and will sunset at the end of MDUFA III. MDUFA IV proposal includes reducing the fee paid by small businesses to 25% of the standard fee and establishing a fee for de novo classification requests at 30% of the PMA fee. The MDUFA IV proposal updates the appropriation trigger to ensure user fees are additive to budget authority appropriations. MDUFA revenue can only be used for activities related to FDA premarket review of PMAs, 510(k)s, and PMA supplements. Fees are available to cover increases in costs for the review process. The MDUFA IV proposal aims to defray increased costs for reviewing device applications and support postmarket surveillance. It will fund the National Evaluation System for Health Technology to improve real-world evidence collection. NEST will enhance treatment decisions and balance safety with device innovation. MDUFA II and III added reporting requirements for the Secretary. The MDUFA III update requires annual fiscal and performance reports for the next five fiscal years to be submitted to specific committees. It includes provisions for streamlined hiring of FDA employees and using user fees to enhance scientific review capacity. Under MDUFA III, FDA will enhance scientific review capacity by hiring reviewers and using external experts. User fees will support management training, MDUFA III training, Reviewer Certification Program, and specialized training for staff. FDA will improve its IT system for real-time submission status updates. Booz Allen Hamilton was hired to assess the medical device review process and made priority recommendations in December 2013. In December 2013, a report made priority recommendations for improving review time. A final report in June 2014 detailed additional recommendations. CDRH published a Plan of Action in December 2014 to address Phase 1 recommendations. An independent assessment will be conducted under MDUFA IV to evaluate FDA's implementation of recommendations. Phase I will evaluate MDUFA III recommendations, while Phase II will assess the medical device premarket review program for efficiencies. The MDUFA agreement focuses on FDA's commitment to timely review of medical device submissions like PMAs and 510(k)s. Performance goals are set for each submission type annually. Programs aim to reduce decision time. FDA and applicants share responsibility for meeting goals. Quarterly meetings with industry track progress. Under MDUFA IV proposal, FDA continues quarterly meetings with industry to discuss progress in meeting performance goals for reviewing medical device submissions. Total review time for a device includes FDA handling time and sponsor's response time. The time spent in the 510(k) review process has decreased since FY2010. In FY2010, the time spent in the 510(k) review process peaked, with FDA reviewers often needing to request additional information from device sponsors due to incomplete submissions. The percentage of sponsors receiving an AI letter on the first FDA review cycle remained stable between FY2010 and FY2016. Quality issues mainly revolved around incomplete or inconsistent device descriptions. If a complete response is not provided to the AI letter, a second AI letter may be sent in the second FDA review cycle. In FY2010, 35% of 510(k)s received an AI letter in the second FDA review cycle, decreasing to 6% in FY2016. The AI letter allows device sponsors to respond and potentially clear the product, avoiding FDA rejection. FDA reviewers often request additional information through an AI Letter from PMA device sponsors due to incomplete or poor quality submissions. In FY2010 and FY2016, a high percentage of PMA sponsors received an AI letter on the first FDA review cycle. Medical device user fees have been increasing and accounted for 42% of FDA's total FY2016 program level, compared to 15% in FY2005. User fees covered 71% of PDUFA program total costs in FY2015. The FDA collects MDUFA fees annually and outlines the reauthorization process in FFDCA Section 738A. This involves consultation with various stakeholders before negotiations with industry. Public input is requested, and monthly discussions with advocacy groups are held during negotiations. The FDA reauthorization process for MDUFA fees involves consultations with stakeholders, negotiations with industry, public input, and posting meeting minutes on the FDA website. The negotiations for MDUFA IV involved four industry trade associations and began in September 2015, with 13 meetings held. The FDA engaged with various stakeholders, including industry trade associations and non-industry groups like health care professional associations and patient advocacy organizations, to discuss the establishment of NEST and the incorporation of patient perspectives into the medical device review process. Regular participants in these meetings included the National Health Council, Pew Charitable Trusts, the American College of Cardiology, and other organizations. FDA announced progress on these discussions on August 22, 2016. FDA reached an agreement with the medical device industry on proposed recommendations for the reauthorization of the medical device user fee program. The draft agreement authorizes FDA to collect $999.5 million in user fees over five years, a 68% increase from the previous agreement. The funding will support premarket device review and the collection of real-world evidence. User fee revenues will also support the National Evaluation System for Health Technology (NEST). The MDUFA IV package is available on the FDA website. The MDUFA IV package, including proposed changes and performance goals, is available on the FDA website. A public meeting was held to discuss recommendations for reauthorization of MDUFA, with materials from the meeting also posted online."
