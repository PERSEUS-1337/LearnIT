    "content": "The report focuses on precision-guided munitions (PGMs) used by the U.S. military, with increased funding requested for these weapons in the coming years. Congress plays a key role in approving or modifying the Department of Defense's proposals for PGMs, which pose oversight issues. Precision-guided munitions (PGMs) used by the U.S. military pose oversight issues for Congress. Key issues include procurement quantities, stockpile assessments, production capacity, development timelines, supply chain security, affordability, and emerging factors. PGMs offer advantages such as range and efficiency in combat, but cost is a main disadvantage. PGMs encompass air- and ship-launched missiles, multiple rockets, and guided bombs. Precision-guided munitions (PGMs) utilize various guidance systems like GPS, laser, and INS to enhance accuracy to less than 3 meters. They have revolutionized air attack operations, allowing for multiple targets to be hit with minimal collateral damage. PGMs were first developed in the 1940s, improving accuracy significantly compared to previous methods. Barry Watts developed guidance systems to improve weapon accuracy during World War II, but they were not fully implemented due to technological challenges and high costs. These systems used television signals and required a chase aircraft for control. In the 1950s and 1960s, the DOD continued to develop precision-guided munitions (PGMs), with laser-guided bombs gaining popularity during the Vietnam War. By 1973, the U.S. military had used over 10,500 laser-guided bombs, with high success rates. In the 1970s and 1980s, all military services developed guided missiles. During the 1970s and 1980s, military services developed guided missiles and laser-guided bombs gained prominence during Operation Desert Storm in 1991. PGMs represented 6% of munitions used during the campaign, striking critical targets and reducing combat sorties. Recent operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria show increasing reliance on PGMs, with nearly 139,000 weapons used in the Middle East since 2014. Counter-IS operations used over 28,000 weapons in 2015, 30,700 in 2016, and peaked in 2017. The campaign used a significant number of weapons, with a peak of 39,500 weapons in 2017, mostly precision-guided munitions (PGMs) like JDAMs and Hellfire Missiles. The proliferation of anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) systems is expected to enhance the operational effectiveness of PGMs, especially against sophisticated air defenses of peer competitors like China and Russia. The proliferation of anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) systems, such as the S-300PMU, S-400, HQ-9, DF-21D, DF-26, and 3M-54 Kaliber missiles, poses a significant threat to U.S. naval forces. These systems have reported ranges exceeding 1,000 nautical miles, forcing U.S. ships and aircraft to engage targets at long ranges to avoid danger. Analysts debate the effectiveness and risk posed by these missiles, with some suggesting that aircraft carriers would avoid entering their engagement zones in combat situations. The S-400 (SA-21) presents risks to aircraft at ranges of up to 215 nautical miles. Some analysts argue that U.S. forces would increase operational risk at ranges over 500 nautical miles. The Paveway guidance kits attach to unguided bombs to enable tactical aircraft to deliver precision strikes. The Paveway guidance kits, used in the Vietnam War, enable aircraft like the F-4 Phantom and A-6 Intruder to deliver precise munitions. Paveway has undergone upgrades, including Paveway III and Paveway IV, with the latter adding satellite guidance for improved accuracy. The U.S. military primarily uses Paveway II and Paveway III kits, while Paveway IV is used by foreign militaries. Raytheon has produced over 350,000 Paveway kits, with Lockheed Martin producing an additional 200,000 kits. Funding for Paveway procurement is in the Air Force's General Purpose Bomb line item, with exports to over 30 countries for Paveway II kits and at least 9 countries for Paveway III kits. Paveway IV is utilized by the United Kingdom. JDAM kits, developed in the 1980s, are used to modify unguided bombs with GPS guidance, creating weapons like GBU-31/32/38 with a range of 13 nautical miles. They have an accuracy of within 3 meters and were first used operationally in 1997 during Operation Allied Freedom in Kosovo. JDAMs have been integrated with all U.S. military branches since their development. The JDAM kits were first used operationally in 1997 during Operation Allied Freedom in Kosovo by a B-2 Spirit bomber. They have received upgrades including a laser guidance system in addition to GPS guidance, allowing them to strike both moving and fixed targets. Boeing announced plans to develop a \"powered\" JDAM as a low-cost alternative to cruise missiles. The DOD has procured over 371,000 JDAM kits since 1998 and plans to acquire an additional 75,000 between FY2020 and FY2024. The Air Force originally projected procuring 270,000 JDAM kits, with production peaking at 30,000 kits prior to 2007 before declining until 2015. The production of JDAM kits peaked at 30,000 before declining until 2015. Increased operational use in Iraq and Syria led to reduced stockpiles, prompting increased procurement from FY2016 to FY2020. The DOD plans to reduce JDAM procurement in future years, with exports to 26 countries. The Small Diameter Bomb, GBU-39, is a 250-pound guided bomb. The Small Diameter Bomb, GBU-39, is a 250-pound guided bomb designed for precision strikes using GPS and laser guidance. It was developed by the Air Force in response to the need for a smaller bomb to reduce collateral damage. The bomb reached initial operating capability in 2006 with a range of approximately 40 nautical miles. Additionally, a second version, the GBU-53 SDB II, was developed with added laser guidance for striking both fixed and moving targets. The Small Diameter Bomb II (SDB II) uses advanced technology like Link 16 and infrared guidance for precision strikes. Development started in 2005, with initial operating capability declared in 2019. The Air Force has procured over 28,000 SDBs for $1.7 billion from FY2005 to FY2019. Both the Air Force and Navy requested over 7,000 SDBs in FY2020 and plan to procure more in the following years. The procurement of SDB II began in FY2018, with plans to purchase over 10,500 SDB IIs from FY2021 to FY2024 for $1.6 billion. The Hellfire missile, introduced in the early 1970s, has evolved with upgrades over the years. It was first used on the AH-64 Apache in 1982, with a range of 4.3 nautical miles. The Marine Corps also adopted Hellfire missiles for their attack helicopters. Upgrades included infrared sensors and warheads for targeting small boats. The missile was later integrated with unmanned aerial vehicles like the MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper for strike capabilities, making it a preferred munition for operations in the Middle East. The Hellfire missile, widely used in the Middle East, is being replaced by the Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM). The Army and Marine Corps plan to transition to JAGM, but the timeline is unclear. Over 71,500 Hellfire missiles were procured by the DOD from 1998 to 2018, costing $7.2 billion. In FY2019, nearly $484 million was allocated for around 6,000 missiles. In FY2019, Congress allocated $484 million for around 6,000 Hellfire missiles. For FY2020, DOD requested $730 million for 9,000 Hellfire missiles and plans to purchase 13,100 missiles at a cost of $1.2 billion between FY2021 and FY2024. The Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM) is designed to replace Hellfire, TOW, and Maverick missiles, with improved target acquisition and discrimination capabilities. JAGM has a maximum effective range of 8.6 nautical miles when launched from a helicopter and 15.1 nautical miles when launched from fixed-wing aircraft. The Joint Air-to-Surface Strike Missile (JAGM) achieved initial operating capability in 2019 and has been integrated on various platforms including the AH-64E Apache and AH-1Z Super Cobra attack helicopters. The missile is also expected to be integrated on other platforms such as the FA-18E/F Super Hornet, MQ-1C Grey Eagle, MH-60M Defensive Air Penetrator, MH-60S Seahawk, F-35 Lightning II, and P-8 Poseidon. The Air Force has started procuring JAGMs but has not disclosed the platforms that will employ the missile. JAGM entered low-rate initial production in FY2017, with all three services procuring it. The DOD has requested over $339 million for FY2020 and plans to procure approximately 4,600 additional missiles through FY2024 for about $1.5 billion. The AGM-158A Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) was developed in the mid-1990s as a stealthy cruise missile for striking targets in heavily defended airspace. It is 14-foot-long, 2,250-pound missile that can be carried internally on various aircraft. The JASSM has a range of over 200 nautical miles and initial operating capability was declared in 2005. An extended range version, the AGM-158B JASSM-ER, was developed in 2004 with a range of 500 nautical miles. The JASSM-ER range increased to 500 nautical miles, achieving full operating capability in 2018 on the F-15E Strike Eagle. The Air Force plans to procure 7,200 missiles, with over 4,000 already acquired. Japan and Poland are interested in acquiring JASSM-ERs. Production is set to increase to 550 missiles per year, aiming for a total inventory of 10,000 missiles. An $818 million contract was awarded in February 2020 for the latest version of the JASSM-ER. The new production contract for the JASSM-ER missile includes 790 missiles over two lots, with 40 missiles designated for foreign military sales. The LRASM, based on the JASSM body, uses advanced sensors for guidance and has garnered interest from Japan. The Air Force plans to procure up to 410 LRASM missiles, a significant increase from the initial estimate of 110. In FY2020, DOD is at maximum production rate for JASSM-ER and LRASM missiles. The Air Force plans to increase JASSM production to 500 missiles per year and up to 96 LRASMs. DOD projects reduced procurement quantities of JASSM-ER but maintains LRASM procurement through FY2024. The Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile targets enemy air defenses, replacing the HARM missile due to operational deficiencies. AARGM, the Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile, addressed deficiencies in the HARM missile during Operation Iraqi Freedom. It features a new solid-propellant rocket motor, improved range, GPS inertial navigation, and advanced sensors. AARGM became operational in 2012 and is integrated into various aircraft. While the Navy is modifying its AARGM stockpile, the Air Force has not requested modifications since FY2016. The United States has spent over $5.4 billion on procuring more than 42,000 GMLRS rockets since 1998. The DOD plans to spend an additional $4.3 billion on nearly 29,000 GMLRS rockets between FY2021 and FY2024. GMLRS has a 200-pound unitary warhead and a maximum range of 70 kilometers, and it is used by both the Army and the Marine Corps. The DOD plans to spend $4.3 billion on 29,000 GMLRS rockets between FY2021 and FY2024. GMLRS is also being exported to Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, Poland, and Romania, as well as to development partners like France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom. ATACMS is a 610-millimeter rocket with GPS guidance, upgraded in 1991 to target armored and hardened targets, with a new seeker developed in 2016 to target ships. The Army plans to retire the ATACMS rocket and replace it with the new Precision Strike Missile, which has a longer range and can launch two missiles in a pod. The DOD is procuring 240 ATACMS missiles in FY2020 for $340 million, with plans to procure 492 missiles for $611 million between FY2021 and FY2024. The PrSM is designed to be launched from multiple rocket launcher systems and has an anti-jam GPS antenna. The Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) is planned to replace the ATACMS rocket with a longer range of over 400 kilometers and anti-jam GPS antenna. The Army tested the PrSM in 2019 and plans for early operational service in FY2023. The Tomahawk cruise missile, developed in the 1970s, has received upgrades and is currently in service. The Tomahawk Block IV cruise missile, in service since the 1970s, has undergone upgrades including GPS guidance and satellite datalink communications. It was first used in Operation Desert Storm, with over 1,600 missiles used in various conflicts. The Navy has spent $5.87 billion on 4,984 Tomahawk missiles from FY1998 to FY2018. The Navy plans to procure 90 missiles in FY2020 and FY2021, with no additional procurement planned for FY2022-FY2024. The Navy has no plans to procure additional missiles in FY2022-FY2024. They project requesting $819 million for additional procurement appropriations. The Standard Missile-6, designed in 2004, is used for anti-aircraft and anti-surface missions, as well as anti-ballistic missile missions. It receives targeting information from AEGIS radars and the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye. SM-6 entered full rate production in FY2013 and is funded under the Navy's procurement line item 2234 Standard Missile. The DOD increased the requirement for SM-6 missiles to 2,331 and requested $488 million for 125 missiles in FY2020. An additional 615 missiles are projected to be procured between FY2021 and FY2024 at a cost of nearly $2.9 billion. The Naval Strike Missile is an anti-ship, low-observable cruise missile designed to minimize radar detection. The Navy has integrated the NSM on its Littoral Combat Ship, with plans to procure 18 missiles for $38 million and an additional 83 missiles for $166 million through FY2024. Congress may question if DOD's desired quantities of standoff munitions are appropriate due to high demand for precision-guided munitions in current operations. The potential issue of assessing the sufficiency of existing and planned PGM stockpiles, particularly in high-intensity conflict scenarios, has been raised by Congress. This includes concerns about the procurement of munitions like JASSM, LRASM, and AARGM in small quantities despite their potential use rates. Congress has mandated DOD to provide annual reports on munitions inventory and requirements, as well as assess combatant command munitions needs. Additionally, the capacity of the defense industrial base for munitions production is another area of concern. The potential issues for Congress include the defense industrial base's capacity for building precision-guided munitions (PGMs) during high-intensity conflicts, supply chain security of PGM components, and concerns about the development timeline of PGMs. These issues are part of assessing the sufficiency of PGM stockpiles and the overall readiness of the defense industrial base. Congress may be concerned about the development timeline and affordability of DOD's plans for procuring precision-guided munitions (PGMs) compared to adversary A2/AD capabilities. China and Russia have advanced systems, raising questions about DOD's ability to match or exceed their weapons systems. Cost-effectiveness and the pace of developing new systems are key considerations amidst finite DOD resources and competing program priorities. The cost-effectiveness of precision-guided munitions (PGMs) compared to adversary capabilities is a concern for Congress. Emerging factors like the U.S. withdrawal from the INF treaty and new military operational concepts may impact DOD's PGM programs. Appendix A and B provide details on prior year procurement by service and program, respectively."
