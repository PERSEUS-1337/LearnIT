    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Military Operations in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Limitation Act of 1999\". Key findings are also included in the Act. The Congress finds that there is consideration for deploying US ground forces in Yugoslavia as part of a NATO operation in Kosovo, which could result in a long-term commitment and significant costs. The Secretary of Defense has previously opposed such a deployment. The deployment of US ground forces in Bosnia has already cost $10 billion and been extended past previous withdrawal dates, indicating that a similar deployment in Yugoslavia for peacekeeping in Kosovo would be more costly and prolonged. This would also strain military readiness. The military operations against Yugoslavia have depleted inventories of essential armaments and cost hundreds of millions of dollars, with projected costs exceeding $5 billion by the end of fiscal year 1999. The military operations against Yugoslavia have depleted armament inventories and cost over $5 billion by the end of fiscal year 1999. Concerns have been raised about the lack of a US aircraft carrier presence in the western Pacific region and the impact on national security missions, including Operation Northern Watch over Iraq. Congress has shown significant concern about the possible deployment of US ground forces to the region. The President's report to Congress on the anticipated costs, funding sources, schedule, and exit strategy for additional US Armed Forces deployed to Yugoslavia, Albania, or Macedonia indicates uncertainty about the duration of NATO operations and the exit strategy depending on events in Belgrade. Authorization by Congress is required for the introduction of US Armed Forces into hostilities. The President's report to Congress highlights the uncertainty surrounding the duration and exit strategy of NATO operations in Yugoslavia. Congress authorization is needed for the introduction of US ground forces in the conflict in Kosovo, as national security interests do not warrant their deployment for peacemaking or peacekeeping purposes. SEC. 3 prohibits the use of Department of Defense funds for deploying US ground forces in Yugoslavia without specific authorization by law, except for missions to rescue US military personnel or citizens."
