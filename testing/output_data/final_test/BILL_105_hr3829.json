The Act is titled the \"Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998\" and emphasizes the shared responsibility of national security between Congress and the President. It highlights the need for Congress to serve as a check on the Executive Branch, including the Intelligence Community, without requiring prior authorization for disclosures. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 emphasizes the importance of employees reporting wrongdoing within the Intelligence Community to Congress. There is a perceived risk of reprisal for reporting, which may hinder the flow of necessary information to the intelligence committees. To address this issue, a new procedure should be established to allow employees and contractors to report to Congress while protecting classified information.

The Director must forward complaints from the Inspector General to the intelligence committees within 7 days. If the complaint is not transmitted accurately, employees can contact the committees directly after notifying the Director. The Inspector General must inform employees of any actions taken on their complaints within three days. An 'urgent concern' includes serious issues related to intelligence activities but not public policy disagreements or false statements to Congress. The curr_chunk discusses false statements or withholding information from Congress regarding intelligence activities, reprisals against employees reporting urgent concerns, and defines the term 'intelligence committees'. It also mentions actions taken by the Director or Inspector General. The curr_chunk discusses additional provisions related to Inspectors General of the Intelligence Community, including employees of certain agencies and contractors intending to report complaints or information to Congress. Employees of certain agencies and contractors can report complaints or information to Congress regarding urgent concerns by contacting the appropriate Inspector General or designee as specified by the President.

The Inspector General must determine credibility within 60 days and transmit the complaint to the head of the establishment.

Employees can contact the intelligence committees directly if the Inspector General fails to transmit their complaint accurately. The employee must inform the head of the establishment and follow their guidance on contacting the intelligence committees securely. The Inspector General is required to notify the employee of each step in the process. The Inspector General must promptly inform employees of any actions taken regarding their complaints or information. An \"urgent concern\" includes serious issues like abuse, violations of law, or false statements to Congress related to intelligence activities. The term 'intelligence committees' refers to specific committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate. Actions taken under this section are not subject to judicial review. A conforming amendment was made to another section of the Act. In a conforming amendment, the term 'intelligence committees' in the House of Representatives and the Senate is modified by striking \"or 8E\" and inserting \"8E, or 8H\"."
