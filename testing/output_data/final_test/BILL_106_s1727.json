    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Palace of the Governors Annex Act\" and pertains to the construction of the Palace of the Governors Annex in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Congress finds that the United States has a rich Hispanic legacy in politics, government, economic development, and cultural expression. The Palace of the Governors in Santa Fe, built in 1610, is the oldest continuously occupied public building in the continental U.S. and a National Historic Landmark. The Museum of New Mexico has worked to protect and promote Southwestern, Hispanic, and Native American arts and crafts since its creation. The Palace of the Governors in Santa Fe houses the history division of the Museum of New Mexico, which has an extensive collection of Spanish Colonial paintings, pre-Columbian art, and historic artifacts including helmets and armor worn by conquistadors. The Museum of New Mexico in Santa Fe houses a collection of Spanish Colonial paintings, pre-Columbian art, and historic artifacts, including grants, real property boundaries, the Columbus Railway Station clock stopped during Pancho Villa's raid, Brigadier General Stephen Watts Kearny's field desk, and over 800,000 other historic items like photographs, guns, costumes, maps, books, and handicrafts. The Palace of the Governors and its contents are part of the Mary C. Skaggs Centennial Collection of America's Treasures. The Palace and the Segesser Hide paintings are national treasures declared by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Time is crucial for constructing an annex to the Palace for exhibiting and storing the collection due to inadequate facilities endangering its existence and preservation, especially with the 400th anniversary of the Palace's continuous occupation in 2010. The Palace of the Governors is part of the Mary C. Skaggs Centennial Collection of America's Treasures and is in need of an annex for exhibiting and storing the collection. A grant will be provided by the Secretary to cover 50% of the final design costs. The Office will pay 50% of the costs for the design, construction, management, inspection, furnishing, and equipping of the Annex. To receive a grant, the Office must submit architectural blueprints and enter into a memorandum of understanding with the Secretary. The memorandum of understanding will require the Office to award the construction contract through a competitive bidding process and specify a completion date for the Annex. The non-Federal share of costs for the final design, construction, management, inspection, furnishing, and equipping of the Annex may be in cash or in kind, including land, art collections, equipment, or services. It should include contributions and expenditures made by the State for the Palace of the Governors or the Annex, such as design, land acquisition, library renovations, and conservation efforts. The funds received under a grant awarded for the Annex must be used for its design, construction, management, furnishing, and equipment. $15,000,000 is authorized for this purpose, subject to availability of appropriations. The State must appropriate $8,000,000 for the final design, construction, and equipping of the Annex before January 1, 2010. Other non-Federal sources must provide funds for the remaining 50 percent of the costs. The Senate passed the bill on April 13, 2000."
