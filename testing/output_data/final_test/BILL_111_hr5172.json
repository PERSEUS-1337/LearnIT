    "content": "The \"Instructional Leadership Act of 2009\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The findings section is included in the Act. The Congress recognizes the importance of school principals being instructional leaders with the necessary skills to guide teaching and learning, as outlined in the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. Despite the recognition of instructional leadership's importance, school principals lack adequate training and support in meeting standards in some states and developing standards in others. Licensure processes for principals often do not focus enough on instructional leadership skills. The term \"highly qualified principal\" should include a strong emphasis on instructional leadership in the No Child Left Behind Act. SEC. 3. GRANTS FOR INSTRUCTIONAL LEADERSHIP. Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include competitive grants for instructional leadership. The Secretary will make grants to eligible entities to develop innovative programs and sites for training school principals in instructional leadership skills, including effective instructional practices, school vision development, ongoing professional development for staff, curriculum alignment, teacher evaluation, and student assessment integration. The Secretary will make grants for pilot programs to develop and implement standards of instructional leadership into State principal certification or licensing requirements. Grants will be awarded on a competitive basis to State educational agencies or partnerships to engage community stakeholders in student and school success. The grant awarded under this section lasts for 2 years, with a possible renewal for 2 more years. Eligible entities include State educational agencies, local educational agencies, nonprofit organizations, institutions of higher education, and partnerships or consortia. Recipients must submit a report on the grant's outcomes to the Secretary. The grant recipients must submit a report to the Secretary detailing the results of their funded activities. The Secretary will establish a definition of 'highly-qualified principal' based on these reports, focusing on instructional leadership standards and the need for principals to demonstrate effective teaching and learning leadership skills. To carry out professional development for school leaders, they must engage in various activities like academic study, simulation exercises, self-reflection, mentorship, and internships. They should also lead a professional learning community that uses real-time data to inform instruction and personalized learning for students. $100,000,000 is authorized for this purpose in fiscal year. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 authorizes $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2010 and necessary sums for the following 5 years. A clerical amendment is made to the table of contents. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 authorizes competitive grants for establishing state-of-the-art principal induction programs. The Secretary may grant funds to States and eligible local educational agencies for developing state-of-the-art principal induction programs. Eligible agencies include high-need local educational agencies or partnerships with institutions of higher education, principal organizations, or nonprofit education organizations. Grant recipients must use the funds to create state-of-the-art programs. The grant aims to develop a state-of-the-art principal induction program that provides new principals with extensive mentoring, common meeting time for administrative tasks, and regular observation by experienced mentors in similar schools. The new principal induction program includes observation of master/mentor principals, professional development activities, and feedback on leadership skills. The new principal induction program includes benchmarks for leadership skills, evaluations by multiple evaluators, paid release time for mentor principals, a transition year with reduced workload, and a standards-based assessment for new principals. The text chunk discusses the authorization of appropriations for a program to determine if a principal should advance in the school administration profession. Sec. 2501 authorizes competitive grants for establishing state-of-the-art principal induction programs."
