    "content": "Electronic waste (e-waste) includes obsolete or broken electronic devices like TVs, CPUs, monitors, laptops, printers, and wiring. The high volumes of e-waste generated in the US contain hazardous materials like lead, mercury, and chromium. E-waste disposal is largely unregulated at the federal level, allowing it to be disposed of in landfills or incinerators. Some e-waste is exported overseas, with developing countries in Asia or Africa being major importers due to lax labor and environmental laws. Many countries lack labor and environmental laws to regulate e-waste processing, posing risks to human health and the environment. The United States is not part of the Basel Convention, which governs international waste trade and prohibits exporting hazardous waste without consent. Recently, momentum has developed for domestic legislation in the United States restricting e-waste exports. These restrictions could include a ban similar to the Ban Amendment to the Basel Convention, an e-waste export licensing system, or a quota on e-waste exports. However, these restrictions may conflict with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and could face challenges before a WTO panel. Since the 1980s, the United States has been involved in international agreements regulating hazardous waste exports, but these agreements do not specifically cover e-waste. The US is not a party to the Basel Convention, which governs the international waste trade and has over 170 member countries. Momentum is building for US legislation to restrict e-waste exports, which could face challenges under GATT and before a WTO panel. The Basel Convention, with over 170 member countries, prohibits exporting hazardous wastes without consent. It also imposes obligations like reducing waste generation and controlling waste transportation. The Basel Convention prohibits exporting hazardous wastes without consent and imposes obligations on waste generation and transportation. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade sets maximum tariffs and restricts trade measures. The Ban Amendment on hazardous waste export has not entered into force. Article XI and Article I of the WTO prohibit export restrictions and grant less favorable treatment to products of certain countries. The DSU provides a process for resolving disputes between WTO Members, including consultations and panel reviews. Members must implement panel and Appellate Body decisions if their measures are found inconsistent with WTO obligations. When a defending Member fails to implement a WTO panel or Appellate Body report, the prevailing Member can request negotiations for a compensation agreement. If no agreement is reached, trade sanctions may be imposed, such as suspending tariff concessions owed under a WTO agreement. Article XI:1 of the GATT prohibits quantitative restrictions on exports and imports between WTO Members. This includes measures like embargoes, quotas, and licensing requirements. Only duties, taxes, and charges are allowed to restrict trade. The restriction applies to various government actions, even those not mandated by law. Import or export bans are considered quantitative restrictions under Article XI:1. Export bans or licensing systems on e-waste could violate Article XI:1 of the GATT, which prohibits quantitative restrictions on trade. Such measures are inconsistent with the GATT as they restrict the import or export of certain goods. Few WTO panels have addressed export restrictions, but import bans through compulsory licensing systems have been consistently found to be in violation of the GATT. Import bans through compulsory licensing systems have been found to violate GATT rules. An example is the WTO panel decision in Brazil - Tyres, where laws restricting imports of retreaded tires were deemed inconsistent with GATT. The WTO panel found that a licensing measure in India, which differentiated between importers based on their reasons for importing goods, was inconsistent with GATT rules. The WTO panel found that a licensing system in India, based on distinctions between importers, violated GATT rules by limiting imports and giving unfettered discretion to deny licenses. This is prohibited under Article XI:1 as any form of limitation on imports is not allowed. The WTO panel decision in China \u2013 Raw Materials highlighted that vague criteria for granting licenses can be inconsistent with Article XI:1. China's export licensing system for raw materials was found to give authorities unfettered discretion to deny licenses due to vague requirements, such as the need for a \"complete and accurate\" application. The WTO panel decision in China \u2013 Raw Materials found that China's export licensing system for raw materials allowed authorities to require unspecified documents, leading to uncertainty for applicants and discouraging exports. This discretionary system was deemed to violate Article XI:1 of the GATT. The GATT panel decision in Japan \u2013 Semi-Conductors highlighted that a lengthy license approval process can also limit exports, even without mandatory requirements. Delays in the export licensing process were found to restrain exports, violating Article XI:1. The GATT panel decision in Japan \u2013 Semi-Conductors emphasized that delays in the export licensing process can restrict exports, violating Article XI:1. The increase in license applications due to policy changes led to significant backlogs, causing delays of up to three months in processing applications, which were deemed de facto quantitative restrictions. E-waste export restrictions may violate Article XIII of the GATT, which requires non-discriminatory administration of quantitative restrictions authorized under the GATT. WTO panels may strike down measures not conforming to the principle of most favored nation treatment. Article I of the GATT requires WTO Members to grant the same advantages to all products from other countries as they do to their own products. This includes rules and formalities related to importation and exportation. WTO panels have interpreted this to cover measures directly or indirectly affecting importation, with licensing being considered a prerequisite for importation under this article. Under Article I:1 of the GATT, measures imposing licensing requirements on exports must provide Most Favored Nation (MFN) treatment to goods from WTO Members. An advantage is considered to be conferred if it affects similar products and is not immediately and unconditionally extended to those products. The term \"advantage\" is broadly defined to include any competitive opportunity or commercial status relative to like products destined for different WTO Members, such as variations in import licensing requirements. In the EC \u2013 Bananas III case, the European Union was found to have given an origin-discriminatory advantage to products of certain WTO Members through its licensing requirements. The WTO has found that imposing additional licensing requirements on imports from certain Members can give an origin-discriminatory advantage, even if the measure is origin neutral. Products can be considered \"like\" under Article I:1 even if they have different tariff classifications. WTO panels assess likeness based on characteristics, end-uses, tariff classification, and consumer preferences. Discrimination between imported products that are \"like\" is presumed if the difference in treatment is solely based on their origins. WTO panels have different interpretations of conferring trade advantages on \"like\" products, which must be done unconditionally without discrimination based on origin or destination countries. Conditions attached to advantages should not discriminate between \"like\" products. The curr_chunk discusses how a measure must be unconditionally accorded to all countries without discrimination based on origin or destination. It gives an example of a Canadian measure that discriminated against certain auto imports from WTO Members, violating the MFN principle. The panel found that Canada's import duty exemption for auto imports violated Article I:1 of the WTO agreement by favoring imports from the United States and North America. Similarly, in Indonesia, a measure exempting certain cars from import duties was also deemed inconsistent with Article I:1. The panel ruled that tax advantages in Indonesia discriminated against products from WTO Members based on their origin. If a measure violates a GATT obligation, a Member may seek to justify it by invoking Article XX exceptions, with the defending Member having the burden of proving compliance with the requirements. Article XX of GATT provides potential defenses for measures restricting e-waste exports. Article XX(b) allows measures necessary to protect human, animal, or plant life or health, but imposes a high standard of \"necessity.\" Article XX(g) could also justify export restrictions by relating to the conservation of natural resources. Article XX of GATT provides defenses for e-waste export restrictions. Article XX(b) requires measures to protect life or health, while Article XX(g) relates to conserving natural resources. However, challenges arise if the resources are in another country. The location of protection or conservation is not specified in Article XX(b) or XX(d), but a GATT panel suggested policies for animals outside a country could fall under Article XX(b). The GATT panel suggested that e-waste export restrictions could fall under Article XX(b) to protect human and environmental health. A WTO panel may need to clarify the territorial reach of Article XX(b) to justify measures with extraterritorial effects. The objectives of e-waste export restrictions would aim to preserve lives and health in other countries, distinguishing it from previous cases like dolphins in Tuna II. The GATT panel suggested that e-waste export restrictions could fall under Article XX(b) to protect human and environmental health, with a focus on preserving lives and health in other countries. A WTO panel may need to clarify the territorial reach of Article XX(b) for measures with extraterritorial effects, considering the transboundary flow of air, water, and chemicals in the soil. The Article XX(b) defense requires a Member to demonstrate that a measure restricting e-waste exports is necessary to protect human life or health. The necessity of measures to protect human life or health in e-waste recycling and disposal is examined under Article XX(b) of the WTO. The importance of the values at stake and the contribution to achieving the measure's objective are considered in determining the necessity of the measure. The necessity of measures to protect human life or health in e-waste recycling and disposal is evaluated under Article XX(b) of the WTO. A measure must be apt to make a material contribution to its objective, with a substantial step towards realizing its public health goal. If a less trade restrictive alternative was reasonably available, the initial finding of necessity may be rejected. To qualify as a reasonably available alternative under WTO rules, a policy must be genuine, feasible, and not unduly burdensome for the defending Member. Possible alternatives to measures restricting e-waste exports include increased investments in recycling infrastructure, stimulating domestic demand for e-waste, production restrictions, and participation in international agreements. If these alternatives are identified, the defending Member must show their effectiveness before a WTO panel. The burden shifts to the defending Member to justify policies not equally effective at realizing objectives of challenged export restrictions. Article XX(g) allows GATT-inconsistent measures for conservation of natural resources in conjunction with domestic restrictions. Measures must be primarily aimed at conservation of exhaustible natural resources. Export restraints under Article XX(g) of GATT must be implemented alongside domestic restrictions on the same goods, with comparable burdens on exports and domestic products. This ensures evenhandedness in international trade and conservation measures. GATT inconsistent measure related to conservation must satisfy the Article XX chapeau, which ensures it is not a disguised restriction on trade or discriminatory. Compliance with the chapeau is crucial for balancing Members' policy goals and GATT provisions. A measure must satisfy the Article XX chapeau to ensure it is not a disguised restriction on trade or discriminatory. This involves analyzing the intent behind the measure's application to determine if protectionism is the true motive. Panels may scrutinize the design and effects of the measure to assess its discriminatory impact on foreign industries. The WTO jurisprudence focuses on determining if a measure is a disguised restriction on trade or discriminatory. Panels analyze the intent and effects of the measure to assess its impact on foreign industries. WTO decisions show a preference for measures applied after international negotiations or agreements, disliking unilateral or coercive measures. The Appellate Body's interpretation of discrimination in the context of Article XX chapeau focuses on the application of measures without regard for conditions in importing/exporting countries. Discrimination is assessed for being arbitrary or unjustifiable based on its legitimacy in achieving Article XX objectives. The Appellate Body's interpretation of discrimination in the context of Article XX chapeau focuses on assessing measures for being arbitrary or unjustifiable in achieving objectives. In U.S. \u2013 Gasoline, a regulation prescribing methods for measuring compliance with Clean Air Act's gasoline standards was found discriminatory as it did not satisfy Article XX requirements. The Appellate Body ruled in U.S. \u2013 Gasoline that the Gasoline Rule was discriminatory and arbitrary because the United States failed to explore international cooperation to achieve its objective, making the discrimination illegitimate. This suggests that failure to pursue cooperation renders discriminatory measures unjustifiable. The Appellate Body found that the shrimp import ban was discriminatory and coercive, as it required other countries to adopt the same sea turtle protection policies as the United States. They suggested that an inquiry into the appropriateness of the regulatory program for exporting countries should have been conducted. The Appellate Body criticized the U.S. for not engaging all shrimp exporting Members in negotiations before enforcing the ban, leading to discrimination and unjustifiability. They noted the ban's unilateral nature and lack of international cooperation efforts. The subsequent decision in U.S. \u2013 Shrimp (Article 21.5) required \"serious, good faith efforts\" in negotiations with exporting countries. The United States revised guidelines for shrimp imports after criticism from Malaysia, challenging the adequacy of measures. International negotiations were initiated with Malaysia and other countries, but did not result in agreements. The United States' efforts to address discrimination in shrimp import certification procedures were deemed not \"arbitrary or unjustifiable\" by the WTO. Article XX requires a legitimate reason for imposing burdens on some countries over others in e-waste regulations, with no justification if implemented without diplomatic efforts. WTO could demand repeal or modification of discriminatory e-waste export measures. The United States is facing concerns about exporting hazardous e-waste to developing countries instead of disposing of it domestically. The country is not a party to the Basel Convention, the largest multilateral agreement regulating hazardous waste trade. This could lead to demands from the WTO to repeal or modify discriminatory e-waste export measures. The Basel Convention requires parties to adopt domestic policies to reduce hazardous waste production. An amendment to ban hazardous waste export from Annex VII parties to developing countries has not yet entered into force. Unilateral restrictions on e-waste exports may face challenges in the WTO system due to inconsistency with GATT regulations. Export restrictions to WTO Members must comply with specific regulations outlined in Articles XI:1, XIII:1, and I:1 of the GATT. Exceptions under Article XX may allow for certain export restrictions, but they must meet strict criteria to be justified. E-waste export restrictions must comply with GATT regulations, including Article XX exceptions. Restrictions must be necessary and not imposed without comparable domestic restrictions. Failure to comply may result in WTO-authorized trade sanctions."
