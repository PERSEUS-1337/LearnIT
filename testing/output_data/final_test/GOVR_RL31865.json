    "content": "The Low Income Home Energy Assistance program (LIHEAP) was established in 1981 to provide annual grants to states, tribes, and territories for home energy assistance programs for low-income households. It includes regular funds and emergency contingency funds, with eligibility rules and benefits discussed in the report. The report provides data on household characteristics and benefit levels from HHS. It discusses LIHEAP funds distribution, funding, appropriations, and legislative history. Federal LIHEAP requirements are minimal, allowing states, tribes, territories, and Indian tribes to make important program decisions. The LIHEAP statute outlines 16 assurances for grantees who receive federal funds, governing how energy assistance is provided to low-income households. Grantees must make assurances about the types of energy assistance, who will be served, and how funds will be administered. Funds can be used for heating and cooling expenses, with all state grantees providing heating assistance and some providing cooling assistance. States must reserve funds to assist households with their home energy costs. States must reserve funds to assist households facing energy crises, defined as weather-related emergencies or supply shortages. Assistance is provided to households at risk of losing heating or cooling due to equipment issues, utility shutoff notices, or fuel supply depletion. Funds can also be used for low-cost weatherization projects. Grantees are limited to using 15% of their allotment for weatherization, with a waiver available for up to 25%. Additionally, funds can be used for services to reduce energy assistance needs, such as needs assessment and counseling on energy consumption reduction, limited to 5% of the allotment. Program administration costs are also covered. The LIHEAP funds can be used for program administration, limited to 10% of the allotment. Eligibility is based on income, with households at or below 150% of the federal poverty income guidelines eligible for assistance. States may adopt lower income limits. Eligibility for LIHEAP assistance is based on income, with households at or below 150% of the federal poverty income guidelines eligible. States may choose to set lower income limits, but no household with income below 110% of the poverty guidelines can be considered ineligible. Grantees can also make households eligible if at least one member receives benefits from programs like TANF, SSI, SNAP, or certain veterans' programs. There is no asset test for eligibility, but states may limit client assets. LIHEAP assistance does not affect eligibility for other state or federal aid programs. The LIHEAP statute requires grantees to conduct outreach to eligible households, especially those with elderly individuals, disabilities, or high energy burdens, to ensure awareness of LIHEAP availability. Grantees must prioritize households with the lowest incomes and highest home energy needs in relation to income for assistance. This provision was added to the law in 1994 to consider both income and energy burden in targeting assistance. Grantees must target households with the highest health risk and energy burden, treating owners and renters equitably under the LIHEAP statute. Renters in HUD-subsidized housing pay 30% of their income towards rent and utilities, with HUD subsidizing the rest. In cases where tenants pay utilities directly, they are reimbursed for the HUD share through a utility allowance, which can result in a rent reduction. States cannot automatically deny LIHEAP benefits to subsidized tenants who pay utilities directly and receive allowances, but they can consider these allowances when determining benefit amounts. Grantees have flexibility in deciding benefit mix, dollar range, and administration agencies. Public participation is required in program operation. The LIHEAP program requires states to submit a yearly plan with public participation, coordinate with other low-income programs like WAP, establish fiscal controls, and delegate administrative functions to local agencies. LIHEAP funds were initially administered by Community Action Agencies before LIHEAP was enacted in 1981. The LIHEAP program, enacted in 1981, requires states to give special consideration to local agencies administering funds for low-income energy assistance. CAAs are involved in administering funds in 30 states, while 13 states have local programs administered by counties. LIHEAP benefits are usually given directly to utilities or fuel oil suppliers, except for cases of renters whose utility payments are included in rent. In FY2014, an estimated 6.3 million households received heating and/or winter crisis assistance through LIHEAP. The number of recipient households has decreased from a peak of 8.1 million in FY2010 but remains higher than pre-FY2009 levels. Appropriations for LIHEAP reached $5.1 billion in FY2009 and FY2010, and $4.7 billion in FY2011. In FY2009 and FY2010, LIHEAP funding reached $5.1 billion, increasing to $4.7 billion in FY2011 from $2.59 billion in FY2008. The percentage of federally eligible households receiving assistance rose to 21% and 22% in FY2009 and FY2010, respectively, before settling back to 16% in FY2013 and FY2014. FY2010 through FY2012 saw the highest number of households receiving cooling and/or summer crisis assistance at 1.1 million each year. In FY2014, 1.1 million households received cooling and/or summer crisis assistance, with 33% having a member 60 years or older, 38% with a member with a disability, and 19% including a child five years or younger. LIHEAP eligibility is set at 60% of state median income in some states, but on average, recipient households have very low incomes. In FY2014, LIHEAP households served had very low incomes, with 68% of heating assistance recipients and 76% of cooling assistance recipients at or below the poverty level. Factors affecting LIHEAP's ability to assist low-income households include energy costs, energy consumption, and the number of eligible households. The average LIHEAP benefit varies by state, with the nationwide average heating benefit in FY2014 being $301. The average heating benefit nationwide in FY2014 was $301, with a range from $78 to $1,024. Cooling assistance had an average benefit of $336, ranging from $121 to $1,246. LIHEAP benefits in constant dollars showed a decline until FY2009 when funding increased significantly. In FY1998, the average LIHEAP benefit declined to $117, reaching $187 in FY2001 but generally decreasing thereafter. In FY2006, the benefit was $171 due to higher funding. By FY2009, the average heating benefit increased to $209 but declined again to $145 by FY2014. The cooling benefit fluctuated over the years, starting at $129 in 1981 and dropping to as low as $49 in FY1990 before increasing again. The LIHEAP program saw fluctuations in average benefit amounts over the years, with values ranging from $72 to $142 in constant dollars. Funding for LIHEAP increased significantly after FY2009, leading to a rise in cooling and summer crisis benefits. Regular funds are distributed to states, tribes, and territories, with emergency contingency funds available for specific needs. The LIHEAP program provides funds that can be distributed to states, tribes, or territories at the discretion of the Administration. Leveraging Incentive grants are also available for grantees who leverage nonfederal resources for energy assistance programs. A portion of these grants can be used for competitive Residential Energy Assistance Challenge (REACH) grants to improve energy security for low-income families. Grantees can use the funding for activities such as heating and cooling assistance, emergency crisis assistance, and weatherization. The LIHEAP program provides funds to states, tribes, and territories. Regular funds were last authorized in FY2007 at $5.1 billion. Indian tribes can request to administer their own LIHEAP funds based on the number of low-income households on a reservation. The LIHEAP program provides funds to states, tribes, and territories. Tribes can work out funding levels with states or receive set-aside funding. A portion of the total regular fund appropriation is set aside for energy assistance in certain territories. In FY2014, 0.5% of funding was set aside for territories, reaching the maximum allowed by the statute. Since FY2014, a set-aside of approximately 0.134% of regular funds has been allocated for territories under the LIHEAP program. Prior to this, the territories received a similar percentage of funding under the predecessor program, LIEAP. Despite requests for increased funding in 1981, HHS decided to maintain the same funding levels based on congressional determination of need. HHS allocates funds to territories based on population, with Puerto Rico receiving 90% of funds. Emergency contingency funds are not formula-based and are distributed at the Administration's discretion to address home energy assistance needs during natural disasters or emergencies. The Emergency Contingency Fund, established by HHS, provides assistance during natural disasters such as weather events, floods, earthquakes, and hurricanes. Grantees can use the funds for temporary shelter, transportation, coats, blankets, utility reconnection, and equipment replacement. Funds are released for various reasons, including energy price increases and extreme weather conditions. The Energy Emergency Contingency Fund was first appropriated in FY1991 and permanently authorized at $600 million in FY1994. Funds have been appropriated every year except for FY2003, and since FY2011, no funds have been allocated. The LIHEAP emergency contingency funds may not always be released to grantees despite being appropriated. These funds have been designated as \"emergency\" for budget enforcement purposes, exempting them from spending limits. Congress first designated these funds as \"emergency\" for budget enforcement in FY1995. The LIHEAP emergency contingency funds were first designated as \"emergency\" for budget enforcement purposes in FY1992 through FY1994 appropriations acts and later incorporated into the LIHEAP statute. The Budget Control Act of 2011 amended the law, allowing for a possible emergency designation each fiscal year, but it has not been used for LIHEAP funding. LIHEAP does not require grantees to match federal funds, but Leveraging Incentive grants may be based on outside funds obtained for energy assistance. In 1990, Leveraging Incentive grants were authorized to provide separate funding for states that leverage nonfederal resources for their LIHEAP programs. States are awarded incentive funds based on their success in securing nonfederal resources for energy assistance. In 1994, the statute was amended to allow up to 25% of grants to be set aside for the Residential Energy Assistance Challenge Option (REACH). The REACH option allows states to receive competitive grants to improve energy efficiency for low-income families, reducing their vulnerability to homelessness and health risks from high energy costs. Funding for Leveraging Incentive and REACH grants has not been authorized since FY2004, with funds typically ranging from $22 million to $30 million. Since FY2013, no funds have been allocated for these grants. Additional funds were previously available to LIHEAP grantees from recovered funds due to oil company overcharges violating price controls. The Emergency Fuels and Energy Allocation Act of 1973 established controls for distributing funds to states for energy efficiency purposes, including LIHEAP. Oil overcharge funds allocated to LIHEAP peaked at $174 million in FY1989 and decreased to $200,000 by FY2008. States can transfer up to 10% of Social Services Block Grant funds for low-income home energy assistance. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program allows states to use funds for home heating and cooling costs. LIHEAP funds are typically released during winter months. Most states release the bulk of their LIHEAP funds during the winter months, shortly after federal appropriations are finalized. In recent years, appropriations have been delayed, leaving states uncertain about the amount of funds they will receive. Congress set aside funds for \"delayed obligations\" for LIHEAP in the early 1990s to start up activities for the following winter's program. The funds grew from $60 million in FY1990 to $688 million in FY1993. In the early 1990s, LIHEAP funding grew significantly, reaching $688 million in FY1993. The program was amended to be funded on a program year cycle, known as \"forward funding,\" to give grantees time to plan once funding levels were known. Despite the statutory language, Congress never actually appropriated funds for a program year as forward funding. Since FY1994, advance appropriations for LIHEAP were provided annually except for FY1997. However, since FY2002, there have been no advance appropriations for LIHEAP. The President's budget for FY2019 did not include funding for LIHEAP, continuing the trend from FY2018. Funding decisions were made in a constrained budget environment to prioritize federal funds. In a constrained budget environment, difficult funding decisions were made to ensure federal funds are spent effectively. Some utility companies and state/local governments provide heating/cooling assistance. The House Appropriations Committee released a draft bill to fund LHHS in FY2019, maintaining LIHEAP funding at $3.640 billion. In FY2018, LIHEAP received $2.962 billion distributed based on the \"old\" formula percentages. The Senate Appropriations Committee had not yet released an LHHS bill at the time of the report. The FY2018 appropriation exceeded the previous year by $250 million, with funds distributed as regular funds according to the old LIHEAP formula. Funding for FY2018 was initially provided through continuing resolutions before the enactment of P.L. 115-141 on March 23, 2018. In FY2018, LIHEAP received $2.962 billion distributed based on the \"old\" formula percentages. HHS announced the distribution of funds on April 23, 2018, after the enactment of P.L. 115-141. The President's budget request proposed to eliminate funding for LIHEAP in FY2018 due to constrained budget environment. Utility companies and state governments provide heating and cooling assistance, with most states prohibiting utilities from discontinuing heat during winter. In FY2018, LIHEAP faced proposed funding cuts, but both the House and Senate committees rejected the President's proposal. The House and Senate bills proposed $3.390 billion in regular funds for LIHEAP, with allocations based on both the \"new\" and \"old\" formula. The Appropriations Committee-reported bill did not specify amounts for leveraging incentive and REACH grants, nor did H.R. 3358 or S. 1771 propose emergency contingency funds. OMB determines LIHEAP funding released to states under a CR, which may not necessarily match the previous year's funding due to standard provisions in continuing resolutions. The provision ensures that funds released under a CR do not exceed the final appropriation amount for a program. States may receive their LIHEAP formula allocations early in the fiscal year based on OMB's assessment of funding levels. In June 2010, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report on the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), highlighting instances of fraud and the need for better controls. This included benefit payments to ineligible applicants using deceased or imprisoned individuals' Social Security Numbers and under-reporting of income. GAO even set up a fake utility company to demonstrate how easily LIHEAP benefits could be obtained. The GAO report on LIHEAP fraud recommended ways for HHS to prevent fraud, such as requiring SSNs from applicants and checking information against databases. HHS issued guidance encouraging states to collect SSNs from LIHEAP applicants, although it is not required by statute. The Tax Reform Act of 1976 authorizes states to use SSNs for administering certain programs, including LIHEAP. HHS guidance allows states to require SSNs for verifying applicant identities. In FY2011, 40 states required SSNs for LIHEAP, up from 28 in FY2010. HHS urged states to prevent improper payments and fraud. LIHEAP regulations aim to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse among clients, vendors, and agencies.

LIHEAP regulations aim to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse among clients, vendors, and agencies. States must submit a plan to HHS each year, but there is no specific way they must comply with statutory requirements. HHS suggested states report on compliance monitoring, fraud reporting mechanisms, verifying applicant identities, cross-checking SSNs, and verifying applicant income. HHS assembled a Program Integrity Working Group to address issues and released a report in April 2012 with recommendations. HHS collaborated with other agencies for verification of identity and income for LIHEAP. Performance measures were developed to guide data collection and assess outcomes of LIHEAP assistance, in response to issues raised in a GAO report. States began collecting performance data in FY2016, with the data not yet made public. The data collection for LIHEAP performance measures was published by HHS in 2013 and amended in 2014. Three primary performance measures were proposed, including Average Reduction in Energy Burden and Percent of Unduplicated Households Prevented from Home Energy Crisis. Consumption data collection requirements were made optional in the 2014 notice. Households receiving LIHEAP benefits are monitored for various indicators like past due notices, fuel balance alerts, fuel source depletion, and equipment repair/replacement. LIHEAP helps restore home energy by reconnecting utilities, purchasing fuel, or fixing equipment. Data collection involves input from fuel vendors and utility companies. LIHEAP's legislative history is detailed in Appendix A. LIHEAP was not the first federal energy assistance program created to help low-income households with their energy bills. Appropriations for home energy assistance initially came about in the 1970s during the OPEC Oil Embargo of 1973-1974. Congress directed funds to assistance focused on lowering energy bills through weatherization and education, crisis assistance, and direct payments to subsidize energy bills for low-income households. The evolution of energy assistance programs in the 1970s and early 1980s led to the creation of LIHEAP in 1982, which included various forms of assistance like weatherization, education, and crisis assistance in addition to direct payments for low-income households' energy bills. In the 1970s, Maine launched \"Project Fuel\" to assist low-income and elderly households with energy costs, focusing on winterizing homes and providing crisis counseling and fuel assistance. This initiative later influenced the creation of the Emergency Energy Conservation Program in 1975, which aimed to help low-income households during the energy crisis. The Emergency Energy Conservation Program (EECP) was established in 1975 to provide funds for weatherization and conservation purposes, as well as fuel voucher programs. Eligible organizations could administer the funds, with Congress appropriating $16.5 million for the program in FY1975. The EECP ended with the creation of the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) in 1976, which was meant to supplement the EECP. The Community Action Agencies administered WAP funds for weatherizing low-income households, but funding shifted to the DOE Weatherization Assistance Program in FY1979. Congress stopped funding the CSA weatherization program and allocated funds only to the DOE program. Additionally, the CSA began providing direct assistance to low-income households for energy bill payments in FY1977 through a Special Crisis Intervention Program funded by a supplemental appropriations act (P.L. 95-26). In FY1977, funding was provided for direct payments to utilities and fuel suppliers to assist consumers facing utility disconnection due to high fuel prices. The program offered up to $250 payments to utilities and up to $50 directly to households in dire financial need. Congress continued to appropriate funds for energy assistance in FY1978 and FY1979. In FY1980, Congress significantly increased funding to address energy crises caused by rising energy prices. In FY1980, Congress significantly increased funding to address energy crises caused by rising energy prices, particularly heating oil. The decontrol of domestic oil prices and OPEC oil price increases led to a dramatic rise in the price of heating oil, prompting Congress to take action and pass energy assistance legislation. The Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources held multiple hearings on energy assistance, leading to the enactment of LIEAP, the Predecessor Program to LIHEAP. Energy needs of low-income households remained a priority for the President and Congress after the appropriation of energy assistance funding for FY1980. The Home Energy Assistance Act proposed a new energy assistance program, LIEAP, funded by windfall profits taxes. LIEAP was authorized at $3 billion for FY1981, with $1.85 billion appropriated. It was a block grant program to states, primarily distributed by formula, with $100 million reserved for crisis assistance. The Home Energy Assistance Act proposed the LIEAP program funded by windfall profits taxes, with $100 million reserved for crisis assistance. States could use funds to help low-income households pay home energy costs, including cooling assistance for medical need. Eligible households were those at or below the lower living standard, and recipients of certain means-tested benefits were eligible for LIEAP benefits. States had discretion in program setup and benefit distribution. The Low Income Energy Assistance Program (LIEAP) addressed payment distribution, benefit amounts, eligibility certification, and emergency fund allocation. The enactment of LIEAP raised concerns about fund distribution among states based on weather conditions. The formula for LIEAP considered factors like temperatures, energy costs, and low-income household numbers. In 1981, LIHEAP replaced LIEAP as a block grant program to assist low-income households with energy needs. LIHEAP replaced LIEAP as a block grant program, providing funds to states, tribes, and territories to assist low-income households with energy needs. Grantees had more flexibility in using funds for cooling expenses and weatherization. Eligibility was set at 150% of poverty or 60% of state median income. The program was authorized at $1.875 billion from FY1982 through FY1984 and had fewer administrative requirements compared to LIEAP. Under LIHEAP, states had more flexibility in reporting and data collection compared to LIEAP. Grantees were only required to make assurances about services provided, with no strict guidelines on program implementation. LIHEAP funding distribution to states, tribes, and territories is detailed in tables in the appendix. The LIHEAP program was funded through a series of CRs at FY2017 levels with a reduction of 0.6791%. In FY2018, over $3 billion was distributed to states, tribes, and territories. Final funds were distributed in April 2018. Allocation details are shown in tables, with total FY2018 funding for all grantees. In FY2018, over $3 billion in LIHEAP regular and emergency contingency funds were distributed to states, tribes, and territories. Table B-2 shows funding distribution from FY2008 to FY2017, including tribes within states. Table B-3 displays historic LIHEAP funding levels from FY1982 to proposed FY2019 funding, detailing authorization levels, budget requests, appropriations, and emergency contingency funds distribution."
