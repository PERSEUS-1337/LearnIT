Challenges in meeting the volume requirement include infrastructure limitations, technology barriers, and delays in EPA approvals for fuel pathways. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) faces uncertainties regarding the impact of fluctuating gasoline consumption on biofuel and conventional fuel industries. Concerns exist about the transparency of credit trading for compliance and the effects of small refinery exemptions on biofuel demand. Despite challenges, two fuel categories consistently meet statutory targets. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) has faced challenges in implementation, leading to scrutiny in Congress and litigation. Some Members of Congress have questioned EPA's regulations and proposed amendments or repeal of the RFS. Despite uncertainties, conventional biofuel and biomass-based diesel have consistently met statutory targets, while advanced biofuel pathways have dominated the cellulosic biofuel volume target. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) was established in 2005 and expanded in 2007. It mandates an increasing volume of renewable fuels in transportation fuels sold in the US. The RFS focuses on four renewable fuel categories and requires a total of 36.0 billion gallons of renewable fuel by 2022. The requirement is met with fuels from conventional biofuel and advanced biofuel categories. EPA determines volume amounts after 2022. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates increasing volumes of renewable fuels in the US, with a focus on conventional and advanced biofuels. The advanced biofuel requirement includes cellulosic biofuel, biomass-based diesel, and other advanced biofuels, with a shift towards more advanced biofuels over time. Each fuel category must achieve specific greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions compared to gasoline and diesel. The total advanced biofuel requirement increases from 7% in 2010 to 58% in 2022, with a lifecycle GHG emission threshold for qualification. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates increasing volumes of renewable fuels in the US, including advanced biofuels like cellulosic biofuel and biomass-based diesel. These fuels must achieve specific greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions to qualify. Compliance with the RFS is regulated by the EPA using a tradable credit system where obligated parties submit renewable identification numbers (RINs) equal to their annual obligation. RINs are valid for the year they are generated and the following year. Obligated parties under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) must meet compliance for each year's renewable fuel volume requirement by purchasing or generating enough credits to satisfy deficits from previous years. RINs can be used or traded with other parties, with transactions registered through the EPA Moderated Transaction System (EMTS). Different biofuels have varying qualifications within the RFS, with some fuels eligible for multiple categories while others can only be used to meet the overall mandate. For example, cellulosic biofuel can fulfill the cellulosic, advanced, and total renewable fuel mandates. The EPA released the final rule for the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) for 2019, calling for 19.92 billion gallons of total renewable fuel, with different biofuels generating varying amounts of Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) based on their energy content. The Equivalence Value (EV) of a biofuel represents the number of compliance gallons claimed for every physical gallon used, with biodiesel having an EV of 1.5 for advanced biofuel. The EPA set the total renewable fuel requirement for 2019 at 19.92 billion gallons, a 1% increase from 2018. The volume requirements for advanced biofuel and cellulosic biofuel were reduced using waiver authority. The advanced biofuel target of 13.0 billion gallons is not expected to be reached due to a shortfall in cellulosic biofuel. EPA estimates 2.59 billion carryover RINs are available. EPA mentions a forthcoming reset rulemaking and sets the biomass-based diesel 2020 volume requirement at 2.43 billion gallons. Biomass-based diesel is the main biofuel for the advanced biofuel mandate. The 2020 volume requirement incentivizes biodiesel and renewable diesel production. EPA considers factors like the biodiesel tax credit unavailability and tariffs on biodiesel imports from Argentina and Indonesia. The EPA administers the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), evaluating renewable fuel pathways and ensuring annual compliance by obligated parties. Compliance with the RFS has been challenging, with concerns about tariffs on biodiesel imports and soybeans exported to China. Annual evaluations consider input from government agencies, the public, and court decisions. The EPA has faced challenges in projecting volume requirements for biofuels, leading to legal challenges and court decisions. For example, the American Petroleum Institute objected to EPA's 2012 cellulosic biofuel production projection and challenged it in court, resulting in the federal court vacating the standard and providing guidelines for future projections. The EPA has faced legal challenges regarding its volume requirements for biofuels, with court decisions impacting the 2014-2016 and 2017 projections for biomass-based diesel. The D.C. Circuit Court vacated the 2016 total renewable fuel volume requirement and remanded the 2015 final rule for reconsideration. Some of EPA's regulatory actions have not met statutory deadlines, but recent final rules, like the 2019 final rule, adhere to the schedule. The lack of timely rulemaking and inaccurate volume projections could impact private investment in advanced biofuels. Slow approval of new fuel pathways and registration of facilities may hinder investment and production. Delays in processing program enhancement rules could impede program growth. The final rules for 2014-2016 and 2019 triggered the \"reset\" provision for renewable fuel categories. The EPA Administrator has the authority to adjust renewable fuel categories under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) through a \"reset\" provision. This provision allows for adjustments to the RFS volumes for future years starting in 2016. EPA plans to issue a rulemaking in early 2019 to reset cellulosic biofuel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel volume targets for 2020-2022. Challenges exist for advanced biofuel producers in understanding RFS eligibility criteria, impacting compliance and fuel production. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) prioritizes liquid transportation fuels from biomass feedstocks for compliance. EPA approval is required for fuels to generate RFS RINs, which can be time-consuming. The RFS indirectly creates demand for biofuels, with cellulosic biofuel targeted to make up 44% of the renewable fuel mandate in 2022. Actual cellulosic biofuel production volumes are below expectations set by Congress, with the 2019 target of 8.5 billion gallons falling short at 418 million gallons. Factors such as lack of private investment, technology setbacks, and uneven government support contribute to this shortfall, raising doubts about the attainability of statutory biofuel volumes. The \"blend wall\" poses a challenge to meeting statutory cellulosic biofuel volumes mandated in the RFS. The largest volume being met is for nonadvanced biofuel, mainly corn starch ethanol blended into gasoline. With ethanol content limited to 10%, the conventional biofuel portion of the RFS requires slightly more ethanol than can be blended into gasoline. The EPA reports that the blend wall, which is the limit on ethanol content in gasoline, may not be as significant of a barrier to fuel consumption as previously thought. The lack of cellulosic biofuel production has allowed more time to address the blend wall and the scheduled biofuel levels in the RFS. One suggested approach is to blend higher levels of ethanol into conventional gasoline. The EPA granted a Clean Air Act waiver in 2010 allowing gasoline to contain up to 15% ethanol for newer vehicles. Limited demand, infrastructure concerns, and lack of a waiver for summer sales have hindered widespread adoption of E15. Another option is promoting ethanol use in flexible-fuel vehicles capable of using E85, but infrastructure constraints exist. The USDA announced $100 million in grants in 2015 to address biofuel infrastructure issues. The USDA announced $100 million in matching grants in 2015 under its Biofuel Infrastructure Partnership for blender pumps, E15 or E85 pumps, and storage tanks. The RFS interacts with various factors like technology, biomass feedstocks, and tax incentives affecting biofuel production feasibility. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) was established in 2005 to diversify the country's energy portfolio, support rural economies, and protect the environment. It was expanded in 2007 but has faced challenges in meeting its objectives over the past decade. Policy questions surrounding the RFS include its purposes and design for achieving those goals. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) aims to introduce more biofuels into the transportation fuel market to achieve supply and environmental objectives. Some stakeholders argue it also serves to find a market for biomass feedstocks and promote rural America's economy. Questions arise on whether the RFS is still necessary for energy security given advancements in unconventional oil and gas production. Some question the need for the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) for energy security and its environmental impact, especially as the advanced biofuel component has missed targets. Challenges in meeting ambitious RFS goals due to slow development of advanced biofuel supplies have caused uncertainty for stakeholders. The debate continues on whether the RFS should be eliminated, amended, or maintained in its current form. Some Members of Congress are considering alternatives to the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), such as transitioning to an octane standard or modifying the conventional biofuel mandate. There are debates on whether the RFS waivers are sufficient to address supply challenges and if they align with program goals. Arguments exist for and against the need for the RFS to lower greenhouse gas emissions and ensure the biofuels industry's access to fuel distribution infrastructure."
