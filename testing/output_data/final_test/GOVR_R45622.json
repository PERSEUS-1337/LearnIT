    "content": "Appointments to federal judgeships, including the Supreme Court, require nomination by the President and confirmation by the Senate. Historically, appointments to lower federal courts have not seen much public disagreement, but in recent decades, appointments to circuit courts and district courts have been more contentious. Federal courts, specifically the U.S. circuit courts of appeals and U.S. district courts, have been a focus of Senate interest and debate regarding the nomination and confirmation process of judges. This report provides statistics and analysis on the appointment of judges to these courts from 1977 to 2018. Excluded from the report are the U.S. Supreme Court and other territorial district courts. The circuit courts of appeals hear appeals from federal district court decisions and review administrative agency decisions. The U.S. circuit courts of appeals, also known as \"circuit courts,\" consist of 13 courts divided into 12 geographic circuits and one nationwide circuit. These courts have a total of 179 authorized judgeships, with the First Circuit having the fewest at 6 judgeships and the Ninth Circuit having the most. The U.S. district courts are federal trial courts with 91 Article III district courts across the states, D.C., and Puerto Rico. Each state has at least one district court, with some states having up to four. There are a total of 673 authorized judgeships, ranging from 1 to 28 per district. The Eastern District of Oklahoma has the fewest judgeships at 1, while the Southern District of New York and the Central District of California each have the most at 28. The U.S. district courts have 91 Article III district courts across states, D.C., and Puerto Rico. Each state has at least one district court, with some having up to four. The Southern District of New York and the Central District of California each have 28 judgeships, the most among Article III district courts. Opportunities for a President to make court appointments arise when judgeships are vacant or scheduled to become vacant. Various factors influence the number of opportunities a President will have, including judicial departures, new judgeships created by Congress, nominations submitted by a President, and Senate consideration speed. During the period from 1977 to 2017, the median percentage of vacant circuit court judgeships before a new Congress was 8.9%, while for district court judgeships it was 7.2%. Vacancy rates were highest at the beginning of the 96th Congress and lowest at the beginning of the 98th Congress. The percentage of judgeships vacant at the start of a presidency is influenced by Senate approval of the preceding President's nominees. During the Trump presidency, the percentage of vacant U.S. district court judgeships was 12.8%, influenced by factors such as the number of nominations confirmed by the Senate, judicial departures, and political party alignment. The number of U.S. circuit court nominees confirmed during different presidencies varied, with the highest being 83 during Reagan's presidency and the lowest being 42 during George H. W. Bush's single term. The percentage of nominees confirmed ranged from 93.3% during Carter's presidency to 71.8% during George W. Bush's presidency. For U.S. district court nominees, the highest confirmation was 305 during Clinton's presidency, and the lowest was 148 during a single four-year term. The confirmation rates for U.S. district court nominees varied among different presidencies, with the highest being 305 during Clinton's presidency and the lowest being 148 during George H. W. Bush's single term. The percentage of nominees confirmed ranged from 94.8% during Reagan's presidency to 77.1% during George H. W. Bush's presidency. The median number of U.S. circuit court nominees confirmed during a Congress was 17, with 26 nominations submitted to the Senate. The confirmation rates for U.S. district court nominees varied among different presidencies, with the highest being 305 during Clinton's presidency and the lowest being 148 during George H. W. Bush's single term. The median number of U.S. circuit court nominees confirmed during a Congress was 17, with 26 nominations submitted to the Senate. The number of U.S. circuit court nominees confirmed ranged from 2 to 44 during different Congresses, with a median confirmation rate of 65.4%. The smallest percentage of circuit court nominees confirmed was 22.2% during the 114th Congress. All circuit court nominations submitted during the 95th and 99th Congresses were confirmed. The median number of U.S. district court nominees confirmed during a Congress was 66, with a range from 18 to 154 confirmations. The confirmation rates for U.S. district court nominees varied among different presidencies, with the highest being 305 during Clinton's presidency and the lowest being 148 during George H. W. Bush's single term. The median number of U.S. circuit court nominees confirmed during a Congress was 17, with a range from 2 to 44 confirmations. In general, a greater number and percentage of circuit and district court nominees were confirmed during Congresses where the President's party matched the Senate's majority party. Unified party control resulted in a median of approximately 18 circuit court nominees confirmed, with a median confirmation rate of 80.0%. During Congresses with unified party control, the median number of circuit court nominees confirmed was 16, with a confirmation rate of 59.7%. For district court nominees, the median number confirmed was approximately 76, with a confirmation rate of 89.5%. In contrast, during Congresses with divided party control, the median number of district court nominees confirmed was 60, with a confirmation rate of 73.1%. It has become more common for Presidents to renominate individuals for U.S. circuit or district court judgeships multiple times before Senate approval. The number of circuit court nominees confirmed during presidencies has increased, with some nominees being renominated multiple times before Senate approval. The range of nominees nominated more than once and confirmed varied, with the highest being 28 during the George W. Bush presidency. Conversely, some nominees were not confirmed despite being renominated, with the highest number being 11 during the George W. Bush presidency. During the George W. Bush presidency, the percentage of confirmed circuit court nominees who were renominated more than once prior to Senate approval was the highest at 45.9%. In contrast, during the Obama presidency, this percentage decreased to 36.4%, the second-highest among the presidencies listed. The total number of district court nominees renominated multiple times ranged from 3 during the George H. W. Bush presidency to 111 during the Obama presidency. During the Obama presidency, the number of nominees confirmed by the Senate after being renominated more than once was the highest at 104, representing 38.8% of confirmed district court nominees. This was an increase from the George W. Bush presidency, where 23.8% of nominees were renominated multiple times before confirmation. Table 6 shows data on U.S. circuit and district court nominees whose nominations were returned by the Senate to the President from the 95th through the 115th Congress. It also indicates the number of nominees who had hearings, nominations reported by the Judiciary Committee, and pending nominations on the Executive Calendar before being returned. Nominees returned during the last two years of a presidency were not confirmed by the Senate. During the 95th through the 115th Congress, the median number of U.S. circuit court nominees whose nominations were returned to a President at the end of a Congress was 8, while for district court nominees it was 13. In the 13 most recent Congresses, the median number of circuit court nominees returned was 9, and for district court nominees it was 20. Notably, no circuit court nominees had nominations returned at the end of the 95th Congress or the 99th Congress. The 106th Congress had the highest number of circuit court nominees returned at 17. During the 95th through the 115th Congress, the median number of U.S. circuit court nominees whose nominations were returned to a President at the end of a Congress was 8, while for district court nominees it was 13. The 115th Congress had the greatest number of district court nominees whose nominations were returned at the end of a Congress (56). The smallest percentage of district court nominees who had nominations returned occurred at the end of the 97th Congress. During the 97th Congress in 1981-1982, only 1.4% of district court nominees had their nominations returned, while during the 114th Congress in 2015-2016, 70.5% of nominations were returned. The timing of nominations submitted to the Senate can impact the confirmation process. The median number of days from nomination to confirmation for nominees confirmed from 1977 through 2018 is provided by presidency and Congress. The time from nomination to confirmation for circuit court judges has increased since 1977, with various factors contributing to delays. The median days from nomination to confirmation ranged from 45.0 days during Reagan's presidency to 229.0 days during Obama's presidency. The median number of days from nomination to confirmation for circuit court judges increased during successive presidencies, reaching 229.0 days during the Obama presidency. The first two years of the Trump presidency saw a decline in this trend, with a median of 140.5 days. The average number of days ranged from 68.7 days during Reagan's presidency to 350.6 days during George W. Bush's presidency for circuit court nominees. For U.S. district court nominees, the median ranged from 41.0 days during Reagan's presidency to 215.0 days. The median number of days from nomination to confirmation for U.S. circuit court nominees increased during successive presidencies, reaching 215.0 days during the Obama presidency. The trend continued in the first two years of the Trump presidency, with a median of 235.0 days. Figure 1 displays the number of days from nomination to confirmation for each confirmed circuit court nominee from 1977 to 2018. During the George H. W. Bush presidency, there was a notable increase in the number of circuit court nominees who waited one year or more for confirmation. The trend continued with 12 nominees during the Clinton presidency, 18 nominees during the George W. Bush presidency, and 8 nominees during the Obama presidency. However, in the first two years of the Trump presidency, none of the 30 circuit court nominees waited at least 365 days for confirmation. During President Clinton's presidency, 18% of circuit court nominees waited at least 365 days for confirmation, while 30% of President George W. Bush's nominees faced similar delays. President Obama had 15% of nominees wait this long. President Clinton had 18 nominees confirmed within 90 days, President George W. Bush had 11, and President Obama had 2. In the first two years of the Trump presidency, 8 nominees were confirmed within 90 days. During the Trump presidency, 27% of circuit court nominees were confirmed within 90 days, a decrease from previous administrations. During the Carter and Reagan presidencies, a total of five district court nominees waited 365 days or more to be confirmed, while no nominees during the George H. W. Bush presidency waited that long. The Clinton presidency saw 14 district court nominees waiting one year or more for confirmation. During the George W. Bush presidency, 17 district court nominees waited over a year to be confirmed, the second highest among completed presidencies. In the Obama presidency, 16 nominees waited at least 365 days. Under Trump, 11% of nominees waited over a year in the first two years. During the Carter and Reagan presidencies, district court nominees had relatively short confirmation times. President Clinton and George H. W. Bush also had nominees confirmed within 90 days. President Obama had the fewest nominees confirmed quickly, while President Trump had two nominees confirmed within 90 days in his first two years. President Carter had the highest percentage of nominees confirmed within 90 days. During the Carter and Reagan presidencies, district court nominees had short confirmation times. Clinton and George H. W. Bush also had nominees confirmed within 90 days. Obama had the fewest nominees confirmed quickly, while Trump had two nominees confirmed within 90 days in his first two years. The confirmation rate within 90 days varied across presidencies, with the lowest being during Obama's presidency. The time taken for U.S. circuit court nominees from nomination to confirmation varied significantly across different Congresses, with the shortest being 28.0 days and the longest being 331.0 days. The median confirmation time stayed above 200 days from the 106th through 114th Congresses but decreased to 140.5 days in the 115th Congress. The time from nomination to confirmation for U.S. circuit court nominees varied greatly across different Congresses, ranging from 32.6 days to 562.9 days. The average confirmation time increased by more than 30 days for several Congresses, while for U.S. district court nominees, the median confirmation time ranged from 26.0 days to 299.5 days across different Congresses. During the 115th Congress, the median wait time for district court nominees exceeded 200 days, marking a trend that started in the 112th Congress. The confirmation time for U.S. circuit court nominees varied greatly across different Congresses, with significant increases in confirmation time observed in specific Congresses. During the 108th Congress, the median number of days from nomination to confirmation for U.S. circuit court nominees increased by 73.0 days compared to the 99th Congress. Similarly, for district court nominees, the five greatest increases in the number of median days from nomination to confirmation occurred during the 114th Congress. During the 114th to 115th Congress, the median days from nomination to confirmation for U.S. district court nominees decreased. The nomination process involves the President transmitting nominations to the Senate, which are then referred to the Judiciary Committee for processing. This process includes a prehearing phase, a hearing, and a vote on whether to report the nomination to the Senate. From 1977 to 2018, the median time from nomination to committee hearing for circuit and district court nominees varied across presidencies, with recent nominees experiencing longer wait times. The range for U.S. circuit court nominees was 23.0 to 154.0 days. During the Trump presidency, the median number of days from nomination to committee hearing for U.S. circuit court nominees was 69.0 days, and for U.S. district court nominees, it was 77.0 days. After a nominee receives a hearing by the Judiciary Committee, a vote determines if the nomination moves forward for Senate confirmation. The Judiciary Committee has three options when reporting a nomination to the Senate - favorable, unfavorable, or without recommendation. Most nominations are reported favorably, but on rare occasions, they may be reported unfavorably or without recommendation. Despite lack of majority support in committee, a nomination can still advance for Senate consideration. Once reported by the Judiciary Committee, a nomination is listed on the Executive Calendar for floor consideration. Nominees included in this analysis had their nominations advanced by the Judiciary Committee and were confirmed by the Senate. The median length of time from nomination reported by the Judiciary Committee to confirmation by the Senate for circuit court judgeships was 9.0 days from 1977 to 2018. District court nominees had a median of 8.0 days. There was variation in confirmation times across presidencies, with nominees in recent presidencies waiting longer. The confirmation process for U.S. circuit court nominees varied from 1.0 to 98.0 days across presidencies. The median confirmation time for U.S. district court nominees ranged from 1.0 to 84.0 days. Since 1953, most administrations have sought prenomination evaluations from the American Bar Association for judicial candidates. The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary evaluates judicial nominees based on integrity, competence, and temperament. The committee's objective is to provide an impartial peer-review assessment to assist the White House in nominating candidates. They focus on professional qualifications, excluding philosophy or political affiliation. Criteria include intellectual capacity, judgment, writing abilities, legal knowledge, and professional experience. The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary evaluates judicial nominees based on integrity, competence, and temperament. Nominees are rated as \"well qualified,\" \"qualified,\" or \"not qualified\" after a multistep evaluation process. The President has discretion in considering the ABA rating when nominating candidates. There is variation in the percentage of nominees receiving a \"well qualified\" rating across different presidencies. During the first two years of the Trump presidency, 62.3% of confirmed district court nominees received a well qualified rating. None of the completed presidencies listed had any confirmed circuit court nominees rated as not qualified by the ABA. The percentage of nominees receiving a not qualified rating ranged from 1.3% to 1.5% in presidencies where at least one nominee was rated as such. During recent presidencies, the Senate confirmed most U.S. circuit and district court nominations by unanimous consent or voice vote, but the use of roll call votes has become more common. Only a small percentage of circuit court nominees were confirmed by roll call vote during the Carter, Reagan, and George H. W. Bush presidencies. During recent presidencies, the Senate confirmed most U.S. circuit and district court nominations by unanimous consent or voice vote. However, confirmation by roll call vote became more common, with a significant increase during the Clinton presidency and a majority of lower court nominees approved using roll call votes during the George W. Bush presidency and continuing under President Obama. During recent presidencies, confirmation by roll call vote became more common for U.S. circuit and district court nominations. Under President Obama, 89.1% of circuit court nominees and 64.6% of district court nominees were confirmed this way. In the first two years of the Trump presidency, all U.S. circuit court nominees were confirmed by roll call votes, while 50.9% of district court nominees were confirmed this way. The increased use of roll call votes for confirmations did not always indicate opposition from Senators. During the Clinton presidency, there was notable variation in the number of nay votes received by circuit and district court nominations confirmed by roll call vote. 75.0% of circuit court nominees received at least one nay vote, with 56.2% receiving more than 20 nay votes. For district court nominees, 56.2% received at least one nay vote. During the George W. Bush and Obama presidencies, a majority of circuit and district court nominees confirmed by roll call vote received zero nay votes. In contrast, during the first two years of the Trump presidency, a significant number of circuit court nominees were confirmed with more than 40 nay votes. During the confirmation of district court nominees, 63.0% received at least one nay vote, with 29.4% receiving more than 40 nay votes. Data on gender and race of U.S. circuit and district court nominees confirmed by the Senate since the Carter Administration is of interest to Congress. Senators often highlight nominee demographics to enhance diversity in the federal judiciary. During completed presidencies, the percentage of confirmed U.S. circuit court nominees who were women ranged from 7.2% during Reagan to 43.6% during Obama. For district court nominees, the range was 8.3% under Reagan to 41.0% under Obama. In the first two years of Trump's presidency, 20.0% of circuit court nominees and 26.4% of district court nominees were women. The percentage of African American nominees ranged from 1.2% under Reagan to 16.4% under Obama. Figure 7 displays the demographics of each President's confirmed nominees. During completed presidencies, the percentage of confirmed U.S. circuit court nominees who were women ranged from 7.2% during Reagan to 43.6% during Obama. For district court nominees, the range was 8.3% under Reagan to 41.0% under Obama. In the first two years of Trump's presidency, 20.0% of circuit court nominees and 26.4% of district court nominees were women. The percentage of African American nominees ranged from 1.2% under Reagan to 16.4% under Obama. For completed presidencies, the percentage of confirmed U.S. district court nominees who were African American ranged from a low of 2.1% during Reagan to a high of 18.7% during Obama. During the first two years of the Trump presidency, 1.9% of confirmed district court nominees were African American. The greatest percentage of Asian American circuit court judges was appointed during the Obama presidency (7.3%). During the first two years of the Trump presidency, 10.0% of confirmed circuit court nominees were Asian American. During the George H. W. Bush presidency, 4.1% of confirmed U.S. district court nominees were Hispanic, while during the George W. Bush presidency, it was 10.3%. In the first two years of the Trump presidency, 1.9% of confirmed district court nominees were Hispanic."
