    "content": "The Act titled \"Urban Flooding Awareness Act of 2014\" defines urban flooding. The \"Urban Flooding Awareness Act of 2014\" defines urban flooding as the inundation of property in densely populated areas caused by rain overwhelming drainage systems. It includes stormwater entering buildings, water backup through sewer pipes, seepage through walls, accumulation of water on property, and overflow from water bodies. Urban flooding excludes flooding in undeveloped or agricultural areas. The Urban Flooding Study is defined as the inundation of property in densely populated areas caused by rain overwhelming drainage systems. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will collaborate with the National Research Council to conduct a study on urban flooding. The study will review research, laws, regulations, and costs associated with urban flooding events in major metropolitan areas across the United States. The study on urban flooding will focus on the largest metropolitan areas and trends in frequency and severity over the past 2 decades. It will also assess the adequacy of federally provided flood risk information, cost-effective methods to identify property damage risk, causes of urban flooding, and potential training for local experts in flood risk characterization. The study on urban flooding will examine the increase in urban flooding over the past 20 years due to global climate change, urbanization, and deteriorating stormwater infrastructure. It will focus on cost-effective strategies like decentralized and natural infrastructure to reduce flooding impacts on public and private property. The assessment includes opportunities for innovative strategies on government-controlled land like roads, buildings, and recreational areas. The role of Federal and State governments in spurring market innovations through public-private partnerships is emphasized, such as smart home technologies for flood warning systems. Sustainable funding methods for flood risk reduction are also explored. The curr_chunk discusses funding options for flood risk and damage reduction, including State revolving fund programs, stormwater fee programs, grant programs, and public-private partnerships. It also mentions information and education strategies. Information and education strategies for community leaders, government staff, and property owners on flood risks, reduction strategies, and flood insurance policies. Relevance of National Flood Insurance Program and Community Rating System to urban flooding areas outside traditional flood plains, with strategies for increasing coverage and participation. Strategies for protecting downstream areas. Strategies for protecting downstream communities from flooding impacts, including potential standards for watershed-wide flood protection planning and streamlined legal processes for flood damage victims. Collaboration with various government agencies and stakeholders. The Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency will submit a report to Congress within 3 years of the enactment of the Act, containing findings and recommendations from the National Research Council on urban flooding strategies and technologies."
