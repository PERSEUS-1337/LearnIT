    "content": "The primary greenhouse gas emitted by human activities is carbon dioxide (CO2) from fossil fuel combustion, contributing to a 40% increase in atmospheric CO2 levels over the past 150 years. Continued emissions will lead to severe and irreversible impacts on climate and ecosystems, prompting efforts to reduce CO2 emissions at the international level. Recent international negotiations and domestic policy developments have led to increased focus on U.S. greenhouse gas (GHG) emission levels. The United States pledged to reduce GHG emissions by 26%-28% by 2025 compared to 2005 levels under the Paris Agreement, and by 17% below 2005 levels by 2020 under the Copenhagen Accord. President Trump announced the intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement in 2017. President Trump announced in 2017 his intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, which cannot be completed before November 4, 2020. The United States' ability to meet GHG emission targets may hinge on CO2 emissions from electric power plants, a major source of emissions. The Clean Power Plan (CPP), established during the Obama Administration to regulate CO2 emissions from power plants, is currently under litigation after being stayed by the Supreme Court in 2016. President Trump's executive order in March 2017 directed the EPA to review and potentially revise the CPP. The EPA proposed to repeal the Clean Power Plan (CPP) in October 2017 and replace it with the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule in August 2018. The ACE rule directs states to establish performance standards for existing coal-fired electric generating units based on EPA-identified technologies and other considerations. Legal questions raised in the CPP proceedings will likely be central to any future legal challenges to the repeal. The CPP proceedings will be crucial for potential legal challenges to the repeal of the CPP or the ACE rule. Understanding GHG emission sources and factors affecting levels can inform policymakers on emission mitigation. Factors like economics, technology, and climate policies will impact future GHG levels. The report analyzes recent CO2 emission trends from electricity generation and their influencing factors. The third section examines CO2 emissions in the electric power sector, focusing on the 2015 CPP final rule. U.S. GHG emissions increased by 20% between 1990 and 2007, then decreased by 10% in the next two years. Between 2010 and 2016, emissions decreased by 7%, reaching levels similar to 1994. In 2016, U.S. GHG emissions were 12% lower than 2005 levels, aligning with goals from the 2009 Copenhagen Accord and 2015 Paris Agreement. The breakdown of U.S. GHG emissions shows that CO2 from fossil fuel combustion accounted for 76% in 2016. Legislative proposals focus on reducing CO2 emissions. GHG emissions by sector indicate electric power historically had the largest share but decreased significantly in the last decade. This trend will likely impact future emissions. The electric power sector contributes 35% of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion in the US, with residential and commercial sectors each at 13% and the industrial sector at 9%. Many GHG reduction programs focus on electricity generation due to its significant contribution to emissions. The electric power sector contributes 35% of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion in the US. CO2 emissions from electricity generation have decreased significantly since 2010, despite electricity generation remaining relatively stable. This reduction is attributed to various factors such as economic conditions and changes in the electricity market. The decrease in CO2 emissions from electricity generation in the US since 2010 can be attributed to economic conditions, changes in the electricity market, and a shift in the electricity generation portfolio towards sources with lower emissions like nuclear, hydropower, and renewables. The shift in the U.S. electricity generation portfolio towards sources with lower emissions like nuclear, hydropower, and renewables has led to a decrease in CO2 emissions. Fossil fuels have varying carbon intensities, with natural gas emitting less CO2 compared to coal and petroleum per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated. This shift in carbon intensity could impact emissions from the electricity sector. The U.S. electricity generation portfolio has shifted towards lower emissions sources, impacting total U.S. GHG emissions. Between 2005 and 2017, coal-fired generation decreased by 40%, natural gas increased by 67%, and non-hydro renewable energy generation increased by 343%. These changes have significantly altered the electricity generation mix in recent years. The shift in the U.S. electricity generation mix towards lower emissions sources has led to an increase in natural gas production by 50% between 2005 and 2015. This was driven by technological advances like directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing. The weighted average annual price of natural gas dropped by 60% during this period, while coal prices increased by 40%. These changes in fuel prices have influenced the economics of power generation, resulting in some natural gas displacing coal in certain regions and leading to the retirement of coal-fired power plants. Between 2006 and 2016, the number of coal-fired power plants decreased from 353 to 230. The majority of increased generation from renewable energy is due to wind power, which increased 14-fold between 2005 and 2017. Solar generation also increased significantly, but wind generation exceeds it. Energy from wood fuels remained constant, while landfill gas usage doubled between 2005 and 2017. Policymakers are focusing on recent trends and future projections of CO2 emissions from the electricity sector. Policymakers and stakeholders are closely monitoring recent trends and future projections of CO2 emissions in the electricity generation sector. Factors such as the electricity generation portfolio, fossil fuel and renewable energy prices, policy developments, economic impacts, and energy efficiency improvements will impact CO2 emission levels. Various groups have prepared projections of CO2 emissions in the electricity sector, which are compared in Table 1. The 2015 CPP final rule would impact 2030 CO2 emission levels from electricity generation. Recent studies show a decrease in emissions by 2030 compared to earlier projections. For example, the 2017 EIA estimate was 22% below 2005 levels by 2030, while the 2018 estimate was 28% below. The Rhodium Group estimates also show a reduction, with the 2018 estimate at 35% below 2005 levels by 2030. The EPA's ACE rule proposed a 26% reduction below 2005 levels by 2030, compared to the 2018 Rhodium Group estimate of 35% below. The ACE rule aimed to replace the CPP with a more narrow interpretation of emission reduction systems, focusing on heat rate improvement measures at existing coal-fired units. States would establish unit-specific performance standards based on a list of candidate technologies. Emission projections from the ACE proposal show a 2% difference between CPP and non-CPP scenarios. The ACE proposal aims to replace the CPP with a focus on heat rate improvements at existing coal-fired units, resulting in a 2% difference in emission projections between CPP and non-CPP scenarios. International negotiations and domestic policy developments continue to impact U.S. GHG emission levels, particularly from power plants. In 2017, electricity generation remained flat compared to 2005, while CO2 emissions decreased by 27%. Changes in the electricity generation portfolio included a decrease in coal's contribution and an increase in natural gas and renewable energy generation. These changes are expected to lead to further reductions in CO2 emissions in the electricity sector and overall U.S. GHG emissions. Total U.S. GHG emissions are projected to continue declining, with analysts providing a range of emission forecasts based on different scenarios. The EIA's Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) publications offer annual CO2 emission projections, emphasizing that these are modeled projections, not predictions. Actual CO2 emissions between 1990 and 2017 have generally aligned with selected EIA emission projections from past years. The EIA's Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) publications provide CO2 emission projections, which have consistently overestimated actual emissions. For example, the AEO from 2006 projected CO2 emissions to be almost 6.9 billion metric tons in 2017, 33% higher than observed emissions. More recent projections (AEO 2015 and AEO 2018) suggest CO2 emissions will remain flat or decline slightly through 2025."
