It marked a shift in federal election administration by setting requirements and providing federal support, including funding for states to meet requirements and improve election administration. The EAC manages election administration funding and shares information. The EAC manages election administration funding and shares information, with debates in Congress over its permanence and regulatory authority. The 112th Congress saw efforts to limit or eliminate the EAC, while its role in responding to foreign interference in the 2016 elections has sparked discussions on extending or expanding its mandate. The report provides an overview of the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), its duties, funding, history, and legislative activity. It also discusses considerations for Congress regarding oversight and potential legislative action. The EAC's role in election administration funding and response to foreign interference in the 2016 elections has sparked debates over its permanence and regulatory authority. The Election Assistance Commission (EAC) was created by HAVA in response to issues with the 2000 elections, particularly in Florida. Recommendations were made for federal partnerships with states to prevent future problems. There were debates on the specifics of these partnerships, including federal funding. Members in Congress debated federal funding for election improvements and guidance on voting system standards. Disagreements arose over the extent of federal involvement in election administration, with concerns about shifting authority from states to the federal government or the inability of states to make necessary changes without federal intervention. These debates impacted discussions on the Election Assistance Commission's role in federal election administration responsibilities. The debate in Congress revolves around whether new federal election administration responsibilities should be handled by existing federal entities like the FEC's Office of Election Administration or a new agency, and if these responsibilities should focus solely on supporting states and localities or include broader authority to compel action. The EAC was established as a compromise, primarily serving a support role for state and local governments, as emphasized by Representative Robert Ney during the bill's markup. The EAC was established as a compromise from HAVA, primarily serving a support role for state and local governments. Its duties, structure, and funding are outlined, with limited power to compel action. Enforcement of national election administration requirements is handled by the DOJ and state-based procedures, not the EAC. The agency's rulemaking is restricted to voter registration reports and federal mail voter registration forms. The EAC, established by the HAVA, primarily serves a support role for state and local governments. It can trigger DOJ investigations, revoke voting system certifications, and audit grantees. Its duties include administering funding and collecting/sharing information. The EAC administers federal funding for election improvements, including grant programs authorized by HAVA and an election data collection grant program funded by the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act. Congress allocated $380 million for HAVA payments to states in FY2018 due to concerns about foreign interference in the 2016 elections. Prior funding was provided in FY2010. The EAC's administrative responsibilities extend beyond the fiscal year, managing multiyear funds and providing technical assistance to recipients. The EAC provides technical assistance and audits grantees to ensure proper fund usage. HAVA integrated the FEC's OEA into the EAC, transferring its functions and staff. The OEA previously served as a clearinghouse for election administration information. The EAC's mandate includes creating federal standards for voting systems, producing voter registration reports, and maintaining a federal mail voter registration form. It conducts election administration research and shares expertise with stakeholders, producing the Election and Voting Survey after each federal general election. The EAC conducts various studies and reports mandated by NVRA and HAVA, including military and overseas voting, voter identification, and election administration research. It also provides resources like Quick Start Guides for election managers and facilitates information exchanges among stakeholders. The EAC coordinates with election administration stakeholders through various activities, including publishing best practices, convening meetings, and responding to reports of foreign interference in elections. It inherited voting system guidelines and certification responsibilities from the FEC and NASED. The EAC took over voting system guidelines and certification responsibilities from the FEC and NASED. The VSS were replaced by the VVSG at the EAC, which are drafted by the TGDC and reviewed before adoption. The commissioners are responsible for accrediting testing labs, certifying voting systems, and issuing advisories to manufacturers. The EAC replaced the VSS with the VVSG, which are drafted by the TGDC. NIST provides technical support and monitors testing labs. The VVSG were first adopted in 2005, updated in 2015, and a second update (VVSG 2.0) was in progress as of May 2019. VVSG 2.0 separates higher-level principles from technical details. The VVSG 2.0, released for public comment on February 28, 2019, sets out function-based principles and guidelines for voting systems. States can choose to adopt the guidelines under their own laws, including requirements for testing by federally accredited labs. HAVA established national election administration standards. HAVA established new national election administration requirements, including standards for voting systems and provisions for provisional voting. The EAC provides voluntary guidance on how to meet these requirements, such as creating and maintaining a statewide voter registration list. States can choose to adopt the guidance, which includes options for either a \"top-down\" or \"bottom-up\" system for managing voter registration data. The EAC issues voluntary guidance for HAVA enforcement, with a four-member commission and advisory bodies. State and local officials contribute to the agency's functioning through these bodies, providing expertise and input. The Election Assistance Commission (EAC) has a diverse membership including state and local officials, voters, specialists, and disability access experts. The commission and advisory bodies aim for political balance, requiring a three-vote majority for certain actions. However, the quorum requirement has led to delays and inactivity. The commission consists of four members with elections experience, limiting party affiliation. Candidates are recommended by the majority or minority leadership. The Election Assistance Commission (EAC) appoints commissioners recommended by House or Senate leadership and approved by the President and Senate. Commissioners serve four-year terms, with the possibility of reappointment for one additional term. The commission selects a chair and vice chair annually from different political parties. Certain actions require a three-vote majority. The commission sets EAC policy, including appointing key positions and adopting guidance. The EAC appoints an executive director and general counsel, promulgates regulations for voter registration reports, and federal mail voter registration form. The executive director oversees day-to-day operations, policy recommendations, and administrative affairs. The EAC's staff size has varied over the years. The EAC's staff size has varied over the years, with transfers of full-time equivalent staff (FTEs) and caps on the number of FTEs maintained. HAVA created three advisory bodies for the EAC, each playing important roles in the agency's functioning. The Board of Advisors and Standards Board review guidance and VVSG before commissioner adoption, and in the event of an executive director vacancy, search committees are appointed by the boards. The EAC's Board of Advisors has 35 members, with representation from state and local officials, federal entities, science and technology professionals, and voter representatives. The commission consults with the boards on research efforts, program goals, and long-term planning, as well as NIST on monitoring voting system testing labs. The Standards Board of the EAC has 110 bipartisan and geographically representative members, including two representatives from each eligible U.S. jurisdiction. The board selects nine members for its Executive Board, with limitations on consecutive terms and political party affiliations. The TGDC, with 15 members, assists the executive director. The 15-member Technical Guidelines Development Committee (TGDC) assists the executive director of the EAC in developing and maintaining the VVSG. The committee is chaired by the Director of NIST and includes members from various organizations with voting system-related expertise. The EAC is required to have an Office of Inspector General (OIG) under HAVA and the Inspector General Act of 1978. The EAC's OIG oversees audits of HAVA funding use, resolves issues identified in audits, and conducts internal audits and investigations of the EAC's finances and compliance with federal laws. This includes addressing instances where grant costs are undocumented, impermissible spending is identified, and inadequate documentation is found. The EAC's OIG oversees audits of HAVA funding use, resolves issues identified in audits, and conducts internal audits and investigations of the EAC's finances and compliance with federal laws. This includes addressing instances where grant costs are undocumented, impermissible spending is identified, and inadequate documentation is found. The EAC receives operational funding for salaries, expenses, and grants administration, with appropriations under the jurisdiction of the Financial Services and General Government Subcommittees. The EAC received operational funding for salaries, expenses, and grants administration from FY2003 to FY2005, with appropriations falling short of authorized amounts in the first two fiscal years. The House Appropriations Committee recommended cuts to the agency's budget from FY2012 to FY2018, but enacted bills aligned more closely with presidential and Senate proposals. Congress appropriated $10.8 million for EAC salaries and expenses in FY2005, the final year of explicitly authorized operational funding. The EAC received operational funding from FY2003 to FY2005, with appropriations falling short of authorized amounts in the first two fiscal years. Despite the lack of explicit authorization after FY2005, the agency continued to receive operational funding. Some Members have proposed reauthorizing appropriations for EAC operations, but none of the proposals have been enacted as of May 2019. It took time for the EAC to become operational due to delays in appointing commissioners, leading to inactivity and missed deadlines. The EAC faced delays in becoming operational due to funding and commissioner appointment issues, leading to inactivity and missed deadlines. Efforts to limit or eliminate the agency began in the 112th Congress, but recent concerns about election security have sparked new support for the EAC. The EAC faced funding and commissioner appointment delays in FY2003 and FY2004, affecting its ability to perform duties. Concerns were raised in a 2004 oversight hearing about missed deadlines for adopting voluntary guidance, hindering states' ability to meet HAVA requirements. The EAC faced funding and commissioner appointment delays in FY2003 and FY2004, affecting its ability to perform duties. Some deadlines for conducting statutorily mandated research had passed before commissioners were sworn in, limiting the scope of their projects. Commissioner Ray Martinez expressed frustration at the lack of research-based guidance for states on implementing election measures due to limited funds. The EAC has very limited funds and there is debate about its longevity. Some view it as a permanent agency due to its essential tasks like updating the VVSG and providing assistance to states, while others see it as temporary. The EAC has faced calls for its elimination due to ongoing issues with performance management, information security, and overhead expenses. Bills have been introduced to terminate the agency, and its operational funding may be cut or eliminated. The EAC has faced calls for its elimination due to ongoing issues with performance management, information security, and overhead expenses. The Senate stopped confirming nominees to the EAC, leading to a loss of members and a lack of policymaking quorum. This prevented the commission from updating the VVSG, a consequence of the FEC's failure to keep the VSS up to date. The FEC's failure to keep the VSS up to date led to a 10-year gap in updating the VVSG. Foreign interference in elections prompted DHS to designate election systems as critical infrastructure, with Congress allocating $380 million for election technology and security enhancements. The EAC administered the payments to states in response. The EAC was charged with administering new payments to states and played a role in setting up special channels for sharing threat information and coordinating critical infrastructure. It has focused on election security by providing IT management trainings for election officials and producing resources for voters. Supporters advocate for a permanent role for the EAC due to its participation in federal election security efforts. The EAC has been supported for its role in federal election security efforts, with proposals for increased operational funding and legislative activity to define its role. Proposals have focused on how the EAC performs its role rather than the nature of the role itself. The EAC manages election administration funding, provides guidance, expertise, research, and connects stakeholders. Members have suggested tasks for the EAC, such as administering grants for audits and setting standards for poll books. There are disagreements about the federal role in election administration. Some post-HAVA legislative proposals have suggested expanding or eliminating the EAC, with debates about its funding and permanence. The EAC was nearing completion of HAVA projects by the 112th Congress, with discussions on the agency's future role. Some Members felt the EAC was no longer necessary due to other agencies handling similar responsibilities. Bills were introduced to disband the EAC and transfer its duties. Other proposals suggested giving the EAC new powers, such as lifting limits on rulemaking or directing state actions. Some proposals aim to expand the Election Assistance Commission's authority by imposing penalties for noncompliance with election administration requirements or changing its structure and procedures to address operational weaknesses. Some proposals aim to address perceived weaknesses in the Election Assistance Commission's operations, such as inefficiencies in current processes and conflicts of interest. Congress has oversight authority over the EAC and can legislate on election administration. Selected examples of structural and procedural proposals are presented in Table 5. The Election Assistance Commission (EAC) is subject to oversight by Congress, which can legislate on election administration. Some proposals suggest addressing weaknesses in the EAC's operations, including inefficiencies and conflicts of interest. New expertise may be needed to address emerging election security threats, prompting considerations on how to provide the EAC access to specialized experience or expertise. Options include consulting with specialist organizations, funding specialized staff, or creating specialized departments within the agency. The Election Assistance Commission (EAC) may need to address weaknesses in its operations, including inefficiencies and conflicts of interest. Options to enhance expertise in election security threats include consulting with specialist organizations, funding specialized staff, or creating specialized departments within the agency. Additionally, considerations on assigning responsibilities to other federal agencies or in different ways have been raised. The EAC may need to address weaknesses in its operations and enhance expertise in election security threats. Questions arise about which federal agencies are best positioned to handle election administration duties. Assessing resource needs, including funding for agency operations and distribution to states, is crucial. The EAC needs to assess its resource needs, including funding for agency operations and distribution to states. Congress may consider ways to reduce delays caused by the quorum requirement for official action by the commission. The EAC may need to address delays caused by the quorum requirement for official action. Options to reduce delays could include structural or procedural changes to the commission. HAVA envisioned the EAC providing guidance on national election administration requirements before states had to meet them, allowing for review before finalizing actions. Legislative proposals have also called for new requirements and EAC guidance, raising questions on setting deadlines for research and adoption of guidance. The EAC may need to address delays in adopting guidance for national election administration requirements. Legislative proposals raise questions about setting deadlines for research and adoption of guidance."
