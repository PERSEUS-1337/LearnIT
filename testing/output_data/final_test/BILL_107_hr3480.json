    "content": "The Upper Mississippi River Basin Protection Act of 2001 establishes a monitoring network for sediment and nutrients, with responsibilities for data collection, collaboration with other monitoring efforts, cost-sharing requirements, reporting, and a National Research Council assessment. Additionally, it includes provisions for computer modeling and research. The Upper Mississippi River Basin Protection Act of 2001 includes provisions for computer modeling, electronic information distribution, and reporting requirements. Authorization of appropriations is also outlined in the legislation. The Upper Mississippi River Basin Protection Act of 2001 defines key terms such as \"Upper Mississippi River Basin\" and \"Upper Mississippi River Stewardship Initiative\" for monitoring nutrient and sediment loss. \"Sound science\" is defined as using the best available scientific information. The curr_chunk provides information and techniques for natural resource management in the Upper Mississippi River Basin, including identifying needs, implementing conservation measures, and assessing treatment results. Federal investments in the Upper Mississippi River Basin must be guided by sound science, including the establishment of a sediment and nutrient monitoring network. The Secretary of the Interior will establish a sediment and nutrient monitoring network for the Upper Mississippi River Basin to identify sources, quantify processes, record changes over time, provide data for computer modeling, and identify major sources of sediment and nutrients. The United States Geological Survey, under the Secretary of the Interior, will establish a sediment and nutrient monitoring network in the Upper Mississippi River Basin. Monitoring information will be headquartered at the Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center in La Crosse, Wisconsin. SEC. 102. DATA COLLECTION AND STORAGE RESPONSIBILITIES. The Secretary of the Interior will establish guidelines for sediment and nutrient monitoring data collection, storage, and reporting. Data from the Upper Mississippi River Basin monitoring will be released to the public with generic identifiers. Privacy protection measures will be in place for data collected in the Basin. The data collected in the Upper Mississippi River Basin will be subject to mandatory disclosure provisions but can only be released as specified in subsection (b). SEC. 103. RELATIONSHIP TO EXISTING SEDIMENT AND NUTRIENT MONITORING. The Secretary of the Interior will inventory existing sediment and nutrient monitoring efforts to understand overlap, data gaps, and redundancies. They will integrate these efforts into the monitoring network required by section 101, making maximum use of existing data and programs. The Secretary of the Interior will coordinate with the Lower Estuary Assessment Group to develop the sediment and nutrient monitoring network required by section 101. SEC. 104. Collaboration with other public and private monitoring efforts. The Secretary of the Interior will collaborate with Federal, State, tribal, local, and private sediment and nutrient monitoring programs to establish the monitoring network. SEC. 105. Cost share requirements. SEC. 105. COST SHARE REQUIREMENTS. Non-Federal sponsors must cover at least 25% of network maintenance costs, with up to 80% allowed through in-kind contributions. Existing State or local monitoring efforts meeting guidelines are exempt from cost share requirements. The National Research Council will conduct a water resources assessment of the Upper Mississippi River Basin. Additionally, there will be computer modeling and research on sediment and nutrient sources. The Director of the US Geological Survey will establish a modeling program to identify sediment and nutrient sources in the Upper Mississippi River Basin. Computer modeling will target subwatersheds for sediment and nutrient reduction efforts, including models for nutrient and sediment loss related to landscape and land management practices, as well as river channel nutrient transformation processes. Models will define river channel nutrient transformation processes. Ancillary information collected in GIS format includes land use, soils, elevation, sediment and nutrient reduction actions, and remotely sensed data. Computer modeling information will be headquartered at the Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center in La Crosse, Wisconsin. The Director of the US Geological Survey will establish an Internet system within 90 days to provide information on programs, sediment/nutrient levels, and successful projects in the Upper Mississippi River Basin. Reporting requirements are also outlined. SEC. 203. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. The Director of the US Geological Survey will provide annual reports on monitoring activities in the Upper Mississippi River Basin and progress reports on modeling activities every three years. Authorization of appropriations for the Secretary of the Interior is set at $6,250,000 annually. An additional $650,000 is allocated for the National Research Council to conduct a water resource and water quality management assessment as required by section 107."
