    "content": "The report discusses the challenges of enforcing child support obligations in international cases where the custodial parent and child live in one country and the noncustodial parent lives in another. The United States has not ratified a multilateral child support enforcement treaty. The report also provides an overview of the current Child Support Enforcement system and the 2007 Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support. Additionally, it includes information on H.R. 1896, a bill in the 113th Congress that aims to implement the Hague Convention. H.R. 1896, introduced in the 113th Congress, aims to implement the Hague Convention on International Recovery of Child Support. Proponents argue that noncustodial parents living abroad should still provide child support for their children in the United States. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program, enacted in 1975, aims to secure financial support for children from noncustodial parents and help families remain self-sufficient. It provides services such as parent location, paternity establishment, and collection of child support payments. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program operates in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and three U.S. territories. States receive federal matching funds and incentive payments to run effective programs. State CSE programs are typically managed at the county-level by various government departments. Compliance with federal requirements is necessary to receive funding. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program is administered at the federal level by the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). State CSE programs have authority to use various methods to collect child support, including income withholding, intercept of tax refunds, liens against property, and reporting to credit bureaus. Additionally, states have civil or criminal contempt-of-court procedures and criminal nonsupport laws. The 1996 welfare reform law required states to implement expedited procedures to secure assets. The 1996 welfare reform law mandated states to implement expedited procedures to secure assets for child support enforcement, including intercepting unemployment benefits, seizing lottery winnings, and restricting licenses. It also authorized the denial of passports for debtor parents. Interstate child support cases are often challenging to enforce due to jurisdictional issues between state and local governments. The federal CSE law requires states to cooperate in interstate child support enforcement, but issues arise due to the autonomy of local courts. States were mandated to enact the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA) to address jurisdictional issues in establishing and enforcing child support orders across multiple states. UIFSA resolves jurisdictional issues between states, establishes applicable laws, and ensures one state has control over child support cases. It provides rules for establishing, enforcing, and modifying child support orders across state lines. The Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA) establishes a \"one-order system\" where only one state's order governs an obligor's support obligation to any child. It also ensures that only one state has jurisdiction to modify a child support order. While the 1996 version of UIFSA is federally mandated and adopted in all states, the 2001 amendments are not required. Only 21 states and the District of Columbia have adopted the 2001 amendments to date. In July 2008, the NCCUSL approved amendments to the 2001 UIFSA to integrate provisions of the Convention adopted at the Hague Conference on Private International Law. 11 states have adopted the 2008 amendments, allowing for immediate implementation of the Convention if ratified. Prior to 1996, there was no federal or state mandate for international child support arrangements. States used their own systems for interstate child support cases before P.L. 104-193. The international enforcement of child support obligations is based on principles of comity and reciprocity. P.L. 104-193 established procedures for this purpose, allowing the Secretary of State to declare foreign reciprocating countries. These countries must have procedures for establishing paternity, support orders, and enforcement of support orders. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program facilitates the international enforcement of child support obligations through various means, including establishing paternity, support orders, enforcement, and collection of payments. The program has reciprocal agreements with 15 countries and ongoing negotiations with many others. The United States aims to establish a \"Central Authority\" to aid in support enforcement cases involving U.S. residents. The United States has state-level arrangements for child support enforcement with various countries, authorized by UIFSA. These arrangements may not be as comprehensive as federal-level agreements, and not all states have arrangements with all countries. About 1%-3% of CSE cases are international cases, where a noncustodial parent lives outside the U.S. The U.S. has not ratified multinational treaties related to child support obligations. The United States has not joined international treaties related to child support obligations, such as the Hague conventions on maintenance obligations, due to differences in jurisdictional rules. In foreign countries, jurisdiction is based on the custodial parent's habitual residence, while in the U.S., enforcement relies on obtaining personal jurisdiction over the noncustodial parent. The Convention aims to provide uniform, simple, and cost-free procedures for processing international child support cases. The Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters aims to streamline international child support cases by allowing countries to recognize and enforce each other's child support orders. The United States can benefit from joining this multilateral treaty, which draws on the U.S. experience with the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA). This would save time and expenses that would otherwise be needed to negotiate individual agreements with other countries. The Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters allows the United States to obtain reciprocal treatment from other countries for child support obligations. While U.S. courts and state agencies already enforce these obligations, many foreign countries require a treaty obligation for enforcement. The Convention addresses jurisdictional barriers and provides flexibility for establishing new support orders. The Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters allows for coordination of international child support cases between countries through central authorities. These authorities facilitate the transfer of documents and information for quick resolution of child support matters. U.S. citizens can access cost-free services for child support enforcement in contracting countries. The Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters allows for coordination of international child support cases between countries through central authorities. U.S. citizens can access cost-free services for child support enforcement in contracting countries. In cases where fees are required for Child Support Enforcement (CSE) services, a means test based on the child's income is used, resulting in minimal fees compared to current practices. The Convention and 2008 amendments to UIFSA do not affect intrastate or interstate CSE cases in the United States, focusing instead on uniform procedures for enforcement of CSE decisions in cases where the custodial parent and child live in one contracting country and the noncustodial parent lives in another. The Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance, adopted in 2007, focuses on uniform procedures for enforcement of CSE decisions and cooperation among countries. HHS will be the central authority for the United States under the Convention, designating state CSE agencies to carry out many central authority functions. The United States was the first country to sign the Convention, with other signatories including Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the European Union, Norway, and Ukraine. In July 2008, amendments to the 2001 Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA 2008) were approved to integrate provisions of the Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support. The U.S. Senate approved the Resolution of Advice and Consent regarding the Convention on September 29, 2010. Additional steps are required before the Convention is fully implemented. Before the Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support can enter into force for the United States, Congress must adopt implementing legislation, states must enact UIFSA 2008, the President must sign the instrument of ratification, and the US must deposit its instrument of ratification with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support will enter into force for the United States after a certain period following the deposit of the U.S. instrument. The Treaty will apply to cases between countries that are party to it. In the 112th Congress, H.R. 4282 was introduced in the House with implementing language for the Convention, passed by the House but not acted upon by the Senate. In the 113th Congress, H.R. 1896, similar to H.R. 4282, was introduced with implementing language for the Convention. H.R. 1896, introduced in the House on May 8, 2013, by Representative Dave Reichert, was passed on June 18, 2013, by a vote of 394-27. The bill includes provisions for implementing the Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support, along with other sections related to data exchange, database use, and budgetary effects. Its purpose is to ensure the U.S. has legal authority to comply with the Convention's obligations. H.R. 1896, known as the International Child Support Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, requires the Secretary of HHS to enforce U.S. treaty obligations related to multilateral child support conventions. It applies to cases where the custodial parent and child reside in one country, and the noncustodial parent lives in another country. The bill expands the definition of an \"authorized person\" to include entities designated as Central Authorities for child support enforcement in foreign reciprocating or treaty countries. The International Child Support Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 requires the enforcement of U.S. treaty obligations for child support in foreign reciprocating or treaty countries. The Federal Parent Locator Service assists in locating noncustodial parents and enforcing child support orders. The Federal Parent Locator Service (FPLS) assists federal and state agencies in identifying overpayments and fraud, assessing benefits, and enforcing child support orders. It includes the National Directory of New Hires, Federal Case Registry, Federal Offset Program, Federal Administrative Offset Program, and Passport Denial Program. The FPLS includes programs like the Passport Denial Program (PDP) and Multistate Financial Institution Data Match (MSFIDM) to locate individuals owing child support. It also has access to external sources like the IRS, SSA, VA, DOD, NSA, and FBI. Concerns arise about potential privacy breaches and financial fraud due to the expanded access to personal information in the FPLS. H.R. 1896 aims to give states the option to require individuals in foreign countries to apply for child support enforcement services through their country's central authority. It would amend the Social Security Act to include requests from foreign treaty countries as if they were requests from states. Concerns about data security, privacy rights, and unauthorized use of personal and financial data in the National Directory of New Hires (NDNH) have been raised in debates regarding expanded access to the NDNH. H.R. 1896 proposes amendments to the Social Security Act to include foreign treaty countries in child support enforcement services. It defines terms like \"foreign reciprocating country\" and \"2007 Family Maintenance Convention\" to establish procedures for support duties. The bill, H.R. 1896, aims to amend the Social Security Act by including foreign treaty countries in child support enforcement services. It defines terms like \"foreign reciprocating countries\" and \"2007 Family Maintenance Convention\" to facilitate support duties. H.R. 1896 proposes amending the Social Security Act to include foreign reciprocating countries and foreign treaty countries for child support enforcement. It allows states to use the Federal Income Tax Refund Offset program to collect past-due child support payments from noncustodial parents. The program involves cooperation between the federal Office of Child Support Enforcement, the IRS, and state CSE agencies. H.R. 1896 proposes amending the Social Security Act to include foreign reciprocating countries and foreign treaty countries for child support enforcement. It allows states to use the Federal Income Tax Refund Offset program to collect past-due child support payments from noncustodial parents. The bill also mandates that each state's Uniform Interstate Family Support Act must include verbatim any amendments officially adopted as of September 30, 2008, by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws to receive federal CSE funding. This ensures uniformity in procedures, requirements, and reporting forms for collecting child support across state lines. The U.S. Congress mandated that all states adopt UIFSA to facilitate collecting child support across state lines, ensuring one court has jurisdiction to establish or modify child support orders. This provision reduces duplicate and conflicting orders, promoting efficiency in the child support enforcement process. The CSE program aims to streamline child support enforcement across state lines by limiting duplicate orders and reducing forum shopping. It is suggested that requiring all states to adopt the most current version of UIFSA would improve effectiveness. H.R. 1896 clarifies that a state court with a child support order has exclusive jurisdiction to modify it. The bill clarifies that a state court with a child support order has exclusive jurisdiction to modify it, as long as the state is the child's residence or the contestants consent. If the state is not the residence and there is no consent, jurisdiction can be transferred to another state. Past-due child support obligations are treated as final judgments across states. The Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act (FFCCSOA) was passed in 1994 to address disputes between parents in different states regarding child support. It required all courts to recognize child support orders issued by other states or tribes. The 1996 welfare reform law clarified the definition of a child's home state and made revisions to ensure consistent application of full faith and credit laws with UIFSA. H.R. 1896 aims to provide further clarification on when a state can modify a child support order, stipulating that each state's UIFSA must include amendments officially adopted by the NCCUSL. The bill, H.R. 1896, requires approval by state legislatures and includes a grace period tied to their meeting schedules. It mandates that the bill becomes effective no later than the date of laws enacted by state legislatures implementing UIFSA amendments. The Secretary of HHS must issue a rule for standard data exchange elements under the CSE program. The rule for standard data exchange elements under the CSE program would incorporate non-proprietary, interoperable standards developed by recognized international bodies and federal entities. Data reporting standards would be in a widely accepted, searchable format and consistent with accounting principles. It would also allow for continual upgrades and incorporate existing nonproprietary standards like the \"eXtensible Business Reporting Language.\" The CSE program emphasizes the importance of sound data standards for electronic information exchange. Quality standards create a level playing field for software vendors serving governmental entities. With increasing system complexity, standards ensure a common vocabulary for efficient government operations. Data exchange challenges arise from disparate systems and definitions, highlighting the need for standardized data elements. The provision aims to standardize data exchange for improved information sharing between systems. It will establish common data elements and definitions for seamless interoperability. H.R. 1896 mandates the HHS Secretary to propose data exchange rules within 24 months. The HHS Secretary is required to issue a proposed rule on data exchange elements within 24 months after enactment. The rule must identify federally required data exchanges, specify and standardize timing of exchanges, and address factors for standardization. It should also include state implementation options and future milestones. H.R. 1896 allows access to data in the Federal Parent Locator Service and information from the National Directory of New Hires for research purposes related to Title IV-A of the Social Security Act. H.R. 1896 proposes restrictions on the use and disclosure of personal identifiers in data used for evaluating federal programs' effectiveness in achieving positive labor market outcomes. The agreement with HHS Secretary must address data security and usage. H.R. 1896 proposes restrictions on the use and disclosure of data for evaluating federal programs. The Secretary must ensure data is used exclusively for research purposes and minimally interferes with program operations. Research firms funded by federal agencies often rely on state-collected data for evaluations. H.R. 1896 aims to make the National Directory of New Hires (NDNH) database accessible to research contractors for evaluating federally supported programs, reducing costs and duplicative reporting. It also includes restrictions on disclosing personal identifiers to unauthorized entities. H.R. 1896 imposes penalties for unauthorized disclosure of personal identifiers and extends the time for deleting new hire reports from the National Directory of New Hires. It maintains the provision allowing the HHS Secretary to retain data samples for research purposes and includes instructions on budgetary effects."
