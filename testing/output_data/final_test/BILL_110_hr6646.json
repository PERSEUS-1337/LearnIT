Congress finds that the Taiwan Relations Act governs relations between the United States and Taiwan, including arms sales and policy to provide Taiwan with defensive arms. It considers any nonpeaceful means to determine Taiwan's future a threat to peace and security in the Western Pacific. The Taiwan Relations Act states that the United States will provide defense articles and services to Taiwan for self-defense, based on the judgment of the President and Congress. Taiwan has increased defense spending to $9.8 billion in 2007. The Defense Ministry of Taiwan requested and the Executive Yuan approved a 2008 budget of $10.6 billion, a 15% increase. The executive branch has not sent any arms transfer notifications to Congress in 2008, including pending arms sales programs worth $11 billion. President Ma Ying-jeou stated the need for defensive weapons from the US despite improved relations with China. Admiral Timothy Keating acknowledged the importance of securing defensive weapons for Taiwan. The United States Pacific Command confirmed a \"freeze\" on arms sales to Taiwan, contradicting longstanding US law and policy. SEC. 2. MANDATORY CONGRESSIONAL BRIEFINGS. The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, must provide detailed briefings to Congress on discussions with Taiwan and potential defense transfers within specified timeframes.
