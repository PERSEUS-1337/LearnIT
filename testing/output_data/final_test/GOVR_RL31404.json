    "content": "The full funding policy is a federal budgeting rule applied to DOD procurement programs since the 1950s, related to Congress's oversight responsibility. Despite affirmations by Congress, GAO, and DOD, recent DOD proposals for non-traditional funding approaches for ships, aircraft, and satellites could set new precedents. DOD's proposals for non-traditional funding approaches for ships and aircraft could set new precedents that may limit Congress's oversight of procurement programs. Congress's decision on this issue could impact DOD's budgeting practices and annual funding requirements. The full funding policy for DOD procurement programs requires the entire cost of a weapon or equipment to be funded in the year of procurement, preventing the use of incremental funding. Under incremental funding, a weapon's cost is divided into annual portions approved by Congress, allowing for progress payments to the contractor as the weapon is built. Exceptions include advance procurement funding for long production leadtimes and economic order quantity procurements in multiyear procurement programs. The full funding policy, approved for multiyear procurement (MYP), was imposed by Congress in the 1950s to enhance oversight of DOD spending. It aims to make total procurement costs visible, strengthen budget discipline, and improve Congress's control over DOD activities. Regulations for the policy are outlined in OMB Circular A-11 and DOD Directive 7000.14-R. The full funding policy for DOD procurement was implemented in the 1950s to improve oversight and budget discipline. It replaced incremental funding to make total costs visible and enhance Congress's control over DOD activities. The policy has been supported by Congress, GAO, and DOD over the years. Incremental funding in DOD procurement can increase costs and tie the hands of future Congresses. While it fell out of favor, supporters argue it can allow for expensive items to be procured without displacing other programs in the budget. Incremental funding in DOD procurement allows for expensive items to be procured without displacing other programs in the budget, avoiding potential biases and enabling better production economies. The use of incremental funding in DOD procurement aims to reduce unobligated balances, acknowledge uncertainties in predicting total procurement costs for long-term projects like ships, and maintain flexibility for future funding decisions. However, recent procurement practices, especially for Navy ships, have deviated from traditional policies, leading to funding profiles that do not align with established guidelines. The National Defense Sealift Fund (NDSF) was created by Congress as part of the FY1993 defense budget to procure, operate, and maintain DOD-owned sealift ships. Procurement of new military sealift ships and certain Navy auxiliary ships was transferred to the NDSF, leading to deviations from traditional funding policies for these ships. The National Defense Sealift Fund (NDSF) was established by Congress in FY1993 to acquire, operate, and maintain DOD-owned sealift ships. Funding for new military sealift ships and some Navy auxiliary ships was shifted to the NDSF, resulting in deviations from standard funding practices for these vessels. In some cases, funds allocated for LMSRs were used to partially finance the construction of multiple ships authorized in different years, following an oldest money first basis. The NDSF operates on an oldest money first basis, deviating from traditional full funding provisions for ship acquisition. The Navy procured various ships in the SCN account during the 1990s with funding profiles that did not conform to the full funding policy. Congress granted the Secretary of the Navy authority to enter into a contract for an LHD-1 class Amphibious Assault Ship funded on an incremental basis, specifically LHD-8. The ship LHD-8 was funded on an incremental basis, with the final increment provided in FY2006. Congress approved funding the two lead Littoral Combat Ships in the Navy's RDT&E account instead of the SCN account. This allowed the ships to bypass the full funding policy traditionally applied to DOD procurement programs. The Air Force planned to lease 100 Boeing 767 aircraft for aerial refueling tankers, but Congress revised the plan to allow for a 10-year leasing arrangement for 20 aircraft and procurement of 80 more under a multiyear contract. The tanker lease was ultimately not implemented, and there have been other non-conforming funding proposals for ships, aircraft, and satellites in recent budget submissions. The Administration proposed using incremental funding for large, expensive satellites and ships in the FY2007 and FY2008 defense budget submissions. This included split funding for an amphibious assault ship, DDG-1000 destroyers, and other military space programs. The Administration proposed split funding for the aircraft carrier CVN-78 in FY2008 and FY2009, with advance procurement funding provided between FY2001 and FY2007. Additionally, incremental funding was proposed for F-22 aircraft procurement over several years. Congress directed funding for the lead DDG-1000 destroyer in the SCN account in the FY2005 budget. The FY2004 and FY2005 defense budgets proposed procuring 60 C-17 airlift aircraft under a multiyear procurement arrangement that resembled incremental funding. This approach would reduce funding in the initial years and increase amounts requested in later years, extending incremental procurement beyond shipbuilding. In 2001 and 2005, Navy officials also advocated for advance appropriations for Navy ships. The Navy considered using advance appropriations for Navy ships to increase the number of ships under construction with available funding. This approach would allow construction to begin in a given year with only partial funding allocated, with the full procurement cost approved by Congress in a single decision. Unlike traditional full funding, advance appropriations would divide the procurement cost into increments scored across multiple budget years. Advance appropriations for Navy ships allow for the full procurement cost to be approved by Congress in a single decision, with funding divided into increments scored across multiple budget years. This concept is seen as a form of full funding, where appropriations are enacted in the current year but scored and available for obligation in later years as specified. The circular allows for the use of advance appropriations to help finance capital assets under certain circumstances. Principle 2 states that a combination of regular and advance appropriations should be proposed in the budget to provide full funding for a capital project or useful segment. The circular allows for the use of advance appropriations to finance capital assets. Full funding for a capital project or investment in the budget year is preferred to avoid tradeoffs with other spending. Advance appropriations may bias tradeoffs in favor of the proposed asset and constrain budget authority and outlays. Advance appropriations can help address funding challenges for capital projects by ensuring all budget authority is enacted in advance, promoting better planning and accountability. Navy officials support using advance appropriations for shipbuilding, noting its benefits for improved project management. In 2001, Navy officials and some Members of Congress supported advance appropriations for Navy shipbuilding, but the Office of Management and Budget did not approve the approach. Congress did not adopt advance appropriations for funding Navy ships, with the House Appropriations Committee expressing dismay at the Navy's advocacy for alternative financing mechanisms. The Committee bill includes a provision prohibiting the Defense Department from budgeting for shipbuilding programs using advanced appropriations. This provision was not included in the final version of the bill passed by Congress. Navy officials proposed using advance appropriations for procuring Navy ships in 2005. Congress has six basic options in response to proposals for non-conforming funding approaches for procurement programs: approve without added language, approve with language limiting the approach to specific programs, or reject the proposals. In response to proposals for non-conforming funding approaches for procurement programs, Congress has three options: approve without added language, approve with limiting language, or reject the proposals. The decision on setting a precedent depends on the wording used in the bill or report language. Congress may consider options for addressing legislatively the application of the full funding policy to DOD procurement programs generally, either maintaining the status quo or adding new bill or report language affirming Congress's preference for the full funding provision. Congress could decide to maintain the status quo or introduce new bill or report language regarding the full funding policy for DOD procurement programs. Options include terminating the policy, allowing DOD to choose funding approaches, or modifying the policy for certain categories of weapons or equipment. The 1996 GAO report recommended enabling agencies to use more flexible budgeting mechanisms for procurement, providing appropriate oversight and control. This could involve strengthening or expanding the scope of the policy for DOD programs, giving the full funding provision a specific basis in statute, or applying it to programs funded outside the procurement title of the DOD appropriations act. The DOD appropriations act prohibits the use of incremental funding for acquiring ships for the Department of the Navy in the FY2002 defense appropriations bill. This provision was not included in the final version of the bill. The National Defense Airlift Fund (NDAF) was established in the FY2001 defense appropriations bill for procuring airlift aircraft like the C-17. The fund directed that C-17s be procured in the NDAF instead of the Air Force's procurement account, following the full funding policy. The National Defense Airlift Fund (NDAF) was disestablished as part of Congress's action on the FY2002 defense appropriations bill, and procurement of C-17s reverted to the Air Force's aircraft procurement account. This change was in line with the requirements for other DOD procurement accounts, including budget exhibit content, reprogramming thresholds, and Congressional notification for changes in quantity. The provision of incremental funding for procurement in less than the full amount required for a complete product, with additional funding expected in subsequent years, was not included in the final version of the bill. In the final version of the bill (S. 1124) passed by Congress and signed into law (P.L. 104-106 of February 10, 1996), Congress can consider factors like its power of the purse, oversight of DOD procurement programs, future Congresses, DOD budgeting discipline, and impact on weapon procurement costs. The full funding policy is crucial for Congress to control executive branch spending, especially in DOD procurement, which forms a significant part of federal spending. The full funding policy in DOD procurement programs is a significant part of federal spending, allowing Congress to control executive branch spending. However, there are concerns that limiting this policy could reduce congressional oversight and make total weapon costs less visible. Incremental funding approaches could complicate tracking total costs and uses of weapons and equipment. The use of alternative funding mechanisms, such as revolving funds, may be considered for DOD, but the issue lies in whether these approaches would be suitable given DOD's larger budget and capital needs compared to other federal agencies. Incremental funding or non-conforming approaches could potentially commit future Congresses to funding programs initiated by previous Congresses, reducing congressional oversight. Incremental funding can enhance Congress's ability to respond to changing circumstances by allowing future congresses to stop funding projects that become unnecessary. Full funding policy is seen as imposing discipline on DOD budgeting practices and helps ensure investment trade-offs are made. Incremental funding can assist in making unbiased investment trade-offs by avoiding bias against very expensive items. It can also help in considering long-term benefits and lower life cycle operation costs. The use of incremental funding in DOD procurement programs, incorporating advanced technology, can be advantageous in budgeting by reducing unobligated balances and recognizing potential cost prediction limits for long-term projects like ships. Incremental funding and advance appropriations can allow the military to start construction on more weapons in the near term, compared to full funding. This approach may be attractive to service and industry officials due to decreased rates of weapon procurement since the 1990s. However, the full costs of weapons started this way would need to be paid in later years. Incremental funding and advance appropriations can help reduce weapon procurement costs in specific cases, such as for very expensive items like aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships. Uncertainty about future funding increments may deter firms from investing in efficient production technologies, potentially increasing costs. The use of incremental funding or advance appropriations can help reduce weapon procurement costs for expensive items like aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships. It can also allow for shifting production schedules to improve production economies in specific scenarios. The use of non-conforming funding approaches for DOD weapons procurement aims to accelerate production economies of scale in the near term, potentially reducing overall procurement costs. Factors influencing the debate include low procurement rates and the desire to modernize equipment quickly while supporting defense firms financially. The military and defense industry may be using non-conforming funding approaches to increase weapon-procurement rates in the short term, potentially weakening Congress's oversight of DOD programs. Balancing DOD procurement goals with Congress's control over spending is crucial. The Armed Services Committees approved Navy's FY2008 procurement funding for various ships and aircraft, including the amphibious assault ship LHA-6, DDG-1000 destroyers, and aircraft carrier CVN-78. The Senate committee recommended a $20-million reduction for the aircraft carrier funding. The committees report recommends a $100 million increase in funding for the Space-Based Infrared Satellite System (SBIRS) High satellites to address obsolescence issues and support satellites three and four. Significant redesign work is needed due to the gap between the acquisition of satellites one and two. This highlights funding allocation challenges for constellations with a small number of satellites. The committee directs the Secretary of Defense to submit a report outlining budgetary and programmatic implications of using Research and Development funds for small satellite constellations in limited circumstances. Alternative funding approaches and options for satellite development and testing, including a single Air Force budget line for space research, development, and testing, should also be addressed. (Page 230) Appendix A. Prior-Year Legislative Activity FY2007 FY2007 Defense The House Armed Services Committee recommended split funding for amphibious assault ship LHA-6 in FY2007 and FY2008, but not for the two lead DDG-1000 destroyers. They recommended full funding for one DDG-1000 and design funding for a second. The committee also did not approve incremental funding for F-22 aircraft procurement. Additionally, the budget request recommended incremental funding for 3 of the 7 ships in the shipbuilding program. The Navy requested funding for 3 of the 7 ships, including the construction of the next-generation destroyer DD(X) and incremental funding for the next aircraft carrier CVN-78. The committee expressed concerns about the use of incremental funding not solving the Navy's shipbuilding funding issues. Program and funding stability were highlighted as top priorities for reducing problems in shipbuilding. The committee emphasized the importance of program and funding stability in reducing shipbuilding costs and sustaining the shipbuilding industrial base. They support the full funding policy for shipbuilding to avoid incomplete funding of ships started in previous years. The Department of Defense considered a proposal for \"split funding\" for certain ships, but the committee remains in favor of full funding. The committee supports full funding for shipbuilding to maintain program and funding stability. They do not endorse incremental funding for any ship class. For the F-22 program, the committee recommends an additional $1.4 billion for procurement of 20 aircraft, as the funds requested were for subassemblies, not aircraft. The budget request for the F-22 aircraft procurement program lacked sufficient funds to procure 20 aircraft in fiscal year 2007. The budget included a multiyear acquisition strategy for 60 aircraft between fiscal years 2008 and 2010, with incremental funding over a three-year period. The Department of Defense's strategy was deemed inconsistent with the full-funding policy. The committee finds the F-22 incremental funding acquisition strategy unacceptable and recommends fully funding and procuring 20 F-22 aircraft in fiscal year. The committee recommends $2.9 billion to fully fund and procure 20 F-22 aircraft in fiscal year 2007, urging restructuring of future F-22 procurement budget plans to comply with full-funding policy. The report also addresses the use of incremental funding for military construction programs, highlighting the difference in funding policies between procurement and construction programs. The committee is concerned about the guidance to cease incremental funding for military construction projects, leading to important projects being cut from the fiscal year 2007 program. This has resulted in critical projects being deferred indefinitely, impacting military readiness and quality of life. The Department of Defense may find incremental execution more efficient for funding and constructing certain projects. The committee recommends \"re-incrementing\" two projects in the budget request, including hangar 5 at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Washington, despite a funding reduction in fiscal year 2007. The committee is troubled by the guidance to cease incremental funding for military construction projects, impacting readiness and quality of life. The committee recommends \"re-incrementing\" the project to replace a clinic at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, with full authorization for the project of $92,000,000. Senate Section 121 of the FY2007 defense authorization bill would authorize four-year incremental funding for procuring CVN-78 and future aircraft carriers. The FY2007 defense authorization bill would authorize four-year incremental funding for procuring CVN-78 and future aircraft carriers, allowing for the procurement of long-lead items for CVN-79 and CVN-80 in advance. This arrangement is similar to an economic order quantity (EOQ) setup but differs from a multiyear procurement (MYP) as these ships have not been approved for MYP. The authority granted under Section 121 covers three ships to be procured over a nine-year period. Section 121 of the FY2007 defense authorization bill authorizes incremental funding for three ships to be procured over a nine-year period. The bill also prohibits incremental funding for F-22 aircraft procurement and entering into a multiyear procurement contract for the program in FY2007. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended split funding for LHA-6 and two lead DDG-1000s. The committee also recommended incremental funding for CVN-21 class aircraft carriers over four-year periods starting with CVN-78 procurement in FY2008. The provision in the FY2007 defense authorization bill authorizes advance procurement for CVN-78, CVN-79, and CVN-80 aircraft carriers. The Navy and industry highlighted the need for stable ship requirements and increased funding to address the low shipbuilding rates driving up costs. The Secretary of the Navy's report outlines a plan to procure CVN-21 class aircraft carriers at 4-year intervals starting in FY2008. The Navy plans to procure CVN-21 class aircraft carriers at 4-year intervals starting in fiscal year 2008. Delays in procurement have increased costs, and the committee emphasizes the importance of adhering to the long-range plan for national defense strategy and affordability. Concerns about cost growth on the CVN-77 program have been raised, urging the Navy and shipbuilder to improve future aircraft carrier affordability. The committee recommends increasing funding for CVN-21 class advance procurement by $50.0 million to achieve program savings. The Secretary of the Navy is directed to review economic order quantity and long lead time material procurement for the CVN-21 class to optimize savings and avoid escalation. A report outlining advance procurement requirements for the first three vessels of the CVN-21 class is to be submitted with the fiscal year 2008 budget request. The committee recommends increasing funding for CVN-21 class advance procurement by $50.0 million to achieve program savings. The Secretary of the Navy is directed to review economic order quantity and long lead time material procurement for the CVN-21 class to optimize savings and avoid escalation. A report outlining advance procurement requirements for the first three vessels of the CVN-21 class is to be submitted with the fiscal year 2008 budget request. None of the funds authorized for advance procurement for CVN-79 and CVN-80 can be obligated prior to 30 days following receipt of the Secretary's report. The report recommends prohibiting incremental funding for the F-22 program, stating that it would set a precedent for funding aircraft and is not justified in this case. The committee disagrees with the Department of Defense's strategy to incrementally fund the F-22A aircraft procurement, stating that it is not justified and would set a precedent for funding aircraft. This decision was outlined in the conference report on H.R. 5122. The conference report on H.R. 5122 authorizes funding for CVN-21 class aircraft carriers and DDG-1000 destroyers. Congress supports the exception for split funding in FY2007 and FY2008 for the first two DDG-1000 ships but expects full funding for subsequent ships. Incremental funding for F-22A procurement is prohibited. The conference report prohibits incremental funding for F-22A fighter aircraft procurement and limits incremental funding for military construction projects as per OMB guidance. Requesting full funding for military construction projects is preferred for ensuring complete and usable facilities. The conferees support full funding for military construction projects to ensure accurate accounting of obligations. For projects over $50.0 million and exceeding 2 years, incremental funding may be used to address expenditure timing. This allows the Department of Defense to request only necessary funds for the budget year and notify contractors of potential delays due to subsequent appropriations. The conferees support full funding for military construction projects and propose using incremental funding for projects over $50.0 million and exceeding 2 years to address expenditure timing. They encourage the Department to avoid using incremental funding for projects with multiple complete and usable facilities to maintain contractor competition. The FY2007 Defense Appropriations Act (H.R. 5631 / P.L. 109-289) prohibits the use of funds for multiyear contracts unless full funding for units to be procured is requested in the budget. The House report on H.R. 5631 emphasizes the importance of full funding for military construction projects and discourages incremental funding for projects with usable facilities. The House Appropriations Committee recommended split funding for the amphibious assault ship LHA-6 in FY2007 and FY2008, but not for the two lead DDG-1000 destroyers. They instead recommended full funding for one DDG-1000 in FY2007 and did not approve incremental funding for F-22 aircraft procurement. The committee faced challenges in recommending appropriations for the Department of Defense and the intelligence community in FY2007. The House Appropriations Committee recommended full funding for one DD(X) destroyer and the F-22 fighter program, citing concerns about incremental funding impacting budget transparency and oversight. The recommended funding for the DD(X) vessel is $2,568,111,000. The House Appropriations Committee recommended full funding for one DD(X) destroyer and the F-22 fighter program. The Committee added $1.4 billion for 20 additional F-22 aircraft, citing concerns about incremental funding and budget transparency. The recommended funding for the DD(X) vessel is $2.57 billion. The Committee does not support a far-reaching policy change beyond the Navy's shipbuilding program. The Navy's proposal for incremental funding of the F-22 fighter program is contrary to Congress's full funding requirement. The Committee recommends an additional $1.4 billion for 20 F-22 aircraft in fiscal year 2007. The Senate Appropriations Committee rejected the Air Force's request to incrementally fund the next lot of F-22 fighter aircraft in fiscal year 2007. Instead, they approved the Navy's request to incrementally fund the first two DDG-1000 destroyers. The Committee added $1.4 billion to fully fund the proposed multiyear procurement of F-22A aircraft, in line with the full funding policy. The report supports the budget request for the dual lead ships in the DDG-1000 program and emphasizes that this unique acquisition strategy should not set a precedent for future shipbuilding programs. Additionally, the report mentions the Navy's budget submission for the fifth and sixth LCS flight 0 ships. The Navy is facing challenges with the procurement of LCS flight 0 ships due to additional costs not covered in the ship construction contract. The Committee recommends rescinding insufficient funds allocated for the fourth LCS flight 0 vessel in the fiscal year 2006 budget. There are concerns about cost overruns for the first two LCS flight 0 ships under construction. The Committee suggests reducing the fiscal year 2007 budget request to fully fund one LCS seaframe, instead of two, to stay on track with the procurement plan for four LCS flight 0 ships. The Navy is recommended to continue procuring four LCS flight 0 ships by the end of fiscal year 2007. The conference report on H.R. 5631 states that full funding must be requested for units to be procured through any multiyear contract. The conference report approves Navy's request for initial procurement funding for LHA(R) amphibious assault ship and first two DDG-1000 destroyers in FY2007 using split funding. The report provides $2,568,111,000 for the DDG-1000 Destroyer Program and allows Navy to split fund twin lead ships of the DDG-1000 class. The conferees approve Navy's request for initial procurement funding for LHA(R) amphibious assault ship and first two DDG-1000 destroyers in FY2007 using split funding. They are making a one-time exception to the full funding principle due to unique circumstances with the shipbuilding industrial base and the DDG-1000 program. The Navy believes the cost and schedule risk in the DDG-1000 program is low enough to permit the twin lead ship acquisition strategy. The Navy has identified the total cost to procure the twin lead ships of the DDG-1000 class as $6,582,200,000. The conferees insist that the Navy manage this program within that total cost, and will be unlikely to increase funding except in cases of emergency or natural disaster. The House Armed Services Committee emphasizes the need for acquisition and budget reforms to regain buying power. The committee criticizes the use of creative financing methods to cover increasing ship costs, stating that various procurement approaches have failed to control cost growth in vessel classes like the Virginia class submarine and future aircraft carrier CVN-21. The bill includes a provision for reports on the feasibility of capital budgeting for major defense acquisition programs. The bill includes a provision for reports on the feasibility and desirability of capital budgeting for major defense acquisition programs, which involves identifying large capital outlays, financing means, expected benefits, separate budgeting for capital assets, and long-term debt issuance for investments. The Secretary of Defense and each military department are required to submit a report to Congress by July 1, 2006. The report to Congress will analyze the feasibility and benefits of using a capital budgeting system for major defense acquisition programs. It will cover the impact on the defense industrial base, decision-making process, budget planning, and financial mechanisms needed for such a system. The Senate version of the FY2006 defense authorization bill allows for split funding for the procurement of the aircraft carrier CVN-78 from FY2007 to FY2010. The Secretary of the Navy is authorized to use split funding for the design and construction of CVN-78 in fiscal years 2007-2010, with contract payments subject to appropriations availability. Section 123 of the bill authorizes split funding for the procurement of an amphibious assault ship LHA(R) in FY2007 and FY2008, with FY2006 funding available for advance construction. $325,447,000 from the SCN account for FY2006 is allocated for design, advance procurement, and advance construction of the LHA Replacement (LHA(R)) ship. Funding for construction in FY2007 and FY2008 will also be available from the SCN account. The Navy has funding available for construction of the LHA Replacement ship. The Secretary of the Navy may enter into contracts for design, advance procurement, and advance construction in fiscal year 2006, and for detail design and construction in fiscal year 2007. Contract payments in out-years are subject to appropriations. The CVN-78 will be a new class of aircraft carrier with advanced technologies. The budget request for the new aircraft carrier program has experienced a one-year delay, pushing the delivery of CVN-78 to fiscal year 2015. This delay is due to budget constraints rather than technical issues. The cost for CVN-78 has increased by approximately $400.0 million. The Navy is exploring more flexible funding methods for large capital assets like aircraft carriers. The program of record for CVN-78 has funding split between two years, but there is a proposal to split it over four years for flexibility. The Navy is directed to provide updated funding profiles for fiscal years 2007 through 2010. The House Appropriations Committee supports the LHA(R) program and urges full funding for the ship class to ensure a sufficient budget before contract award. The report on Air Force aircraft procurement highlights the need for proper budget allocation before contract award. The budget request includes funds for long lead items for the Joint Strike Fighter. The Committee recommends requesting advance procurement funds in the fiscal year 2007 budget submission, with full funding for the aircraft in the fiscal year 2008 budget. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends providing the Navy additional reprogramming authority for fiscal year 2006 to address unforeseen funding shortfalls in shipbuilding programs. The Committee is concerned about the Navy using appropriated funds for outfitting and post delivery to cover construction shortfalls, and the new authority is provided with the understanding that this practice will not continue in the future. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends giving the Navy additional reprogramming authority for fiscal year 2006 to address funding shortfalls in shipbuilding programs. The Committee urges the Department of Defense to consider using advance appropriations for future budgets to improve the shipbuilding program. The fiscal year 2006 President's budget includes funds for the DDG-51 destroyer program for completion requirements and shutdown costs. The Department's decision to change policy and budget for final DDGs of the Class after the last ship was appropriated is concerning. Budgeting for these costs post-procurement obscures actual ship costs and overstates savings from multiyear contracts. The Navy's assertion that unfunded costs will impact contractual obligations and ship deliveries is alarming. The Navy signed a multibillion dollar contract for ships that may be non-operational and undeliverable without additional funds. The Committee requests a detailed report on the costs needed to complete the remaining ships by December 1, 2005. Until then, they recommend reducing the budget request by $195,654,000. (Page 127) The conference conferees are considering using advance appropriations to improve Navy ship procurement and save costs in the 2007 budget. They plan to request the GAO to assess the implications of this approach. The overall limit on advance appropriations for fiscal year 2007 is $23.158 billion, consistent with past budget resolutions. The SCN appropriation account is included for advance appropriations in the Senate. Senate Amendment (S.Amdt. 146) to S.Con.Res. 18, sponsored by Senator Warner and co-sponsored by others, was submitted on March 15, 2005. It aimed to increase advance appropriations in FY2007 and FY2008 by $14 billion to $37.393 billion. The amendment also included the Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy (SCN) appropriation account for advance appropriations. The Senate passed S.Con.Res. 18 on March 17, 2005. The committee's report on the bill (H.Rept. 108-491) proposed amending provisions relating to DOD multiyear procurement contracts to require written notification to congressional defense committees when cancellation costs above $100 million are not fully funded. This includes a financial risk assessment for not fully funding the cancellation ceiling. The bill proposes amending DOD multiyear procurement contracts to require written notification to congressional defense committees when cancellation costs above $100 million are not fully funded, including a financial risk assessment for not fully funding the cancellation ceiling. The bill proposes amending DOD multiyear procurement contracts to require written notification to congressional defense committees when cancellation costs above $100 million are not fully funded, including proposed funding sources to meet such costs if the contract is canceled. The proposed multiyear procurement contract requires notification to congressional defense committees for cancellation costs above $100 million, with proposed funding sources. The Senate Armed Services Committee noted full funding for the first LHA(R)-class amphibious assault ship in the FY2005 defense authorization bill. Accelerating the ship's funding in FY2005 would reduce costs by $150 million. The committee recommends an increase of $150.0 million for advance procurement and advance construction of components for the first amphibious assault ship of the LHA(R)-class. Additionally, a decrease in APAF of $280.2 million is recommended for the procurement of at least 22 F/A-22 aircraft in fiscal year 2005. The Air Force may procure more than 22 aircraft if funding allows, as approved by the Department of Defense. The Secretary of the Air Force must certify contractor compliance with delivery schedule and full program funding for multiyear procurement programs under the FY2005 Defense Appropriations Act. House Section 8008 of H.R. 4613 allows for multiyear contracts with specific conditions. The contract for procurement of Air Force aircraft does not consider recurring manufacturing costs, requires payments to be made based on incurred costs, and lacks a price adjustment for not awarding a follow-on contract. The bill provides funds for 15 C-17 aircraft procurement and advance procurement. The House Appropriations Committee criticized the Air Force for not fully funding the procurement of 15 C-17 aircraft in fiscal year 2006, stating that the Air Force ignored the law and Congress's intent by using a multiyear contract for incremental funding. This could lead to potential Anti-Deficiency Act violations and unfunded liability costs in the hundreds of millions of dollars. The Committee criticized the Air Force for entering into a multiyear contract for C-130J aircraft without agreed production levels. The contractor received a commitment for sustained production rates, but projections show shortfalls in 2007-2009, leading to increased costs for the Air Force and taxpayers. The Air Force has allowed itself to act as a sales agent for a program, potentially burdening itself and taxpayers with the costs. The Committee criticizes the Air Force for not following sound contracting principles in multiyear procurements, leading to increased costs. The Committee recommends modifications to prevent future abuses in multiyear acquisitions. The Committee criticizes the Air Force for not following sound contracting principles in multiyear procurements, leading to increased costs. Recommendations include restrictions on contract funding, advance procurement funds usage, and procurement requests for normal fabrication and assembly costs. The Committee criticizes the Air Force for flawed financial strategies in the C-17 program, including the use of a unique provision in the multiyear contract allowing for price adjustments. The Committee is displeased with the Air Force's incremental financing scheme and abuse of political support for the program. The Congress provided full funding for all 15 aircraft in the C-17 program, but the Air Force continued using advance procurement funding and high cancellation ceilings to keep production going for aircraft without approved appropriations. The Committee disapproves of this financial strategy and lack of approval for such practices. The Air Force continued production of C-17 aircraft without approved appropriations, leading to potential financial liabilities and a violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act. The Committee disapproves of this practice and includes measures to prevent future financial misconduct. The Committee disapproves of the Air Force's unauthorized production of C-17 aircraft and includes measures to prevent future financial misconduct. Additionally, the Committee has added $158.6 million and one aircraft to address the funding shortfall in fiscal year 2005, with provisions for the procurement of 15 aircraft in fiscal years 2005 and 2006. The Secretary of the Air Force is directed to fully fund the procurement of 15 aircraft in fiscal year 2006. The Committee disapproves of the Air Force's funding strategy for the C-17 program and demands additional funding for one more aircraft in fiscal year 2005. The Secretary of the Air Force is urged to fully fund the procurement of 15 aircraft in fiscal year 2006. The Committee disapproves of the Air Force's funding strategy for the C-17 program and demands additional funding for one more aircraft in fiscal year 2005. The Air Force is urged to fully fund aircraft in production, with $176,000,000 allocated for new upgrades and improvements. The Committee emphasizes the importance of fully funding the aircraft in production as the program's top priority. The report highlighted the funding request for a vessel in fiscal year 2005, costing approximately $141,600,000. The Committee insisted on full funding for the vessel in the 2005 bill to ensure its completion, following the traditional full funding policy. This approach was applied despite the vessel being acquired through the Army's research and development account. The Committee recommended increasing the budget for the construction of the first Flight 0 LCS by $107,000,000, fully funding the effort at $214,000,000 in 2005. They opposed incremental funding and provided the total amount needed for construction in one year, following the traditional full funding policy. The Navy's plan for procuring a new amphibious assault ship LHA(R) in FY2008 involves designing a ship that would alter the amphibious nature of the LHA and proposing a fully funded construction program. The Committee opposes incrementally funded construction and supports a fully funded program for design and construction. Additionally, the Navy's plan to fund the construction of Maritime Prepositioning Force (Future) ships is discussed. The report highlighted concerns about the lack of detailed information on the planned expenditures for Maritime Prepositioning Force (Future) ships funded through the National Defense Sealift Fund starting in FY2007. Despite requests for more information, details were not provided to Congress due to an ongoing study by the Center for Naval Analysis. The Committee emphasized the need for the Navy to justify its requests for appropriated funds. The Committee emphasized the need for the Navy to provide sufficient justification for appropriated funds, especially regarding the planned expenditures for Maritime Prepositioning Force (Future) ships funded through the National Defense Sealift Fund. The Committee expressed concerns about requesting funds without proper justification and preferred applying the traditional full funding policy to these ships, even though they are to be acquired through the NDSF. The Senate Appropriations Committee supports the budget request for the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) and consents to funding the construction of prototype ships for two designs in the Navy's Research and Development account. The Committee acknowledges the high technical risk of the program and grants increased flexibility for funding within the research and development account. However, it directs that all follow-on ships beyond the prototypes be fully funded in the Shipbuilding account. The conference report on H.R. 4613 requires full funding for follow-on ships beyond the prototypes of the Littoral Combat Ship designs in the Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy account. The report also mandates the procurement of 15 C-17 aircraft by the Secretary of the Air Force in fiscal year 2006. The conference report mandates full funding for follow-on ships in the Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy account. It also requires the procurement of 15 C-17 aircraft by the Secretary of the Air Force in fiscal year 2006, with additional funding provided for this purpose. Language has been included to ensure advance procurement and full funding for the aircraft. The report also addresses multiyear procurement regulations and includes a provision to prevent certain contract requirements in the future. The conference report mandates full funding for follow-on ships in the Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy account. It also requires the procurement of 15 C-17 aircraft by the Secretary of the Air Force in fiscal year 2006, with additional funding provided for this purpose. Language has been included to ensure advance procurement and full funding for the aircraft. The report also addresses multiyear procurement regulations and includes a provision to prevent certain contract requirements in the future. The conferees agree to provide $305,516,000 for advance procurement for the DD(X) class of ships instead of $320,516,000 as proposed by the Senate and no appropriation as proposed by the House. The Navy is directed to include future funding requests for the DD(X) in the Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy appropriation. Within the funds provided, $221,116,000 is only for. The conferees mandate full funding for follow-on ships in the Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy account. For the DD(X) class, $221,116,000 is allocated for design and advance procurement of the first ship, and $84,400,000 for the second ship at an alternative shipyard. No funds are to be used for long leadtime material dependent on untested DD(X) key technology. Future budget requests will cover the remaining financial needs for these ships. The Navy's Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) program is also addressed in the report. The conferees agree that all follow-on ships should be fully funded in the Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy account. The conference report on H.R. 1588 authorizes the Secretary of the Air Force to enter into a lease for aerial refueling tanker aircraft and a multiyear procurement program for up to 80 aircraft. The Secretary of the Air Force is authorized to enter into a multiyear contract for the purchase of tanker aircraft to meet Air Force requirements. The total number of tanker aircraft purchased under this contract cannot exceed 80, and the contract can be for a maximum of 10 program years. The contract can be initiated or continued as long as there are sufficient funds available. The Secretary of the Air Force can enter a multiyear contract for tanker aircraft purchases, limited to 80 aircraft over 10 years, contingent on fund availability. The FY2004 Defense Appropriations Act allows for contract performance based on annual appropriations, with cancellation payment provisions. The House Appropriations Committee merged full funding and advanced procurement appropriations for fiscal flexibility. The Navy is recommended to implement a financial flexibility strategy to manage costs within the program and avoid reprogramming funds from other high priority programs. The Senate Appropriations Committee is aware of the Navy's plan to fund ship purchases in fiscal year 2005 within the Research and Development, Navy account for the DD(X) next-generation destroyer and the Littoral Combat Ship. The Navy plans to procure the next-generation destroyer and the Littoral Combat Ship with research and development funds, followed by Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy funds for the second ship in each class in fiscal year 2006. The Committee is concerned that the Navy may not benefit from this approach as it may not learn lessons from the research, development, and testing phase before moving on to construction. The Navy plans to fund the next-generation destroyer and Littoral Combat Ship through research and development before moving on to Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy funds for the second ship in each class. The Committee directs that if these ships are funded in research and development, all acquisition rules will apply before procurement. If the Navy does not follow these policies, funding for the first ships in their class will be requested in Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy. (pages 154-155) Conference Report H.Rept. 108-283 of September 24, 2003. The Navy plans to fund the next-generation destroyer and Littoral Combat Ship through research and development before moving on to Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy funds for the second ship in each class. The conferees agree that research and development funding should not be used to procure the first ships of a class in fiscal year 2005. If the fiscal year 2005 request includes these ships in RDT&E, all acquisition rules, including technology readiness reviews and test and evaluation, must be followed before transitioning to procurement. (page 292) The provision in Section 141 requires full funding for future multiyear procurement arrangements unless authorized by Congress. It prohibits funding approaches resembling incremental funding for future MYP arrangements, like the one proposed by the Air Force for the C-17 program. This provision does not apply to the follow-on C-17 MYP arrangement approved by Congress in 2001. The Secretary of Defense may obligate funds for procurement of an end item under a multiyear contract only for a complete and usable end item. Funds for advance procurement under a multiyear contract can only be used for long-lead items necessary to meet a planned delivery schedule for major end items. The conference report on the FY2003 defense authorization bill contained a provision requiring full funding for multiyear procurement contracts. The Secretary of Defense can only obligate funds for a complete and usable end item under such contracts. The Secretary of Defense can obligate funds for advance procurement of long-lead items necessary to meet a planned delivery schedule for major end items. This provision does not apply to contracts awarded before the enactment of this Act. The conference amendment clarified that funds available under contracts awarded before the enactment of the Act cannot be used for any purpose other than what they were authorized for. This section allows for the purchase of economic order quantities of long-lead items where authorized by law. The House Appropriations Committee criticized the Air Force's budgeting approach for the C-17 aircraft, which delays requesting $1.5 billion until 2007 and 2008, using incremental funding instead of full funding. This change was referred to as \"transformation\" by the Air Force, but the committee called it incremental funding. The Air Force's budgeting approach for the C-17 aircraft, referred to as \"transformation\", involves using incremental funding instead of full funding. This approach allows costs to be pushed off onto future years, despite being inconsistent with DOD fiscal policy. The Air Force proceeded with incremental funding despite Congress denying special authority for it, reinterpreting regulations to justify their approach. The Air Force's budgeting approach for the C-17 aircraft involves using advance procurement funding, which is not consistent with DOD fiscal policy. The Committee directs the Air Force to use fiscal year 2003 C-17 Advance Procurement to support the acquisition of 15 C-17 aircraft in fiscal year 2004 and to restructure outyear funding to comply with proper use of advance procurement as defined in the FMR. The Senate Appropriations Committee supports the C-17 program and the procurement of 60 additional airplanes. They recommend fully funding the C-17 multiyear procurement request and reducing amounts for Navy shipbuilding programs. The Air Force has not requested sufficient funding to purchase 15 C-17 aircraft per year as recommended. The Senate Appropriations Committee disapproves the Air Force's C-17 financing proposal, recommending full funding of $585,900,000 for 15 aircraft in fiscal year 2003. They plan to work with the Air Force to ensure cost-effective execution of the procurement program. The Committee also addresses the Navy's advance procurement funding requests for shipbuilding programs. The Senate Appropriations Committee disapproves the Air Force's C-17 financing proposal and recommends full funding for 15 aircraft in fiscal year 2003. They plan to work with the Air Force to ensure cost-effective execution of the procurement program. The Committee notes inconsistencies in the Navy's advance procurement funding requests for shipbuilding programs, exceeding 30% of the total cost of the vessel. The Committee recommends reallocating funds from advance procurement to cover costs of prior year Navy shipbuilding programs, fully funds increased costs for DDG-51 and LPD-17 class workload, and supports the Virginia Class submarine program. The conference report on H.R. 5010 addresses the C-17 multiyear procurement funding request. The C-17 multiyear procurement funding request in the Department of Defense's fiscal year 2003 budget submission did not fully fund the purchase of 15 C-17 cargo aircraft per year, creating a future liability for the Air Force and Congress. The conference agreement includes an increase of $585,900,000 to fully fund the purchase of 15 C-17 aircraft in fiscal year 2003. The full funding policy, also known as up-front funding, is consistent with two basic laws regarding executive branch expenditures\u2014the Antideficiency Act of 1870, as amended, and the Adequacy of Appropriations Act of 1861. This policy directs that funds within the \"Aircraft Procurement, Air Force\" account be used for advance procurement of 15 aircraft. Laws enacted by Congress since 1870 respond to abuses of executive branch expenditure of funds. The Antideficiency Act of 1870 and the Adequacy of Appropriations Act of 1861 prevent agencies from obligating funds without specific statutory authority or exceeding appropriations. Agencies must budget for full contract costs upfront and cannot enter into contracts without legal authorization or adequate appropriations. OMB Circular A-11 provides guidance to executive branch agencies on these matters. Circular A-11 from the Office of Management (OMB) guides executive branch agencies on budget submissions to Congress, emphasizing full funding for capital asset acquisition projects to comply with Administration policy and the Antideficiency Act. It requires agencies to have sufficient budget authority for unconditional obligations under contracts. Good budgeting requires full appropriations for asset acquisition to ensure all costs and benefits are considered. Failure to fully fund capital assets can lead to poor planning, higher costs, project delays, and inadequate funding for maintenance. Circular A-11 emphasizes the need for full funding for capital projects to comply with Administration policy and the Antideficiency Act. The investment must be fully funded with appropriations before any obligations can be incurred. Full funding with regular appropriations is essential for good budgeting to ensure all costs and benefits are considered. Circular A-11 emphasizes the need for full funding for capital projects to comply with Administration policy and the Antideficiency Act. Full funding with regular appropriations in the budget year is crucial for making decisions on providing resources. It allows for more efficient work planning, accountability for achieving goals, and the use of performance-based contracts. Funding capital projects in increments can lead to poor planning, higher costs, and the risk of cancellation or inadequate funding. The DOD Directive 7000.14-R emphasizes the policy of full funding for procurements covered in the annual DOD Appropriations Act. This includes providing funds upfront for the total estimated cost of a program and ensuring each fiscal year has funding for a complete end item without relying on future funding. Exceptions to this policy exist for efficient production of major defense systems. The DOD Directive 7000.14-R emphasizes full funding for procurements in the annual DOD Appropriations Act, providing funds upfront for total estimated costs. Exceptions for efficient production of major defense systems include advance procurement for long lead-time items and advance economic order quantity (EOQ) procurement. EOQ can be requested for annualized procurements on an exception basis for unusual circumstances. Both efforts must be identified in an Exhibit P-10 when the Budget Estimate Submission is submitted to OSD and Congress. Congressional Hearings and Reports discuss the origins and rationale for the full funding policy, reaffirmed periodically by Congress, GAO, and DOD. The 1969 GAO report outlines the origins and early regulations of the full funding provision for Navy shipbuilding, which was initially applied in 1951. This report is significant as it provides a detailed history of the policy, including how Congress appropriated funds for the entire cost of Navy shipbuilding. After the passage of the act in 1951, Congress appropriated funds for Navy shipbuilding programs based on prevailing prices, without accounting for potential cost increases. Congressman Mahon emphasized the practice of providing funds upfront for total estimated costs to ensure transparency. The Committee discovered contracts for materials were partially funded during hearings. The Committee discovered contracts for materials were partially funded with the expectation of completing financing through succeeding years appropriations. It is recommended to prevent this practice in the future to ensure procurement funds are used effectively. The Office of the Secretary of Defense issued a directive in response to these concerns to ensure orderly execution of procurement programs within available funds. The directive issued by the Office of the Secretary of Defense emphasizes the importance of having adequate appropriations and funds available before authorizing any procurement of material, equipment, or services. Estimates must be based on the latest firm prices to ensure effective use of procurement funds. The directive from the Office of the Secretary of Defense emphasizes the importance of using firm prices for estimates in procurement actions. It requires all procurements after fiscal year 1957 to adhere to full funding policies. Exceptions may be granted by the Secretary of Defense, such as for Air Force projects like the intermediate range ballistic missile and intercontinental ballistic missile. The directive from the Office of the Secretary of Defense mandates full funding policies for procurements after fiscal year 1957, with exceptions allowed by the Secretary of Defense for projects like the intermediate range ballistic missile and intercontinental ballistic missile. A letter from the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) further explains the implementation of the directive and its alignment with Congress' funding principles for DOD procurement programs. The Assistant Secretary explained the full funding principle, ensuring total estimated costs are covered for items or programs presented for approval. This includes funds set aside for immediate and future obligations to complete delivery of end items and initial spares. Additionally, full funding is clarified for preproduction preparations of new items to be procured and placed in production in a subsequent year. The full funding concept ensures total estimated costs are covered for items or programs presented for approval, including funds for immediate and future obligations. It also clarifies preproduction preparations for new items to be procured and placed in production in a subsequent year. Military services issued formal implementation instructions on full funding at different times, with exceptions granted to certain Air Force programs in the fiscal year 1963 budget. The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) believed in 1962 that realistic programs and budgets for Air Force ballistic missiles should be fully funded. Instructions were issued to develop the fiscal year 1964 budget with new obligational authority to fully fund missile procurement programs. This required a shift in Air Force missile contracting to total cost delivery for a specific number of missiles. The procurement program for shipbuilding within DOD has been consistently reviewed and revised with respect to full funding due to the long lead time of 3 to 7 years. Prior to the fiscal year 1961 budget, ship cost estimates were based on design concepts and labor/material rates, with increases funded in subsequent years or by reducing programs. The fiscal year 1961 budget introduced a new policy in financing shipbuilding programs. The fiscal year 1961 budget introduced \"end cost\" budgeting for shipbuilding programs, including estimates for construction and conversion costs, growth factors, and deficiencies correction. The period for cost estimates was shortened to 11 months after preliminary acceptance trials or post-shakedown availability. The Navy Program/Budget Decision in 1968 refined full funding for ship programs, aligning shipbuilding procurement with aircraft and electronics. This change reduced funding requirements for shipbuilding programs in fiscal year 1969 and prior years. Bureau of the Budget Circular No. A-11 from July 1962 emphasized the need for major procurements to account for outfitting and postdelivery costs. The Bureau of the Budget Circular A-11 in July 1962 and a revision in 1968 emphasized the concept of full funding for major procurement programs, ensuring complete financing of the entire cost. This concept aligns with the term \"full funding\" as used in DOD Directive 7200.4 and refers to having adequate obligational authority available. The 1973 House Appropriations Committee Report emphasized the importance of full funding for DOD procurement programs and warned against the abuse of advance procurement funding exceptions. The concept of \"advance procurement\" is a specific exception to the general rule of \"full funding\" in military equipment procurement. Full funding requires each annual budget request to contain all necessary funds for complete delivery of end items. Advance procurement allows budgeting for components in advance of the end item budget. This exception is clearly defined in DOD Directive 7200.4. The House Budget Committee reviewed the full funding policy in a 1978 hearing, focusing on the Carter Administration's proposal to expand the policy to additional programs. The Department of Defense has not always adhered to rules regarding advance procurement funding, leading to concerns about potential abuses. The Committee requested the Secretary of Defense to personally review advance procurement funding requests for the fiscal year 1975 budget to ensure compliance with established rules. If future abuses occur, the Committee may reconsider the advance procurement technique itself. The House Budget Committee reviewed the full funding policy in a 1978 hearing, focusing on the Carter Administration's proposal to expand the policy to additional programs in the Federal budget. John R. Quetsch, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary (Comptroller) at the Department of Defense, provided DOD's perspective on the history and application of the full funding policy. He mentioned the policy's origins in the Navy shipbuilding program in 1951 and its gradual expansion to other procurement programs. In 1961, the Department of Defense proposed including all predicted costs through completion of ship construction to address budget issues. GAO's 1969 report led to the update and strengthening of DOD directive 7200.4. The policy was endorsed in the 1973 House Appropriation Committee report, creating an incentive to manage programs within budget estimates. The reprogramming of funds for procurement and military construction programs is based on the full funding principle, which ensures visibility for Congress and the public. Incremental funding would lead to uncertainty in planning and higher costs for DOD procurement and construction programs. The Department of Defense prefers full funding for procurement and military construction to maintain management control and discipline, as it ensures visibility for Congress and the public. Incremental funding may reduce unobligated balances but would still require funds for contingencies and uncertainties. Ultimately, expenditures, not unobligated balances, influence the government's need to borrow money. The Department of Defense supports full funding for procurement and military construction to maintain control and visibility for Congress. Incremental funding may seem tempting but would result in additional costs and operational problems. The Department of Defense emphasizes the importance of full funding for procurement and military construction to maintain control and visibility for Congress. Internal problems include human resistance to discipline and unrealistic cost estimates, leading to the need for constant review. The Department of Defense faces challenges with unrealistic cost estimates and the need for constant review to ensure realistic and achievable costs. Despite some successful resistance to cost growth and escalation, unexpected inflation can still pose a problem. While the full funding approach has saved money, it has sometimes come at the expense of other programs, leading to cancellations or reductions to maintain discipline and program completion. The program manager's discipline in adhering to budget commitments is crucial for program success. Full funding ensures accountability and accurate reporting, unlike incremental funding which lacks oversight. This approach allows for monitoring project spending against original estimates, promoting transparency and accountability. The project manager is accountable for spending against original estimates and obligations. Full funding provides transparency and accountability in government records. The President supports full funding for budget proposals to understand total costs, increase flexibility, and achieve economic construction progress. Full funding allows for program continuity, eliminates uneconomic start-up costs, and provides agencies with the ability to contract for the full cost of items like ships without budget cuts or delays. This concept contrasts with previous annual incremental funding methods, particularly in shipbuilding procurement, where funds were granted for only portions of the project each year. The 1996 GAO report emphasized the importance of full funding for federal capital assets to ensure efficient project completion, control overall expenditures, and assess budget impact on the economy. Up-front funding is crucial to prevent delays, cost overruns, and distortion of budget allocation. The 1996 GAO report highlighted the significance of full funding for federal capital assets to ensure efficient project completion and control overall expenditures. Up-front funding is essential to prevent delays, cost overruns, and distortion of budget allocation. Some agencies, like the Army Corps of Engineers, have been exempt from the up-front funding requirement, but OMB is pushing for consistent application across the government. The requirement for budget authority to be provided up-front was established over 100 years ago to address past issues of agencies committing the government to payments exceeding available resources. The importance of up-front funding for federal agencies was emphasized in the 1967 Report of the President's Commission on Budget Concepts. It ensures efficient resource allocation decisions and highlights the impact of the federal budget on the economy for the formulation of fiscal policy. The up-front funding for federal agencies is crucial as it has the most significant economic impact on the private sector when decisions are made. Failure to recognize the full cost of expenditures could lead to resource allocation distortions, favoring certain types of spending like physical assets. This could result in an inaccurate reflection of the nation's needs, neglecting other beneficial long-term spending areas such as research and development and human capital. Failure to fully fund capital projects at the time of commitment can lead to future constraints on resources for Congress and administrations, forcing them to prioritize past commitments over current needs. This can result in less flexibility in annual resource allocation and hinder the ability to address changing priorities. In the final chapter of its report, GAO emphasized the importance of full up-front funding for capital projects to ensure fiscal control and long-term cost comparisons. Failure to practice full up-front funding can commit the government to projects without considering long-term affordability, leading to future constraints on resources and reduced flexibility to address new needs. Incremental funding may lock Congress into future spending patterns and disadvantage fully funded projects in the budget process. Full up-front funding for capital projects is crucial to ensure fiscal control and long-term cost comparisons. However, fully funded projects may be disadvantaged in competition with incrementally funded projects, even if they cost less in the long run. Agencies need financing tools that provide fiscal control while enabling prudent capital decisions within the current budget framework. Various capital budgeting proposals have been suggested, but concerns have been raised about their impact on fiscal accountability and control. The GAO observed that full up-front funding is essential for making trade-offs in budget decisions. While some recommend a full-scale capital budget, more modest tools like revolving funds and investment components can also facilitate capital spending. Revolving funds, investment components, and budgeting for stand-alone stages can help accommodate up-front funding without raising congressional or fiscal control issues. The GAO report recommended enabling agencies to use more flexible budgeting mechanisms to manage the dilemma of absorbing the entire cost of expensive acquisitions in annual budgets. Budgeting mechanisms like revolving funds and investment components allow agencies to accumulate resources over time for capital needs, promote full costing of programs, and provide funding predictability for long-range planning. These tools are becoming increasingly important in helping managers and Congress identify program costs and manage capital assets as GPRA moves towards full implementation. The GAO briefed Senate committees on the implications of changing Navy shipbuilding funding from incremental to full funding in response to a request from the Senate Budget Committee in August 2000. The briefing concluded that such a change would impact future DOD budgets. Moving from incremental to full funding for Navy shipbuilding would limit the procurement of additional ships within a set budget. Incremental funding reduces budget authority for new ships in future fiscal years due to funds being allocated to complete partially funded ships from previous years. Cost growth risks exist for all capital projects, impacting both fully funded and incrementally funded projects. Any cost growth on partially funded ships would further decrease funding for new ships. Budgetary implications and acquisition management issues are also associated with incremental funding for the Navy and other agencies. Incremental funding for Navy shipbuilding erodes fiscal flexibility and limits cost visibility and accountability, according to DOD and OMB officials. It may lead to underestimated acquisition costs and hinder contractors from taking advantage of economies of scale. Past use of incremental funding has had negative consequences, as cited in a 1996 GAO report. The use of incremental funding for capital asset acquisitions, such as Navy shipbuilding, has had negative consequences in the past. For example, a 1996 GAO report highlighted how incremental funding led to cost overruns and schedule delays for Department of Energy projects. Another report found that long-term leases for auxiliary ships in the 1970s and 1980s resulted in higher costs per ship. While some incremental funding may be justified for high technology acquisitions, full funding is crucial for maintaining fiscal control and avoiding resource allocation distortions."
