If an employee or Member dies after separating from service with title to a deferred annuity under section 8338 but before establishing a valid claim for annuity, the widow or widower is entitled to an annuity equal to 55 percent of the deferred annuity, or may choose to receive a lump-sum credit instead if eligible and applies before the annuity is awarded. The widow or widower of a former employee or Member may receive an annuity under certain conditions, with limitations on the amount based on survivor annuity payments to former spouses. SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATES.

Application for recomputation must be made within 12 months of the effective date of regulations by the Office of Personnel Management. Any change in an annuity or survivor annuity resulting from a recomputation shall only apply to amounts accruing for months after the enactment of this Act. The amendment made by section 3 will be effective as of the enactment date, and can also apply to widows or widowers of former employees who died before that date, with exceptions for certain cases. The lump-sum credit has been voided. A survivor annuity can still be claimed if the individual would have been entitled to it before the enactment of this Act. Definitions for \"widow,\" \"widower,\" and \"lump-sum credit\" are provided."
