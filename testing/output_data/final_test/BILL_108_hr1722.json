    "content": "The \"Rural Rental Housing Act of 2003\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Key findings are outlined in the Act. Congress finds a growing need for rural rental housing, with many households lacking access to affordable units and living in inadequate or overcrowded conditions. In rural America, overcrowding is a significant issue with 28% of rural households facing serious housing problems. Approximately 1 million rural renters have multiple housing issues, and 2.6 million rural households live in substandard conditions. One-third of rural renters pay more than 30% of their income for housing, while 20% pay over 50%. 92% of rural renters with significant housing problems pay more than 50% of their income for housing. Rural economies face limited job opportunities due to factors like remoteness and low population density, hindering access to technology and investment. Local expertise is often focused on farming or natural resource industries. Rural areas also have less access to credit compared to metropolitan areas. Federal Government investment in rural rental housing has significantly decreased over the past decade. Federal spending for rural rental housing has been cut by 73% since 1994, and rural rental housing unit production financed by the Federal Government has been reduced by 88% since 1990. This decline in investment exacerbates the challenges faced by rural economies, such as limited job opportunities and access to credit compared to metropolitan areas. To address the scarcity of rural rental housing, the Federal Government must collaborate with various entities including State and local governments, private financial institutions, philanthropic organizations, and nonprofit groups.
