Congress finds that the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 was amended to authorize a round of base realignments and closures in 2005. Additionally, the Secretary of Defense was required to assess threats to national security and determine surge requirements for the Armed Forces and military installations. The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 was amended to authorize a 2005 round of base realignments and closures. The Secretary of Defense was required to assess national security threats and determine surge requirements for military installations. The process for preparing criteria and recommendations for the closures included advance publication of proposed criteria and consideration of public comments. The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 was amended to authorize a 2005 round of base realignments and closures. Congress required the Secretary of Defense to publish final selection criteria for the closures, which could be modified by Congress. The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 was amended to authorize a 2005 round of base realignments and closures. (part A of title XXIX of Public Law 101-510; 10 U.S.C. 2687 note), as added by section 3002 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 (Public Law 107-107; 115 Stat. 1344), is amended to read as follows: \"SEC. 2913. FINAL SELECTION CRITERIA FOR 2005 ROUND.\" The final criteria for the closure or realignment of military installations in the US in 2005 include mission requirements, impact on operational readiness, availability of land and facilities, and preservation of training areas and testing ranges for military weapons systems. The criteria for closure or realignment of military installations in the US in 2005 include accommodating military weapons systems, supporting homeland defense missions, contingency requirements, preserving infrastructure for surge operations, and assessing potential costs and savings. The criteria for base realignment and closure actions in 2005 include assessing costs and savings, economic impact on communities, infrastructure support for forces, and environmental impact on receiving locations. In recommending military installations for closure or realignment in 2005, priority consideration is given to military value. The final selection criteria specified shall be the only criteria used, along with the force-structure plan and infrastructure inventory. Previous criteria and selection criteria from earlier rounds do not apply to the process in 2005. The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 is amended to specify criteria in section 2913 for military installations closure or realignment in 2005."
