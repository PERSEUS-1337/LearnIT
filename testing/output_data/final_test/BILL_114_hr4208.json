    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Authority for the Use of Military Force Against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant Act\". Congress finds that the terrorist organization known as ISIL poses a grave threat to Iraq, Syria, regional stability, and the national security interests of the United States and its allies. ISIL holds significant territory, intends to seize more, and plans to conduct terrorist attacks internationally, including against the United States. They have committed acts of violence and mass executions against Muslims. ISIL has committed genocide and violence against religious and ethnic minority groups, targeted women and girls with horrific acts, and is responsible for the deaths of innocent US citizens. The US is working with allies to degrade and defeat ISIL. The anti-ISIL Coalition was announced on September 5, 2014, during the NATO Summit in Wales, emphasizing the need for a broad international coalition to counter the serious threat posed by ISIL. The United States urges allies and partners, especially in the Middle East and North Africa, to join the coalition and defeat this terrorist threat. President Obama and US military leaders advocate for using US government capabilities to support regional partners rather than deploying large numbers of ground forces. SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES. The President is authorized to use the Armed Forces against ISIL or associated persons. Congress declares this as specific statutory authorization under the War Powers Resolution. The purpose is to protect US citizens and provide military support. The use of significant United States ground troops in combat against ISIL, except to protect the lives of United States citizens from imminent threat, is not consistent with the purpose of providing military support to defeat ISIL. SEC. 4. DURATION OF AUTHORIZATION: The military force authorization will end three years after enactment unless reauthorized. \n\nSEC. 5. REPORTS: The President must report to Congress every six months on actions taken under this authorization. \n\nSEC. 6. ASSOCIATED PERSONS OR FORCES DEFINED: \"Associated persons or forces\" include individuals and organizations fighting for or alongside ISIL, posing a direct threat to US forces or coalition partners. The Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 is repealed. The sole statutory authority for military action against ISIL is established, superseding any prior authorizations."
