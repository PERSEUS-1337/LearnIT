    "content": "The Act titled \"The Small Watershed Rehabilitation Amendments of 1998\" allows for the rehabilitation of water resource structural measures constructed under certain Department of Agriculture programs. This includes measures near, at, or past their evaluated life expectancy as outlined in the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act. The Small Watershed Rehabilitation Amendments of 1998 allow for the rehabilitation of water resource structural measures to extend their service life and meet safety standards. This includes protecting, correcting damage, and upgrading structural measures as needed. The term 'covered water resource project' refers to works of improvement carried out under specific acts and programs, including the Small Watershed Rehabilitation Amendments of 1998. The Resource Conservation and Development Program provides cost share assistance for the rehabilitation of structural measures impounding water in covered water resource projects. Eligible local organizations can receive financial assistance for this purpose. The Resource Conservation and Development Program offers financial assistance for rehabilitating structural measures in covered water resource projects. The assistance may cover up to 65% of total rehabilitation costs, including land, easements, rights-of-ways, water, mineral rights, project administration, and contracting. The Secretary, in collaboration with eligible local organizations, may impose conditions related to land use and development regulations for receiving financial assistance. The Secretary, in collaboration with eligible local organizations, may require proper zoning and developmental regulations in the watershed where structural measures are located to prevent rapid obsolescence and maximize rehabilitation benefits. The Secretary may also provide technical assistance for planning, designing, and implementing rehabilitation projects upon request from eligible local organizations. The Secretary, in collaboration with eligible local organizations, may provide technical assistance for planning, designing, and implementing rehabilitation projects in various fields such as biology, hydraulics, hydrology, economics, water quality, and contract administration. Rehabilitation assistance may not be used for operation and maintenance activities specified in the agreement for the water resource project, which remains the responsibility of the local organization. The Secretary may renegotiate agreements for financial assistance under certain circumstances. The eligible local organization can apply for rehabilitation assistance from the Secretary for a covered water resource project, subject to approval by the State agency or Governor. The rehabilitation must meet Secretary's standards and address dam safety issues. The State dam safety officer may be involved if State permits are needed. The Secretary requires rehabilitation projects to be cost-effective and meet safety standards without needing benefit-cost analysis. Documentation of project benefits and requirements is necessary for responsible use of Federal funds. Requests for rehabilitation assistance are ranked based on certain criteria. The Secretary establishes a system for approving rehabilitation requests, ensuring fairness and proper administration. $60,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 1999 to 2008. $5,000,000 is allocated for an assessment of rehabilitation needs in 1999 and 2000. The Secretary is required to assess the rehabilitation needs of water resource projects in all States and submit an annual report to Congress on the status of these activities. Eligible local organizations must also report annually on the status of any rehabilitation efforts funded under this section."
