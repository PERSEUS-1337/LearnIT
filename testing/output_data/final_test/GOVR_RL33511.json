    "content": "Federal R&D funding priorities have shifted over time, reflecting presidential preferences, congressional appropriations, and national priorities. Defense R&D predominated in the 1980s but decreased to about 50% of total federal R&D in the 1990s, reflecting Clinton Administration policies. Non-defense R&D priorities have included space in the 1960s, energy in the 1970s, and health since the 1980s. Funding for defense and counterterrorism R&D has increased since the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Federal R&D funding priorities have shifted over time, with Defense R&D decreasing in the 1990s but increasing after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Department of Defense and National Institutes of Health funding make up 77% of the FY2007 R&D request. R&D budgets are developed over an 18-month period, with advisory committees recommending priorities to agencies. Agencies, OMB, and OSTP determine funding levels before Congress passes a budget resolution. The budget resolution sets spending levels and recommends allocations for each appropriations subcommittee. For FY2005, R&D appropriations totaled $131.8 billion, with 54% going to defense R&D. Non-defense R&D funding increased by 0.2%, with the largest increases in NIH and DOD. Smaller increases were made for R&D at USDA, DHS, DOT, NASA, and NIH. For FY2005, Congress reduced NSF's budget by 0.3% below FY2004 levels. Funding for R&D in Education and EPA was also decreased. The President aimed to eliminate the ATP in DOC, which received $134.0 million in FY2004. NOAA's R&D funding increased by 10%, while ATP received $114.0 million in FY2005. In FY2006, Congress allocated $134.8 billion for R&D, with a significant portion going to DOD for weapons development and NASA for space exploration. In FY2006, Congress allocated $134.8 billion for R&D, with a significant portion going to DOD for weapons development and NASA for space exploration. Other agencies' R&D budgets were reduced or remained flat, with a 1% across-the-board cut for all discretionary R&D. For FY2007, R&D was requested at almost $137 billion, seeking to double funding over 10 years for key federal agencies supporting basic research in physical sciences and engineering as part of the American Competitiveness Initiative. The NIST laboratories, as part of the American Competitiveness Initiative (ACI), aimed to enhance U.S. innovation. Funding for NASA R&D would have increased by about 8% for the Constellation Systems program to develop human space vehicles. Cuts would have been made in NASA research programs in aeronautics and life sciences. The budget would have slightly increased for defense development, while NIH funding would have remained flat. Other R&D funding agencies would have seen decreases from FY2006 levels. The Administration's budget projected reducing budget deficits by cutting discretionary spending over the next five years. The ACI initiative aimed to enhance U.S. innovation by increasing funding for NASA R&D and making the R&D tax credit permanent. FY2007 appropriations increased support for defense development but decreased homeland security R&D funding. Current debates focus on federal R&D funding priorities and balancing the portfolio. The NSF projects that national R&D expenditures will total $312.1 billion for FY2004, with federal R&D funding declining as a percentage of the total from 46% in 1983 to about 30% in 2004. The United States leads in R&D spending globally but ranks sixth in R&D expenditures as a percentage of GDP. Industry is the largest supporter of the nation's R&D activities. Funding patterns play a significant role in priority-setting debates. Industry is the largest supporter and performer of the nation's R&D, funding 64% of all U.S. R&D in 2004. Most industrial R&D is for near-term applied work and product development, with 82% of development work supported by industrial R&D. Federal support for development goes largely to defense R&D performed by industry. The federal government is the largest supporter of the nation's basic and applied research, funding 62% of national basic research expenditures in universities. About 42% of federal research dollars go to universities, while 22% fund mission-oriented work in federal agency laboratories. Universities conduct 55% of nationally funded basic research, with the federal government funding about 65% of this research. Industry's support for academic R&D peaked at 7.4% in 1999 and declined to 4.9% in 2004, according to a recent NSF report. The decline in industry support for academic R&D peaked at 4.9% in 2004, with U.S. companies choosing to work with foreign universities due to more favorable IP rights. Federal R&D funding decreased from 18% of total federal discretionary outlays in FY1965 to about 16% currently, but started to increase again from FY2001 onwards. Concerns about the decline in federal R&D funding persist despite this increase. Concerns about declines in federal R&D funding persist due to deficit spending and future reductions in discretionary R&D budgets. National defense-related R&D outlays have increased, focusing on defense, homeland security, and biomedical research. Recommendations have been made to improve the quality of data used in making science policies. Some argue for increased federal research funding to support academic research capacity and innovation, as other countries like China and India challenge U.S. knowledge generation and industrial capabilities. In response to congressional requests, reports and meetings in 2005 discussed the importance of innovation and technological development as key drivers of economic growth, with some arguing for increased federal funding to support academic research and innovation. President Bush's FY2002 budget and the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis highlighted the significant impact of research and development (R&D) on economic growth. R&D was found to contribute 6.5 percent to economic growth between 1995 and 2002, with plans to incorporate R&D into GDP estimates by 2013. Basic research is emphasized as crucial for future discoveries and capabilities. Some observers question the link between basic research knowledge and technological innovation for economic growth due to lack of credible data and expert disagreement. Policymakers are unsure how increased federal research support would enhance growth and which R&D fields warrant funding. Suggestions include focusing on improving the climate for industrial R&D through tax incentives, regulatory policies, and liability protections. The benefits of federal R&D investments are likely to be discussed in the context of long-term economic growth. The benefits of federal R&D investments are likely to be discussed in the context of long-term economic projections, deficits, decreasing budgets, and diversifying priorities for support. Issues include the impact of state-supported funding on federal funding, organizing government for research, modifying funding mechanisms, and enhancing accountability. The Center for Strategic and International Studies report in 2005 emphasized the need to increase federal basic research funding and proposed various options to enhance accountability for R&D investments, such as redirecting funds from defense technologies, dedicating a minimum percentage of R&D funding for basic research, increasing tax credits for industrial support of academic research, and creating special Treasury bonds or loan-guarantee programs for financing basic research. In response to expert reports and recommendations, the 109th Congress introduced various legislative responses to enhance innovation and research funding. This included bills to increase NSF funding, create research centers of excellence, double NSF funding, establish a Presidential Council on Innovation, and encourage agencies to allocate 3% of their R&D budgets to high-risk research. Additionally, there were proposals to increase the number of U.S. mathematics and science teachers, create an energy-related Advanced Project Agency, and support high-risk, high-payoff research. The U.S. Commission on National Security 21st Century recommended doubling federal R&D budget by 2010 and improving competitiveness of U.S. academic R&D institutions to address threats to national security. A 2006 National Science Board report called for drastic changes in science and mathematics classrooms to avoid raising generations lacking critical thinking skills. The Council on Competitiveness and other reports have proposed increasing federal funding for research, improving regulatory climate, and enhancing science education to promote critical thinking and informed decision-making based on technical and scientific information. A new report released in November 2006 reviews risk factors for U.S. technological competitiveness and emphasizes funding for basic physical sciences and engineering research to enhance U.S. innovative capacity and ability to compete internationally. The President's \"American Competitiveness Initiative\" (ACI) supports additional training in mathematics and science education at the pre-college level and for part-time science and math teachers. Several bills were introduced in the second session of the 109th Congress to address these issues. Several bills were introduced in the second session of the 109th Congress to address competitiveness issues, including S. 3936, the National Competitiveness Investment Act, and the bipartisan-supported \"Protecting America's Competitive Edge\" Acts. The House Science Committee also reported H.R. 5358, the Science and Mathematics Education for Competitiveness Act. The Science and Mathematics Education for Competitiveness Act, the Early Career Research Act, and the Research for Competitiveness Act were introduced in the 109th Congress. Some bills aimed to improve education to address challenges in space and defense, similar to past national defense education acts. There are concerns about the balance of federally supported research fields, with a focus on health/life sciences potentially overshadowing other fields like physical sciences, math, and engineering. Critics suggest increasing funding for all research fields and allocating more federal funding to non-health research. Federal funding for research and development (R&D) has increased significantly in health sciences over the past 20 years, with NIH receiving the majority of funding. In contrast, funding for non-health R&D fields has not seen the same level of growth, with some departments experiencing decreases in funding. Life sciences have seen a substantial increase in funding, while other fields like physical sciences and mathematics have seen more modest growth. Funding for physical sciences, mathematics, and engineering increased significantly in recent years. The National Science Foundation debated supporting social and behavioral sciences research in the 1950s and 1980s. Despite initial skepticism, NSF began supporting social sciences in 1968. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison questioned this support in 2005. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a member of the Subcommittee on Science and Space and Senate Appropriations Subcommittee, questioned the appropriateness of NSF's support for social sciences research and recommended focusing on \"the hard sciences\" like biology, chemistry, and physics. She raised concerns about specific NSF social sciences awards and whether the doubling of NSF's research budget should benefit social sciences. A draft of S. 2802 initially limited NSF's budget increase to physical sciences research but was later amended. NSF's budget increase to support physical sciences research was amended to not restrict funding for research consistent with its mandate. Various perspectives exist on the balance of R&D funding, with a focus on biomedical research in recent years. Critics argue that other fields of science have received inadequate federal attention due to the emphasis on health sciences. The NSF authorization bill for FY2003 aimed to double its budget by 2008, but funding has not consistently met this target. Calls for increased funding for physical sciences, mathematics, and engineering have been made to achieve more balance in federal health sciences funding. In response, a conference was held to explore opportunities at the interface of life and physical sciences for major advances. The President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) recommended targeting physical sciences and engineering to bring them to parity with life sciences in budget allocations. Legislation was enacted to make the Research and Experimentation (R&D) tax credit permanent, providing incentives for industrially funded R&D. The R&D tax credit was extended for two years and eligibility was widened. The cost to the Treasury could be about $10 billion if the credit were expanded. Legislation to make the credit permanent did not pass. The focus should be on supporting research rather than product development. The NSF authorization bill for FY2003 aimed to increase NSF's budget by 15% annually for FY2003, FY2004, and FY2005 to double its budget by FY2008. It also focused on increasing federal support for science fields that had not seen significant funding increases. Congress appropriated about $4.1 billion for NSF's FY2004 R&D funding, slightly more than the previous year. The NSF's budget authority was reduced below FY2004 levels in FY2005, but increased by about 1.6% in FY2006. The President requested a 3% increase for FY2006, mainly for facilities support. The FY2007 request aimed to increase the R&D budget by 8.3% over FY2006. Final appropriations for FY2007 were pending, with both House and Senate proposing increases over FY2006 levels. P.L. 107-368 required the NSB to report on how increased funding should be utilized. The National Science Board recommended funding NSF annually at $18.7 billion, with priorities for R&D support. The Coalition for National Science Funding has advocated for increased funding. Homeland security R&D funding has increased from 2.5% to 6.8% of the federal non-defense R&D budget. Homeland security R&D funding is a significant issue in priority-setting discussions. OMB's term \"combating terrorism\" R&D includes homeland security R&D. The largest FY2007 programs are in NIH for bioterrorism R&D and containment facilities, followed by requests for DHS, DOD, NSF, USDA, EPA, NASA, DOE, and NIST. P.L. 107-296 mandated DHS to coordinate federal agency homeland security R&D programs, with funding almost quintupling since FY2002. In FY2007, Congress reduced DHS's R&D funding by 22% below the FY2006 amount, emphasizing development over research. Some suggest centralized R&D priority-setting in Congress and the executive branch, while others argue that decentralized budgets may not align with a national R&D agenda. The National Academies recommended that Congress consider the R&D budget as a unified whole before its separate parts for each agency are considered by individual congressional committees. It suggested reconfiguring R&D budget request data as an S&T budget, excluding defense activities, to denote basic and applied R&D. OMB has used a modified version of this format since the FY2002 budget request, including a \"Federal Science and Technology (FS&T) budget table\" for FY2007. The Federal Science and Technology (FS&T) budget table for FY2007 includes non-R&D funding like education and information dissemination. There was a projected 1% decrease in FS&T funding from FY2006 to FY2007. Senator Jeff Bingaman suggested joint hearings on S&T spending and potentially revising the budget to consolidate all federal S&T spending in one place. The Federal Science and Technology (FS&T) budget for FY2007 should be revised to consolidate all federal S&T spending in one place for more transparency. Executive Order 12881 established the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) to recommend agency R&D budgets, advise OMB, and coordinate interagency R&D initiatives. The FY2007 budget included funding for \"Networking and Information Technology R&D\" and \"Climate Change Science Program.\" In FY2007, the Federal Science and Technology budget requested $1.7 billion, with priorities including nanotechnology at $1.3 billion. Interagency R&D initiatives focused on combating terrorism, hydrogen, homeland security, energy security, advanced networking, national nanotechnology, complex biological systems, and the environment. Special attention was also given to stewardship for federal scientific collections and developing a new science of science policy to understand the linkages between R&D investments and innovation. The 2001 National Science Board (NSB) report recommended creating a cabinet-level post for Science and Technology (S&T) to achieve balance in R&D, coordinate federal research, and handle research policy issues. It also suggested viewing federal R&D funding as a five-year planned portfolio and empowering the President's science advisor to establish \"functional budgeting\" for non-defense R&D objectives. The 2001 NSB report recommended creating a cabinet-level post for Science and Technology to achieve balance in R&D and coordinate federal research. It also suggested empowering the President's science advisor to establish \"functional budgeting\" for non-defense R&D objectives. The congressional science policy report, Unlocking Our Future, called for improved coordination with OMB to enhance stewardship of national R&D and suggested Congress develop an independent expert S&T review mechanism. Some propose reestablishing the Office of Technology Assessment for this purpose. The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) was established in 1972 to provide in-depth reports on technology policy options for Congress. It was eliminated in 1995, but there have been proposals to revive it or create a similar body for better congressional support for science and technology analysis. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has conducted pilot technology assessments since 2002 at congressional direction. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has conducted various technology assessments since 2002, including biometrics for border security, cybersecurity for critical infrastructure protection, and wildland fire communications. There have been debates in Congress about restoring a technology assessment capability, including questions about funding, the utility of GAO's reports, and options for institutional arrangements. Controversy also exists over congressional earmarking of R&D funding for specific projects. The practice of earmarking funds for specific performers or geographic locations in R&D projects is controversial. Supporters argue it helps develop R&D capability and generates economic growth, while critics believe it distorts agency priorities and is not an effective use of taxpayer funds. OMB did not publish funding data on R&D earmarks in the FY2007 budget request, but previous data showed $2.4 billion was appropriated for earmarked R&D in FY2006. AAAS data shows $2.4 billion was appropriated for earmarked R&D in FY2006, a 13% increase from FY2005. This constituted 1.7% of total federal R&D funding. Earmarks were mainly for projects in DOD, DOE, USDA, NASA, DOC (NIST), and DOT. FY2007 R&D earmarks are estimated to be similar. Legislation was passed to increase transparency in earmarking, requiring OMB to create a website with federal award information by January 1, 2008. The legislation aims to increase transparency in earmarking by creating an online database, but it is unclear how it will serve users as the data systems used do not collect earmark data. OMBWatch also has a website providing similar information. A rule change mandates disclosure of earmark sponsors in tax and spending legislation, but critics doubt it will eliminate earmarking practices. The new requirement for earmarking will not apply to all tax provisions, manager's amendments, or some earmarks in conference reports. Senator Tom Coburn sent a survey to universities about research earmarks, causing concern among Congress members and universities. The Government Performance and Results Act aims to improve federal spending efficiency and accountability. The Government Performance and Results Act aims to improve efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability in federal spending by requiring agencies to use performance measures for management and budgeting, including for R&D programs. The Bush Administration emphasized the importance of performance measurement for R&D, with efforts to base budget decisions on program performance. The Bush Administration emphasized the importance of performance measurement for R&D programs, using OMB criteria to assess research outcomes. R&D programs were evaluated using the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART), with at least 29 programs deemed effective and 41 moderately effective. Defining priorities for research and measuring results quantitatively were noted as challenging. It is challenging to define priorities and measure research outcomes quantitatively, hindering the use of performance measures to recommend budget levels for R&D. Congressional staff may not be comfortable using performance data for budget decisions, preferring traditional budget information focusing on inputs. Congress may increase attention to R&D performance measures as discretionary spending constraints grow. OMB proposed draft legislation in 2005 for results commissions to evaluate and recommend restructuring or terminating ineffective programs. The NAS advises on implementing performance measures for research. The recent report on using performance measures for research is Implementing the Government Performance and Results Act for Research: A Status Report, 2001. The House Science Committee's Unlocking Our Future report recommended a \"portfolio\" approach for applying GPRA to basic research. The House passed a rule requiring committee reports to include performance goals and objectives for funding."
