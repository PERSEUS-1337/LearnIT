The Director of NIH may award funding to pediatric research consortia for conducting various research categories and providing training. Up to 20 consortia may receive awards, each organized to support pediatric research. Each consortium receiving funding must be formed from cooperating institutions, coordinated by a lead institution, and meet requirements set by the Director of NIH. The support received should supplement, not replace, other sources of funding, and the duration of support can vary. The Director of NIH can extend funding for pediatric research consortia for up to 5 years, with the possibility of additional 5-year extensions. The Director is responsible for coordinating activities among the consortia and receiving reports on their activities.
