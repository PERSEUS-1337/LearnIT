    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 27201 of the Government Code is amended to ensure that the county recorder must accept for recordation any authorized document related to real property, as long as it meets statutory requirements and is photographically reproducible. The recorder cannot refuse to record a document based on legal sufficiency. Each instrument, paper, or notice must have an original signature or be a certified copy. Facsimile signatures are accepted on liens recorded by governmental agencies if officially adopted and noted on the document. The facsimile signature remains valid until revoked by the agency. Each instrument, paper, or notice that is rerecorded must be executed and acknowledged as a new document, unless exempted by law or presented solely to correct a recording sequence. The intent of the parties regarding the priority of recorded documents controls, regardless of the recording sequence. The corrective affidavit must be attached to the original recorded instrument, paper, or notice, set out the corrected information, be certified under penalty of perjury, and acknowledged pursuant to Section 27287. A \"minor correction\" includes incorrect or missing address, clarification of illegible text, incorrect or missing name near the signature, or incorrect or missing documentary transfer tax amount due. When rerecording an instrument, a cover sheet complying with Section 27361.6 must be included, stating the reason for rerecording. Section 27288.1 of the Government Code is amended to require specific information in documents recorded in county official records. When rerecording a document, it must comply with specific requirements, including a cover sheet stating the reason for rerecording. Additionally, if the document involves a transfer of real property interest, certain names must be included, except for specific types of notices. No reimbursement is required by this act as local agencies or school districts have the authority to levy charges to cover mandated programs or services. This act may incur costs for local agencies due to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes."
