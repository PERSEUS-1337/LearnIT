    "content": "The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) in 2015. Title I-A program, the largest grant program under ESEA, provides aid to LEAs for disadvantaged children's education. It offers supplementary services to low-achieving students in schools with high numbers of low-income families. Title I-A also includes requirements for receiving grants and distributes funds to SEAs and LEAs based on four formulas, with minimal changes made by ESSA. The ESSA reauthorized the ESEA in 2015, with minimal changes to the Title I-A grant allocation process. One notable change is an increase in the set-aside for the Bureau of Indian Education and Outlying Areas. This change will take effect in FY2017, ensuring that the total amount available for state grants will not be less than in FY2016. The report discusses the four Title I-A formulas used to determine grants, including Basic Grants, Concentration Grants, Targeted Grants, and Education Finance Incentive Grants. In FY2018, 41% of Title I-A appropriations were allocated through Basic Grants, 9% through Concentration Grants, and 25% through each of Targeted Grants and EFIG. The four formula strategy has evolved over time, starting with the Basic Grant formula and adding the Concentration Grant formula in the 1970s to focus funding on LEAs with high percentages of low-income children. The House and Senate developed new formulas to target Title I-A funds better, but no compromise was reached. Funds are currently allocated through four formulas based on the number of formula children in an LEA and state average per pupil expenditures. Maximum grants are calculated and adjusted to match available appropriations. The maximum grants under Title I-A formulas are adjusted to match available appropriations, considering state and LEA minimum grant provisions. LEAs must meet specific criteria to be eligible for grants, which can be received under multiple formulas. Funds are calculated at the LEA level for Basic, Concentration, and Targeted Grants, while EFIG grants are first calculated at the state level and then suballocated to LEAs. Once funds reach LEAs, amounts from all formulas are combined and used jointly. The Basic Grants formula, part of Title I-A, allocates the largest proportion of funds to LEAs, with a declining trend since FY2001 due to increases in other formulas. Grants are based on two factors: an LEA's relative share of a child count and an expenditure factor. The Basic Grants formula for Title I-A allocates funds to LEAs based on a child count and expenditure factor, with specific criteria for determining the population used for grants. In FY2018, children in poor families accounted for 97% of formula children. To receive Basic Grants funding, an LEA must have at least 10 formula children, with these children making up more than 2% of children ages 5-17 in the LEA. The state expenditure factor is determined using the state average per pupil expenditure for public K-12 education. After adjustments, a state's APPE is multiplied by 0.40 as specified in statute. The expenditure factor is the same for all LEAs in the state. Each LEA is to receive a minimum of 85%, 90%, or 95% of its prior-year grant, depending on the LEA's formula child rate. The hold harmless rate is 85% if the formula child rate is less than 15%, 90% if it is 15% or more but less than 30%, and 95% if it is 30% or more. The hold harmless provisions ensure that LEAs receive a minimum of 85%, 90%, or 95% of their prior-year grant based on their formula child rate. To qualify, LEAs must meet Basic Grants eligibility requirements. States receive a minimum grant based on total Basic Grant appropriations, with adjustments made for each LEA's initial grant calculated by multiplying formula children by the state expenditure factor. The state expenditure factor determines LEA grants, with reductions made if appropriations are insufficient. Puerto Rico is treated as a state under the Basic Grant formula, with funds reserved for schools supported by the BIE and Outlying Areas. Starting FY2017, a percentage of Title I-A appropriations will be reserved for the BIE and Outlying Areas. In FY2017, 0.7% of Title I-A appropriations will be reserved for the BIE and 0.4% for the Outlying Areas, with a requirement to maintain funding levels for states. If funds are insufficient, adjustments will be made as required by law. Adjustments to LEA grants under Title I-A are made by SEAs after ED calculates the grants. These adjustments include reserving funds for school improvement grants and allocating 1% of state total allocations for various ESEA programs. Programs for Children and Youth Who Are Neglected, Delinquent, or At-Risk (Title I-D) receive funding of $400,000 or more for state administration. Starting in FY2017, states can reserve 3% of the total allocation for direct student services. Funds can also be provided to eligible charter schools or to account for recent LEA boundary changes. States have the option to use alternative methods to reallocate grants among small LEAs. The formula for calculating grants for eligible LEAs involves multiplying the population factor by the expenditure factor, adjusting for insufficient appropriations, and applying a minimum adjustment. Hold harmless levels are considered in each step to ensure funding adequacy. In the grant allocation process, the hold harmless amount is used to adjust grant amounts for LEAs. The amount for each LEA is adjusted through the state minimum grant provision and a factor to raise affected LEAs to their hold harmless levels. LEAs in states receiving a minimum grant will generally see an increase in their grant amounts, while LEAs in states not receiving a minimum grant will see a decrease. The grant allocation process involves Steps 1 through 3, with all estimates produced by ED being the grant amounts calculated in Step 3. Final Grant = Preliminary Grant * SCH_IMP_ADJ * S_ADMIN_ADJ * AWD_ADJ * DSS_ADJ * OTR_ADJ. LEA grants calculated in Step 3 are adjusted by the state for school improvement, state administration reservations, achievement awards, direct student services, and other adjustments. Factors such as PF, EF, L_HH, APP, S_MIN_ADJ, and L_HH_ADJ are used in the calculation. The Concentration Grant formula is similar to Basic Grants but with a higher LEA eligibility threshold and differences in hold harmless and state minimum grant provisions. Title I-A has included Concentration Grant formulas since 1970, with varying provisions. The Concentration Grant formula, established in 1970 and updated in 1988, allocates a small portion of Title I-A appropriations based on population and expenditure factors. To qualify, an LEA must meet a higher eligibility threshold than Basic Grants, with a minimum of 6,500 formula children or a child rate above 15%. The Concentration Grant formula allocates Title I-A funds based on population and expenditure factors. LEAs must meet higher eligibility thresholds than Basic Grants, with a minimum of 6,500 formula children or a child rate above 15%. Hold harmless provisions apply for LEAs that initially qualify for a Concentration Grant but later fail to meet requirements. The state minimum grant is based on a modified version of the Basic Grant minimum. The Concentration Grant formula for Title I-A funds allocates grants based on population and expenditure factors, with higher eligibility thresholds than Basic Grants. States may make further adjustments to LEA grants as calculated by ED, with exceptions for states with a low percentage of formula children. The Concentration Grant formula for Title I-A funds allocates grants based on population and expenditure factors, with higher eligibility thresholds than Basic Grants. SEAs may allocate grants to LEAs based on formula child counts, with the option to allocate grants to all LEAs with a higher child count or rate than the state average. In states where formula children constitute less than 0.25% of the national total, the state total may be allocated to LEAs based on formula child counts. The Targeted Grants allocation formula is similar to Basic Grants but with differences in how children in the population factor are counted. Targeted Grants make up a significant portion of Title I-A grants, with 25% of FY2018 appropriations. Funds were first allocated for Targeted Grants in FY2002 after a slight modification to the formula. The Targeted Grants allocation formula is similar to Basic Grants but with differences in how children in the population factor are counted. Targeted Grants assign weights based on each LEA's formula child rate and number of formula children, with a higher rate and number resulting in a higher grant per child. There is a higher eligibility threshold for Targeted Grants compared to Basic Grants. The formula factors include a formula child count multiplied by an expenditure factor, subject to appropriations, an LEA minimum, and a state minimum. The Targeted Grants allocation formula assigns weights based on each LEA's formula child rate and number of formula children, resulting in a higher grant per child for LEAs with higher rates and numbers. The higher of the two weighted formula child counts is used to determine grants for each LEA. Of the LEAs receiving grants under the Targeted Grant formula, about 88% use percentage-based weighting rather than numbers-based weighting. The weights are applied in a stepwise manner to produce two weighted child counts, with higher weights given to LEAs with higher formula child rates and numbers. Formula children in LEAs with the highest rates can have a weight of up to four, while those with the highest numbers can have a weight of up to three. The Targeted Grant formula uses five ranges for number and percentage weighting scales based on the distribution of Title I-A formula children among LEAs. Each quintile represents roughly 20% of all formula children. The weights are applied stepwise, with higher weights given to LEAs with higher formula child rates and numbers. For example, an LEA with 2,000 formula children and a total school-age population of 10,000 would have a formula child rate of 20%. The Targeted Grant formula uses five ranges for number and percentage weighting scales based on the distribution of Title I-A formula children among LEAs. Each quintile represents roughly 20% of all formula children. The weights are applied stepwise, with higher weights given to LEAs with higher formula child rates and numbers. In this example, the formula children are weighted at different levels based on their numbers and percentages within the LEA's total school-age population. The Targeted Grant formula combines weighted counts of formula children from Steps 1 and 2. The population factor for Targeted Grants is determined by the numbers scale count exceeding the percentage scale count. To qualify for funding, an LEA must have at least 10 formula children with a rate of 5% or more. The Minimum State Grant is calculated based on a percentage of total state grants or the national average grant per formula child. The Targeted Grant formula combines weighted counts of formula children, with a population factor determined by the numbers scale count exceeding the percentage scale count. LEAs must have at least 10 formula children with a rate of 5% or more to qualify for funding. The EFIG formula, authorized in 1994, has not received any funds. Puerto Rico has a cap of 1.82 on the aggregate weight applied to the population factor under the Targeted Grant formula. The EFIG formula, authorized in 1994 but not funded until FY2002, has been modified and now constitutes a significant portion of Title I-A grants. Grants are calculated at the state level based on formula child counts, with LEAs competing for funding within their state based on these counts. The EFIG formula for Title I-A grants calculates funding at the state level based on formula child counts, with LEAs competing within their state. Formula child counts are weighted in the intra-state allocation process, with slightly different expenditure constraints compared to other Title I-A formulas. The EFIG formula for Title I-A grants calculates funding at the state level based on formula child counts, with unique factors such as effort and equity factors. State total grants under EFIG are determined by a formula child count multiplied by expenditure, effort, and equity factors, adjusted by a state minimum. Each LEA's share of the state's total grant is based on a weighted formula child count for the LEA, adjusted by an LEA hold harmless provision. The EFIG formula factors include population factor and weights applied to formula child counts for state total grants and LEA suballocation. The weights on the number and percentage scales differ based on the state's equity factor, with higher equity factors leading to more rapid weight increases for formula children in states. States with higher equity factors have varying degrees of APPE among their LEAs. The weights for EFIG vary based on the state's equity factor, with higher factors resulting in higher weights. The state expenditure factor for EFIG is determined using the state APPE for public K-12 education, with a minimum of 85% and a maximum of 115% of the national APPE. The state's APPE is adjusted to 85% or 115% of the national APPE based on certain thresholds. After adjustments, a state's APPE is multiplied by 0.40 as specified in statute. The effort factor in the EFIG formula compares state education expenditures to personal income, resulting in an index number above or below 1.0. The Equity Factor in the EFIG formula is unique and based on the disparity in APPE among LEAs of a state, measured by the coefficient of variation (CV). Grants are maximized for states with 40% higher expenditures per formula child. The Equity Factor in the EFIG formula is determined by the variation in expenditures per pupil among LEAs in a state, with most states falling into the 0.10-0.20 range. States with lower expenditure disparities among LEAs are rewarded with higher multipliers and grants, while states with higher disparities receive lower grants. This system incentivizes states to reduce disparities among LEAs. In effect, states are rewarded for lower disparities among LEAs through various grant levels such as Hold Harmless, Minimum State Grant, and Initial State Grant. Hold harmless provisions are not considered initially in state total grants calculation, potentially leading to insufficient funds for all LEAs. Minimum State Grant calculation includes children in LEAs ineligible for grants under EFIG formula. The initial state grant amount is determined by multiplying the number of formula children in the state by various factors. Further adjustments are made by SEAs for LEA grants. The Education Finance Incentive Grant Allocation Formula involves calculating state total EFIG allocations through a multi-step process. The Education Finance Incentive Grant Allocation Formula involves a multi-step process. State grants are calculated based on the number of formula children in the state, with adjustments made for LEA grants. The state minimum grant provision is applied to adjust the total grants for all eligible states. LEA EFIG allocations are calculated by dividing the weighted population factor for each eligible LEA by the total weighted population factor for all eligible LEAs in the state. If the amount is greater than the LEA's hold harmless amount, it is used. In the Education Finance Incentive Grant Allocation Formula, state grants are calculated based on formula children with adjustments for LEA grants. LEA grant amounts are adjusted to reach hold harmless levels. If an LEA's grant is below the hold harmless level, it is increased. The process involves multiple steps, with only Stage 1 and Steps 1 and 2 in Stage 2 calculated by ED. In the final step of calculating LEA grants under all Title I-A allocation formulas, grant amounts are adjusted by the state for various factors such as school improvement, state administration reservations, achievement awards, direct student services, and other adjustments. Factors include population, expenditure, effort, equity, appropriation, state minimum adjustment, and weighted factors. The final step in calculating LEA grants under Title I-A allocation formulas involves adjustments by the state for factors like school improvement, state administration reservations, achievement awards, direct student services, and other adjustments. These adjustments are based on factors such as population, expenditure, effort, equity, appropriation, state minimum adjustment, and weighted factors. LEAs have discretion to control a significant portion of Title I-A grants at a central district level, ranking public schools by percentages of low-income students and serving them in rank order. Schools with over 75% low-income students must be prioritized, with the option to serve elementary and middle schools with over 75% low-income students and high schools with over 50% before serving schools in rank order. The distribution of Title I-A grants involves prioritizing schools with high percentages of low-income students, with the option for LEAs to set higher eligibility thresholds. Data used to determine low-income students for funding distribution may differ from data used for state and LEA allocations. Title I-A grants prioritize schools with high percentages of low-income students. LEAs use proxies like free and reduced-price school lunches to determine low-income status for funding allocation. Eligibility thresholds for free and reduced-price lunches are higher than poverty levels used in allocation formulas. Title I-A grants prioritize schools with high percentages of low-income students. Funds are allocated based on the number of students from low-income families, with grants varying based on the percentage of low-income students in each school. LEAs must provide a minimum amount of funds per child from a low-income family if they allocate Title I-A funds to schools with low-income child percentages below 35%. The allocation of Title I-A grants is based on the number of low-income students in each school, with funds varying depending on the percentage of low-income students. LEAs must provide a minimum amount of funds per child from a low-income family if they allocate funds to schools with low-income child percentages below 35%. The appropriations for Title I-A have seen steady increases since the reauthorization of the ESEA in 2001. Since the reauthorization of the ESEA in 2001, Title I-A appropriations have shown a pattern of increasing funding in two periods: from FY2001 to FY2005, and from FY2007 to FY2009, with a further increase from FY2013 to FY2018. The allocation of funds between Targeted Grants and EFIG formulas has been shifting, with a decrease in Basic Grant formula allocations."
