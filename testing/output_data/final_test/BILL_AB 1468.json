    "title": "AB 1468",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature declares the rights of individuals with disabilities to access public places and bring actions for damages for violations. Legislation in 2012 imposed requirements on attorneys for construction-related accessibility claims but excluded public facilities. Community colleges and school districts in California aim to provide quality educational programs and services that meet the diverse needs of students and communities. The Division of the State Architect oversees design and construction compliance for accessibility, safety, and building code requirements on new construction and modernization projects for community colleges and other public agencies. The Division of the State Architect ensures compliance with codes and regulations for school construction projects, including accessibility. They issue a closeout letter at the end of construction to confirm compliance. Community colleges and local educational agencies should receive additional protections in construction-accessibility actions. Section 54.26 of the Civil Code outlines criteria for new construction or alterations by public entities regarding compliance with ADA standards. Construction before September 15, 2010, following 1991 ADA standards is not in violation, while construction after September 15, 2010, and before March 15, 2012, following either 1991 or 2010 ADA standards is also deemed compliant. New construction or alteration by a public entity after March 15, 2012, complying with 2010 ADA Standards or the applicable code is not in violation. Elements in existing facilities not altered by March 15, 2012, meeting 1991 or 2010 ADA Standards are also deemed compliant. A closeout letter from the State Architect certifying compliance with ADA standards serves as presumptive evidence for public buildings. Definitions for construction-related accessibility claims are outlined in the Civil Code. The \"Application for stay and early evaluation conference\" is a filing with the court that meets specific requirements. A \"Certified access specialist\" (CASp) is someone certified under Government Code Section 4459.5. \"Meets applicable standards\" refers to a site inspected by a CASp and found to meet all relevant accessibility standards. A site labeled \"Inspected by a CASp\" is pending a determination by the CASp that it meets construction-related accessibility standards. If a site is \"CASp determination pending\" before a certain date, it means it was inspected by a CASp. The curr_chunk defines \"construction-related accessibility standard\" as laws requiring compliance with accessibility standards for new and existing facilities. It also explains that a \"place of public accommodation\" has the same meaning as \"public accommodation\" under federal law. For actions starting on or after January 1, 2016, or ongoing cases without a final judgment, \"place of public accommodation\" includes public buildings, facilities, and places of an educational institution of a public entity as defined by federal law. A \"qualified defendant\" in a construction-related accessibility claim is one who met standards or was inspected by a CASp before being served with a summons. The court does not need to find full compliance with accessibility standards, only that the place of public accommodation meets applicable standards. \"Site\" refers to a place of public accommodation. In civil procedure, \"site\" refers to a place of public accommodation."
