SEC. 1022 of the \"Family Savings and Investors Protection Act of 1994\" allows for the indexing of assets held for more than 1 year when sold or disposed of, substituting the indexed basis for adjusted basis. This applies to indexed assets such as stock in a corporation or tangible property used in a trade or business. The term 'indexed asset' excludes certain types of property, including creditor's interests, options, net lease property, certain preferred stock, and stock in foreign corporations. Stock in a foreign corporation listed on major exchanges is exempt from certain regulations, excluding stock in specific types of foreign investment companies. The indexed basis for any asset is determined by multiplying the adjusted basis of the asset by the applicable inflation ratio, which is calculated based on the gross national product deflator for the calendar quarter of disposition divided by the deflator for the quarter of acquisition. The applicable inflation ratio for an asset is rounded to the nearest one-tenth of 1 percent and is only considered if greater than 1. The gross national product deflator for a calendar quarter is used to calculate the indexed basis of an asset. Short sales of indexed assets with a period exceeding 1 year have specific rules for determining the amount realized. The short sale period begins the day after property is sold short, with specific rules for determining the amount realized based on the applicable inflation ratio. Short sales of substantially identical property are not treated as indexed assets during the short sale period. The short sale period starts the day after property is sold and ends on the closing date. Adjustments are allowed for qualified investment entities, with exceptions for certain sections. Stock in a qualified investment entity is considered an indexed asset. The entity's indexed assets for a calendar month are determined based on the ratio of the fair market value of indexed assets to all assets held by the entity at the end of the month. If the ratio is 90 percent or more, it is considered 100 percent, and if it is 10 percent or less, it is considered zero. The valuation of assets for real estate investment trusts does not need to be done more frequently than once every 36 months, except in certain circumstances. A qualified investment entity includes regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts. Other pass-thru entities are also subject to specific rules. In partnerships, adjustments made at the partnership level are passed through to the partners. Special rules apply in cases of transfers involving section 754 elections, treating adjustments as sales of partnership assets. In partnerships, adjustments made at the partnership level are passed through to the partners. Special rules apply in cases of transfers involving section 754 elections, treating adjustments as sales of partnership assets. With respect to the transferee partner, the partnership's holding period for assets begins on the date of adjustment. For S corporations, adjustments at the corporate level are passed through to shareholders. For common trust funds, adjustments at the trust level are passed through to participants. Dispositions between related persons are exempt from this section, except for the basis of property in the hands of related persons. \"In partnerships, adjustments are passed through to partners. Special rules apply for transfers involving section 754 elections. For S corporations and common trust funds, adjustments are passed through to shareholders and participants, respectively. Dispositions between related persons are exempt from this section, except for the basis of property in the hands of related persons. Related persons are defined as those bearing specific relationships or treated as a single employer. Transfers made to increase an adjustment may be disallowed by the Secretary.\" Net lease property is defined as leased property where the lease term is 50% or more of the useful life of the property. Substantial improvements to property, contributions to capital in stock of a corporation, and other portions of an asset can be treated as separate assets. The applicable inflation ratio is adjusted for periods when the asset was not an indexed asset. The net lease property is defined as leased property where the lease term is 50% or more of the useful life of the property. For the period of the lease, the deductions allowable to the lessor by section 162 must be 15 percent or less of the rental income. Certain distributions with respect to stock in a corporation are treated as dispositions. This section cannot increase a net ordinary loss or an ordinary loss under other provisions of the title. The taxpayer may be treated as having a long-term capital loss equal to an ordinary loss amount. The acquisition date for an asset previously subjected to subsection (a)(1) by the taxpayer is determined based on the most recent prior application date. The application of collapsible corporations under section 341(a) is not affected by this provision. The Secretary is authorized to issue regulations. The Secretary will prescribe necessary regulations for this section. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections. Section 1022 discusses the indexing of certain assets for determining gain or loss. The amendments made by this section apply to dispositions after December 31, 1994, in taxable years ending after that date."
