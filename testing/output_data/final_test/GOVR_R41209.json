    "content": "The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) issued a proposed policy letter on inherently governmental functions and work reserved for federal government employees. This guidance helps agencies determine which functions should be performed by government personnel. The policy letter was issued under the authority of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for FY2009 and President Obama's memorandum on government contracting. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) issued a proposed policy letter on defining \"inherently governmental functions\" and developing criteria for identifying critical functions that should be performed by government personnel. This guidance aims to ensure that agencies can identify positions that perform inherently governmental functions and maintain sufficient expertise to oversee contractors' work. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy issued a proposed policy letter on defining \"inherently governmental functions\" and developing criteria for identifying critical functions that should be performed by government personnel. President Obama charged OMB with clarifying outsourcing guidelines. Members of Congress may hold hearings or introduce legislation based on the final policy letter. Some functions that have been contracted out may have been misclassified as not inherently governmental. The 110th Congress tasked OMB with reviewing definitions of \"inherently governmental function\" to address concerns about improper contracting out. Multiple definitions exist in law and government policy, accompanied by varying guidance on what constitutes these functions. The 110th Congress tasked OMB with reviewing definitions of \"inherently governmental function\" to address concerns about improper contracting out. Agencies are required to give \"special consideration\" to using federal employees for functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions, but they can still contract out such functions. The Federal Acquisition Regulation lists functions that \"approach being\" inherently governmental, but critical functions are not defined for federal law. Critical functions are not currently defined by federal law, allowing agencies to contract them out without limitations. Legislation in the 111th Congress aimed to create a category of \"mission essential functions\" for government employees, but it was not enacted. The Obama Administration's proposed guidance advises agencies on determining if functions are inherently governmental and when they should be performed by government personnel to avoid loss of expertise. The Obama Administration's proposed guidance advises agencies on determining if functions are inherently governmental and when they should be performed by government personnel to avoid loss of expertise. The guidance also emphasizes that contractors can provide expertise, innovation, and cost-effective support to federal agencies for a wide range of services, as long as federal officials appropriately manage contractor performance. The proposed policy guidance aims to help agencies distinguish between inherently governmental functions and critical functions that should be performed by government personnel. This guidance is seen as unprecedented compared to previous policies like Policy Letter 92-1 and OMB Circular A-76. The proposed policy letter aims to define \"inherently governmental functions\" using the definition from the Federal Activities Inventory Reform (FAIR) Act, which states these functions are so critical to the public interest that they must be performed by Federal Government employees. This guidance is a departure from previous policies like Policy Letter 92-1 and OMB Circular A-76. The proposed policy letter aims to define \"inherently governmental functions\" using the definition from the Federal Activities Inventory Reform (FAIR) Act. It requires agencies to take steps to ensure that they do not contract out such functions, including determining if the functions are designated as inherently governmental in statute or qualify under proposed tests in the letter. The proposed policy letter defines \"inherently governmental functions\" based on the FAIR Act, focusing on sovereign powers and discretion in decision-making. It also seeks feedback on a potential third test, the principal-agent test. The policy letter requests comments on a possible third test, the principal-agent test, to identify functions as inherently governmental. Agencies must include written determinations in the contract file if functions are not inherently governmental. They must also monitor contractor performance to prevent interference with federal employees' responsibilities. The proposed policy letter instructs agencies to reestablish control over inherently governmental responsibilities currently performed by contractors through oversight, insourcing, or contract termination. It aligns with existing statutory requirements to prioritize government personnel for functions closely associated with inherently governmental tasks. The proposed policy letter requires agencies to determine if functions closely associated with inherently governmental tasks should be contracted out, ensuring private sector performance is cost-effective and appropriate. Agencies must have internal capability to oversee contractor performance, control missions, and avoid conflicts of interest. The proposed policy letter requires agencies to limit contractors' discretion, monitor their activities, identify contractor work products, and mitigate conflicts of interest to ensure effective oversight and avoid confusion with government officials. The proposed policy letter requires agencies to limit contractors' discretion, monitor their activities, identify contractor work products, and mitigate conflicts of interest to ensure effective oversight and avoid confusion with government officials. It defines a \"critical function\" as necessary for agencies to perform and maintain control of their mission and operations, requiring agencies to dedicate sufficient employees to critical functions and retain control of highly critical functions. Agencies can contract out critical functions if they have sufficient internal capability. The proposed policy letter requires agencies to ensure effective oversight and avoid confusion with government officials by limiting contractors' discretion, monitoring their activities, and identifying contractor work products. Agencies must retain control of critical functions and take necessary steps to insource these functions when internal control is at risk due to overreliance on contractors. The policy raises legal and policy issues related to inherently governmental functions and limitations on contracting out. The proposed policy letter raises key issues regarding the relationship with other executive branch authorities on inherently governmental functions, potential changes in agencies' use of contractors, and the impact on the acquisition workforce. Some reforms may require congressional action, while others suggest opportunities for additional changes in interagency contracting and the definition of commercial items. The proposed policy letter raises key issues regarding the relationship with other executive branch authorities on inherently governmental functions and potential changes in agencies' use of contractors. It discusses reforms that may require congressional action and opportunities for additional changes in interagency contracting and the definition of commercial items. The terminology and definitions used in the proposed policy letter and other executive branch authorities may diverge somewhat, potentially leading to substantive distinctions in the category of functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions. The proposed policy letter discusses the category of functions associated with inherently governmental functions, such as serving as an interpreter during an interrogation. It suggests the need for additional precision in terminology and addresses potential changes in definitions used in other executive branch authorities. The Obama Administration aims to establish a consistent definition of inherently governmental functions in executive branch regulations. Differences in definitions exist, with varying levels of discretion mentioned. The proposed policy letter includes tests for identifying these functions. The proposed policy letter introduces a new term \"sovereign\" in one of the tests for identifying inherently governmental functions, which is not found in the FAIR Act's definition. It focuses on discretion rather than sovereignty, and does not clarify its relation to existing requirements under OMB Circular A-76. The proposed policy letter introduces a new term \"sovereign\" in one of the tests for identifying inherently governmental functions, focusing on discretion rather than sovereignty. It requires agency personnel to ensure that contractors do not perform inherently governmental functions on a contract-by-contract basis, in addition to submitting a list of such functions to OMB annually. Differences with Circular A-76 include the level of detail and definition of \"inherently governmental.\" The proposed policy letter raises questions about the identification of inherently governmental work and the potential impact on the government's effort to have a consistent definition. It also questions if the implementation of the policy letter could make the Circular A-76 requirement for inventories of inherently governmental activities irrelevant. The policy letter seeks input on how to address challenges in classifying certain functions and what additional guidance is needed. The proposed policy letter raises concerns about the use of contractors for functions such as physical security and deadly force, which some Members of Congress have also questioned. The Obama Administration previously ended contractor performance of taxpayer debt collection. The FAIR Act does not consider federal building security as inherently governmental. The policy letter seeks input on federal guidance for using contractors for physical security. The government guidance on using contractors for physical security, including guard services at buildings, is crucial. The Federal Protective Service relies heavily on contract security guards for on-site security at approximately 446,000 federal buildings. In the National Capital Region, FPS contracts with 54 private security guard companies to protect 125 federal facilities with approximately 5,700 guards. Task orders detail the terms and conditions for contract security guard services. The Federal Protective Service heavily relies on contract security guards for on-site security at federal buildings. Task orders specify details such as guard post locations, staffing hours, and the number of guards. Congress has shown interest in FPS's use of contract security guards, with a budget of $487 million in FY2006. The Committee discussed federalizing portions of the FPS's contract security guard force to improve security at critical facilities. This could result in federal agencies commenting on the proposed policy letter and its effects on their use of contract security guards. OFPP's proposed policy letter and recent congressional action may impact federal agencies' use of contract security guards and the role of FPS in administering them. Congress could also amend the FAIR Act to potentially change the list of functions excluded from inherently governmental functions. The proposed policy letter does not list armed security as an inherently governmental function, which could reduce the use of contract security guards. OFPP is seeking public input on categorizing contractors involved in security operations that may involve deadly force. The policy letter would require agencies to assess if a function is inherently governmental before using private security contractors. The current draft of the policy letter would not significantly change the DOD's use of private security contractors in contingency operations like those in Iraq and Afghanistan. The DOD has already conducted an analysis on the use of PSCs in these regions. The Office of General Counsel's opinion allows contractors to protect U.S. personnel and property, stating that armed security contractors should not be used in situations involving direct participation in hostilities. The DOD restricts the use of security contractors in high-risk situations, limiting them to defensive responses. Post-award requirements include ongoing review of contractor functions closely associated with inherently governmental tasks. The proposed policy letter requests public comment on a possible test for agencies to consider functions inherently governmental where serious risks could be created by contractors. Concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of managing armed security contractors by DOD and the Department of State. Some argue that the use of Private Security Contractors (PSCs) has undermined the U.S. mission in Iraq and Afghanistan. Some analysts argue that the use of Private Security Contractors (PSCs) has undermined the U.S. mission in Iraq and Afghanistan. Both the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of State have reviewed their contractor management and taken steps to improve oversight, such as not renewing contracts with underperforming contractors. DOD issued an instruction detailing appropriate use of armed contractors in contingency operations. Critics suggest that not using PSCs would hinder DOD and the Department of State's ability to perform effectively. The use of Private Security Contractors (PSCs) in high-threat environments like Iraq has raised concerns about the effectiveness of DOD and the Department of State's mission. Congress has stated that security in such environments should be provided by the Armed Forces, with the combatant commander having discretion on using armed contractors. DOD instructions align with Congress's stance, giving the combatant commander the authority to decide on the appropriateness of using armed contractors. Successful implementation of OFPP's proposed policy letter on the use of armed contractors would rely heavily on each agency's acquisition workforce. Agency personnel would need to carry out various tasks related to governmental functions, manage contractors closely associated with these functions, and establish internal controls. OFPP emphasizes the importance of having an adequate number of government personnel and specific strategies for addressing workforce needs. The government's acquisition workforce, particularly civilian agencies, may not have the capability to meet the tasks required by the proposed policy letter. The civilian agency contracting value increased significantly, but the workforce's capacity and capability have not kept pace. This poses challenges in fulfilling responsibilities and addressing workforce needs. The 2008 Acquisition Workforce Competencies Survey revealed that the acquisition workforce lacks capacity in critical acquisition process steps, leading to trade-offs that may impact successful outcomes. Efforts to strengthen the workforce face challenges, requiring members to continue making trade-offs among various tasks, as noted by OFPP. Certain actions contemplated by the proposed policy letter, such as changes to existing laws regarding inherently governmental functions, would require congressional action. The executive branch cannot modify these designations as it can with the FAR or OMB Circular A-76. Congress could establish a statutory basis for desirable features of the policy letter. Without further legislation, the definition of \"critical functions\" would only exist in a policy document, subject to executive branch changes. Congress could also legislate to modify any aspects of the policy letter that do not align with its intent. The proposed policy letter may not align with Congress's intent, particularly regarding the contracting out of functions not inherently governmental. There is uncertainty about whether the inclusion of \"critical functions\" in the policy letter aligns with Congress's intent in the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act. The proposed policy letter raises questions about the classification of critical functions and the alignment with Congress's intent in the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act. OFPP's approach to identifying inherently governmental functions may need further exploration by Congress or the executive branch. Interagency contracting, especially in terms of accountability and transparency, may face challenges highlighted by the proposed policy letter. A review of interagency contracting and the definition of \"commercial activity\" as per OMB Circular A-76 could be necessary. This review could potentially lead to a narrowing of the definition to align with the proposed changes. A review of the appropriate role of the private sector in federal government work is suggested to balance government and contractor performance. Questions on the best mix of private and public sector labor, benchmarks for decision-making, and understanding 'overreliance' and 'underreliance' are raised. The concepts may be linked to the number and type of federal contract opportunities. The appropriate role of the private sector in federal government work is being reviewed to balance government and contractor performance. Questions on the best mix of private and public sector labor, benchmarks for decision-making, and understanding 'overreliance' and 'underreliance' are raised, linked to the number and type of federal contract opportunities. Some argue for reliance on the private sector for commercial services, while others believe new policies are needed due to the growth in government activities and procurement complexity. Other objectives, policies, or principles are considered equally important as reliance on contractors. Examples of these changes can be seen in OFPP's proposed policy letter. The role of the private sector in federal government work is under review to balance government and contractor performance. OFPP's proposed policy letter highlights the benefits contractors can provide in terms of expertise, innovation, and cost-effective support to federal agencies."
