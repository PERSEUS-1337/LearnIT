    "content": "The President signed the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, providing a total of $38.54 billion for FY2009 for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies. The Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $38.54 billion for FY2009 for Department of the Interior agencies, Forest Service, Indian Health Service, Environmental Protection Agency, arts and cultural agencies, and other entities. Funding also included activities within the Department of Energy. The Department of Energy programs were transferred to House and Senate Appropriations subcommittees for energy and water, while EPA jurisdiction was moved to subcommittees covering Interior and Related Agencies. Appropriations laws for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies have three primary titles: Title I covers Interior agencies, Title II discusses EPA. The report discusses Interior agencies in the first section, EPA in the second section, and other agencies, programs, and entities in the third section. It also covers cross-cutting topics that involve multiple agencies and major issues like Everglades restoration. The report highlights key funding changes for FY2009 and policy issues related to appropriations legislation. Budget submissions for some agencies are extensive, containing numerous funding, programmatic, and legislative details. The curr_chunk discusses appropriations laws providing funds for various accounts, activities, and directives. It includes final FY2009 appropriations levels enacted in the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009. The term appropriations represents total funds available, excluding permanent mandatory budget authorities. For more information on programs funded in the bill, contact key policy staff members listed at the end of the report. The curr_chunk discusses omnibus funds provided by P.L. 111-8, H.R. 1105 for FY2009, including stimulus funds from P.L. 111-5, H.R. 1. The House Committee on Appropriations is the main source of funding figures in the report. The primary sources of funding figures used in the report include the House Committee on Appropriations, the Senate Committee on Appropriations, agency budget justifications, and the Congressional Record. References to the \"Explanatory Statement\" for the omnibus law and the stimulus law are also included. Funding figures in tables may not add up precisely due to rounding. Table 1 displays appropriations for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies for FY2004-FY2009, with earlier years' funding not readily available. The FY2009 omnibus funding represented a $265.5 million increase. The FY2009 omnibus funding for Interior appropriations bill increased by $265.5 million (1%) over FY2004 in current dollars, but decreased by 11% in constant dollars. The Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 (P.L. 111-8, H.R. 1105) signed by the President allocated $27.59 billion for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies, which was $1.78 billion (7%) over the FY2009 Bush Administration request and $825.9 million (3%) below the FY2008 level. The FY2009 omnibus funding for Interior appropriations bill included $1.74 billion for lands and $75.0 million for FWS construction. The enactment of regular appropriations for FY2009 followed emergency funds in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, providing a total of $38.54 billion for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies for FY2009. President Bush signed the FY2009 CR, P.L. 110-329, on September 30, 2008, providing funding for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies from October 1, 2008, through March 6, 2009. Additional provisions were later extended through March 11, 2009 (P.L. 111-6). The FY2009 CR included provisions for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies, such as additional funding for National Park Service security for the Presidential inauguration and removing prohibitions on oil and gas leasing activities in certain regions of the Outer Continental Shelf. It also addressed funding for the Modified Water Deliveries Project for Everglades National Park. President Bush had requested $25.81 billion for these agencies for FY2009. The President requested $25.81 billion for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies for FY2009, a $2.61 billion reduction from FY2008. The House and Senate held hearings on agency budget requests, but no bills were reported or considered during the 110th Congress. Divisiveness over funding for oil and gas leasing in the Outer Continental Shelf was a major obstacle. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 was a $787 billion economic stimulus package aimed at preserving and creating jobs, promoting economic recovery, and making investments in transportation and environmental protection. It included $10.95 billion for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies, supplementing the $27.59 billion in omnibus appropriations for FY2009. Not all agencies typically funded through the Interior bill received funding in this law. The economic stimulus law provided funding to various agencies, with the majority going to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for clean water and drinking water state revolving fund grants. The remaining funds were allocated for cleanup projects such as Superfund remediation and grants for Brownfields and leaking underground storage tanks. The economic stimulus law allocated $10.95 billion in total funds, with a significant portion going to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for various purposes including cleanup projects, grants for Brownfields, and diesel emission reduction grants. Another portion of the funds went to federal land management agencies for construction, wildfire management, and facility maintenance. Additionally, funds were provided to the Bureau of Indian Affairs for road repair, school construction, and detention center maintenance. The economic stimulus law allocated $10.95 billion in total funds, with a significant portion going to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for cleanup projects, grants for Brownfields, and diesel emission reduction grants. Funds were also allocated to federal land management agencies for construction, wildfire management, and facility maintenance. Additionally, funds were provided to the Bureau of Indian Affairs for road repair, school construction, and detention center maintenance. Other agencies received funding for various purposes such as deferred maintenance, sanitation projects, and equipment purchases. The Senate had approved $11.11 billion, while the House had passed $14.81 billion, with differences between the two versions. The economic stimulus law allocated $10.95 billion in total funds, with a significant portion going to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for cleanup projects, grants for Brownfields, and diesel emission reduction grants. Funds were also allocated to federal land management agencies for construction, wildfire management, and facility maintenance. Additionally, funds were provided to the Bureau of Indian Affairs for road repair, school construction, and detention center maintenance. P.L. 111 - 5 provided emergency funding for FY2009, with the monies available for obligation until September 30, 2010. Interior appropriations laws do not typically limit obligations to two years. The FY2009 omnibus appropriations law funded some accounts until expended, while others were limited to one or two fiscal years. The economic stimulus law specified that it would not affect funds under the FY2009 continuing appropriations resolution and required agencies to notify the House and Senate Appropriations Committees on how the funds would be spent. Each agency had to submit a general expenditure plan within 30 days of enactment. The economic stimulus law required agencies to submit a general expenditure plan within 30 days of enactment. Agencies could transfer up to 10% of funds within the agency with approval. Administrative and support costs were not to exceed 5% of any specific appropriation. Activities funded in the Interior title are limited to 5% of any specific appropriation, unless specified otherwise. Controversial issues debated during consideration of the annual Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill include funding for Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects, and construction of BIA Schools and IHS Health Facilities, with concerns about proposed funding cuts. President Bush's budget includes controversial issues such as Indian Trust Funds, Land Acquisition, and Outer Continental Shelf Leasing. Key details include proposed reductions in funding, historical accounting of Individual Indian Money accounts, appropriate funding levels for Land and Water Conservation Fund, and preleasing and leasing activities in offshore areas. The curr_chunk discusses Continental Shelf Leasing, Payments in Lieu of Taxes Program (PILT), Royalty Relief, and Superfund funding. It focuses on issues such as compensating local governments for federal land, royalty relief for oil and gas companies, and funding for hazardous waste cleanup. The curr_chunk discusses termination of BIA Education and Housing, IHS Urban Health Programs, and Wildland Fire Fighting funding issues. It also mentions questions about fire protection funding levels, borrowing funds for wildfires, and environmental impact analysis. The Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 provided funding for the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to manage public land for various uses, including energy development and wildland fire management. The BLM received a $30.7 million increase in funding in FY2009. The FY2009 omnibus law provided $859.5 million for DOI wildland fire management, a $9.3 million increase over the Bush Administration request. This funding was a 28% decrease from the previous year's appropriation to the BLM for wildland fire management. Additionally, the FY2009 stimulus appropriations law allocated an extra $15.0 million for BLM for Wildland Fire Management. The Bush Administration proposed changes to the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act, aiming to redirect proceeds from land sales to the general fund of the Treasury and cap DOI receipts at $60 million annually. These changes were intended to increase oversight of funds during the appropriations process and update land management plans for selling or exchanging lands. Legislation would be required to enact these changes, but it has not been passed yet. The Bush Administration proposed redirecting proceeds from land sales to the general fund of the Treasury to increase oversight of funds during the appropriations process. The FY2009 omnibus law included $10.0 million for the Range Improvement Fund, which funds range improvements like vegetation projects and fencing. The Administration had sought to eliminate the fund and redirect grazing fee receipts to the general fund. The FY2009 omnibus law allocated $890.2 million for BLM land programs, including protection, recreational use, improvement, development, disposal, and administration. An additional $125.0 million was provided for activities such as remediation of abandoned mines and maintenance of facilities. The Bush Administration had proposed redirecting proceeds from land sales to increase oversight of funds. The FY2009 omnibus law allocated $28.2 million for the National Landscape Conservation System, an increase from the Administration's request. Overall, $60.8 million was provided for the NLCS, with some activities receiving less funding compared to FY2008. Recreation resources management saw a decrease to $45.9 million, but overall, there were increased funds for various activities. The FY2009 omnibus law included increases in funds for various activities compared to FY2008 levels. This included increases for soil, water, and air management, abandoned mine remediation, wild horse and burro management, wildlife management, and resource protection and law enforcement. Additionally, $99.4 million was allocated for energy and minerals management, a reduction from the previous year. The FY2009 omnibus law included increases in funds for various activities compared to FY2008 levels, such as soil, water, and air management, abandoned mine remediation, wild horse and burro management, wildlife management, and resource protection and law enforcement. Additionally, $99.4 million was allocated for energy and minerals management, a reduction from the previous year. The lower appropriation for FY2009 was primarily the result of offsetting fees derived through a program requiring payment for each application for a permit to drill oil and gas wells. The Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2009, removed the prohibition on using funds to prepare final regulations regarding a commercial leasing program for oil shale or to conduct a commercial oil shale lease sale. The FY2009 omnibus law allocated $7.8 million for the healthy lands initiative, an increase from the $4.9 million in FY2008. The Bush Administration had requested $14.9 million but settled for the lower amount. The initiative aims to enhance vegetation resources on western public lands and is funded through a combination of appropriations, existing funds, and contributions from partners. It focuses on six areas to restore and improve the health and productivity of large land areas. The Bureau of Land Management's FY2009 budget justification focused on six areas in western public lands to maintain, improve, and restore wildlife habitat. Additional funds were sought to expand initiatives in Colorado and add a seventh area in California. The omnibus law allocated $6.6 million for BLM construction, including funding for requested projects and additional ones. The FY2009 stimulus law provided $180.0 million to BLM for construction projects, including energy efficient retrofits and road repairs. This funding is significantly higher than previous years, ranging from $6.4 million to $16.8 million. For land acquisition, the omnibus law allocated $14.8 million, an increase from previous years. The omnibus appropriations law allocated $1.44 billion for Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) accounts, which was $850,000 less than the FY2008 appropriation. This amount included $75.0 million in emergency appropriations for construction. It represented an $138.7 million increase (11%) over President Bush's request for FY2009. The largest portion of the FWS annual appropriation is for the Resource Management account. The FWS annual appropriation for the Resource Management account was $1.14 billion, with an increase of $58.3 million (5%) over FY2008. The omnibus law also provided an additional $280.0 million for FWS, allocated to Resource Management and Construction accounts. The Endangered Species program funding increased to $158.0 million in FY2009. The omnibus law increased funding for the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund from $73.8 million in FY2008 to $75.5 million in FY2009, as proposed by President Bush. The FY2009 appropriation contained $233.5 million for endangered species and related programs, up 4% from FY2008. Final regulations for changes to the consultation process under ESA were published in December 2008. The final regulations for changes to the consultation process under ESA were published on December 16, 2008, and took effect on January 15, 2009. The changes were controversial, allowing the Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce to withdraw or reissue regulations without following rulemaking steps. On April 28, 2009, FWS announced the rescinding of new rules and reinstatement of old rules. The omnibus appropriations law also authorized the withdrawal of special rules for the threatened polar bear, limiting ESA protections to those under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The omnibus appropriations law provided $462.9 million for refuge operations and maintenance, increasing wildlife and habitat management, refuge-based law enforcement, visitor services, maintenance, and conservation planning. Refuge funding was not keeping pace with new demands, leading to increased costs of operations on many refuges. Refuge funding was not keeping pace with new demands, leading to cuts in programs to aid endangered species, reduce infestation by invasive species, protect water supplies, address habitat restoration, and ensure staffing at less popular refuges. The stimulus law provided additional funding to address these concerns, but some observers believe ongoing problems will persist after the funding is exhausted. The omnibus appropriations law allocated $62.7 million for FWS law enforcement in FY2009, an increase of 5% over FY2008 levels. The FY2009 stimulus law provided the FWS with $165.0 million for Resource Management and $115.0 for Construction, using nearly identical criteria for project selection. Projects were encouraged to prioritize creating jobs and lasting value for the American public, including critical maintenance, habitat restoration, and energy conservation. The FY2009 stimulus law allocated $115.0 million for Construction projects, including maintenance, repairs, retrofits, and construction work on National Wildlife Refuges and other Service properties. Local laborers, contractors, and companies will be hired for these projects, with a focus on job creation and habitat restoration. The omnibus appropriations law included $35.5 million for construction, an increase from the President's request of $12.2 million. The omnibus law allocated $35.5 million for construction, an increase from the President's request of $12.2 million, but down 67% from the FY2008 total. An additional $115.0 million was received from the stimulus law, resulting in a total of $150.5 million for Construction, up 39% over the FY2008 appropriation. $4.9 million was appropriated for avian flu research and monitoring, down 33% from FY2008. The program was transferred to the Migratory Bird Management Program for studying the virus spread through wild birds. The focus is on studying the spread of the virus through wild birds, particularly North American species with migratory patterns that may come into contact with infected Asian birds. The geographic areas of interest include Alaska, the Pacific Flyway, and Pacific islands. Funding for land acquisition in FY2009 was increased to $42.5 million, up from $34.6 million in FY2008. President Bush's budget for FY2009 proposed a reduction in Land Acquisition to $10.2 million and a decrease in Refuge Acquisition to $0.9 million. The aim was to focus on managing existing lands in the refuge system. In FY2009, funding for land acquisition was increased to $42.5 million, with a focus on managing existing lands in the refuge system. The majority of the program's funding has historically been for land acquisitions for federal refuges, but recent years have seen less funding allocated for traditional land acquisition. The program is funded through appropriations from the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) and the Migratory Bird Conservation Account (MBCA), which has a source of mandatory spending for land acquisition. President Bush proposed increasing the price of a duck stamp from $15 to $25 in FY2009, with a further increase to $35 in FY2013, but no action has been taken. The MBCA has been increasingly used to protect habitat for migratory birds, with President Bush's budget assuming a 35% increase in MBCA revenues to $54.0 million for FY2009. The National Wildlife Refuge Fund compensates counties for federal lands of the NWRS, supported by receipts and a permanent appropriation. The National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) receives funding from various activities, but additional appropriations are needed to fully fund authorized amounts. Congress provided $14.1 million for FY2009, a slight increase from FY2008. The Multinational Species Conservation Fund (MSCF) benefits endangered species like elephants, tigers, and marine turtles. The omnibus appropriations law allocated $10.0 million for the MSCF. The omnibus appropriations law allocated $10.0 million for the Multinational Species Conservation Fund (MSCF) and $4.8 million for the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Fund (NMBCF) in FY2009. State and Tribal Wildlife Grants support conservation efforts for species of concern to states, territories, and tribes, with funding used for conservation plans and projects. The omnibus appropriations law allocated $75.0 million for FY2009 for State and Tribal Wildlife Grants. Funding is divided for competitive grants to tribal governments, matching grants to states, and is determined by formula. The appropriation for FY2008 was $73.8 million, with a similar request for FY2009. The National Park Service (NPS) oversees 391 park units covering 85 million acres, protecting diverse natural and historic areas. The NPS mission is to preserve park resources while making them accessible to the public, with nearly 20 types of area designations including national parks, monuments, and recreational areas. Park recreational visits totaled nearly 275 million visits. The NPS received $2.53 billion for FY2009, with increases compared to previous years. The omnibus appropriations law provided funding boosts for most NPS accounts, including park operations. The law also extended the authorization for the NPS Advisory Board. The National Parks Centennial Initiative, proposed by the Bush Administration in 2006, aimed to address chronic budget shortfalls in the national parks. It sought to add up to $3 billion in new funds over 10 years through a public/private joint effort, with three components: adding $100 million annually in discretionary funds, challenging the public to donate $100 million annually, and implementing other park programs to strengthen visitor services. The National Parks Centennial Initiative proposed by the Bush Administration in 2006 aimed to address budget shortfalls in national parks by adding $3 billion in new funds over 10 years through a public/private joint effort. This included adding $100 million annually in discretionary funds, challenging the public to donate $100 million annually, and implementing other park programs to strengthen visitor services. The initiative also included a proposed $1 billion \"Centennial Challenge\" relying on private donations, raising concerns about potential commercialization and privatization influence on the parks. The stimulus law provided additional funding for three NPS budget accounts, totaling $750 million, close to the Senate's original support of $747 million. The House initially supported $1.8 billion for the NPS, including $100 million for the Centennial Challenge program, which was not retained in the law. The stimulus law provided $589.0 million for construction, more than double the regular FY2009 appropriations. $146.0 million was allocated for park operations, covering deferred maintenance and critical repair projects. $15.0 million was designated for historic preservation grants to Historically Black Colleges and Universities. The law emphasized agency flexibility in project allocation to create jobs and lasting value for the park system. The FY2009 omnibus appropriations law provided $2.13 billion for park operations, with $99.6 million specifically for maintenance and repair. An additional $146.0 million from the stimulus law was allocated for the National Park System operations. This funding accounts for nearly 85% of the total NPS budget and supports 20,923 full-time equivalent positions. The majority of operations funding for national parks is provided directly to park managers, covering essential activities, programs, and services. This includes resource protection, visitors' services, facility operations, maintenance, and administrative expenses. The FY2009 omnibus law allocated $98.6 million for the US Park Police, with $2.0 million for security for the Presidential Inauguration, representing a 5% increase above the request and a 14% increase from FY2008. The funding also supports additional recruits in 2009. The US Park Police received $98.6 million in funding for FY2009, with $2.0 million allocated for security during the Presidential Inauguration. The force had fallen to a 20-year low of 576 officers by January 2008, with serious deficiencies in leadership, staffing, training, and equipment cited by the DOI Inspector General. The USPP is responsible for law enforcement at park sites in Washington, DC, New York City, and San Francisco, with authority extending to all NPS units and certain federal and state lands. The US Park Police received $98.6 million in funding for FY2009, with $2.0 million allocated for security during the Presidential Inauguration. Following the release of the OIG report, changes were made to the leadership of the USPP. The Bush Administration proposed the National Parks Centennial Initiative, but funding for this initiative has not been authorized by Congress. The Centennial Challenge received $24.6 million in seed money from Congress in FY2008, to be matched by private contributions. The funding was directed towards signature projects controlled by the NPS, not for core operations or commercializing parks. The Park Service has started work on projects funded through the Challenge. Additionally, $59.7 million was allocated for National Recreation and Preservation in FY2009, $14.2 million more than the Bush Administration's request but $7.7 million less than FY2008, due to the exclusion of the Preserve America grant program. In FY2009, $7.4 million was allocated in the NR&P line item for the Preserve America grant program, traditionally funded in the Historic Preservation Fund. The program supports park system recreation, natural and cultural resource protection, environmental compliance, and state/local community efforts. The FY2009 omnibus law provided $15.7 million for the heritage partnerships program, an increase of $8.6 million (121%) above the request. The Appropriations Committees expressed concerns about the increasing number of national heritage areas (NHAs) and favored funding new areas primarily through planning funds. The omnibus appropriations law allocated $5.6 million for statutory and contractual aid to NHAs, $1.9 million less than FY2008. The Bush Administration proposed discontinuing the program, which provides limited financial assistance to natural, historical, cultural, or recreational areas not managed by the NPS. The Historic Preservation Fund administers grants for activities specified in the National Historic Preservation Act. The National Park Service (NPS) provides grants for historic preservation activities under the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). The NHPA was reauthorized in 2006, extending funding through 2015. The grants are typically funded on a 60% federal/40% state matching share basis. The Historic Preservation Fund also includes funding for Save America's Treasures. The omnibus appropriations law allocated $69.0 million for the HPF, a 2% decrease from FY2008 but a 4% increase from the FY2009 request. Funding for state and tribal historic preservation grants increased by $3.1 million (8%) and $0.6 million (9%) respectively. In FY2009, funding for historic preservation grants decreased, with Save America's Treasures seeing a 19% decrease. The Preserve America grant program was not funded, and the National Inventory of Historic Properties was also excluded from appropriations. The Bush Administration had requested $3.0 million for the National Inventory program. In FY2009, funding for historic preservation grants decreased, with Save America's Treasures seeing a 19% decrease. The Preserve America grant program was not funded, and the National Inventory of Historic Properties was also excluded from appropriations. The Bush Administration had requested $3.0 million for the National Inventory program. Additionally, the FY2009 omnibus appropriations law provided $232.5 million for the NPS construction budget, a substantial boost above the request and FY2008 funding levels. The Construction line item funds new construction projects, improvements, repair, rehabilitation, and replacement of park facilities. DOI estimates deferred maintenance for the NPS for FY2008 at between $8.23 billion and $12.11 billion. In FY2009, the omnibus appropriations law provided $64.2 million for NPS land acquisition and state assistance, with $45.2 million allocated for NPS land acquisition, exceeding the Administration's request. Land acquisition funds are used to acquire lands for the National Park System, including buying inholdings within park boundaries. Additionally, $19.0 million was allocated for LWCF state assistance, despite the Bush Administration not requesting funds for FY2009. The FY2009 enacted level for State assistance was $19.0 million, $5.6 million less than FY2008. Funds are allocated among states for recreation-related land acquisition and planning. For more information, refer to the \"Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF)\" section in this report. The USGS is a science agency that provides information on natural hazards, the environment, energy, minerals, water, and biological sciences. It is also a mapping agency and a source of water resource data. In FY2009, it received $1.04 billion in funding, an increase from previous years. In FY2009, the USGS received $968.5 million in funding, with increases for global climate change research, satellite operations, water resources research institutes, and geologic resource assessments. Additionally, the stimulus law provided an extra $140.0 million for various activities such as facility repairs and upgrades to monitoring systems. The FY2009 omnibus appropriations law provided $112.5 million for the Enterprise Information Program within the USGS, which includes funding for information technology, security, services, and resources management. This program consists of three primary programs: enterprise information security and technology, enterprise information resources, and national geospatial program. The FGDC provides operational support and management for geospatial data collaboration. The FY2009 omnibus appropriations law allocated $72.3 million for the program, with $40.2 million designated for the Landsat program, including Landsat 8 for environmental monitoring and Landsat 5 and 7 for Earth data. The FY2009 omnibus law allocated $242.1 million for Geologic Hazards, Resources, and Processes activities, with specific funding for Hazard Assessments, Landscape and Coastal Assessments, and Resource Assessments. The volcano hazards program received $23.9 million, with emphasis on evaluating volcano research and monitoring needs in active areas like Hawaii, Yellowstone, the Cascades, and Alaska. The Bush Administration requested an $8.2 million increase for a water census component in the Water for America Initiative. Funding for the water census in the Landscapes and Coastal Assessments program was not provided in FY2009, but the omnibus law allocated $221.4 million for mineral resource assessments. Congress retained funding for the program, with universities or other entities conducting assessments to support nonfederal needs. The omnibus law allocated $221.4 million for water resources research, including $65.1 million for the National Water Quality Assessment and $9.0 million for the Groundwater Resources Program. This funding countered a Bush Administration request to reduce support for water resources research institutes. The FY2009 omnibus appropriations law allocated $185.3 million for the Biological Research Program, a $5.5 million increase from FY2008. The program focuses on conserving and managing biological resources, including research on climate change effects, wildfires, ecosystems, river habitats, vertebrate diseases, and gap analysis. The FY2009 omnibus appropriations law allocated $185.3 million for the Biological Research Program, focusing on conserving and managing biological resources. Funding was provided for priority ecosystems in the Greater Everglades, Chesapeake Bay, San Francisco Bay, and Mojave Desert. Science Support modernizes infrastructure for managing scientific information, while Facilities cover maintenance and repair costs. The stimulus law provided an additional $140.0 million for USGS facilities. The FY2009 omnibus law allocated $45.5 million for USGS climate change research, an increase of $12.0 million from FY2008. The program aims to provide science, monitoring, and predictive modeling on climate changes and their effects on the U.S. landscape. Scientists will track indicators of climate change and develop decision support tools for policy makers and resource managers. The FY2009 omnibus law allocated $10.0 million for a new National Global Warming and Wildlife Science Center to study the impacts of climate change on forest carbon storage, glaciers, ecosystem modeling, and the Yukon River Basin. The Center was tasked with developing adaptation and mitigation strategies for plants, wildlife, and ecosystems to become resilient to climate change. The FY2009 omnibus law allocated funds for a National Global Warming and Wildlife Science Center to study climate change impacts on ecosystems. Collaboration with stakeholders was encouraged, and funds were allocated for carbon sequestration studies. The Minerals Management Service administers programs for offshore energy and minerals management. The Obama Administration finalized regulations for alternative energy leases in the Outer Continental Shelf. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) collects and disburses revenue from federal onshore and offshore leases, as well as Indian mineral leases. Revenues are distributed to states, the U.S. Treasury, and designated programs. In FY2008, MMS collected about $23.5 billion in revenue, with royalties from natural gas and oil leases fluctuating annually based on oil and gas prices. Oil royalties accounted for 39% of MMS receipts in FY2007, a significant increase from previous years. In FY2008, royalties from natural gas and oil leases contributed about 25% each, while record bonus bids accounted for about 44% of MMS receipts. Other sources of MMS receipts include rents for all leaseable minerals and royalties from coal and other minerals. The FY2009 funding level for MMS was $310.4 million (gross funding level), composed of: $116.7 million in appropriations (net funding level); $146.7 million in offsetting collections retained since 1994; and $47.0 million in state cost sharing deductions. This represented a 5% increase in gross funding from FY2008, but a 1% decrease in net funding. The Bush Administration had sought a gross funding of $307.1 million for FY2009. The Bush Administration's funding request for FY2009 was higher than enacted due to a $47.0 million deduction for royalty cost-sharing with states not included in the request. Moratoria on oil and gas development in certain OCS areas were lifted in 2008, allowing for future development. Congress removed annual moratoria provisions for the Atlantic and Pacific coasts in the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2009. An OCS moratoria was not reinstated in the omnibus appropriations law for FY2009. The moratoria on oil and gas development in certain OCS areas were not reinstated in the FY2009 appropriations law. The decision to reinstate the moratoria is contentious, with some supporting their removal to increase domestic oil and gas supply, while others are concerned about adverse economic and environmental impacts. Legislation in the 109th Congress opened part of the Gulf of Mexico for leasing but placed a moratorium on the eastern Gulf until 2022. The Bush Administration initiated a new leasing program in 2008, with a draft proposal in January 2009 set to take effect in 2010. The Obama Administration extended the comment period for the proposal from 60 to 240 days. The Secretary of the Interior extended the comment period for OCS oil and gas leasing from 60 to 240 days due to resource assessments and environmental concerns. Legislation has been introduced to permanently prohibit leasing in certain OCS areas. Royalty relief for OCS producers has been debated, with no royalties collected on leases awarded in 1998 and 1999. The MMS omitted price thresholds in lease agreements for oil and gas production in 1998 and 1999. A lawsuit by Kerr-McGee challenged the Secretary of the Interior's authority to impose price thresholds, with a ruling in favor of Kerr-McGee in 2007. The Department of the Interior appealed the ruling, which was upheld by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2009. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans upheld the District Court decision regarding OCS royalties, potentially affecting $23-$31 billion in future royalties. Congressional discussions are ongoing on royalty relief issues, with estimated losses to the federal Treasury ranging from $21-$53 billion over 25 years. The 110th Congress passed legislation addressing lease modifications without price thresholds. The 110th Congress passed legislation allowing the Interior to modify leases in the Gulf of Mexico to include price thresholds. The bill aimed to ensure that current leases included price thresholds or lessees agreed to pay a \"conservation of resources fee.\" Critics raised concerns about the effectiveness of the MMS audit and compliance program, suggesting a need for stronger controls to improve royalty collection. DOI established the Royalty Policy Committee (RPC) to review the MMS Mineral Leasing Program and offered over 100 recommendations for improvement. The Royalty-in-Kind Program saw significant growth from 2004 to 2007. The Government Accountability Office suggested improvements for the program in a report issued in 2008. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 established the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement to ensure coal-mined land is reclaimed. An Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund was created to address abandoned mine sites with fees levied on coal production. The omnibus appropriations law provided $164.7 million for the Office of Surface Mining for FY2009, with $120.3 million allocated for Regulation and Technology. The Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund received a net appropriation of $44.4 million, including a $25.3 million increase over the Bush Administration's request. The Bush Administration's FY2009 request for Abandoned Mine Land (AML) funds was reduced to $19.1 million, with a proposed rescission of $11.7 million. This reduction was offset by an increase for the Bureau of Land Management for environmental investigation and restoration at Naval Oil Shale Reserve Number 3 in Colorado. The request did not include new funding for State Emergency Grants or Federal Emergency Projects. The Bush Administration's FY2009 request for Abandoned Mine Land (AML) funds was reduced to $19.1 million, with a proposed rescission of $11.7 million. Congress disagreed with the Administration's decision not to include new funding for State Emergency Grants and Federal Emergency Projects, adding $25.3 million to the Fund. Disbursements from the AML fund were previously determined by annual appropriations, with states and tribes developing their own regulatory programs. The Abandoned Mine Land (AML) collections were divided into federal and state share accounts, with a complex formula determining state allocations. Fee collections exceeded appropriations, resulting in a $2.1 billion unappropriated balance by FY2007. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act reauthorized AML fee collections through FY2021. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act reauthorized AML fee collections through FY2021 and made changes in grant disbursement procedures. Western states, paying more into the fund due to coal production shifts, sought increased appropriations to address disproportionate reclamation burdens. P.L. 109-432 addressed these concerns by funding state and tribal grants from general U.S. Treasury funds starting in FY2008, with some activities still requiring annual appropriations. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act reauthorized AML fee collections through FY2021 and made changes in grant disbursement procedures. P.L. 109-432 addressed concerns by funding state and tribal grants from general U.S. Treasury funds starting in FY2008, with some activities still requiring annual appropriations. Among the expenses covered are federal AML programs in states without OSM-approved reclamation programs, an emergency reclamation program, OSM administrative expenses, and the Clean Streams program. Annual collections deposited to the AML fund are used to calculate total funds distributed to states and tribes in the following fiscal year. Certified states and tribes that have completed remediation of priority sites will receive balances in their accounts in seven annual installments paid from general Treasury funds. Changes in P.L. 109-432 redirected AML collections from certified states to federal-share accounts based on historical coal production, discontinuing allocations to the Rural Abandoned Mine Program. This aimed to increase funds for distribution to uncertified states for reclamation efforts. Disbursements to uncertified states are based on their coal production account and will increase gradually from 50% in FY2009 to 100% in FY2012. Certified states will receive 50% in FY2009, 75% in FY2010, and the full amount in FY2011. OSM estimates that 83% of fee collections will go to states and tribes outside the appropriation process.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs provides services to federally recognized tribes and their members. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) provides programs and services to federally recognized American Indian and Alaska Native tribes. These programs include government operations, law enforcement, social programs, economic development, and education through the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE). In FY2009, BIA and BIE received $2.38 billion in funding, with an increase of $84.9 million from FY2008. The FY2009 stimulus law added $500.0 million in emergency supplemental funding. The FY2009 stimulus law added $500.0 million in emergency supplemental appropriations for the BIA, increasing Indian Affairs funding by 26% compared to FY2008. $450.0 million was targeted towards BIA construction programs for road repair, school construction, and maintenance. The remaining $50.0 million was allocated for workforce training, housing improvement, and guaranteed loans. The law aimed to create jobs and lasting value for the American public through these construction projects. The stimulus law allocated $500.0 million in emergency appropriations for the BIA, with $450.0 million for construction projects and $50.0 million for workforce training and housing improvement. BIA construction projects were exempt from prevailing wage rate requirements, and DOI released details on funded projects. Key programs for BIE and BIA include education, law enforcement, welfare assistance, and road maintenance. The BIE funds an elementary-secondary school system and higher education programs, comprising 184 schools educating about 44,000 students. Tribes and tribal organizations operate 123 institutions, with BIE operating the rest. BIE also runs two postsecondary schools and provides grants to 26 tribally controlled colleges. Key issues include low student achievement, schools failing to make adequate yearly progress, and inadequate school facilities. In school years 2003-2006, 69%-70% of BIE-funded schools failed to make AYP. In school years 2003-2006, 69%-70% of BIE-funded schools failed to make AYP. In FY2008, BIE received $12.1 million for education program enhancements to improve instructional resources at schools targeted for restructuring. Activities funded include teacher development, principal training, reading and math programs, and tutoring for high school students. The JOM program provides education assistance grants for Indian students attending public schools. Indian students attending public schools receive funding through the Johnson-O'Malley (JOM) program, which is funded in two budget activities, Tribal Government and BIE. In FY2009, JOM received a total of $21.4 million, with $13.80 million allocated in the BIE budget activity and $7.6 million in the Tribal Government budget activity. The Bush Administration had proposed no funding for JOM, citing concerns about its impact on BIE's school system and lack of focused academic achievement goals. The Johnson-O'Malley (JOM) program provides funding for Indian students in public schools and tribally operated schools. Two tribal career and technical colleges, UTTC and Navajo Technical College, receive grants under the Education Department's Carl Perkins Act program. The Bush Administration had sought to end funding for these colleges in FY2009. The Bush Administration aimed to cut funding for tribal technical colleges in FY2009, arguing they receive enough from the Perkins Act. However, proponents claim BIE funding is crucial for their operations. The omnibus appropriations law allocated $6.0 million for these colleges, a slight increase from FY2008. Many BIE school facilities are in poor condition, with health and safety issues. BIA education construction funding for FY2009 saw a decrease from FY2008 but received additional funds under the stimulus law, totaling $406.5 million. Rising crime rates, methamphetamine use, and juvenile gang activity are reported by BIA and Justice Department. Rising crime rates, methamphetamine use, and juvenile gang activity are reported on Indian reservations. The federal government has jurisdiction over major criminal offenses, with tribes sharing limited sentencing options. Tribes have fewer law enforcement resources than state and local jurisdictions, with a significant gap in needed officers. BIA funds law enforcement programs, including the \"Safe Indian Communities Initiative\" under the Bush Administration. The House Appropriations Committee directed BIA to allocate FY2008 funding increases for tribal law enforcement outside the usual methodology to serve areas with the greatest need, especially remote reservations. The omnibus appropriations law contained a further increase for law enforcement to $255.1 million for FY2009, an increase of $26.9 million over FY2008. Most of the increase was for police services and criminal investigations. The omnibus law for FY2009 allocated $14.5 million to tribal courts, a $170,000 increase from FY2008. The Bush Administration had proposed a decrease in funding, but proponents argued that tribal courts are underfunded and essential for law enforcement on reservations. The Indian Housing Block Grant is the main federal housing program, while BIA's HIP focuses on repairs and new houses. The Housing Improvement Program (HIP) is a smaller program that focuses on urgently needed repairs, renovations, or modest new houses for the neediest families on or near reservations. Total HIP funding was $13.7 million in FY2008, with an increase to $32.6 million in FY2009, including stimulus funding for new home construction. The Bush Administration had proposed eliminating HIP for FY2009, citing cost-effectiveness concerns. The Bush Administration proposed eliminating the Housing Improvement Program (HIP) for FY2009, arguing it is not cost-effective and serves a limited number of tribes. Indian tribes and supporters opposed the elimination, stating that HIP meets a significant need for housing rehabilitation. The BIA's Road Maintenance program is the primary source of funds for maintaining BIA-owned roads and bridges, including those under the Indian Reservation Roads program. The Indian Reservation Roads (IRR) program is the largest federal funding source for road and bridge construction on Indian reservations and trust lands. It is jointly managed by the Transportation Department and BIA, with funds allocated to BIA for tribal projects. The omnibus law allocated $26.0 million for Road Maintenance in FY2009, an increase of $0.5 million from FY2008. The FY2009 stimulus law included $142.5 million for Road Maintenance, bringing the total funding to $168.5 million. The Bush Administration had proposed reducing BIA Road Maintenance appropriations by 49% to $13.0 million. The Administration proposed a 49% reduction in BIA Road Maintenance appropriations to $13.0 million, arguing tribes could use 25% of IRR funds for maintenance. Tribes opposed the cut, stating funding was insufficient even with 25% of IRR funds. Federal recognition grants tribes sovereignty, jurisdictional powers, and access to federal programs. The Interior Department established a process for acknowledgment decisions in 1978, now managed by the Office of Federal Acknowledgment (OFA). OFA employs experts to review recognition petitions, criticized for lengthy processes. The Office of Federal Acknowledgment (OFA) has faced criticism for delays in reviewing recognition petitions due to resource constraints. The omnibus law allocated $2.61 million for OFA in FY2009, a slight increase from the previous year. The Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) provides financial assistance to various insular areas and freely associated states in the Western Pacific. For more information on the Bureau of Indian Affairs and education programs, visit their respective websites. The Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) manages relations between the federal government and insular areas like American Samoa, CNMI, and USVI. OIA funding includes permanent appropriations and annual discretionary funds from Assistance to Territories (AT) and Compact of Free Association (CFA) accounts for various projects and government operations. The Office of Insular Affairs receives funding from permanent and annual appropriations, as well as from the Assistance to Territories (AT) and Compact of Free Association (CFA) accounts. In FY2009, $321.7 million was allocated through statutes, with $208.7 million from the Compacts of Free Association and $113.0 million for fiscal assistance to territories. An additional $84.0 million in combined AT and CFA funding was provided through annual appropriations, representing a 1% increase from FY2008. In FY2009, the Office of Insular Affairs received a total of $84.0 million in combined Assistance to Territories (AT) and Compact of Free Association (CFA) funding, which was a 1% increase from FY2008. The AT funding of $78.7 million was allocated for various technical projects, while $5.3 million in CFA funds were provided. The AT appropriation exceeded the Administration's request by 5%, with a specific recommendation to use some of the funds to staff an office in Guam for military build-up issues. The CFA appropriation of $5.3 million was 10% higher than the Administration's request. In FY2009, the Office of Insular Affairs received $84.0 million in combined Assistance to Territories (AT) and Compact of Free Association (CFA) funding, a 1% increase from FY2008. The AT funding of $78.7 million was for technical projects, exceeding the Administration's request by 5%. The CFA funds of $5.3 million were 10% higher than the request. The PILT program compensates local governments for federal land within their jurisdictions that cannot be taxed. President Bush requested $195.0 million for PILT in FY2009, a 15% decrease from FY2008. However, no funding for PILT was included in the omnibus appropriations law or the stimulus law for FY2009. The PILT program in FY2009 received an enacted appropriation at the estimated authorized amount, totaling over $3.8 billion since 1976. Despite controversy over funding levels not matching property taxes, annual appropriations were consistently lower than authorized amounts between FY2000 and FY2008. The PILT program does not provide funding comparable to property taxes, especially in rural areas, leading to the need for additional PILT funds to provide necessary services. Mandatory spending of the full authorized amount was enacted for FY2008-FY2012, resulting in no annual appropriations during those years. For more information on the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program, visit the DOI website. The Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians (OST) oversees the reform of Interior Department management of Indian trust assets and manages Indian funds directly, including tribal funds and Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts. Tribal funds owned by about 300 tribes have a total asset value over $2.9 billion, while IIM accounts have a total asset value over $420 million. The Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians (OST) manages Indian trust assets, including tribal funds and Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts. The funds total over $420 million and come from various sources such as claims awards, settlements, and investment income. Key issues for OST include historical accounting for tribal and IIM accounts, litigation, and the Indian land consolidation program. The FY2009 appropriations act provided $181.6 million for OST, a reduction from the previous year. The Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians (OST) manages Indian trust assets, including tribal funds and Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts. Appropriations for historical accounting are usually made through OST, with a limit of $56.4 million for FY2009. The House Appropriations Committee has expressed intent to limit expenditures for historical accounting, citing its impact on other Indian programs. Historical accounting is expected to be time-consuming due to the large number of IIM accounts and missing documents. In 2003, the Department of the Interior proposed a $335 million project to reconcile Indian Trust accounts from 1938-2000. The plan aimed to reconcile all transactions for judgment and per-capita accounts, transactions over $5,000 for land-based accounts, and use statistical sampling for transactions under $5,000. The plan was revised in 2007 due to increased costs, reducing the number of transactions reconciled, and changing sampling strategies. Special deposit accounts were no longer included as they were being distributed to other accounts. OST continues to follow the 2007 accounting plan, estimating a total cost. The Department of the Interior proposed a $335 million project in 2003 to reconcile Indian Trust accounts from 1938-2000. The plan was revised in 2007 due to increased costs, with OST estimating a total cost of $271 million and completion in FY2011. Plaintiffs in the IIM litigation questioned the validity of the sampling technique and the time period. The judge rejected the historical accounting plan in 2008 but did not order a new process or cessation of accounting. The Bush Administration argued for the continuation of historical accounting for tribal suits and settlement discussions. Over 100 tribes have filed trust fund and accounting suits. Over 100 tribes have filed trust fund and accounting suits, including the IIM suit. One tribal suit seeks class action certification for over 250 tribes. OST proposed allocating $40 million to IIM accounts out of $56.4 million for historical accounting in FY2009. The Cobell v. Salazar class-action lawsuit was filed in 1996 by IIM account holders. OST activities are related to the Cobell case, focusing on methods for historical accounting and settlement discussions. In January 2003, DOI submitted a proposed historical accounting plan to the district court for the Cobell case, estimating a cost of $335 million over five years. After changes in methods in 2007, the revised plan was estimated to cost $271 million and be completed by the end of FY2011. Different methods produced varying estimates of a total owed to IIM accounts, with the highest being $176 billion. The Cobell district court held a trial on correct historical accounting methods in September 2003, rejecting both. The court rejected both plaintiffs' and DOI's historical accounting plans in September 2003, ordering DOI to account for all trust fund and asset transactions since 1887 without using statistical sampling. DOI estimated the cost to be $6-$12 billion, appealed the order, and later estimated compliance with a new order to cost $12-$13 billion. The Appeals Court for the D.C. Circuit vacated the district court's order in November 2005. OST continued historical accounting under its 2003 plan. In October 2007, a new judge presided over the Cobell case, questioning the Department of Interior's (DOI) historical accounting efforts. The court rejected the DOI's accounting plan in January 2008, deeming it inadequate and impossible due to high costs. Instead of a revised accounting process, the court ordered hearings for a remedy. In August 2008, the court ruled for $455.6 million in restitution to the plaintiffs, who had initially sought $27-$100 billion. Congress expressed concerns over the lawsuit's costs potentially hindering trust reform implementation. The costs of the Cobell lawsuit may jeopardize DOI trust reform implementation and reduce spending on Indian programs. Possible settlement costs could be as high as $100 billion estimated by plaintiffs, $27.5 billion proposed in 2005, $8 billion proposed by Congress, $58 billion requested in 2008, or $46 billion sought in June 2008. Tribal trust fund and accounting suits could further increase settlement costs. Funding large federal payments for settlements is a concern for Congress. The House Appropriations Committee has urged parties to settle trust litigation in its entirety. Settlement bills were introduced in the 109th Congress, but no trust fund settlement legislation was introduced in the 110th or 111th Congress. The Treasury Department's \"Judgment Fund\" was considered insufficient for a settlement in the $6-$13 billion range. The Indian land consolidation program, funded by Congress in FY1999, aims to reduce ownership fractionation of Indian trust lands. The FY2009 omnibus appropriations law did not allocate funds for this program, leading to a $9.8 million reduction from FY2008. The Bush Administration argued that despite acquiring over 360,000 interests since 1999, the program has not decreased ownership fractionation or trust management costs, with 1.5 million new fractionated interests created during the same period. The Administration claimed that despite acquiring over 360,000 interests since 1999, the Indian land consolidation program has not reduced ownership fractionation or trust management costs. A working group was established to explore other options for land consolidation. The National Indian Gaming Commission oversees tribal regulation of Class II and Class III games, with funding adequacy being a primary appropriations issue. The National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) receives most of its budget from annual fees assessed on tribes' gaming operations, with a fee cap raised to $8 million in 1998 and $12 million for FY2004-FY2007. No direct appropriations were made for NIGC activities during FY1999-FY2008 and FY2009. The National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) amended the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) in 2006 to establish a formula-based fee ceiling of 0.08% of gross gaming revenues. The NIGC anticipated fee revenues of $15.5 million for FY2008, a 19% increase from FY2007. For FY2009, they expect fee revenues of about $17 million. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for regulating air and water quality, pesticides, hazardous waste management, and environmental cleanup. Visit http://www.nigc.gov for more information on NIGC. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) receives funding for various statutory responsibilities, including managing solid and hazardous wastes, environmental cleanup, and grants to assist states in pollution control. In FY2009, EPA received $7.64 billion in appropriations, with additional emergency funding of $7.22 billion from the stimulus law. Congress made some reductions in specific programs despite the overall increase in EPA's budget. In FY2009, Congress appropriated a total of $14.86 billion for the EPA, doubling its annual funding. $6.00 billion was allocated for grants to states for their State Revolving Funds, with $4.00 billion for Clean Water projects and $2.00 billion for Drinking Water projects. The funds had to be obligated by the end of FY2010 to stimulate the economy. In addition to the $6.00 billion allocated for State Revolving Funds in FY2009, Congress appropriated $2.00 billion for Drinking Water projects. The remaining $1.22 billion in stimulus funds was designated for various EPA cleanup projects and initiatives. The FY2009 appropriations focused on federal assistance for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects, environmental cleanup, and air quality. Congress addressed policy matters such as greenhouse gas emissions reporting, environmental justice, hazardous air pollutants regulation, and toxic substances releases reporting. The omnibus law directed EPA to re-evaluate a Clean Air Act waiver denial by the Bush Administration. The EPA will re-evaluate a Clean Air Act waiver denial by the Bush Administration, allowing California to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new vehicles. EPA appropriations for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects are allocated to State and Tribal Assistance Grants for funding State Revolving Funds (SRFs) for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure upgrades to comply with federal regulations. The EPA allocates annual appropriations for State Revolving Funds (SRFs) to help states meet federal water quality requirements. States must provide matching funds to receive federal grants, which are used to issue low-interest loans for water infrastructure projects. Repayments from these loans help maintain the SRFs by providing capital for new projects. The State Revolving Funds (SRFs) are designed to be self-sustaining by using repayments to fund new projects. However, federal assistance is still needed to ensure states have enough capital for water infrastructure projects. The FY2009 appropriations law provided $689.1 million for Clean Water SRF grants, with funding declining since FY2005. Maintaining or increasing federal assistance is crucial due to long-term community needs and stricter water quality requirements. The FY2009 omnibus law provided $829.0 million for Drinking Water SRF grants, consistent with previous years. The stimulus law significantly increased funding for SRF grants in FY2009, with $4.00 billion for Clean Water SRF grants and $2.00 billion for Drinking Water SRF grants. Matching funds requirement was waived under the stimulus law. EPA will allocate these funds using existing formulas. The stimulus law waived the 20% matching funds requirement for SRF grants and allowed states to provide negative interest loans, forgive loan principal, or award grants for water infrastructure projects. Congress also allocated $145.0 million for special project grants in FY2009 to address water quality needs. The FY2009 special project grants totaling $145.0 million were allocated to address water quality needs, with recipients required to provide 45% matching funds. The Superfund program, established by CERCLA, ensures responsible parties pay for environmental contamination cleanup. Past Administrations did not request funding for these projects in their annual budgets. The Hazardous Substance Superfund account supports the assessment and cleanup of contaminated sites administered under EPA's Superfund program, with funding allocated to sites on the National Priorities List. Some funding also goes towards enforcement and research for more effective cleanup methods. Congress directs EPA to transfer funds for research from the Superfund account to the Science and Technology account in annual appropriations. The Superfund program funds homeland security activities for emergency response to terrorist attacks involving hazardous substances. Funding levels have remained steady at around $1.25 billion annually, with some Members of Congress advocating for a constant pace of cleanup using federal and responsible party contributions. Federal funds could improve cleanup pace and quality at sites with no viable parties to pay costs, potentially allowing more sites to be listed on the NPL for cleanup. Concerns about steady funding being eroded by inflation have sparked debate on reinstating Superfund taxes on industry to support the Hazardous Substance Superfund Trust Fund, which Congress appropriates funds from to finance the EPA's Superfund program. The Superfund Trust Fund is now supported by general Treasury revenues after special industry taxes expired. Industry still contributes through corporate income taxes. The FY2009 appropriations law allocated $1.29 billion to the Superfund account, with transfers for cleanup research and investigation. The FY2009 omnibus appropriation for the Superfund program was $1.29 billion, which included an additional $600 million from the stimulus law for remedial cleanup projects. Congress limited EPA's use of these funds for management expenses to maximize project costs. The FY2009 omnibus appropriation for the Superfund program was $1.29 billion, with an additional $600 million from the stimulus law allocated for long-term cleanup projects at NPL sites. These remedial projects aim to address risks to human health and the environment, creating jobs in the private sector through contracts awarded to private companies for construction and equipment installation. The Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2002 amended CERCLA to establish a program for cleaning up contaminated brownfields, which are commercial and industrial properties with less hazardous contamination. Prior to the amendments, EPA used Superfund money for brownfield cleanup. The 2002 amendments to CERCLA established a separate Brownfields grant program within EPA to aid states and communities with site assessment and cleanup activities. Section 104(k) authorizes EPA to award competitive grants for individual brownfields cleanup, while Section 128 allows grants to states to enhance their own brownfields programs. Congress appropriates funding for these grants within the State and Tribal Assistance Grants account. The FY2009 omnibus appropriations law allocated $169.7 million for EPA's Brownfields program, an increase from previous years. $97.0 million was designated for competitive grants for site assessment and cleanup, with an additional $100.0 million provided by the stimulus law. Recipients will hire private contractors to work on brownfields sites, creating jobs in the private sector. The Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Trust Fund was established by Title V of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 to support cleanup of petroleum from leaking underground storage tanks. Congress appropriates funds from this trust to enforce and oversee cleanup actions by responsible parties. If the responsible party cannot pay, the funds may be used for cleanup. The LUST Trust Fund, established in 1986, supports cleanup of petroleum from leaking underground storage tanks. Appropriated funds can be used for cleanup if responsible parties cannot pay, are not found, or fail to comply. Funds can also be used in emergencies to protect human health and the environment. Financially viable responsible parties can be required to reimburse the funds. Additionally, the EPA can enter into grant agreements with states and territories to carry out cleanup and enforcement activities using trust fund monies. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 added provisions to expand the use of trust fund monies for regulating underground storage tanks to prevent leaks. EPA's role includes overseeing compliance with these regulations. The FY2009 omnibus appropriations law allocated $112.6 million for the LUST Trust Fund Program, with $77.1 million for cleanup and enforcement actions and $35.5 million for leak prevention efforts. An additional $200.0 million in supplemental funds was provided for cleanup and enforcement actions under Section 9003(h). Matching funds requirement for cooperative grant agreements was waived by the stimulus law. EPA works with states and territories to prevent leaks from underground storage tanks. The law waived the 10% matching funds requirement for cooperative grant agreements and limited EPA's management costs to 1.5% of the $200.0 million funding. Congress is interested in funding EPA's air quality programs, allocated among State and Tribal Assistance Grants, Environmental Programs, and Science and Technology accounts. Funding supports regulatory programs, research, and monitoring activities related to air quality. The Superfund account includes funding to address radiation exposure risks from hazardous waste sites with radiological contamination. The FY2009 appropriations act increased funding for air quality programs, including grants for diesel emission reduction projects and state and local air quality management grants. These grants support the implementation of the Clean Air Act by monitoring air quality, issuing permits, and conducting training for pollution control activities. The omnibus appropriations law provided $360.0 million in FY2009 for grants to reduce diesel emissions, authorized by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. EPA awards these grants competitively to assist governments and organizations in reducing emissions from diesel-powered vehicles. The FY2009 omnibus appropriations law allocated funds to reduce emissions from diesel-powered vehicles and equipment. It included a provision requiring EPA to reserve $6.5 million for developing a rule on mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. The FY2009 omnibus appropriations law allocated funds for reducing emissions from diesel-powered vehicles and equipment. The law included provisions related to environmental justice and prohibited EPA from using funds for certain regulatory purposes. Section 425 of the FY2009 omnibus appropriations law prohibited EPA from implementing Bush Administration regulations that altered emissions control requirements and reporting thresholds for toxic substances. Section 424 required the EPA Administrator to reconsider the decision to deny California's request to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new vehicles. The State of California has requested the Obama Administration to reconsider the Bush Administration's denial of a waiver to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles. The Clean Air Act allows California to set its own emission standards for vehicles with an EPA waiver. EPA is required to re-evaluate this decision by June 30, 2009. The omnibus appropriations law provided $4.75 billion for FY2009 for the USDA Forest Service, $631.4 million more than the Bush Administration request. The stimulus law added $1.15 billion for the Forest Service in FY2009, with allocations for Capital Improvement and Maintenance and Wildland Fire Management. FS appropriations are divided into major accounts including Forest and Rangeland Research, State and Private Forestry, National Forest System, Wildland Fire Management, Capital Improvement and Maintenance, Land Acquisition, and Other. The Forest Service budget for FY2009 included funding for Fire Management, Capital Improvement and Maintenance, Land Acquisition, and other programs. Significant issues were raised during appropriations debates, including proposed cuts to State and Private Forestry programs. Congress rejected these cuts and also addressed FS Payments to States under the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act. The FY2009 Forest Service budget included funding for various programs, with proposed land sales to extend payments under the Secure Rural Schools program not materializing. The program was eventually extended for four years with declining payments. State and Private Forestry programs received increased funding in the omnibus appropriations law for FY2009. In FY2009, the omnibus appropriations law provided $265.9 million for State and Private Forestry programs, rejecting proposed cuts by President Bush. Forest health management programs received additional funding compared to the Bush Administration request and FY2008 levels. Health programs received additional funds for FY2009 under the stimulus law, with cooperative fire programs funded at higher levels than requested. The omnibus appropriations law allocated $27.0 million for forest stewardship, $57.4 million for the forest legacy program, and rejected proposed cuts for State and Private Forestry programs. The omnibus appropriations law provided additional funds for urban and community forestry, cooperative forestry programs, and international forestry in FY2009. The total funding allocated was $57.4 million, which was significantly more than the requested amount and higher than the FY2008 level. The omnibus appropriations law allocated $333.3 million for forestry research and development programs in FY2009, which was $40.3 million more than requested and $11.5 million more than the FY2008 level. The FY2009 omnibus appropriations law provided $1.51 billion for National Forest System funding, which was $40.2 million above FY2008 levels. Most sub-accounts saw modest increases, with a total proposed cut of $120.0 million (8%) compared to the Bush Administration's request. This funding includes construction, maintenance of facilities, roads, trails, and deferred maintenance. The FY2009 omnibus appropriations law provided $482.4 million for Capital Improvement and Maintenance, $76.6 million more than the Bush Administration request and $17.6 million more than the FY2008 level. Increases were seen in most accounts, with decreases only for facilities construction and road construction. The maintenance backlog was a particular interest to Congress, with the Bush Administration proposing $9.1 million for deferred maintenance. The Administration sought to reduce deferred maintenance by $39.6 million in FY2008, with total funding for maintenance backlog reaching $59.1 million in the omnibus appropriations law. Additionally, the stimulus law allocated $650.0 million for Capital Improvement and Maintenance in FY2009. The omnibus appropriations law provided $49.8 million for land acquisition in FY2009, significantly more than the Bush Administration's request. This funding will likely be used to address the agency's maintenance backlog and support various projects such as restoration, ecosystem enhancement, and remediation of abandoned mine sites. The Indian Health Service (IHS) in the Department of Health and Human Services provides comprehensive medical and environmental health services for American Indians and Alaska Natives through federal, tribal, and urban Indian-operated programs and facilities. IHS operates hospitals, health centers, school health centers, and health stations for approximately 1.9 million AI/AN individuals belonging to 562 federally recognized tribes in 35 states. The Indian Health Service (IHS) operates hospitals, health centers, and clinics for American Indians and Alaska Natives. They receive funding through appropriations, reimbursements, and a special Indian diabetes program, with a total budget of $3.58 billion for FY2009, including an additional $500 million from the stimulus law for facilities construction and improvement. The FY2009 IHS budget includes $3.19 billion for Health Services and Facilities, with 89% allocated to Health Services and 11% to Facilities. If stimulus law appropriations are included, Facilities receive 20% and Health Services 80%. Key issues include urban Indian health, Indian health professions programs, and health care facilities construction. The FY2009 budget for Health Services was $219.4 million more than FY2008, totaling $3.19 billion. The FY2009 IHS Health Services budget is $2.97 billion, funded through congressional appropriations, private health insurance reimbursements, and federal programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Estimated total reimbursements were $779.7 million. An additional $150.0 million per year is spent on the Special Diabetes Program for Indians. The budget has three subcategories: clinical services, preventive health services, and other services. Clinical services received $2.63 billion, an increase of $191.9 million over FY2008. The FY2009 IHS Health Services budget is $2.97 billion, with clinical services receiving $2.63 billion. The FY2009 appropriation for hospital and health clinic programs was $1.60 billion, $113.8 million more than FY2008. HIT funds from the stimulus law totaled $85.0 million, increasing the total budget to $1.68 billion. The Indian Health Care Improvement Fund is included in the hospitals and health clinics budget activity. The Indian Health Care Improvement Fund (IHCIF) received an allocation of $15.0 million for FY2009, $1.2 million more than FY2008 and $5.0 million more than the Bush Administration's request. Funds are distributed based on health care funding needs, with priority given to units with the greatest deficiencies. Contract Health Services (CHS) funds the purchase of health services from local providers when IHS cannot provide care. Contract Health Services (CHS) is crucial in IHS regions with limited direct-care facilities, providing care through its own system. The Catastrophic Health Emergency Fund (CHEF) covers high-cost cases, such as disaster victims or catastrophic illnesses, with $634.5 million allocated for CHS in FY2009. Additionally, $31.0 million was designated for CHEF, representing a 17% increase from FY2008. Other clinical services programs received funding increases as well, including $141.9 million for dental programs and $67.7 million for mental health in FY2009. In FY2009, funding for mental health saw a 7% increase from FY2008 and a 3% increase from the FY2009 request, totaling $67.7 million. Alcohol and substance abuse received $183.8 million, a 6% increase from FY2008 and a 13% increase from the FY2009 request. Preventive health services were allocated $135.2 million, a 6% increase from FY2008 and a 3% increase from the Bush Administration's FY2009 request. This included funding for methamphetamine treatment and prevention, public health nursing, health education, immunizations in Alaska, and the tribally administered community health representatives program. The FY2009 appropriations for public health nursing, health education, Alaska immunizations, and the CHR program saw increases of 7% and 3% from FY2008 and the Bush Administration's request, respectively. The omnibus appropriations law allocated $430.0 million for other health services in FY2009, including urban Indian health programs, Indian health professions support, contract support costs, tribal management grants, direct IHS operation of facilities, and self-governance technical assistance. Contract support costs received the largest appropriation of $282.4 million for FY2009. In FY2009, Contract Support Costs (CSC) received $282.4 million, a 6% increase from FY2008. This funding is provided to tribes for administering IHS-funded programs under self-determination contracts. Tribal management grants received $2.59 million, a 4% increase from FY2008. Direct IHS operations appropriations were $65.3 million in FY2009, a 3% increase from FY2008. In FY2009, urban Indian health program received $36.2 million, a $1.6 million (5%) increase from FY2008. The program provides preventive and primary health services for eligible urban Indians through contracts and grants with urban Indian organizations. The Bush Administration did not propose funding for the program in FY2009. The Bush Administration argued that IHS funding should focus on Indians near reservations, while opponents questioned the impact on urban Indian health programs. IHS's Indian Health Professions program includes scholarships, loan repayment, and recruitment activities. The Indian Health Professions programs aim to increase the number of Indians in health professions and fill vacancies in IHS-funded health care facilities. The omnibus appropriations law allocated $37.5 million for FY2009, $1.2 million more than FY2008 and $15.6 million more than the Bush Administration's request. There was opposition to proposed funding cuts, with proponents arguing for an increase to maintain scholarships and loan repayment awards. The FY2009 omnibus appropriations allocated $390.2 million for the IHS Facilities budget category, including funds for equipment, construction, maintenance, and improvement of health-care and sanitation facilities. This was $15.5 million more than FY2008 and $36.8 million more than the Bush Administration's request. Specific allocations included $53.9 million for maintenance and improvement, $95.9 million for sanitation facilities construction, $22.1 million for equipment, $178.3 million for facilities and environmental health support, and $40.0 million for health care facilities construction. In FY2009, the stimulus appropriations law allocated $415.0 million to the IHS Facilities budget, totaling $805.2 million for Facilities, a 115% increase from FY2008. $227.0 million was designated for health care facilities construction, resulting in a total of $267.0 million for FY2009, a 630% increase from FY2008. Congress specified allocations for other activities in the Facilities budget. The Facilities budget for FY2009 allocated $100.0 million for maintenance and improvement, $68.0 million for sanitation facilities, and $20.0 million for equipment. This marked significant increases over FY2008, with a total of $153.9 million, $163.9 million, and $42.1 million respectively. The stimulus law exempted medical equipment spending caps and prevailing wage rate requirements for IHS facilities construction projects. The Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation (ONHIR) was created in 1974 to resolve a dispute between the Hopi and Navajo tribes over lands originally set aside for a reservation in 1882. The lands were partitioned between the two tribes, with members of one tribe living on land partitioned to the other tribe being relocated at federal expense. ONHIR's main activities involve land relocation. The Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation (ONHIR) was established in 1974 to address a land dispute between the Hopi and Navajo tribes. ONHIR's primary activities include land acquisition, housing construction, infrastructure development, and providing support for relocated families. The omnibus appropriations law allocated $7.5 million for ONHIR in FY2009, a decrease from the previous year. The relocation process, which began in 1977, is close to completion, with a small backlog of eligible families awaiting replacement homes. Most families affected by relocation were Navajo, with only a few eligible Hopi families living on Navajo partitioned land. According to ONHIR data, the relocation process for Navajo and Hopi families is almost complete, with 98.5% of eligible Navajo families and 100% of Hopi families relocated by the end of FY2007. However, around 250 Navajo families living on Hopi land may opt out of their agreements and relocate using ONHIR benefits. As of the end of FY2007, 51 eligible Navajo families were awaiting relocation, with eight still residing on Hopi land. ONHIR and the U.S. Department of Justice were in negotiations with the Hopi Tribe regarding the relocation of these families. The Hopi Tribe allowed seven Navajo families to stay on Hopi land as autonomous families in exchange for relocating families who had signed agreements but later opted out. ONHIR estimated that relocation for 51 eligible families would be completed by FY2009, but additional Navajo families opting out or filing late appeals could extend the process. Congress has expressed concerns about the speed of relocation and avoiding forced evictions. The ONHIR appropriations language prohibits evicting Navajo families from Hopi partitioned lands without providing a replacement home. Negotiations aim to prevent forced relocations as the backlog of relocatees is reduced. The Smithsonian Institution is a museum and research complex with 19 museums. The Smithsonian Institution (SI) is a museum and research complex with 19 museums, 9 research facilities, and the National Zoo. It had over 28.2 million visitors in 2008 and is funded by federal appropriations and a private trust. In FY2009, it received $731.4 million in funding, with allocations for Salaries and Expenses, Facilities Capital, and the Legacy Fund. In FY2009, the Smithsonian Institution received $593.4 million in funding for salaries, expenses, museums, and research centers, representing a 5% increase from FY2008. There was a $10 million increase for museums and research institutes, but a $10 million decrease for facilities services and planning. Concerns over governance and fiscal management had been raised during the FY2008 appropriations process, but progress was noted in the FY2009 omnibus bill. The Appropriations Committees requested a review of the Smithsonian's reform progress and funding needs. $123.0 million was allocated in FY2009 for Facilities Capital, an increase from FY2008. An additional $25.0 million was provided in the stimulus law. The FY2009 omnibus appropriations law allocated $25.0 million for Facilities Capital, with funds used for repairs at the Arts and Industries Building, National Zoo, and infrastructure projects. This brought total appropriations to $148.0 million, an increase of $42.6 million from FY2008. Additionally, $15.0 million was provided for the SI's Legacy Fund to address facility repairs backlog, with a requirement for private donations matching. None of the funds could be used for day-to-day maintenance or general expenses. The Smithsonian Institution received $14.8 million in FY2008 for the Legacy Fund, with a requirement for private donations to match federal funds two to one. In addition to federal appropriations, the SI also receives income from trust funds for salaries, capital projects, and operations. Net assets decreased by almost 4 percent in FY2008 to just under $2.4 billion. For more information, visit http://www.si.edu/. The National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities includes the NEA, NEH, Federal Council on the Arts and Humanities, and IMLS. NEA is a major federal supporter of arts disciplines, providing grants to all states. In FY2009, NEA received $155.0 million, a 7% increase from FY2008. In FY2009, the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) received $128.2 million for grant funding, with direct grants receiving $54.1 million and state/regional partnership grants receiving $42.0 million. Additionally, $9.8 million was allocated for Challenge America, representing a 6% increase over FY2008 funding. In FY2009, the NEA received $128.2 million for grant funding, including $54.1 million for direct grants and $42.0 million for state/regional partnership grants. An additional $13.3 million was allocated for American Masterpieces, while $50.0 million was received through the stimulus law for grants and administration to support arts projects and activities preserving jobs in the non-profit arts sector. The NEH supports grants for humanities education, research, preservation, and public programs. They have provided over 61,000 grants since 1965 and offer a Challenge Grant program to match private donations. In FY2009, NEH received $155.0 million, an increase of $10.3 million from FY2008. One of their largest programs is federal/state partnerships, which received $35.0 million for FY2009, an increase of $3.3 million from FY2008. The National Endowment for the Arts received $15.8 million in FY2009, an increase of $0.8 million (5%) from FY2008 funding. The We the People initiative grants include model curriculum projects for schools to improve humanities course offerings. The leading causes of environmental deterioration in South Florida are altered natural flows of water due to canals, levees, and pumping stations. In 1996, Congress authorized the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to create a plan to restore the South Florida ecosystem, including the Everglades. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was completed in 1999, with federal involvement authorized by Congress in the Water Resources Development Act of 2000. WRDA 2000 is considered the key law for Everglades restoration projects. Appropriations for restoration projects in the South Florida ecosystem have been provided to various agencies through annual appropriations bills. Federal and state funding for projects related to the restoration of the ecosystem has exceeded $3.3 billion and $12.0 billion respectively from FY1993 to FY2009. DOI conducts CERP and non-CERP activities in southern Florida through multiple agencies. The funding for restoration activities in southern Florida is expected to be around $286 million per year for the next 10 years. In FY2009, $118.3 million was allocated to DOI for Everglades restoration, an increase from previous years. Additional funds were also provided under the stimulus law. The primary difference in funding between FY2008 and FY2009 was for the Modified Water Deliveries Project (Mod Waters), with $60.0 million allocated in FY2009. The funding for restoration activities in southern Florida is around $286 million per year for the next 10 years. In FY2009, $118.3 million was allocated to DOI for Everglades restoration, with an additional $60.0 million for the Modified Water Deliveries Project (Mod Waters). The project aims to improve water deliveries to Everglades National Park and restore natural hydrological conditions. Funding and planning for the Tamiami Trail portion of the project are being conducted by the Corps, with a project to increase water flows southward by creating a 1-mile bridge on Tamiami Trail and raising the canal height by one foot. The project to increase water flows southward in Everglades National Park includes building a 1-mile bridge on Tamiami Trail and raising the canal height by one foot, costing $227 million. A feasibility study for additional bridge length beyond the current project is to be submitted to Congress by March 11, 2010. Concerns about federal commitment to Everglades restoration are raised due to limited authorized projects since WRDA 2000. Federal commitment to Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) implementation is a concern, with debates on funding levels and project delays. Phosphorus pollution is a key issue, but recent appropriations laws did not address mitigation measures. The Interior appropriations laws from FY2004-FY2008 conditioned funding for the Modified Water Deliveries Project on meeting state water quality standards. Funds would be provided unless federal departments/agencies report that water quality standards are not met in the A.R.M. Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge and Everglades National Park, leading to disapproval of further expenditure of funds. These provisions were enacted due to concerns about a Florida state law amending the Everglades Forever Act to address phosphorus pollution in the Everglades. The LWCF is authorized at $900 million annually through FY2015 for Everglades Restoration. The funds may not be spent without an appropriation and are used for federal land management agencies. For more information on Everglades Restoration, visit the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Program website and the Corps of Engineers website. The LWCF is used by federal land management agencies like the Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, and Forest Service for land acquisition. It also funds state and local governments for recreational development through a grant program. Additionally, money from the LWCF has been used for related activities since FY1998, with appropriations varying each year. Most federal acquisitions are specified for specific management units, while state grant programs and other activities are also funded. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) appropriations have fluctuated over the years. In FY2009, $275.3 million was allocated, with $152.2 million for federal land acquisition, an 18% increase from FY2008. This amount was more than three times the Administration's request for FY2009. In FY2009, $275.3 million was allocated for the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), with $152.2 million for federal land acquisition, exceeding the Administration's request. Funding for federal land acquisition has increased from $111.9 million in FY2006 to $152.2 million in FY2009. The omnibus appropriations law provided $19.0 million for stateside grants in FY2009. The Bush Administration did not request funds for new stateside grants in FY2009 through FY2008, citing alternative funding sources for parkland acquisition. They also stated that the program could not measure performance effectively and was not central to NPS's core functions. A small amount of funding was requested for administration of the grant program in FY2009. The Clinton Administration had also proposed eliminating stateside funding in the past. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 eliminated stateside funding, with $8.2 million in revenue from OCS leasing projected for FY2008. The omnibus appropriations law allocated $104.1 million for FWS Cooperative Endangered Species Grants and FS Forest Legacy Program in FY2009, a third of what the Bush Administration had requested. President Bush had sought funds for other programs within the Department of the Interior and the Forest Service for FY2009. In FY2008 and FY2009, the largest portion of the LWCF appropriation was for land acquisition, a shift from previous years. Congress appropriated funds for various programs within the Department of the Interior and the Forest Service, with ongoing controversies surrounding wildfire protection programs and funding. The FY2009 omnibus appropriations law provided $2.99 billion for the FS and DOI wildland fire management accounts, with increases from previous years. Discussions include the high cost of fire suppression efforts, locations for fire protection treatments, and challenges hindering fuel reduction activities. The budget request proposed transferring wildfire funds from the Bureau of Land Management to the Office of the Secretary\u2014Department-Wide Programs. FY2008 funding included $1.71 billion of emergency wildfire appropriations. Additionally, the FY2009 economic stimulus law provided an extra $515.0 million for reducing fuel levels on federal lands. The omnibus appropriations law for FY2009 allocated $1.33 billion for wildfire suppression, an increase of $193.7 million from FY2008. This included $148.3 million for the Forest Service and $45.4 million for the Department of the Interior. However, the funding was still less than the total of fire suppression and emergency funding in recent years. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concern about the high costs of large fires in the FY2008 appropriations bill. The Federal Land Assistance, Management, and Enhancement (FLAME) Act was introduced to modify funding for severe fires. The omnibus appropriations law included $956.8 million for wildfire preparedness in FY2009, an increase of $90.7 million from the request. Congress increased preparedness funding for both the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior. The FY2009 omnibus appropriations law included $705.2 million for other wildland fire operations, with $31.8 million allocated for burned area rehabilitation, a decrease of $4.0 million from the BLM's funding. The FY2009 omnibus appropriations law allocated $11.5 million for the Forest Service (FS) and $31.0 million for the Department of the Interior (DOI) for burned area rehabilitation. Emergency funds totaling $131.0 million were enacted for FY2008 to supplement burned area rehabilitation efforts. Fuel reduction, a focus of the Bush Administration, received $531.1 million in the omnibus appropriations law. In FY2009, additional funds were allocated for fuel reduction efforts, with $515.0 million from the economic stimulus law. The Joint Fire Science Program received increased funding, with $6.0 million for DOI and $8.0 million for FS. Funding for fire research and development was also increased. In FY2009, funding for FS fire plan research and development was increased to $23.9 million, $1.9 million above the request and 2% above the FY2008 level. The omnibus appropriations law significantly increased FY2009 FS fire assistance funding to $91.2 million, with increases for forest health management on federal lands, volunteer fire assistance, and state fire assistance. The law also restored proposed cuts in State and Private Forestry funding for these programs. The omnibus law increased funding for community assistance by $1.1 million (19%) from FY2008. It also provided $500.0 million in emergency wildfire appropriations for FY2008, with funds allocated for wildfire suppression, repayment of accounts, fuels reduction, and hazard mitigation activities. The FY2008 Interior appropriations act allocated funds for various purposes, including $25.0 million for FS rehabilitation, $6.0 million for DOI rehabilitation, and $14.0 million for FS facilities construction. Additionally, emergency wildfire suppression funds were provided by different acts, totaling $910.0 million for FY2008, with $775.0 million for the FS and $135.0 million for DOI. The FY2008 appropriations act allocated funds for various purposes, including $110.0 million for DOI emergency wildfire suppression, $175.0 million for FS fuels reduction, and $25.0 million for FS preparedness in high-risk areas.
