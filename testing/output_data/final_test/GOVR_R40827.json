    "content": "Congressional concerns have led to legislative proposals like the \"Solomon Amendment\" requiring higher education institutions to grant military recruiters access to campuses or risk losing federal funds. DOD can collect high school student directory information for recruiters, and colleges and universities are at the forefront of expanding civil rights. School campuses have been at the forefront of expanding civil rights for gay individuals, challenging DOD policy on homosexuality. Some campuses have restricted military presence by limiting recruitment and cutting ROTC connections. Legislation addresses recruiting separately for high schools and colleges. In 1982, Congress allowed the Secretary of Defense to collect student directory information for recruiting purposes. The Secretary of Defense was allowed to collect student directory information for recruiting purposes, limited to students 17 years or older in eleventh grade or higher in US secondary schools. The information collected included name, address, education level, and was to be kept confidential. Some controversy arose over recruiter access to campuses, with some schools allowing military recruiters despite opposition. In 1999, Congress enacted legislation requiring secondary schools to provide the Department of Defense (DOD) with access to student information for recruiting purposes. Despite this change, some schools still resisted allowing recruiter access. In 2000, Congress mandated that educational agencies must grant military recruiters access to campus and directory information. If access was denied, the services were to escalate the issue to designated officials and ultimately involve the Secretary of Defense if necessary. Certain private schools with religious objections could be exempt from this requirement. In 2001, Congress strengthened the mandate for educational agencies to provide military recruiters access to students and directories. Parental consent allowed students to opt out of releasing their information. In 2002, NCLB amendments required educational institutions to grant recruiter access upon request, with opt-out provisions and exceptions for private schools with religious objections to military service. In 2003, Congress removed the provision allowing a majority vote to deny recruiter access or directory information. In 2007, DOD changed how it uses its recruiting database after a settlement with the New York Civil Liberties Union. The DOD agreed to use the recruiting database only for recruiting purposes, not share data with other agencies, destroy information after three years, and collect Social Security numbers from the Selective Service System. Some school districts have tried to limit military recruitment on campuses, but these efforts have been short-lived. Successful tactics to counter military recruitment have been less restrictive, such as schools in Hawaii no longer releasing student contact information due to a recruiter misleading students. In response to threatened litigation, a school district in North Carolina will grant campus access to a peace activist attempting to recruit students to alternative careers. Prior to the 1993 DADT compromise, exclusion of gays and lesbians from military service, and ROTC, had proven problematic on some college campuses. For example, in May 1990, two students from Harvard and MIT were dismissed from the Navy ROTC program at MIT, with the Navy seeking recoupment of scholarship funds totaling over $80,000. The provost of MIT criticized the ROTC policy of excluding gay and lesbian students and requiring them to repay scholarship funds. The Navy decided not to seek recoupment from two students. A directive issued by the Deputy Defense Secretary allowed recoupment for violations of military law but not for homosexuality. Individuals using homosexuality as an excuse to avoid military service may have to repay their scholarships. In the past decade, there has been significant congressional and judicial activity regarding military access to colleges and universities. The Solomon Amendment in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY1995 limited interference with military access by denying funds to institutions that restrict Secretary of Defense's access for recruiting purposes. Congress also added language in 1996 regarding ROTC programs at educational institutions. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY1996 added language regarding ROTC programs at colleges and universities, prohibiting funds to institutions with anti-ROTC policies. The Secretary of Defense was required to notify relevant committees of such determinations. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY1996 added language prohibiting funds to institutions with anti-ROTC policies. The Secretary of Defense must notify relevant committees of such determinations. In August 2010, two ineligible institutions were listed in the Federal Register: Vermont Law School and William Mitchell College of Law. The Connecticut Supreme Court upheld a ruling banning military recruiters from the University of Connecticut Law School campus. Despite this, the University of Connecticut maintained military ROTC units on its Storrs campus. The University of Connecticut maintained ROTC units on its Storrs campus to fulfill the requirement of teaching military tactics under the Morrill Act. Despite a court ruling prohibiting military recruiters at the UConn Law School in Hartford, the university continued to enroll students in ROTC and accepted federal funding. This may have conflicted with the state's 1991 Gay Rights Law. The law limited educational institutions from blocking ROTC programs or recruiter access. Funds would not be available to institutions that denied military recruiters or ROTC programs, with exceptions for ceasing discrimination, pacifist policies, or state prohibitions. In 1997, the Department of Defense published a list of schools in Connecticut that prohibited military recruiting on campus. Service members attending these schools risked losing tuition assistance. The FY1998 National Defense Authorization Act addressed this issue by acknowledging the state's actions to restrict military recruiting at state-funded colleges. The Department of Defense suspended funding to colleges and universities in Connecticut due to a prohibition on military recruiters. The Governor has pledged to remedy the issue, and the Secretary of Defense will not use funds for contracts or grants until March 29, 1998, to allow time for the prohibition to be repealed. The Secretary of Defense may use funds for reprogramming or rescission activities despite the prohibition on military recruiters. The state legislature approved allowing military recruitment on state campuses, and Congress later modified the law to prevent withholding federal funds from students attending schools that violated recruiter access rules. Opposition to these restrictions took various forms, with many law schools seeking ways to address the issue. Restrictions on military recruiting at law schools led to efforts by some schools, including sending a letter listing action items to address the issue. The House of Representatives passed a resolution supporting non-discrimination policies on campus. The House of Representatives passed a resolution reaffirming commitment to military personnel readiness and equal access for military recruiters at higher education institutions. Congress urges the executive branch to challenge any obstacles to the operation of this requirement and to follow the doctrine of non-acquiescence. The Solomon Amendment prohibits funds from being provided to higher education institutions that restrict military recruiters' access to campuses or student information. The Solomon Amendment requires higher education institutions to provide student information to military recruiters, leading to legal challenges such as Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights (FAIR) where the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the amendment. The Court reversed a decision that required universities to comply with the Solomon Amendment, which mandates funding based on military recruiter access. The universities argued that allowing recruiters on campus conflicted with their anti-discrimination policies due to the military's DADT policy. FAIR argued that the Solomon Amendment violated free speech rights by penalizing law schools for not allowing military recruiters on campus. The government defended its actions citing Congress's powers to support the military. The Third Circuit decision could impact military recruitment. The government argued that allowing military recruiters on campus does not infringe on law schools' free speech or expressive association rights. Recruiters represent their employers, not the schools, and schools can still protest the military's message as long as recruiters have equal access. The Court was receptive to the government's arguments. The Court was receptive to the government's arguments regarding the Solomon Amendment and rejected all three arguments put forward by the law schools regarding the First Amendment rights of objecting institutions. The Court found fatal flaws in the law schools' analysis and stated that indirect compulsion by Congress via a funding condition may not be unconstitutional. This could have implications for future legal debates on legislative access for military recruiters on college campuses. The Court upheld the Solomon Amendment, stating that while expressive conduct is subject to First Amendment scrutiny, the law schools' actions did not constitute compelled speech. Requiring law schools to facilitate military recruiters' access was deemed different from government-mandated pledges or mottos, and did not infringe on the schools' speech rights. The Court upheld the Solomon Amendment, stating that law schools allowing military recruiters on campus did not constitute compelled speech. Allowing recruiters did not require the schools to \"associate\" with them, and they could still express opposition to military policies through other means like signs, picketing, speeches, and forums of protest. The Court upheld the Solomon Amendment, stating that law schools allowing military recruiters on campus did not constitute compelled speech. Recruiters are considered outsiders with limited purpose, not becoming members of the school's expressive association. Congress has broad powers over military manpower and personnel matters, including the authority to require campus access for recruiters, which is generally entitled to judicial deference. The Court rejected FAIR's position, emphasizing that regulations are not invalid simply because there may be other alternatives. In the wake of the FAIR case, litigation regarding military recruitment on college campuses has mostly subsided. However, a recent case, Young America's Foundation v. Gates, raised concerns about DOD enforcing the law. The advocacy organization sued DOD to withhold funds from the University of California-Santa Cruz for allegedly denying military recruiters access to campus. The Court of Appeals dismissed the case, stating the plaintiffs lacked standing. Some opponents of military recruiting in high schools have raised legal concerns about student contact information privacy. However, statutory and constitutional analysis supports the release of student directory information under FERPA. This law allows such information to be available to outside entities even without the military recruitment provisions. The military recruitment provisions do not raise constitutional concerns regarding student contact information privacy. The Supreme Court has recognized a constitutional right to privacy under the Fourteenth Amendment, but has not established a standard for measuring violations. Circuit courts use balancing tests to determine privacy violations, as seen in Falvo ex rel. Pletan v. Owasso Independent School District No. I-011. The court ruled that peer grading violated FERPA but denied the plaintiff's constitutional claim based on a three-part balancing test. The Tenth Circuit found that student's school work and test grades did not warrant constitutional protection. The release of student names, addresses, and telephone numbers to military recruiters may not violate constitutional privacy rights, as basic contact information is unlikely to be considered private. The government could argue that this information serves a compelling state interest in maintaining the armed forces. Courts may view the disclosure as minimally intrusive, as students have the option to opt out or decline military service. The court would likely reject privacy challenges to student data collection provisions, as Congress acted within its constitutional authority under the Spending Clause to promote policy goals by conditioning federal funds on state compliance. The Supreme Court has upheld this technique to induce cooperation with federal policy, including in the recent FAIR case."
