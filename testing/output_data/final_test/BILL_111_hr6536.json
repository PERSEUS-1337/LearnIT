    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Voluntary Protection Program Act\" and establishes the Voluntary Protection Program. The Secretary of Labor will establish cooperative agreements with employers to promote safety and health management systems, including hazard assessment, prevention programs, management and employee participation, and training. Additionally, a voluntary protection program will be implemented to encourage excellence in protecting employees from occupational hazards. The voluntary protection program requires employers to submit an application demonstrating compliance with safety requirements and undergo onsite evaluations by representatives of the Secretary of Labor to ensure employee protection. The voluntary protection program under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 requires employers to provide information about their safety and health program to the Secretary of Labor. Periodic reevaluations by the Secretary of Labor are necessary for continued participation in the program. The Secretary of Labor monitors program performance through the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration is required to develop a documentation policy for follow-up actions on fatalities and injuries at worksites in the voluntary protection program. Internal controls must be established to ensure compliance with program policies for onsite reviews and monitoring of injury rates. Additionally, a monitoring system needs to be put in place. Establish a monitoring system for the voluntary protection program with specific performance goals and measures. Sites approved for the program are exempt from certain inspections, investigations, and paperwork requirements, except for cases like employee complaints or fatalities. No payment is required for employers to participate in the program. The Secretary of Labor will oversee the transition to the new voluntary protection program, ensuring it aligns with the previous program. Employers with active agreements before the enactment of this Act will be included in the new program. Employers with active agreements before the enactment of this Act, under the voluntary protection programs by OSHA, can continue participating in the new program. The Secretary of Labor will establish a program to increase small businesses' participation in the voluntary protection program. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal year 2011 and beyond."
