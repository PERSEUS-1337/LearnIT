    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Economic Growth and Price Stability Act of 1999\". The Congress finds that during inflation, the US experiences economic growth deterioration, while stable prices encourage robust growth. The Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978's policy goals create confusion about monetary policy's role, impacting economic activity and job creation globally. Countries worldwide are urging central banks to focus on price stability in monetary policy. Congress needs to clarify the Federal Reserve's role in economic policymaking for long-term growth and job creation. Price stability is crucial for productivity, incomes, living standards, employment, and global competitiveness. The US policy states that price stability should be the primary goal of the Federal Reserve. The United States policy emphasizes the importance of establishing an environment conducive to economic growth and increasing living standards through free markets, low taxes, respect for private property, and stable currency. The primary goal of the Federal Reserve should be to promote price stability. SEC. 3. MONETARY POLICY. Amendment to the Federal Reserve Act to emphasize the importance of promoting price stability. The Federal Reserve Act emphasizes promoting price stability by establishing a numerical definition and maintaining a monetary policy to achieve it. The Board must consult with Congress semiannually and submit written reports on their objectives and plans for achieving price stability. The Board must provide numerical measures to assess price stability, describe intermediate variables used, and define 'price stability' to Congress. Additionally, they must estimate the time needed to achieve their objectives. The Board and Committee must provide Congress with an estimate of the time required to achieve price stability, considering short-term effects on employment and output. Definitions for \"Board\" and \"Committee\" are provided in this section. SEC. 4. REPEAL OF OBSOLETE PROVISIONS.
