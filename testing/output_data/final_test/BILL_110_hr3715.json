    "content": "The \"Rural Commuters Relief Act of 2007\" acknowledges the challenges faced by commuters in rural areas due to rising gas prices, limited access to public transportation, and longer distances to places of employment. The Act aims to address the economic impact of high gas prices on rural economies and the higher incidence of poverty in non-metropolitan areas. The \"Rural Commuters Relief Act of 2007\" introduces a new deduction for long-distance rural commuters to offset high gasoline expenses. The \"Rural Commuters Relief Act of 2007\" allows eligible individuals to deduct $100 for each high gasoline price month during the taxable year. The deduction can be increased by $100 if the individual car pools an average of 4 days per week during the 3-month period. Carpooling is defined as having at least one other individual in the vehicle during most of the trip. The term 'eligible individual' in the \"Rural Commuters Relief Act of 2007\" refers to someone who commutes more than 30 miles between their home and work using a gasoline or diesel-fueled vehicle, either registered to them or part of a carpooling arrangement. The \"Rural Commuters Relief Act of 2007\" defines an eligible individual as someone who commutes over 30 miles between home and work using a gasoline or diesel-fueled vehicle, either registered to them or part of a carpooling arrangement. To qualify, both places must be in rural areas, and the family income must not exceed the median family income for the United States. A rural area is defined as a nonmetropolitan area with a population of not more than 30,000. A high gasoline price month is when the average weekly retail price of regular grade gasoline is at least $3 per gallon in the applicable PAD District. The Rural Commuters Relief Act of 2007 allows for a deduction for high gasoline expenses for long-distance rural commuters, defined as individuals who commute over 30 miles between home and work using a gasoline or diesel-fueled vehicle. The deduction applies to individuals filing joint returns and is based on the Petroleum Administration for Defense District that includes the distance between the individual's home and work. The amendments made by this section in the Rural Commuters Relief Act of 2007 apply to calendar months and taxable years after the enactment date of the Act."
