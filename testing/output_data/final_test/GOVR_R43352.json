The Dodd-Frank Act established an SEC Reserve Fund funded by registration fees, with a limit of $50 million per year and $100 million total. P.L. 113-76 rescinds $25 million from the Reserve Fund. The Selective Service System is an independent agency for military manpower needs. The Selective Service System requires all males aged 18-25 in the US to register, but the draft ended in 1972. In 1980, President Carter proposed standby draft registration for both men and women, but only male registration was approved. Efforts are being made to potentially include women in combat units. Since 1972, there has been no renewal of the President's authority to draft individuals into the military. Funding for the Selective Service System has remained stable in absolute dollars but has decreased when adjusted for inflation. The Small Business Administration's funding has decreased in inflation-adjusted terms. The agency administers programs to assist small firms, including loan guarantees, low-interest loans for disaster victims, training programs, and advocacy for small businesses. The Small Business Administration's funding increased to $1,754.5 million in FY2013, with a significant portion allocated for disaster assistance and business loan subsidy costs. In FY2014, $929 million was appropriated for various SBA programs and expenses. In FY2014, the Small Business Administration received $929 million in funding, with allocations for business loan credit subsidies, the Office of Inspector General, the Office of Advocacy, and disaster assistance.

The Small Business Administration received $415.9 million for salaries and expenses, $151.6 million for business loan administration, $111.6 million for business loan subsidy costs, $191.9 million for disaster loans, $17.0 million for the Office of the Inspector General, and $9.0 million for the Office of Advocacy in FY2014. The Senate Committee on Appropriations approved an appropriation of $949.2 million for the SBA, $19.6 million less than the Administration's recommendation. The U.S. Postal Service receives funding mainly from mail users, with an annual appropriation from Congress for certain purposes. Congress authorized appropriations in the Revenue Forgone Reform Act of 1993, including a $29 million annual reimbursement until 2035 for below-cost postal services to not-for-profit organizations in the early 1990s. Appropriated funds are deposited in the Postal Service Fund at the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The Postal Service Fund, established at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, is where the U.S. Postal Service receives funding. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA) from 2006 impacted the postal appropriations process starting in FY2009. The PAEA requires budget requests from the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General (USPSOIG) and the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC) to be submitted directly to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget. For FY2014, the USPS and the President requested $70.8 million, while the PRC and President requested $14.3 million. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended different appropriations for the Postal Regulatory Commission and the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General. The House and Senate FY2014 FSGG measures included postal policy provisions such as maintaining six-day mail delivery and prohibiting fees for certain services. The House and Senate bills proposed various measures for the USPS, including refraining from selling post offices in historic properties, modifying operational hours, expanding retail access, and submitting reports on compliance with advisory opinions. President Obama's FY2014 budget request proposed extending long-standing appropriations policies, except for six-day mail delivery. The Administration also favored recalculating USPS's Federal Employee Retirement System balance, restructuring Retiree Health Benefits Fund payments, and allowing USPS to draw upon the fund for healthcare insurance premiums for retirees. The FY2014 budget proposed reforms for USPS, including cash relief and operational revenue. P.L. 113-76 allocated funds to USPS, PRC, and USPSOIG. The United States Tax Court received $51 million in FY2013. The USTC received $51 million in FY2013. The President requested $53 million for FY2014. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $51 million for FY2014, $2 million less than the President's request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $53 million for FY2014, the same as the President requested and $2 million above the FY2013 enacted amount. P.L. 113-76 provides $53 million for FY2014. Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act includes government-wide provisions. The FY2014 budget proposed provisions prohibiting pay raises for certain political appointees and officials in various positions. These provisions were included in H.R. 2786, S. 1371, and P.L. 113-76. Additionally, funds appropriated for FY2014 were prohibited from being used for pay adjustments for federal blue-collar workers.

The OMB Director would issue guidance for federal agencies on carrying out Pay for Success projects.

The House and Senate versions of H.R. 2786 and S. 1371 had different provisions on travel to Cuba. The House version tightened restrictions, while the Senate version eased restrictions. However, P.L. 113-76 did not include any of the Cuba provisions from either version. Restrictions on travel to Cuba have been a key component of U.S. efforts to isolate Cuba's communist government for the past 50 years. The Cuban Assets Control Regulations (CACR) have been amended over the years to reflect policy changes. In 2009, the Obama Administration eased restrictions for family travel, and in 2011, further eased travel restrictions for religious and educational activities. Currently, there are eight categories of travelers who can visit Cuba under a general license without needing special permission from OFAC. These categories include those visiting close relatives, full-time journalists, professionals conducting noncommercial research, students and faculty of accredited U.S. institutions, members of religious organizations, and travelers involved in licensed sales of certain products. Additionally, 15 categories of travelers engaging in activities like education, religion, and humanitarian efforts may be eligible for specific licenses. Specific licenses for people-to-people travel to Cuba are generally issued for one year to organizations that sponsor such trips. H.R. 2786 included a provision to prohibit funding for travel-related transactions to Cuba for nonacademic educational exchanges. This type of travel was deemed to violate the prohibition on tourist activities set forth in the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. The report criticized people-to-people travel to Cuba for not promoting the Cuban people's independence from authorities. The Obama Administration defended such travel, stating it helps build connections between Cuban and American people to support Cubans moving forward independently. Assistant Secretary of State Roberta Jacobson highlighted the administration's policies providing alternative sources of information for Cubans. The House bill included a provision for a Treasury Department report on travelers visiting relatives in Cuba, while the Senate bill proposed a new general license for professional research and attendance at meetings in Cuba. The Senate bill proposed a new general license for professional research and attendance at meetings in Cuba, expanding current licenses for professional activities related to disaster prevention, emergency preparedness, and natural resource protection."
