    "content": "The \"Lessening Regulatory Costs and Establishing a Federal Regulatory Budget Act of 2017\" includes sections on regulatory reform officers, task forces, accountability, regulatory cap, annual regulatory cost submission, waiver, and definitions. The Act also outlines the sense of Congress and its purpose. The Act emphasizes the need for prudent financial management by the Federal Government and aims to control costs associated with complying with regulations. It focuses on removing unnecessary regulations and managing the costs of new regulations through an annual budgeting process. The Regulatory Reform Officer (RRO) must be designated by each agency within 60 days of the Act's enactment to oversee regulatory reform initiatives and policies, ensuring compliance with applicable laws and Executive Orders aimed at reducing regulatory costs and planning. The Regulatory Reform Officer (RRO) at each agency must oversee regulatory reform initiatives, ensuring compliance with laws and Executive Orders aimed at reducing regulatory costs. The RRO must report to the agency head and consult with agency leadership regularly. SEC. 4. REGULATORY REFORM TASK FORCES. Each agency must establish a Regulatory Reform Task Force, chaired by the agency RRO, composed of key officials including the agency Regulatory Policy Officer and senior agency officials involved in rulemaking. Additionally, joint task forces involving multiple agencies must also have a Regulatory Reform Task Force. The Chief Acquisition Officers Council will establish a joint regulatory reform task force with officials from each agency's Regulatory Reform Task Force. The task forces will evaluate regulations for repeal, replacement, or amendment within 5 years, estimating cost savings for each recommendation. The regulatory reform task force will identify regulations that eliminate jobs, are outdated, impose excessive costs, create inconsistencies, violate specific requirements, or were made to implement Executive orders. The Regulatory Reform Task Force will consult with stakeholders affected by federal regulations and may incorporate their suggestions in the list of rules to be repealed. Each task force must submit a report to the agency head within 90 days of the enactment of the Act and annually thereafter. The Regulatory Reform Task Force will submit a report on improvements made towards implementing regulatory reform initiatives, detailed descriptions of regulations reviewed, and an inventory of regulations recommended for repeal, replacement, or modifications. SEC. 5. ACCOUNTABILITY. Each agency must include performance indicators in their annual performance plans to measure progress in implementing the Act. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will issue guidance on this within 60 days. The head of each agency will assess the Regulatory Reform Task Force's performance in implementing the Act. SEC. 6. REGULATORY CAP. During fiscal year 2018, agencies must identify at least 2 regulatory actions for repeal before proposing new significant regulatory actions. The Regulatory Reform Task Force will assist in prioritizing these actions, ensuring that regulatory objectives can still be met if the identified regulations are repealed. In fiscal year 2018, agencies must ensure that the total incremental cost of new significant regulatory actions and any repealed actions is zero or approved by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Any new costs must be offset by eliminating costs from at least two prior regulatory actions. The Office of Management and Budget will provide guidance on this process. The Director shall establish guidance on complying with regulatory cost requirements, including standardizing measurement, defining new and offsetting actions, determining costs of existing actions for elimination, accounting for costs in different fiscal years, and overseeing significant actions with cost savings. The Director will update guidance on complying with regulatory cost requirements, including standardizing measurement and overseeing significant actions with cost savings. Individual waivers may be justified in emergencies or other circumstances. SEC. 7. ANNUAL REGULATORY COST SUBMISSION TO THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET. Annual Regulatory Plan requires agencies to submit a list of new regulations, their associated costs, and actions to offset costs. The Director must include all regulations approved during the Presidential budget process in the Unified Regulatory Agenda. The Director must include all regulations approved during the Presidential budget process in the Unified Regulatory Agenda. A significant regulatory action may not be issued by an agency if it was not included in the Unified Regulatory Agenda, unless approved in advance by the Director. The Director sets incremental cost allowances for agencies during the budget process. The Director does not set a net amount of incremental costs allowed for an agency, the net incremental cost allowed shall be zero. No significant regulatory actions exceeding the agency's total incremental cost allowance may be made in that fiscal year, unless required by law or approved in writing by the Director. If an agency does not exhaust all the incremental cost allowance for a fiscal year, that remaining balance may be included in the incremental allowance for the subsequent fiscal year. An agency's net incremental cost allowance may require an increase, decrease, or no change to the total regulatory costs, include any existing regulatory action that imposes costs and the repeal or revision of which will produce verified savings, and include meaningful burden reduction through the repeal. The Director will provide guidance to agency heads on implementing requirements for reducing regulatory costs, including a methodology for estimating cost reductions achieved by repealing regulations. SEC. 8. WAIVER.\n\nThe Director of the Office of Management and Budget may waive requirements of certain sections if an agency issues very few rules. The waiver can be revoked at any time, and a publicly available list of agencies under waiver will be maintained.\n\nSEC. 9. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, key definitions include \"agency,\" \"costs,\" \"Director,\" \"incremental cost,\" and \"regulation\" or \"rule.\" These terms are defined to clarify their meanings within the context of the Act. The terms \"agency,\" \"costs,\" \"Director,\" \"incremental cost,\" and \"regulation\" or \"rule\" are defined in this Act to clarify their meanings within the context of the Act. The terms \"action\" and \"significant regulatory action\" have the meaning given those terms in Executive Order 12866."
