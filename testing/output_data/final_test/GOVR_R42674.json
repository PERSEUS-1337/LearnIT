President Obama will not attend, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will represent the United States. The main priorities for the meetings are food security, supply chain reliability, and fostering innovative growth through cooperation. The status of the TPP negotiations will be a major backdrop for the meeting. APEC, founded in 1989, aims to promote trade and investment liberalization in the Asia-Pacific region for sustainable economic growth. It currently has 21 members including the US, China, and Taiwan. The US priorities in Vladivostok are to build on past accomplishments and cooperate with Russia on shared agenda items. APEC, founded in 1989, promotes trade liberalization in the Asia-Pacific region. Members agreed to the Bogor Goals for free trade by 2010 for developed economies and 2020 for developing economies. Trade facilitation is a major focus, with voluntary liberalization measures announced through Individual Action Plans. Decisions are made by consensus, and criticism has been received over the years. APEC, founded in 1989, promotes trade liberalization in the Asia-Pacific region. APEC has faced criticism for its lack of formal agreements, but proponents highlight its success in lowering trade barriers and facilitating trade. The average tariff rate among members has decreased from 16% to 5%, and trade facilitation initiatives have reduced business transaction costs by 5%. APEC's efforts have had a significant impact on international trade in the region, leading to a four-fold increase in intra-APEC trade since 1989. In 2011, APEC members accounted for 44% of global exports and 46% of global imports. APEC hosts annual meetings, with the United States hosting in 2011, Russia in 2012, and Indonesia in 2013. This year's Economic Leaders' Meeting is in September in Vladivostok, Russia. The theme for 2012 is \"Integrate to Grow, Innovate to Prosper.\" U.S. total trade with APEC increased from $1.2 trillion to $2.3 trillion between 2001 and 2011. In 2011, U.S. total trade with APEC increased from $1.2 trillion to $2.3 trillion. U.S. exports to APEC members rose from $461 billion to $894 billion, while U.S. imports from APEC members jumped from $751 billion to $1.389 trillion. The U.S. trade deficit with other APEC members increased from $290 billion in 2001 to $495 billion in 2011. Six of the top 10 U.S. bilateral trading partners in 2011 were APEC members, receiving 48.5% of U.S. exports and providing 54.6% of U.S. imports. Other significant U.S. trading partners in APEC include Singapore, Russia, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Australia. In November 2011, the United States hosted the 19th APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in Honolulu. President Obama met with leaders from Japan, Russia, and China. The leaders of nations negotiating the TPP agreement also met and outlined a comprehensive Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. The 2011 APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in Honolulu outlined a regional agreement for comprehensive market access, with Canada and Mexico joining TPP negotiations. President Obama emphasized the goal of doubling U.S. exports. The Leaders' Declaration reaffirmed the pledge against protectionism and APEC's mission of economic integration and trade expansion. APEC's 2011 Economic Leaders' Meeting focused on trade expansion, green growth, regulatory reform, and economic opportunities for women. The United States agreed to cap tariff rates on environmental goods and phase out tariffs by 2015. The 21 APEC members could not agree on which goods would be considered \"environmental goods\" for tariff reduction by 2015. Russia, as the host of the 20th APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting, is focusing on trade liberalization, food security, supply chains, and innovation. Discussions include improving transportation infrastructure, enhancing technology, and regulatory reform. This will be Russia's first APEC meeting as a member of the World Trade Organization. The United States aims to complete priorities from the previous meeting in Vladivostok. The United States aims to conclude discussions on defining \"environmental goods\" for tariff phase-out and improving supply chain efficiency at the APEC meeting in Vladivostok. They also want to continue the dialogue on food security and address restrictions on agricultural goods exports. Russia and the United States have differing views on education within APEC. The United States and Russia have differing views on education within APEC. The Obama Administration has prioritized the Asia-Pacific region in its foreign policy, joining the East Asia Summit and strengthening ties with ASEAN. The Obama Administration has increased engagement in the Asia-Pacific region by appointing the first U.S. Ambassador to ASEAN and initiating an annual U.S.-ASEAN Summit. This has raised questions about APEC's role in U.S. foreign policy, with the administration viewing APEC as the premier economic organization in the region and the EAS as the main geopolitical association. The Obama Administration has actively pursued progress in TPP negotiations, promoting it as a stepping stone for the FTAAP envisioned by APEC. Some APEC members disagree with this view, with concerns about U.S. motivations and TPP being part of a containment policy against China. Observers question the consistency of TPP with APEC's goals and its approach to trade liberalization. The Obama Administration emphasizes ASEAN's central role in Asia-Pacific relations, despite tension with APEC's importance in regional economic integration. ASEAN has free trade agreements with China, India, Japan, and South Korea, and is negotiating with the EU, ASEAN+3, and ASEAN+6. The US stance on ASEAN's trade agreements with other nations is uncertain. Congressional interest in APEC remains. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) has been a focus of Congressional interest, particularly regarding implications for U.S. trade policy, relations with China, and budgetary matters. APEC's vision of voluntary trade liberalization has faced challenges in the U.S. structure of binding trade agreements. The 112th Congress passed the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Business Travel Card Act of 2011, allowing expedited immigration processing for APEC Business Travel Cards at U.S. international airports. Immigration processing through airline crew lanes at U.S. international airports is available for APEC members, but it does not replace the need for an entry visa. APEC has become a point of contention in U.S.-China relations, with concerns about China's assertiveness and the U.S. strategy of containment. The United States contributes financially to APEC's budget, with previous direct support at $901,000 per year. Additional funds were allocated by Congress in fiscal years 2009, 2010, and 2011.

The Congressional Budget Justification for FY2013 includes a request for $1.028 million for APEC support. U.S. Trade with APEC is a major component of U.S. merchandise trade, with the top 3 U.S. trading partners in 2011 being APEC members."
