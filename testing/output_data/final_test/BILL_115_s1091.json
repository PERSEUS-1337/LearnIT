The percentage of grandparents caring for their grandchildren increased from 24% in 2006 to 32% in 2016. Grandparents report benefits but may struggle with their own health needs. Better coordination of resources is needed to support them. An Advisory Council is established to support grandparents raising grandchildren. An Advisory Council is established to support grandparents and older relatives raising grandchildren, with members including key government officials and representatives of relevant agencies. The Advisory Council, led by the Department of Health and Human Services, is responsible for providing information, resources, and best practices to help grandparents and older relatives raising children meet their needs and maintain their own well-being, including considering the impact of opioids. The Advisory Council, under the Department of Health and Human Services, must address the needs of those affected by the opioid crisis and members of Native American tribes.
