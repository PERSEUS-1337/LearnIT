The Gun Victim Compensation Act amends Section 924 of title 18, United States Code to hold individuals liable for damages caused by the transfer of firearms to prohibited individuals, including juveniles. A civil action can be brought in a United States district court to recover damages for bodily injury. The Gun Victim Compensation Act holds individuals liable for damages caused by transferring firearms to prohibited individuals. Liability is waived if the injury was self-inflicted or the victim was engaged in criminal activity. The Gun Victim Compensation Act holds individuals liable for transferring firearms to prohibited individuals, with exceptions for self-inflicted injuries or criminal activity. Liability is limited to damages within 5 years of the transfer, and prevailing plaintiffs may receive attorney's fees, costs, and punitive damages. Juveniles are exempt from certain provisions regarding temporary handgun transfers.

Juveniles can possess a handgun with parental consent and under adult supervision, keeping written consent on hand, and following state and local laws. Members of the Armed Forces or National Guard can carry a handgun in the line of duty. Juveniles can possess a handgun with parental consent and under adult supervision, following state and local laws. This includes transfers by inheritance, self-defense, and transfers for consideration with parental consent.
