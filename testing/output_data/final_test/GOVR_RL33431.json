SCAAP reimburses states and localities for the salary costs of correctional officers detaining \"undocumented criminal aliens,\" defined as aliens convicted of felonies or multiple misdemeanors who entered the US without inspection. The State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) provides funding to states and localities for incarcerating \"undocumented criminal aliens\" with felony or misdemeanor convictions. Eligible entities include all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and over 3,000 counties and cities. To qualify for reimbursement, aliens must have at least one felony or two misdemeanor convictions and be incarcerated for a minimum of four consecutive days. The State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) provides funding to states and localities for incarcerating undocumented criminal aliens with convictions under state or local law and be incarcerated for at least four consecutive days. SCAAP funds were previously unrestricted and could be used for various purposes, including projects like interoperable communications systems, inmate medical care, and construction. The criteria for receiving SCAAP funds have evolved over time, leading to reimbursement for ineligible aliens in some cases. The formula for determining funds is administratively set by the Department of Justice. The State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) provides funding to states and localities for incarcerating undocumented criminal aliens with convictions under state or local law. The reimbursement formula is determined administratively by the Department of Justice (DOJ). In FY2007, the formula involved calculating a per diem rate per inmate based on correctional officers' salary costs and total inmate days. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in DHS analyzed inmate records to determine eligibility for reimbursement. The values were compared with the annual appropriation to determine the maximum allowable reimbursement. The State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) provides funding to states and localities for incarcerating undocumented criminal aliens with convictions under state or local law. The reimbursement formula is determined administratively by the Department of Justice (DOJ). Funding for SCAAP has been appropriated by Congress annually since 1995, with levels fluctuating between $130 million in FY1995 to $565 million in FY2002. From FY2000 to FY2008, SCAAP reimbursements totaled approximately $4 billion, with California historically receiving the largest annual awards. Other states such as Florida, Illinois, New York, and Texas have also consistently received larger awards. In 2005, SCAAP was reauthorized through FY2011, with a provision added to use reimbursement funds for correctional purposes only. Legislation in previous Congresses aimed to modify the program to cover costs for various purposes, including indigent defense and translators. In the 111th Congress, legislation was introduced to reauthorize the program until FY2014 and consider costs related to criminal aliens charged with specified crimes for SCAAP reimbursement. The Administration's FY2010 budget did not include funding for SCAAP, but funding for the program was included in the budget. Funding for SCAAP was included in the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2010 (H.R. 2847), with the House proposing $300 million and the Senate proposing $228 million for the program."
