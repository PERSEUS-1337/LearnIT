    "content": "The Act titled \"Select Agent Program and Biosafety Improvement Act of 2008\" includes provisions for the reauthorization of the select agent program, revision of biological agents and toxins list, sharing information with state partners, improving inventorying and monitoring of agents, defining smallpox, and planning for a surge in samples. It also addresses oversight of biocontainment laboratories, training for personnel, and a biological laboratory incident reporting system. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service regulate select agents and toxins posing threats to public health, animal/plant health, or products. There are 72 select agents and toxins, with 13 found naturally in the US. As of April 2008, 325 entities are registered with CDC and 75 with APHIS to work with select agents and toxins. Biocontainment laboratories are used by scientists to study infectious materials safely and effectively, categorized by Biosafety Levels 1 through 4. There are 9,918 individuals approved to work with select agents and toxins through the CDC and 4,336 through APHIS. The Select Agent Program is being reauthorized under Title I. The Select Agent Program is being reauthorized under Title I, with amendments to the Public Health Service Act and the Agricultural Bioterrorism Protection Act of 2002 for the years 2009 through 2013. Additionally, appropriate training requirements are being updated for individuals with a legitimate need. Amendments are made to the Agricultural Bioterrorism Protection Act of 2002 and the Public Health Service Act to include the Department of Homeland Security as a covered agency. SEC. 102. SELECT AGENT PROGRAM REVIEW. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will contract the National Academy of Sciences to review the select agent program's impact on biosecurity, international collaboration, and scientific advancements in the US. The report and recommendations are due within 240 days of the Act's enactment. The National Academy of Sciences will submit a report with recommendations to improve the select agent program's structure for enhancing biosecurity, reducing adverse effects on international collaboration and scientific advances, and addressing other issues as requested by the Secretaries of Health and Human Services and Agriculture. SEC. 103. REVISION OF THE LIST OF BIOLOGICAL AGENTS AND TOXINS. Amendment to the Public Health Service Act includes adding new criteria for biological agents and toxins, such as endemic status, information from risk assessments by Homeland Security, and newly discovered disease agents. Amendment to the Agricultural Bioterrorism Protection Act of 2002 includes new criteria for biological agents and toxins, such as endemic status and information from risk assessments. The Department of Homeland Security conducts biological risk assessments, including newly discovered disease agents. The amendments do not prevent listing endemic biological agents or toxins in the United States. SEC. 104. SHARING INFORMATION WITH TRUSTED STATE PARTNERS. Amendment to the Public Health Service Act and the Agricultural Bioterrorism Protection Act includes provisions for sharing information with State officials for emergency preparedness planning. Amendment to the Agricultural Bioterrorism Protection Act of 2002 allows for withholding information from State officials for emergency preparedness planning under certain conditions. SEC. 105. IMPROVEMENTS TO INVENTORYING AND MONITORING OF AGENTS. Improved Method to Inventory and Monitor Listed Biological Agents: The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in coordination with the Secretary of Agriculture, will issue guidance on inventorying and monitoring biological agents listed under specific Acts. Considerations include the effectiveness of measures and control procedures for laboratory personnel. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in coordination with the Secretary of Agriculture, will issue guidance on inventorying and monitoring biological agents listed under specific Acts, including qualitative and quantitative control procedures and inventory record requirements for registered persons. SEC. 106. SMALLPOX DEFINITION CLARIFICATION. The Attorney General, in coordination with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, will issue guidance on the interpretation of the statutory definition of \"variola virus\" within 90 days of the Act's enactment. SEC. 107. PLAN FOR SURGE IN SAMPLES OF BIOLOGICAL AGENTS AND TOXINS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, along with the Secretary of Agriculture and State officials, will create guidelines for labs and personnel not regularly testing for biological agents and toxins to be quickly utilized during emergencies when other labs are overwhelmed. This falls under the title of Biosafety Improvements. The term \"high containment biological laboratory\" refers to a facility with Biosafety Level 3 or 4 facilities. The Secretaries of Health and Human Services, Agriculture, Defense, and Homeland Security will evaluate national needs and oversight of these labs. Considerations include existing or planned construction of such labs. The evaluation of high containment biological laboratories includes assessing capacity for government biodefense and infectious disease research, sharing lessons learned, improving guidance on infrastructure and training, and enhancing personnel training standards. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will submit a report to Congress on the findings and recommendations from the evaluation of biosecurity training under section 202 within 240 days of the enactment of the Act. Improvement of training for laboratory personnel. The term \"high containment biological laboratory\" refers to a facility with Biosafety Level 3 or 4 facilities. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop minimum standards for biosafety and biosecurity training for personnel in these labs, in collaboration with other agencies and experts. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish minimum standards for biosafety and biosecurity training for personnel in high containment biological laboratories. Registration for listed agents requires compliance with these standards, in addition to any other requirements deemed necessary by the Secretary. The standards may be disseminated for voluntary use in laboratories and academic settings. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish minimum standards for biosafety and biosecurity training for personnel in high containment biological laboratories. Registration for listed agents requires compliance with these standards. The standards may be used voluntarily in laboratories and academic programs in the United States and other countries. SEC. 203. BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY INCIDENT REPORTING SYSTEM. The Secretaries of Health and Human Services and Agriculture will establish a Biological Laboratory Incident Reporting System for reporting biosafety or biosecurity incidents. A public or private entity will be contracted to receive and process incident reports. The Biological Laboratory Incident Reporting System will receive and process incident reports, analyze data to identify trends, issue alert messages, disseminate information without facility-specific details, ensure anonymity of reporters, and conduct additional activities as requested by the Secretaries."
