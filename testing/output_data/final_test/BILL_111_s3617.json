    "content": "The \"Storage Technology for Renewable and Green Energy Act of 2010\" or the \"STORAGE 2010 Act\" provides an energy investment credit for energy storage property connected to the grid. The \"STORAGE 2010 Act\" amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow up to 20 percent credit for qualified energy storage property. The \"STORAGE 2010 Act\" defines qualified energy storage property as property directly connected to the electrical grid designed to receive, store, and convert energy for sale or grid reliability. This includes various technologies like hydroelectric pumped storage and batteries. The \"STORAGE 2010 Act\" defines qualified energy storage property as technologies like batteries, superconducting magnetic energy storage, flywheels, thermal energy storage systems, and hydrogen storage, with a minimum capacity of 1 megawatt for 1 hour, determined by the Secretary of Energy. The electrical grid refers to the system under the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or State. The \"STORAGE 2010 Act\" defines qualified energy storage property as technologies with a minimum capacity of 1 megawatt for 1 hour, determined by the Secretary of Energy. These technologies include batteries, superconducting magnetic energy storage, flywheels, thermal energy storage systems, and hydrogen storage. The electrical grid falls under the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or State public utility commissions. Qualified energy storage properties can be owned by the Federal government, a State or political subdivision, an electric cooperative under the Rural Electrification Act, or any agency, authority, or instrumentality of these entities. The \"STORAGE 2010 Act\" defines qualified energy storage property as technologies with a minimum capacity of 1 megawatt for 1 hour, including batteries, superconducting magnetic energy storage, flywheels, thermal energy storage systems, and hydrogen storage. These properties can be owned by the Federal government, State, political subdivision, electric cooperative, or any agency, authority, or instrumentality of these entities. The credit for qualified energy storage property placed in service during the taxable year is subject to an allocation limit. The STORAGE 2010 Act sets a credit limitation of $1,500,000,000 for qualified energy storage property projects selected by the Secretary of Energy. The Secretary will allocate this limit among projects, with a maximum allocation of $30,000,000 per project for taxable years after the enactment of the Act. Selection criteria will be determined by the Secretary in consultation with the Secretary of Energy. The Secretary of Energy shall select projects with commercial viability, various technologies, and prioritize projects that increase reliability, integrate renewable resources, or improve grid efficiency. Deadlines will be set for project selection. The Secretary of Energy will select projects based on commercial viability, technology diversity, and priorities like grid efficiency. Projects must be operational within 2 years of receiving an allocation, with exceptions for hydroelectric pumped storage projects. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, must determine the necessity of projects within 3 years of allocation. Construction must begin within 5 years, and projects must be in service within 8 years, or the allocation will be invalid. Special rules apply to compressed air energy storage projects. If a project does not start construction within 3 years and be in service within 5 years of allocation, the allocation will be invalid. The Secretary can extend these periods on a project-by-project basis if there has been a good faith effort. The Secretary may review and reallocate credits allocated under the STORAGE 2010 Act within 4 years of enactment if there has been a good faith effort to begin construction or place the project in service, and any delays are beyond the taxpayer's control. The Secretary can reallocate credits under the STORAGE 2010 Act if there are insufficient qualifying applications or if an allocation is revoked due to project delays. The identity of allocations made under subparagraph (D)(ii) must be publicly disclosed. The amendments made by this section require the public disclosure of applicant identity, project location, and credit amount. No credits can be allocated after December 31, 2020. Effective date applies to periods after enactment of the Act. Energy storage property connected to the grid is now eligible for new clean renewable energy bonds. The amendment expands the definition of a qualified renewable energy facility to include energy storage property owned by specific entities. The effective date for this amendment applies to obligations issued after the enactment of the Act. The amendment expands the definition of qualified onsite energy storage property under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This property provides supplemental energy to reduce peak energy requirements primarily on-site. The amendment expands the definition of qualified onsite energy storage property under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, designed to receive and store intermittent renewable energy generated onsite for onsite consumption. This includes thermal energy storage systems and property used for smart grid services controlling time-of-day charging and discharging of plug-in and hybrid electric vehicles. The qualified onsite energy storage property must have a minimum capacity of storing 20 kilowatt hours of energy, an output of 5 kilowatts of electricity for 4 hours, and an energy storage efficiency of at least 80 percent. The amendments made by this section apply to periods after the date of the enactment of this Act, with a maximum limit of $1,000,000 for qualified onsite energy storage property. SEC. 5. CREDIT FOR RESIDENTIAL ENERGY STORAGE EQUIPMENT. SEC. 5. CREDIT FOR RESIDENTIAL ENERGY STORAGE EQUIPMENT. Subsection (a) of section 25C of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to allow a 30 percent credit for qualified residential energy storage equipment installed during the taxable year. The term 'qualified residential energy storage equipment' refers to property installed in a dwelling unit in the US owned by the taxpayer, providing supplemental energy to reduce peak energy requirements or store intermittent renewable energy for onsite consumption, with a roundtrip energy storage efficiency. The term 'qualified residential energy storage equipment' includes systems with a roundtrip energy storage efficiency of at least 80%, capable of storing 2 kWh of energy and outputting 500 watts of electricity for 4 hours. Exclusions apply for properties eligible for other tax credits. The amendments made by this section apply to property placed in service after the date of the enactment of this Act."
