    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Stop Taxing the Second Amendment Act of 2016\". The Congress finds that the Second Amendment includes the right to acquire firearms and ammunition without undue burdens, and that local taxation on these items suppresses interstate commerce and limits access, leading to the need for Congress to regulate interstate commerce in firearms and ammunition. The Second Amendment protects the right to acquire firearms and ammunition without undue burdens. Taxing these items disproportionately affects low-income communities and infringes on constitutional rights. The purpose of this Act is to prevent states from using taxes to suppress lawful commerce and constitutional activities. The Act limits state and local governments from imposing taxes on the sale of certain firearms and ammunition that affect interstate commerce. It also restricts taxes payable for conducting background checks incident to the sale of firearms and ammunition. No State or local government may impose a tax on conducting background checks for firearms or ammunition that affect interstate commerce, or increase the tax rate for such checks. The Act prohibits State or local governments from taxing background checks for firearms or ammunition affecting interstate commerce. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.
