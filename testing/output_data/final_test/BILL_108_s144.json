    "content": "The Plant Protection Act is amended to include a new subtitle for Noxious Weed Control and Eradication, with a short title as the Noxious Weed Control and Eradication Act of 2004. The Noxious Weed Control and Eradication Act of 2004 defines terms like 'Indian Tribe' and 'weed management entity' for the purpose of controlling or eradicating noxious weeds. The Act includes criteria for entities recognized by the State, with expertise in weed control and education, and may involve various government and private representatives. The Noxious Weed Control and Eradication Act of 2004 defines terms like 'Indian Tribe' and 'weed management entity' for controlling or eradicating noxious weeds. It includes criteria for State-recognized organizations, individuals, and districts with authority for land management activities on Federal lands owned by the US Forest Service or the Bureau of Land Management. The Secretary will establish a program to provide financial and technical assistance for controlling or eradicating noxious weeds. Grants will be made to weed management entities for this purpose, and agreements will be entered into to provide assistance for noxious weed control or eradication. The Secretary will provide grants to weed management entities for controlling or eradicating noxious weeds. Consultation with Federal agencies or consent from non-Federal landowners is required. Grant considerations include severity of the weed problem, leveraging non-Federal funds, progress in addressing the issue, and other relevant factors. Grant funds usage and cost shares are also specified. The weed management entity receiving a grant must use the funds for controlling or eradicating noxious weeds. The Federal cost share for projects on non-Federal land cannot exceed 50%, and non-Federal cost share can be in cash or in kind. Authorized projects include education, inventories, mapping, management, monitoring, and capacity building. The weed management entity must use grant funds for controlling or eradicating noxious weeds. Projects are selected competitively based on the severity of the weed problem and the likelihood of resolving it. Applicants must submit an application to the Secretary for eligibility. The criteria for selecting projects for grant funds to address noxious weed problems include leveraging non-Federal funds, improving national capacity, progress in weed management, comprehensive approach, reducing weed population, and promoting cooperation between states. The Secretary prioritizes projects for funding based on technical reviews by regional, State, or local weed management experts, giving preference to those involving State, local, and Indian Tribe governments. Special consideration is given to States with approved weed management entities established by Indian Tribes, with the possibility of additional funding allocation to address specific needs and projects. SEC. 455. AGREEMENTS. The Secretary must consult with relevant authorities or obtain consent from non-Federal landowners for activities on Federal land. Agreements under this section are exempt from certain procurement laws. Eligible activities include education, inventories, management, monitoring, and capacity building. The Secretary selects activities for controlling or eradicating noxious weeds based on severity, effectiveness, comprehensiveness, capacity improvement, and promotion of cooperation. The Secretary prioritizes activities for controlling or eradicating noxious weeds based on factors like cooperation between States, relevant considerations, and involvement of regional, State, and local experts. Additionally, a Rapid Response Program can be initiated in collaboration with weed management entities at the request of a State Governor. The Rapid Response Program allows for quick eradication or control of noxious weeds in a State if there is a demonstrated need, the weed poses a significant threat to native wildlife, delaying action would have substantial economic impact, and the proposed response is technically feasible, economically responsible, and minimizes adverse impacts on ecosystems and nontarget species. Funds under this Act are meant to supplement, not replace, existing assistance for controlling noxious weeds on Federal and non-Federal lands. Providing funds to weed management entities will not affect county payments from the Federal Government. Authorization of appropriations is also addressed. Authorization of appropriations for grants and agreements to carry out sections 454 and 455 of the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000, with a limit of 5% for administrative costs. Additionally, a technical amendment is made to include a new section on Noxious Weed Control and Eradication. Subtitle E of the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000 includes provisions for Noxious Weed Control and Eradication, such as defining terms, establishing a program, providing grants to weed management entities, and authorizing appropriations."
