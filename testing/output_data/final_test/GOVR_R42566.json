    "content": "A range of federal incentives support the development and deployment of alternatives to conventional fuels and engines in transportation, including tax deductions, credits for vehicle purchases, federal grants for vehicle conversion, mandates for biofuels, and incentives for manufacturers. These policies originated in response to reducing petroleum imports after the oil embargoes in the 1970s. Since 2005, U.S. oil imports have decreased by 70% due to factors like reduced domestic demand during the recession, increased supply of U.S. oil and alternatives, and federal incentives. The U.S. has also become a net exporter of petroleum products. This decline in import dependence may lead to less reliance on petroleum for promoting alternative fuels and vehicles in the future. Other factors driving policy on alternative fuels and advanced vehicle technologies include federal incentives and concerns over petroleum import dependence. Federal incentives for alternative fuels and advanced vehicle technologies do not follow a single, comprehensive strategy but rather address various public policy issues like environmental quality, domestic manufacturing, and rural development. While reducing reliance on foreign petroleum has been a major concern, other factors such as rural development, domestic manufacturing, and environmental issues have also influenced congressional interest in alternative fuels and technologies. Various programs have been proposed and enacted to support the development and commercialization of alternative fuels, each with its own benefits and drawbacks. Alternative fuels programs can be categorized into six main types. Alternative fuels programs can be classified into six categories: expanding domestic ethanol production, establishing other alternative fuels, encouraging nonpetroleum vehicle purchases, reducing fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, supporting U.S. vehicle manufacturing, and funding U.S. highways. Ethanol is viewed as a homegrown alternative to imported oil, with Congress enacting laws to promote its domestic development and benefit states with a high concentration of corn growers. Incentives for ethanol production are included in farm-related legislation and administered by the USDA or through tax provisions. The U.S. government has implemented various programs to promote alternative fuels, including ethanol production and other biofuels. Tax credits were provided to gasoline suppliers for blending ethanol, but these credits expired in 2011. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates the use of biofuels by petroleum refiners and importers. Congress has also supported the development of alternative fuels like biodiesel, cellulosic biofuel, hydrogen, LPG, CNG, and LNG through various incentives. Some alternative fuels have been supported through tax credits, federal mandates, and R&D programs to boost consumer adoption of vehicles that consume less petroleum. These tax credit programs are limited in duration to encourage early adopters. Currently, a credit is available for plug-in electric vehicles. The government offers tax credits for various types of alternative fuel vehicles, including plug-in electric vehicles. Agencies like the EPA and DOT work to reduce fuel consumption and emissions through programs like the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards. Manufacturers must meet specific miles-per-gallon requirements or face penalties. The Department of Energy (DOE) and U.S. automakers collaborate on reducing diesel emissions and promoting renewable fuels for transportation. EPA's RFS mandates the use of biofuels for GHG emission reductions relative to gasoline. DOT's CMAQ funds programs to reduce emissions in urban areas exceeding air quality standards. EPA's DERA aims to reduce diesel emissions through new technologies. EPA and DOT jointly link CAFE standards with GHG standards under the Clean Air Act. The Department of Energy (DOE) has funded research programs on vehicle electrification, focusing on economical batteries to extend electric vehicle range. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) provided grants to U.S.-based companies for advanced battery systems manufacturing. The Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) loan program supports investments in technologies to reduce petroleum consumption, including electric and hybrid vehicles. The federal government has a motor vehicle fuels excise tax program to fund highway construction and maintenance. Newer fuels like ethanol and compressed natural gas have been added to the program with lower tax rates than gasoline or diesel. Lower tax burdens for certain vehicles and fuels may incentivize their use over conventional options, potentially impacting federal highway revenue. The federal government offers tax incentives and programs to support alternative fuels and advanced vehicles, administered by separate agencies. This report focuses on specific programs that directly support alternative fuels or advanced vehicles, excluding more general programs or those that have not been funded. Programs are categorized by agency and whether they address general factors or are fuel/technology-specific. Expired or repealed programs up to December 31, 2017, are included in the appendix. Appendix A includes recently expired or repealed programs related to alternative fuels and advanced vehicles, such as Alternative Fuel Refueling Property Credit, Biodiesel Tax Credits, and Plug-In Electric Vehicle Credit. Congress may consider reinstating these programs or creating similar ones. Additionally, Appendix B contains tables listing programs by agency, fuel type, vehicle type, and recently expired programs. Appendix B provides a summary of various programs and incentives related to alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles, including Plug-In Electric Vehicle Credit, Second Generation Biofuel Producer Credit, Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Credit, and Special Depreciation Allowance for Second Generation Biofuel Plant Property. The tables in Appendix B categorize these programs by agency, fuel type, vehicle type, and list programs that have expired or been repealed since December 31, 2017."
