    "content": "On April 12, the House and Senate approved the conference version of the FY2003 Supplemental (H.R. 1559) providing $78.49 billion for military operations in Iraq, relief and reconstruction of Iraq, U.S. costs in Afghanistan, aid to coalition partners, and homeland security. President Bush signed the legislation on April 18 (P.L. 108-11), which includes additional funding for homeland security programs. The Emergency Supplemental bill H.R. 1559 includes $700 million for protecting high-threat urban areas, $2.23 billion for first responders, and $2.475 billion for the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund. It also provides additional funding for food aid for Iraq and drops funding for a Presidential crisis fund. The bill allows for broad discretion in the allocation of Iraq reconstruction money to various Federal agencies, including the Department of Defense. H.R. 1559 funds defense spending with $62.6 billion, allocating $15.7 billion to the Iraq Freedom Fund for DOD's discretion. Congress also increased combat pay for U.S. forces. President Bush requested a $74.75 billion supplemental package for defense, Iraq reconstruction, foreign aid, and homeland security. The emergency Iraq War supplemental funding included direct appropriations for grants to airlines and changes in fees and unemployment benefits for airline workers. The enacted version of H.R. 1559 followed the Senate framework but at different levels. Amounts shown in brackets represent costs of fee changes and unemployment benefits. The bills in both the Senate and House increased appropriations for Iraq reconstruction and foreign aid, with the Senate allocating $8.45 billion mainly for additional food aid for Iraq. The House slightly increased to $7.98 billion. Homeland security funding was slightly below the President's request in the House, while the Senate increased it by $770 million to $5.14 billion. H.R. 1559 provided $3.2 billion for airline industry relief, while S. 762 included $3.5 billion. The conference version of the bill provided $62.58 billion for defense, with reduced flexibility in fund usage as recommended by appropriators. The conference bill, H.R. 1559, appropriates funds for regular accounts and establishes a new $15.7 billion Iraq Freedom Fund for DOD flexibility. The President can allocate funds to various agencies, including the Department of Defense, with restrictions removed. $5.12 billion is allocated for homeland security, $749 million more than requested, and $3.1 billion for airline relief. The final bill provides a $3.1 billion package for airline relief, including direct appropriations and a temporary suspension of certain fees. The President desired flexibility in managing resources, with funds placed in emergency response funds for various purposes. Executive officials would have extensive discretion in allocating these resources. Among the proposed emergency funds were: Defense Emergency Response Fund -- $59.9 billion, Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund -- $2.4 billion, Department of Homeland Security Counterterrorism Fund -- $1.5 billion, Department of Justice Counterterrorism Fund -- $500 million, Executive Office of the President Emergency Response Fund -- $250 million, Legislative Branch Emergency Response Fund -- $125 million. Administration officials argued for flexibility due to changing circumstances in Iraq and uncertainty over military campaign duration and humanitarian needs. Congress directed funds for specific purposes in the enacted legislation. The Iraqi Relief and Reconstruction Fund allows the President flexibility to allocate funds to federal agencies, including the Department of Defense. The House and Senate versions of the supplemental appropriation differed in how funds were to be managed, with the conference version allocating $59.9 billion to the Department of Defense and creating a new $15.7 billion Iraq Freedom Response Fund for the President to allocate. H.R. 1559 also adjusts Department of Homeland Security funds to specific allocations for port security and state and local government. The enacted supplemental appropriation of $3.5 billion includes allocations for port security, state and local government law enforcement, National Guard reimbursements, and checked baggage explosive detection systems at airports. Most of the funds are allocated to specific accounts, with $500 million going to various activities including FEMA disaster relief. H.R. 1559 requires advance notification of spending and reimbursement of foreign aid accounts used for pre-conflict needs in Iraq. Lawmakers adopted defense-related proposals, such as increasing combat pay by $650 million. Lawmakers adopted defense-related proposals, including increasing combat pay by $650 million and creating a panel to examine claims of sexual misconduct at the Air Force Academy. The Senate also rejected an amendment to add $1.05 billion for National Guard and Reserves procurement. House and Senate amendments focused on Iraq reconstruction, humanitarian resources, aid to Turkey and Colombia, and eligibility of reconstruction efforts. The Senate approved an amendment adding $600 million for food assistance programs, with $155 million designated for Iraq reimbursement. The House rejected amendments cutting aid to Turkey and Colombia. The House approved a proposal prohibiting the use of funds for Iraq reconstruction to purchase goods or services from France, Germany, Russia, or Syria. Senate amendments related to this issue were withdrawn. Most amendments focused on increased spending for homeland security purposes. The Senate adopted a proposal adding $105 million for grants to States. The Senate approved amendments adding $105 million for grants to States for bioterrorism inoculation programs and $200 million to the Office for Domestic Preparedness. Additionally, $150 million was allocated for DOE nuclear security programs. Other efforts to increase homeland security funding were rejected. Several amendments were proposed to increase funding for homeland security, including Senator Hollings' amendment for $1 billion for port security, Senator Breaux's amendment for $2.67 billion for various programs, Senator Schumer's amendment for $2.33 billion for ODP funding, and Senator Boxer's amendment for $30 million for technology to protect airliners. However, Congressman Obey and Nadler's amendments were ruled out of order. The Senate also rejected an amendment by Senators Byrd and Hollings to allocate resources to specific accounts rather than leaving discretion to the Secretary of Homeland Security. The Administration supported actions by the House and Senate for funding homeland security but raised concerns about specific allocations hindering executive flexibility. They objected to Senate language allocating defense funds to specific accounts and House text directing Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund resources to specific agencies, limiting Presidential flexibility. The Administration requested $62.6 billion for the Department of Defense for war costs in Iraq, operations in Afghanistan, and global terrorism. Funding included deployment of forces to the Persian Gulf, occupation force in Iraq, equipment repair, firefighting, and oil field restoration. The Department of Defense requested $59.9 billion for the Defense Emergency Response Fund to cover expenses for ongoing missions in Iraq, Afghanistan, and enhanced security in the United States. The Department of Defense requested $59.9 billion for the Defense Emergency Response Fund to cover expenses for ongoing missions in Iraq, Afghanistan, and enhanced security in the United States. DOD could exercise discretion in spending the money for appropriate purposes and move funds into relevant accounts. Concerns were raised about the flexibility in allocating the funds, leading to 75% of the funding being appropriated to specific accounts with added reporting requirements. Additionally, $1.4 billion was requested for military support to key cooperating nations in the war on terrorism, $150 million for indigenous or irregular foreign military forces, and $50 million for regular forces. The Department of Defense requested $1.4 billion for military and logistical support in the global war on terrorism, with additional reporting requirements. Congress rejected the request for indigenous forces and reduced the funding for regular forces. The proposal aimed to increase the discretionary funds for the Secretary of Defense and combatant commanders for unforeseen military needs, citing the war in Iraq and global terrorism. Additionally, there was a proposed increase in the total funding transfer limit from $2 billion to about $9 billion. The enacted version of the FY2003 supplemental appropriations bill raised statutory limits for DOD transfer authority but at lower levels than requested. President Bush and DOD officials emphasized the urgency of quick passage to prevent operating expense shortages. $30.3 billion of the $62.6 billion request was for costs related to the Iraqi war buildup phase, which Congress appropriated in regular accounts instead of the Defense Emergency Response Fund as requested by DOD. During Congressional consideration of the FY2003 supplemental appropriations bill, key issues included balancing oversight and DOD flexibility, funding for foreign military forces with added reporting requirements, increased compensation for war duty, defining DOD's postwar role, and allocation of funds for reconstruction activities in Iraq. The FY2003 supplemental appropriations bill addressed concerns about costs and effects of the war in Iraq, with Congress reducing DOD's flexibility in funding allocation. A new Iraq Freedom Fund Account was established with $15.7 billion, giving DOD discretion over $10-11 billion of the funds. The FY2003 supplemental appropriations bill established the Iraq Freedom Fund Account with $15.7 billion, giving DOD discretion over $10-11 billion for postwar reconstruction and relief activities. The enacted version provides funding consistent with DOD's request, balancing flexibility with congressional oversight. The FY2003 supplemental appropriations bill established the Iraq Freedom Fund Account with $15.7 billion, giving DOD discretion over $10-11 billion for postwar reconstruction and relief activities. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 1559 provided flexibility for DOD to transfer funds within specific appropriations accounts. The enacted version of H.R. 1559 allows DOD to transfer funds within the new Iraq Freedom Response Fund, with specific ceilings and floors. 75% of DOD's total request of $62.6 billion is appropriated to regular accounts, while $15.7 billion is allocated to the Iraq Freedom Fund for combat, stability operations, and reconstitution, subject to set limits. The DOD must stay within set ceilings and floors in the bill, with any unused funds for the Iraqi conflict to be returned to the Iraq Freedom Fund. If DOD meets the floors and spends up to the ceilings, $5.2 billion out of $15.7 billion in the fund would be affected. Funding flexibility allows DOD to transfer at least $10.4 billion from the fund to various accounts, with the potential for more if spending is below the ceilings. DOD has funding flexibility to transfer around $10.5 billion to $11 billion, with requirements to notify Congress and submit quarterly reports. The final distribution of funding from the FY2003 supplemental is still pending. Congress provided $62.58 billion for the Department of Defense, matching the requested amount. The enacted FY2003 supplemental budget for the Department of Defense was $62.58 billion, matching the requested amount. The House and Senate also provided similar amounts, with slight differences in military construction funding. The enacted version included over $3 billion more for military personnel than DOD's proposal, possibly due to concerns about troop levels for occupation. Comparisons and assessments of the funding allocations are challenging due to the lack of underlying assumptions provided by DOD. The FY2003 supplemental budget for the Department of Defense was $62.58 billion, matching the requested amount. The House and Senate also provided similar amounts, with slight differences in military construction funding. Comparisons and assessments of the funding allocations are difficult due to the lack of underlying assumptions provided by DOD. Funding allocations in FY2003 Supplemental for DOD were detailed in Table 2b, including allocations within appropriated amounts and a new Operation Iraqi Freedom Fund set up by the House bill. The FY2003 supplemental budget for the Department of Defense was $62.58 billion, with funding allocations detailed in Table 2b. The House bill set up the Operation Iraqi Freedom Fund, recommending various allocations and setting ceilings and floors. The Conference bill established a new Iraq Freedom Fund with designated ceilings and floors, giving DOD flexibility in allocating about $5 billion. Funding for military and logistical support in the war on terrorism was included in the Iraq Freedom Fund. The House version allocated $4.2 billion for procurement from the Combat Stability Operations and Force Reconstitution fund within the Operation Iraqi Freedom Fund. Congress allowed DOD to transfer up to $2 billion of the supplemental funds to different appropriation accounts with notification procedures. This transfer limit is proportionately six times greater than the limit set in the FY2003 DOD Appropriations Act. Congress requires DOD to submit a financial analysis on FY2003 spending, covering the supplemental and regular appropriations, as well as additional funding received. DOD requested funds for military construction projects in Guantanamo Bay and the Persian Gulf, including the Millennium Village project. The enacted version allows DOD to transfer up to $150 million to the contingency. The FY2003 Supplemental bill provides DOD with more flexibility in funding by allowing transfers to the contingency construction account and allocating funds to individual projects with notifications to defense committees. $110 million is allocated for the Millennium Village project. Congress grants some flexibility for reimbursing foreign military forces in the global war on terrorism, allowing up to $1.4 billion for coalition support. The FY2003 Supplemental bill allocates $1.4 billion for coalition support, requiring DOD to notify Congress in advance of payments and provide a financial plan for expenditure by July 1, 2003. Failure to provide the plan will result in unobligated funds reverting to the Treasury. DOD must consult with the Secretary of State and the Office of Management and Budget for transfers. Congress caps DOD's total spending for coalition support at $1.4 billion in the FY2003 supplemental. The FY2003 Supplemental bill allocates $1.4 billion for coalition support, with funds for various purposes including reimbursing Pakistan and other nations for border patrolling. DOD requested $150 million for irregular or indigenous forces, but this was rejected. In response to DOD's request for $50 million, the enacted supplemental permits DOD to spend up to $25 million for counter-terrorism training. Congress also agrees to double the amount available for combatant commanders in the CINC Initiative Fund to $50 million for various military activities. In the enacted supplemental, Congress increases spending limits for equipment, joint exercises, and military education and training. Funding for emergencies and extraordinary expenses is expanded to $50 million. This includes support for joint warfighting capabilities in Iraq and the global war on terrorism. In the enacted supplemental, Congress increases imminent danger pay and family separation allowances for forces deployed in the Iraqi conflict. Combat pay increases by 50% to $225 a month, and family separation allowances increase by 150% to $250 a month retroactively to FY2003. These adjustments aim to provide additional compensation for military personnel, including activated reservists, for their service in the Iraq war. Senator Durbin proposed higher levels, but a compromise was reached with Senator Stevens. Cost estimates for the change in imminent danger pay and family separation allowances range from $650 million to $825 million for FY2003. The armed services committees may consider making the change permanent in the FY2004 budget. DOD will cover the cost within the supplemental. Additionally, DOD requested funding for repairing Iraq's oil wells in a new Natural Resources Risk Remediation Account and flexibility to use foreign contributions for this purpose. In the enacted version, Congress agrees to provide $489.3 million for a new Natural Resources Risk Remediation Account to repair and rebuild Iraq's oil wells and facilities. DOD is to use any foreign contributions to this fund or from the Defense Cooperation Account before spending these funds. Congressional monitoring of foreign contributions is no longer required, as DOD can use them without specific appropriation. The scope of foreign contributions to Iraqi reconstruction is currently unclear. Additionally, the Administration requested $2.4 billion for the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund, with the President having discretion on fund management. The Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance, headed by Lt. General Jay M. Garner, manages funds for postwar activities within the Department of Defense. DOD's costs for the Iraq war in FY2003 are estimated to be $62.6 billion, with potential additional costs. Estimates at a press conference suggest the cost of the Iraq war for DOD could range from $57.3 billion to $65.0 billion, with a midpoint of $60.2 billion. The adequacy of the supplemental may depend on the number of U.S. troops remaining in Iraq. The Pentagon suggested keeping 125,000 troops in Iraq for the next year. The DOD estimates the cost of Afghanistan and the global war on terrorism to be around $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion per month. The FY2003 supplemental covers the last seven months of costs, with previous months funded by $6 billion received in the FY2003 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution. Additionally, there are estimates on the effect of Congressional action to increase imminent danger pay and family separation allowances for deployed troops in FY2003. Congress set a floor of $1.1 billion for fuel costs. In FY2003, Congress allocated $1.7 billion more for military personnel than DOD's request. The chief cost issue in the long-term is the number of troops in Iraq, with estimates suggesting a five-year cost of $45 billion if troop levels decline. Unlike Bosnia and Kosovo, the U.S. is unlikely to share these costs with other countries. Observers also warn that keeping significant troops in Iraq could strain U.S. forces' readiness. The readiness of U.S. forces could be affected by strains from maintaining troops in Iraq. The elimination of patrolling Iraqi airspace could offset some effects. In FY2003, the Senate increased imminent danger pay and family separation allowances. They also established a panel to review and report to the Secretary of Defense and armed services. The Senate established a panel to review the effectiveness of policy and actions taken at the Air Force Academy in response to sexual assault allegations. The panel was to report to the Secretary of Defense and armed services committees within 90 days. Additionally, a Senate amendment to prohibit funding for airlift contracts to non-U.S. controlled firms was dropped during conference. Another amendment requiring the President to submit a proposal to raise revenue for the FY2003 supplemental costs was rejected. Both the House and Senate supported funding requested by the Administration but differed on increasing Congressional oversight. During the House and Senate markup of the Department of Defense request, both committees recommended appropriations close to the amount requested by the Administration. They restricted funds to specific accounts and added notification and reporting requirements. The House version allowed flexibility in the use of $25.4 billion, while the Senate distributed all funds as requested. The House Appropriations Committee established a new Operation Iraqi Freedom Response Fund totaling $59.7 billion, with $25.4 billion allocated for later stages of the war with flexibility for DOD to allocate funds within set limits. The House Appropriations Committee allocated $1.7 billion more than requested for Military Personnel accounts, including funds for imminent danger pay and mobilizing reservists. They also set aside $25.4 billion in the Operation Iraqi Freedom Response Fund for Combat, Stability Operations, and Force Reconstitution costs, with requirements for advance notification to Congress of fund transfers. The House Appropriations Committee allocated $25.4 billion in the Operation Iraqi Freedom Response Fund for Combat, Stability Operations, and Force Reconstitution costs. This included setting ceilings and floors for various categories within the fund, such as Military Personnel, classified programs, Operation and Maintenance, procurement, RDT&E accounts, and transfers to the Department of Homeland Security. The total funding for all the ceilings and floors exceeded the reserved amount, requiring funding below the ceilings in some accounts. The Senate Appropriations Committee reduced the Administration's request for the Defense Emergency Response Fund from $59.9 billion to $11 billion, transferring the remaining funds to other specific appropriations accounts. They allocated funds for deployment of troops, equipment, base camps, counter drug activities in Colombia, and reimbursement for drawdown in funds for the Afghan Army. The House and Senate bills distributed some of the $3.7 billion requested by the Administration for procurement at the service level. The House and Senate bills distribute part of the $3.7 billion requested by the Administration for munitions and equipment replenishment in Defensewide procurement to individual services. Both houses agreed to provide $1.4 billion for military and logistical support to key cooperating nations in the war on terrorism, with different restrictions proposed. The House required a 7-day advance notification and a report within 30 days of enactment, while the Senate required a 15-day advance notification for the use of funds. Neither house approved the Administration's request for the Secretary of Defense to spend $150 million to support irregular or indigenous forces. The Senate approved new authority for the Secretary of Defense to spend $50 million to support regular forces of other nations in the war on terrorism. Both houses gave combatant commanders and the Secretary of Defense flexibility to use funds at their discretion. The HAC and SAC recommended doubling the amount CINCs could spend from $25 million to $50 million from the CINC Initiative Fund to support U.S. or foreign military forces. The House and Senate agreed to increase the Secretary of Defense's discretionary spending limit to $45 million and $69 million respectively. Both chambers set conditions on the use of foreign contributions to the Defense Cooperation Account. The HAC required prior approval for transfers, while the SAC retained the current statute. Additionally, $489 million was approved for the new Natural Resources program. The House and Senate approved $489 million for the new Natural Resources Risk Remediation Account to cover firefighting and repair of Iraqi oil wells. The SAC allowed DOD to use foreign contributions without restrictions, while the HAC required prior approval for transfers. The HAC and SAC disagreed on raising the annual transfer amount, with the SAC capping it at $3.5 billion per year. The Defense Department's FY2003 supplemental requested most of its funding in the Defense Emergency Response Fund transfer account for flexibility. The Defense Department requested $11 billion in funding for Afghanistan and enhanced security in the FY2002 supplemental, seeking flexibility in combating terrorism. Various changes were proposed to increase flexibility in providing aid to foreign militaries and transferring funds between accounts. Ceilings were proposed within the Defense Emergency Response Fund account, including caps for munitions replenishment, procurement, and RDT&E for war with Iraq and global terrorism. The Defense Department requested $11 billion in funding for Afghanistan and enhanced security in the FY2002 supplemental, seeking flexibility in combating terrorism. Ceilings were proposed within the Defense Emergency Response Fund account for military operations in Iraq and the global war on terrorism, but enforcement methods were unclear. The $59.9 billion in the DERF appropriation account was intended to cover costs incurred in the war with Iraq, including deployment of forces, equipment, repair and replenishment of equipment, mobilization of reserve forces, and expenses for the war on terrorism. DOD also requested $1.4 billion in the Operation and Maintenance, Defense wide account for Coalition Support. DOD requested $1.4 billion in the Operation and Maintenance, Defense wide account for coalition support, including payments to Pakistan, Jordan, and countries supporting U.S. operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. The proposal did not specify individual country amounts but required consultation with OMB and concurrence from the Secretary of State. It did not include the 15-day notification to congressional committees as in the FY2002 supplemental. Additionally, DOD requested $489.3 million for a new Natural Resource Remediation Fund for emergency fire fighting. DOD requested $2.6 billion for a new transfer fund, the Natural Resource Remediation Fund, for emergency fire fighting, repairing damage to oil facilities, and ensuring fuel availability in Iraq. Concerns were raised about DOD's expanding role and discretion in using foreign contributions. DOD requested $2.6 billion for specific accounts, including funds for higher oil costs, military construction projects, counter drug activities in Colombia, and reimbursement for training expenses. They also proposed changes to current law to increase management flexibility for the war on terrorism. The DOD requested $2.6 billion for various accounts, including funds for oil costs, military construction, and counter drug activities in Colombia. They also proposed controversial measures to increase flexibility in responding to unanticipated expenses and providing support to foreign military forces in the war on terrorism. This included proposals to transfer funds between appropriations and use up to $150 million to support indigenous forces assisting U.S. operations. The DOD proposed using up to $50 million from the DERF account to support foreign military forces in the global war on terrorism, with approval from the Secretary of State. This would allow aid to be provided rapidly in response to emergency requirements. Additionally, the request aimed to increase the CINC Initiative Fund from $25 million to $50 million for combatant commanders' activities. The supplemental request proposed increasing DOD's flexibility by raising limits for purchases, payments to foreign countries, and military education and training of foreign nationals. This would allow DOD to reimburse foreign military forces for expenses, including procurement, personnel costs, and exercises, with the Secretary of Defense needing the concurrence of the Secretary of State to spend the additional $200 million in funding. There was no mechanism provided for congressional oversight of these expenditures. The Administration's proposal included after-the-fact reporting on a quarterly basis for reimbursement of irregular and regular forces. The final version reduced the request for irregular forces to $25 million and rejected the request for $150 million. DOD proposed increasing the annual ceiling on fund transfers between appropriation accounts from $2 billion to about $9 billion to respond to emerging requirements, particularly in Iraq. Congress provided $2 billion in transfer funds in the enacted bill. In the enacted bill, Congress provides $2 billion in transfer authority for funds in the FY2003 supplemental, particularly for expenses related to \"coercive diplomacy\" and the deployment of personnel to and from the theater for conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. DOD's estimate of the cost of the war assumed a short, intense conflict of about a month. DOD estimated the costs of the war based on plans developed by combatant commanders, including postwar operational costs for repairing Iraqi oil facilities. A controversy arose over transferring funds from reconstruction efforts to DOD for reconstitution of damaged equipment. Reconstitution involves repairing damaged equipment and replenishing lost munitions or spare parts in war. DOD's FY2003 Supplemental Request included additional pay for military personnel in combat, activating reservists, and personnel support. Consumables cover higher fuel prices, expended munitions, and food and medical supplies. It also includes payments to Pakistan, Jordan, and other countries. The DOD's FY2003 Supplemental Request includes $1.4 billion for payments to Pakistan, Jordan, and other nations for logistical and military support in the war on terrorism in Afghanistan. It also includes funding for Free Iraqi Forces, the Afghan Army, emergency firefighting, repair of Iraqi oilfields, and providing fuel to the Iraqi people. Additionally, there are allocations for White House and communications systems enhancements, Guantanamo Bay base improvements, and depot maintenance for equipment. Personnel costs accounted for a significant portion of the total expenses for the war in Iraq, ongoing operations in Afghanistan, and increased security in the United States. The number of reservists being activated for the Iraqi war rapidly increased in January 2003. The allocation of expenses to the DERF account by appropriation account was subject to change based on the course of the war in Iraq or changes in DOD priorities. The number of reservists being activated for the Iraqi war rapidly increased in January 2003, with over 200,000 currently activated according to the Defense Department. DOD estimated a cost of $14 billion for a short, intense war lasting about one month, higher than a recent CBO estimate of $10 billion. DOD estimated a cost of $100 million for humanitarian assistance, $3.7 billion for munitions and equipment replacement, and $7.79 billion for Iraq reconstruction and relief in the FY2003 Supplemental Request. The FY2003 Supplemental Request included $7.6 billion for Foreign Operations programs, with $2.85 billion for Iraq relief and reconstruction and $4.7 billion for aid to coalition partners in the global war on terrorism. The majority of Iraqi reconstruction funds would be managed by the White House through a special Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund. The White House proposed transferring funds for immediate humanitarian relief and reconstruction activities in Iraq to the Defense Department instead of traditional foreign assistance management agencies, sparking controversy among critics who argued for State Department oversight. Critics raised concerns about the White House's proposal to transfer funds for Iraq's reconstruction to the Defense Department instead of the State Department, citing potential challenges in coordinating with NGOs and international organizations. They also questioned the discretion granted to the White House in allocating funds for humanitarian and reconstruction needs. The White House's reconstruction plan for Iraq includes allocating up to $200 million to restore essential services like water, sanitation, healthcare facilities, and transportation infrastructure. The second phase focuses on rebuilding economic and institutional capacity, including roads, schools, hospitals, markets, and electricity generation. Additionally, a framework will be established for education, economic development, agriculture, and governance institutions. The Administration requested $200 million to replenish aid accounts for Iraq's needs, including humanitarian accounts and establishing safe facilities. Congress approved $2.475 billion for the Relief and Reconstruction Fund, allowing resources to be apportioned to federal agencies for reconstruction efforts in Iraq. The House and Senate expected funds for Iraq's reconstruction to go to the Secretary of State and USAID, not the Secretary of Defense. Despite this, the White House pushed for DOD control, which was ultimately agreed upon by the conference committee. The enacted legislation places the Iraq Fund under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, requiring Congress to be notified five days in advance of any fund obligations. H.R. 1559 strengthens congressional oversight of foreign aid for Iraq reconstruction by requiring reports on fund organization, costs, and operations. It also includes up to $495 million in reimbursements and $1.3 billion in DOD funds for key cooperating states. The enacted supplemental bill allocated funds for military support in Iraq and the global war on terrorism, drug interdiction in Colombia, and the Middle East Partnership Initiative. Changes were made to the allocation of military grants for Central European nations following Congressional reductions in overall funding. The enacted bill allocated funds to various countries in Central Europe for humanitarian purposes. Specific amounts were directed to replenish foreign aid accounts that had been used for pre-positioning food and medicine stocks in the region. The conference agreement emphasized the \"full and prompt\" reimbursement of USAID and State Department accounts. The conference agreement directs full reimbursement of USAID and State Department accounts from the Iraq Fund. The supplemental provides $143.8 million for international disaster assistance, with $112.5 million to restore funds diverted for Iraq. Congress increased the State Department's refugee reserve account to $80 million. H.R. 1559 includes $369 million to reimburse food aid accounts, with $69 million for the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust. The enacted legislation provides roughly $920 million for reimbursing foreign aid accounts, more than double the Administration's request of $410 million. The supplemental appropriation proposal includes about $4.7 billion in additional aid to 23 countries and regional programs contributing to the war in Iraq and global fight against terrorism. Key aid packages include $700 million for Jordan and $1 billion in military aid for Israel, on top of their regular assistance packages. Israel would also receive $9 billion in economic loans guaranteed by the U.S. government over the next three years. Israel would pay all costs associated with economic stabilization loans totaling several hundred million dollars over the next three years. Turkey would receive $1 billion for economic grants, which could be used for fees related to $8.5 billion in direct loans or loan guarantees. Afghanistan would receive $325 million in economic grants for anti-terrorism, demining, and military transfers. Egypt would receive $300 million for economic grants, with a portion potentially used to access up to $2 billion in loan guarantees. The Administration proposes to reprogram $379.6 million in commodity import program aid to Egypt as a cash transfer. Pakistan would receive $200 million in military grants and law enforcement assistance, in addition to the $305 million received in FY2003. The Administration also requested $150 million for a U.S. Emergency Fund for Complex Emergencies. Congressional Action on International Assistance includes $4.52 billion in additional aid, about $180 million less than requested. Congress earmarked funding for various countries, with Turkey potentially receiving up to $1 billion in aid, contingent on cooperation with the US in Operation Iraqi Freedom. The aid package for Turkey could increase to $8.5 billion with a loan option. The enacted supplemental funding bill combines text from House and Senate-passed bills, including $9 billion in Israeli loan guarantees with added conditions. Loans may be issued in $3 billion allotments each year from FY2003 to FY2005, with a provision to reduce disbursements if Israel violates loan conditions. One condition prohibits loan resources from supporting activities in areas not administered by Israel before June 5, 1967, similar to a condition from a previous loan guaranty package. The enacted supplemental funding bill includes $9 billion in Israeli loan guarantees with added conditions, such as prohibiting loan resources from supporting activities in areas not administered by Israel before June 5, 1967. Congress cut Economic Support Fund appropriations by $20 million, but most of the President's request for international assistance is supported in the enacted emergency supplemental. The Administration allocated funds for various countries, including $50 million for the Palestinians, $25 million for Djibouti, and $100 million for the Middle East Partnership Initiative. They also modified military aid grants to Central Europe states, adding funds for Albania, Macedonia, and Ukraine, and increasing amounts for other countries. The proposed supplemental budget raised concerns about executive flexibility, Iraq reconstruction costs, and potential erosion of funding for other foreign aid priorities. Questions were also raised about the appropriateness of country assistance amounts and the consistency of DOD's request for authority and funds for indigenous forces with traditional U.S. military assistance programs managed by the State Department. The President sought authorities for flexibility in responding to changing demands, including in defense and Iraq reconstruction/international assistance. The Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund allocated $2.44 billion with broad purposes, divided into three categories. Specific details on sectors and actions were provided, but funding amounts were not specified, allowing the White House to delegate resources to any agency. The White House sought flexibility in allocating funds for Iraq reconstruction. There were disputes over the proposal to have the Defense Department manage the funds. A central Fund similar to past relief efforts was suggested, with Congress placing funds under USAID control. The supplemental request for the Relief and Reconstruction Fund aimed to make appropriations available. The White House sought flexibility in allocating funds for Iraq reconstruction, with disputes over management. A central Fund was proposed, with Congress placing funds under USAID control. The Relief and Reconstruction Fund aimed to make appropriations available, removing restrictions on U.S. foreign assistance. Congress has been reluctant to support requests for contingency resources for foreign policy emergencies. The President has mechanisms to \"borrow\" funds from aid accounts for emergencies. A $100 million request for the Crises Fund raised concerns. Up to $200 million could be transferred between accounts for any purpose, with percentage caps and consultation requirements in place. The enacted supplemental proposal establishes the Relief and Reconstruction Fund with added oversight mechanisms. The President can allocate resources to various departments, but the Iraq Fund falls under foreign aid laws. H.R. 1559 includes reporting requirements and 5-day advance notification for Fund obligations. The supplemental also limits transfers to $100 million and removes appropriations for the emergency fund for foreign crises. The Administration's $3.5 billion supplemental request for Iraq reconstruction is a general projection of needs over the next 12 months. Reconstruction needs beyond this initial allotment may be met through proceeds from Iraqi oil sales and frozen assets. The international aid community is discussing post-conflict relief efforts. The Administration's $3.5 billion supplemental request for Iraq reconstruction is uncertain, with discussions on post-conflict relief efforts. USAID and the State Department are drawing resources from various accounts for Iraq, including $506 million from Child Survival and Health, Development Assistance, and Economic Support Fund accounts. The supplemental request of nearly $900 million for replenishing foreign aid accounts and addressing Iraq programs did not fully cover USAID transfers already made. The discretionary language allowed up to $200 million from the Relief and Reconstruction Fund to repay accounts, leaving the final decision to the White House. The enacted supplemental provides over $900 million to restore funds for Iraq operations, including $369 million in food assistance. The Administration requested funds to assist coalition partners, nations at risk due to the Iraq conflict, and countries cooperating in the global war on terrorism. Some questioned the inclusion of nearly $700 million for countries outside the Iraq conflict, such as Afghanistan, in the supplemental appropriation. The Administration proposed $325 million for immediate shortfalls in Afghanistan's FY2003 program, including resources for infrastructure, government support, security, demining, and military training. Congress increased assistance to over $300 million. In Pakistan, an additional $175 million was proposed for military aid to combat terrorists, along with $25 million for border security. Colombia received $71 million for military and counter-narcotics support, with an additional $34 million for narcotics interdiction operations. Congress approved $700 million in the FY2003 Foreign Operations Appropriation. In the FY2003 Foreign Operations Appropriation, Congress approved $700 million for the Andean Counter-narcotics Initiative for Colombia and other countries in the region. The request included $50 million for Palestinians for peace objectives, humanitarian activities, and civil reforms. President Bush amended the request to include funds for Palestinians and Israel, but Congress did not increase overall appropriations. Additionally, $30 million in military support was allocated for the Philippines. The $30 million in military support for the Philippines would upgrade its counterterrorism capabilities. Slovenia, not a coalition member, would receive $5 million in military assistance for its contributions to Operating Enduring Freedom and the Afghan National Army. Questions arose over the Administration's $1 billion request for Turkey, potentially leading to $8.5 billion in loans. The US negotiated with Turkey for deployment of forces in Iraq, offering a $6 billion aid package that could be leveraged into $26 billion. The United States offered a $6 billion aid package to Turkey, which could have been increased to $26 billion. However, after the Turkish parliament rejected the U.S. request to base troops for operations in Iraq, the aid offer was withdrawn. Turkey granted overflight rights for the Iraq campaign instead. The $1 billion aid request was justified by Turkey's role as an ally in the war on terrorism and the economic risks it faced due to the Iraq conflict. The enacted supplemental foreign aid bill mostly supports the President's allocations, with added conditions for Turkey. Amendments to reduce the $1 billion package failed in the House. The supplemental proposed economic aid reductions for countries and programs not earmarked, including Palestinians, Djibouti, Turkey, and the Middle East Partnership Initiative. It included $1.4 billion for the Defense Department to pay Jordan, Pakistan, and other nations supporting U.S. military operations in Iraq or the war on terrorism. Congressional oversight and State Department's role in foreign aid policy were key concerns. The Defense Department requested $150 million to support indigenous forces assisting U.S. military operations, including those targeting terrorism. The funds would be approved by the Secretary of Defense, with input from the Secretary of State. Indigenous forces are defined as irregular forces and resistance movements conducting operations in enemy territory. The Defense Department requested $150 million to support indigenous forces in enemy-held territory, particularly in Iraq. This funding would provide a \"hedge\" in case of prolonged conflict, as mentioned by Deputy Secretary Richard Armitage. Last year, a similar request for $30 million was rejected by Congress. The House Appropriations Committee rejected the Defense Department's proposal for $150 million to support indigenous forces in enemy-held territory. H.R. 1559 provides $1.4 billion for nations supporting U.S. military operations in the global war on terrorism but does not authorize the $150 million for aid to indigenous forces. Critics argue for additional resources for homeland security, with some Members of Congress offering amendments to increase funding. Members offered amendments to increase funding for homeland security, including $2 billion for the ODP in the Bush Administration's FY2003 supplemental appropriations request. The Department of Homeland Security projected $1.5 billion for the ODP formula grant program, $450 million for critical infrastructure security grants, and $50 million for high threat urban areas. The Administration also requested $450 million for critical infrastructure security grants with significant changes to the current federal structure. The security grants proposed changes to federal first responder programs, allowing funds for personnel overtime expenses. The House allocated $2.2 billion to ODP, with $1.5 billion for formula grants and $700 million for high threat urban areas. The Senate recommended $2 billion for ODP, with allocations for formula grants, critical infrastructure security, high threat urban areas, and technical assistance. The Senate passed an amendment adding $200 million to ODP programs, with additional funding for high threat urban areas, FEMA, and Community-Oriented Policing Services. The total funding provided by the Senate was $2.2 billion, matching the House amount. The enacted supplemental bill provided $2.23 billion for ODP, exceeding the Administration's request by $230 million. Additionally, roughly $109.5 million was allocated for interoperable communications programs. The conference agreement provided a total of roughly $4.385 billion for first responder preparedness in FY2003. This includes $1.3 billion for ODP's formula grant programs, $200 million for critical infrastructure protection, $700 million for high threat urban areas, $30 million for technical assistance, and $109.5 million for interoperable communications. Some argue that current federal assistance for first responders is insufficient, while others point to slow utilization of grants by state and local governments. The conference agreement allocated $4.385 billion for first responder preparedness in FY2003, including funds for ODP's formula grant programs, critical infrastructure protection, high threat urban areas, technical assistance, and interoperable communications. Suggestions were made to adjust ODP's distribution formula to increase assistance to high-risk areas. The agreement instructed ODP to distribute formula grant funds to states within 60 days and for states to distribute 80% of funds to localities within 45 days. Reporting requirements included risk assessments of high-threat urban areas, security costs, new distribution formulas, overtime accountability, and federal terrorism preparedness grant programs. The Administration's FY2003 supplemental request included $500 million for Department of Justice organizations to reestablish operational capabilities lost due to terrorist attacks and pursue counterterrorism investigations. The request also authorized funding to reimburse federal agencies for detaining terrorist suspects. Additionally, $1.5 billion was requested for the Department of Homeland Security's Counterterrorism Fund to support counterterrorism investigations and operations, including those in collaboration with the Department of Defense. The Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $500 million for the Department of Justice's Counterterrorism Fund, but Senator Stevens proposed reallocating the funds to various Department of Justice programs. This included FBI salaries, construction, state and local law enforcement assistance, Community Oriented Policing Services, and interagency law enforcement support. Additionally, $109.5 million of the President's request for the Counterterrorism Fund was made available for other purposes. The House and Senate allocated funds for the Counterterrorism Fund, with the House appropriating $50 million and the Senate recommending $1.135 billion. The FBI received $367 million, and funds for state and local law enforcement were deleted. The President's Emergency Response Fund received $215 million. The conference agreement provides additional funds for FEMA, with a $55 million appropriation, less than half of the amount recommended in S. 762. The White House proposed a $250 million fund for emerging terrorist threats and a $125 million emergency fund for the legislative branch. Congressional action split on the issue of a White House emergency response fund. The House and Senate bills differed on funding for a White House emergency response fund. H.R. 1559 allocated $150 million to the Department of Homeland Security's Counterterrorism Fund, while S. 762 provided $215 million within DHS funds. The onset of the war in Iraq significantly impacted the airline industry, with a 10% drop in air travel and a 30% decrease in advance bookings. The airline industry is facing a significant drop in advance bookings, around 30%, following the events of September 11th. Most airlines experienced record losses in 2002, with only Southwest being profitable. United Airlines is operating in receivership, raising concerns about potential structural changes in the industry. Congress and the Bush Administration provided $15 billion in federal support to the airline industry after September 11th. After the September 11th attacks, the airline industry received $15 billion in federal financial support through the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act. The funds included direct aid for industry losses and access to $10 billion in government-backed loans. Thirteen airlines applied for the loan program, with United being denied. Only about $1.5 billion of the authorized $10 billion has been committed. Congress proposed additional relief for the airline industry in the FY2003 Emergency Supplemental. The FY2003 Emergency Supplemental proposed $3.2 billion in direct assistance for the airline industry, with the Senate suggesting $3.5 billion. Both bills aimed to provide aid for security costs and limit executive compensation. The Senate bill included a tax holiday for security fees and extended war risk insurance provisions. Additionally, it offered extra unemployment insurance for displaced airline employees. The enacted relief package totaled $3.1 billion. The enacted emergency supplemental relief package for the airline industry in FY2003 totals $3.1 billion. It includes grants for aviation security costs, compensation for secure cockpit doors, suspension of fees, and extension of unemployment benefits."
