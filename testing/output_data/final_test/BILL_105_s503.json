    "content": "The \"HIV Prevention Act of 1997\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The findings section of the Act is outlined. The Congress finds that the terms \"acquired immune deficiency syndrome\" and \"AIDS\" are obsolete. The focus should be on the full course of HIV disease rather than just the later stages. The term \"HIV disease\" more accurately defines the medical condition. The focus on HIV disease should be on the full spectrum rather than just AIDS. Early data collection and intervention are crucial for improving outcomes. Partner notification is recommended for prevention efforts. Individuals with HIV disease have an obligation to protect others by avoiding risky behaviors. States should have laws making intentional HIV infection a felony to balance public health needs with optimal medical care for infected individuals. SEC. 3. PREVENTION OF TRANSMISSION OF HIV. States must demonstrate that their laws and regulations require health professionals to confidentially report positive HIV test results to the State public health officer for statistical and epidemiological analyses. The curr_chunk discusses the assessment of preventive services and partner notification programs for individuals exposed to HIV in the State. The curr_chunk explains that the term \"partner\" includes sexual partners of individuals with HIV, partners who share hypodermic needles for drug injection, and partners who share drug-related paraphernalia that may risk HIV infection. The State requires sufficient information collection for partner notification purposes. The notification is necessary for partners of individuals with HIV to learn about exposure, receive counseling and testing, and access information on prevention and treatment measures. The State cooperates with the CDC Director in partner notification for individuals with positive HIV test results, providing counseling and preventative health information. The State requires testing for defendants indicted for crimes involving forced sexual activity to determine HIV status if the victim was at risk or requests it. The State mandates HIV testing for defendants indicted for crimes involving forced sexual activity to determine their HIV status within 48 hours of indictment. Results must be shared with the victim, defendant, legal guardians (if minor), attorneys, prosecuting attorneys, judge, and public health official. The defendant must undergo follow-up HIV testing upon request of the victim, with results shared in judicial proceedings. The defendant's HIV status may be considered in judicial proceedings if test results indicate HIV disease. Patients undergoing procedures that risk HIV transmission must undergo testing as authorized by the State. The State mandates HIV testing for patients undergoing procedures that risk transmission, with results shared with healthcare professionals and funeral-service practitioners. The State requires healthcare entities to notify funeral-service practitioners if a body is infected with HIV. Health insurance issuers must provide applicants with the opportunity to know their HIV status if testing is required for insurance approval. The State requires adoption agencies to inform prospective adoptive parents of a child's HIV status upon request. The sense of Congress is that health professionals with HIV should notify patients in medical situations where there is a risk of transmission. States are encouraged to develop guidelines for this notification process. This requirement applies to all states after 120 days from the enactment of the Act, with some states having a delayed applicability. Delayed applicability for certain states: If the Secretary determines that a requirement cannot be implemented without state legislation, it applies after the first regular session of the state legislature. Definitions include HIV as the human immunodeficiency virus and HIV disease as infection. The term \"HIV disease\" refers to infection with HIV and any resulting conditions. The term \"Secretary\" pertains to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Part D of title XXVI of the Public Health Service Act is amended with a new section after section 2675. SEC. 2675A states that compliance with State laws consistent with the HIV Prevention Act of 1997 does not constitute a violation for entities receiving financial assistance. Congress recommends felony charges for individuals knowingly infecting others with HIV. Congress also emphasizes the importance of confidentiality regarding HIV status. Congress emphasizes the importance of strict confidentiality in implementing section 3 of the Act."
