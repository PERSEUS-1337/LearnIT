The National Ocean Exploration Program Act authorizes the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to conduct interdisciplinary exploration voyages to survey little-known marine areas, prioritize deep ocean regions for scientific discoveries, and document historic shipwrecks and submerged sites. The National Ocean Exploration Program Act authorizes the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to conduct interdisciplinary exploration voyages to survey marine areas, prioritize deep ocean regions for scientific discoveries, and document historic shipwrecks and submerged sites. The program aims to enhance the technical capability of the United States marine science community, accept donations for ocean exploration purposes, and establish an ocean exploration forum to encourage partnerships and communication among experts and stakeholders. The National Ocean Exploration Program Act aims to enhance scientific expertise, prioritize deep ocean regions, and document historic shipwrecks. Stakeholders are encouraged to focus on underwater regions of scientific interest rather than global temperature trends. SEC. 104. EXPLORATION TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE TASK FORCE. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, along with other agencies and experts, will convene an ocean technology and infrastructure task force to develop strategies for new exploration technology, improved communications infrastructure, data management systems, and public outreach activities. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in collaboration with other agencies, aims to enhance public understanding of ocean science and resources through outreach activities. Additionally, they seek to establish partnerships for sharing exploration technology and expertise with governmental and non-governmental entities. SEC. 105 authorizes interagency financing for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Science Foundation, and other Federal agencies involved in the program. Funds can be shared, transferred, received, and spent for administrative or programmatic projects. SEC. 106 clarifies that the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act authority is not superseded. SEC. 107 authorizes appropriations. SEC. 107 authorizes appropriations to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for the Undersea Research Program Act of 2005, with increasing amounts allocated from 2006 to 2015. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will establish an undersea research program with a designated Director. The program aims to increase scientific knowledge for the management, use, and preservation of oceanic resources through research, exploration, education, and technology development. It will be part of NOAA's efforts in undersea research, education, and technology development, providing infrastructure and expertise for the academic community's undersea science needs. The undersea research program will be conducted through a national headquarters, regional research centers, and a national technology institute. The program director will oversee the program with guidance from the Council of Center directors. The undersea research program includes core research, advanced technology support for NOAA, science-based education, development of undersea technology, and discovery of natural products from ocean systems. SEC. 206. COMPETITIVENESS. Regional centers manage external projects through open and competitive processes based on scientific merit, relevance to NOAA, research goals, and technical feasibility. A small fund is allocated for rapid response activities and NOAA-related service projects. SEC. 207. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. For fiscal years 2006 to 2008, appropriations are authorized to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for regional centers and the National Technology Institute. The funding is divided between West Coast and East Coast Regional Centers. For fiscal years 2009 to 2010, funding for regional centers and the National Technology Institute is allocated with 50 percent for West Coast Regional Centers and 50 percent for East Coast Regional Centers. For fiscal years 2011 to 2013, funding for regional centers and the National Technology Institute is allocated with 50 percent for West Coast Regional Centers and 50 percent for East Coast Regional Centers. For fiscal years 2013 to 2015, funding for regional centers and the National Technology Institute is allocated with 50 percent for West Coast Regional Centers and 50 percent for East Coast Regional Centers. The funding amounts increase each year, with $24,359,000 for 2013, $26,795,000 for 2014, and $29,474,000 for 2015. The funding allocation for fiscal years 2013 to 2015 includes 50 percent for West Coast Regional Centers, 50 percent for East Coast Regional Centers, and $11,790,000 for the National Technology Institute. The bill was passed by the Senate on July 1, 2005."
