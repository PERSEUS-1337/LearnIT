    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Rare Earths Supply-Chain Technology and Resources Transformation Act of 2010\" or the \"RESTART Act.\" Key findings are also included in the Act. Congress finds that modern defense technologies and renewable energy technologies rely heavily on rare earth elements (REEs). The United States owns 15 percent of the world's REEs reserves but depends almost entirely on foreign sources. The United States heavily relies on imports for rare earth elements as there are no active producers in the country. China, the main producer of REEs, is reducing exports due to domestic demand and environmental regulations, potentially leading to restrictions on certain REEs exports. The United States lacks domestic production and refining capabilities for heavy rare earth elements, relying on overseas sources. There is no strategic reserve of rare earth compounds, metals, or alloys. REEs are crucial for national security, and the US should establish a self-sufficient industry for mining, processing, and manufacturing these materials domestically. The United States currently lacks the ability to reclaim rare earth resources and magnets from discarded products, allowing overseas entities to profit by selling them back to US manufacturers. This poses a threat to national security and the defense supply chain. There is an urgent need to assess the global market for rare earth materials and the strategic importance placed on them by foreign nations, particularly China. The United States aims to address supply-chain vulnerability related to rare earth materials and end items containing them. The policy is to ensure a competitive domestic rare earth supply chain for national security and economic reasons. The Act requires the appointment of Executive Agents from various government agencies to reestablish a competitive domestic rare earth supply chain. Additionally, a baseline for rare earth material supply-chain vulnerability must be established. The Act mandates an assessment of the rare earth supply chain by key government agencies within 180 days of enactment. They will identify critical rare earth elements for national security and submit findings to Congress. Additionally, a national stockpile for rare earth materials must be established. The Secretary of Defense is required to procure critical rare earth materials and place them in the national stockpile within one year. The Defense Logistics Agency will administer the stockpile and provide annual reports to Congress. The Administrator is authorized to purchase rare earth materials to support national defense and economic needs for five years. The Administrator is authorized to purchase rare earth materials from China to meet national security and economic needs. If rare earth materials are no longer critical, a report will be issued to Congress to terminate the stockpiling requirement by April 1, 2015. Establishment of fair market conditions for the reestablishment of a domestic rare earth supply chain. The United States Trade Representative will conduct a review of international trade practices in the rare earth materials market, focusing on actions by foreign producers related to dumping and export quotas. After the review, they will either take action before the World Trade Organization or report to Congress on the findings. SEC. 7. CONSIDERATION OF LOAN GUARANTEES FOR RARE EARTH SUPPLY-CHAIN DEVELOPMENT. The Secretaries of Commerce, Interior, and State, along with the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of Energy, are required to issue guidance and reports for the rare earth industry to obtain loan guarantees to support the reestablishment of domestic rare earth supply chain and defense supply chain operations in the United States. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, along with Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy programs, are sponsoring initiatives to obtain loan guarantees for reestablishing mining, refining, alloying, and manufacturing operations in the United States to support the domestic supply chain. The urgent need for a domestic rare earth supply chain is emphasized by Congress, warranting prioritization under the Defense Production Act. The Secretary of Defense is required to report on past, current, and future projects addressing this issue within 180 days of the Act's enactment. If no projects are in progress or planned, justification for the lack of action must be provided to support the establishment of domestic rare earth supply-chain initiatives. SEC. 9 emphasizes the need for research and development to support the domestic rare earth supply chain. Funding should be provided by various government agencies to support innovation and workforce development in this sector. SEC. 10 imposes restrictions on the divestment of facilities created with US Government funds for the rare earth supply chain, requiring approval from the Secretaries of Energy, Commerce, and Defense. Recipients must comply with national security measures and ensure availability of rare earth materials for Department of Defense needs. SEC. 11 provides definitions. The Act defines rare earth as chemical elements from lanthanum to lutetium, including yttrium and scandium. It also defines refining as the process of separating and purifying rare earths, and processing as supporting facilities for rare earth production. The Act aims to promote domestic manufacturing of rare earth metals and alloys in the United States through production, recycling, and stockpiling initiatives for national defense purposes. The Act promotes domestic manufacturing of rare earth metals and alloys for national defense purposes. An alloy is a solid solution of elements in a metallic matrix created through alloying. Sintering is a method of making objects from powder by heating below the melting point."
