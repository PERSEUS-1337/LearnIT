    "content": "The Act titled \"College Scholarship Fraud Prevention Act of 1999\" aims to prevent scholarship fraud. Congress finds that a significant amount of fraud occurs in the offering of college education financial assistance services to consumers, including misrepresentations about sources of financial aid, tailored assistance portfolios, pre-selection of eligible students, and promises of assistance. In 1996, the Federal Trade Commission launched \"Project Scholarscam\" to combat fraudulent scholarship services despite ongoing misrepresentations about financial aid assistance to consumers. Despite efforts by the Federal Trade Commission, colleges, and organizations, scholarship fraud persists due to lack of awareness. The United States Sentencing Commission will amend sentencing guidelines to increase penalties for fraud related to higher education financial assistance, making them comparable to penalties for misrepresentation on behalf of certain organizations or government agencies. SEC. 4 amends Section 522(c) of title 11, excluding debts related to college financial assistance fraud from permissible exemptions in bankruptcy estates. SEC. 5 introduces the Scholarship Fraud Assessment and Awareness Act activities. The Attorney General, Secretary of Education, and Federal Trade Commission must submit an annual report to Congress on fraud in financial assistance for higher education. The first report is due within 18 months of the Act's enactment. The Secretary of Education, along with the Federal Trade Commission, will maintain a scholarship fraud awareness site on the internet. The scholarship fraud awareness site, maintained by the Secretary of Education and the Federal Trade Commission, includes materials from the Project Scholarscam campaign, a list of convicted fraudsters, a message board for complaints, an electronic comment form, and links to other information sources. The Commission provides internet links to sources on scholarship fraud, including websites of organizations, colleges, universities, and government agencies. It also includes a link to the Better Business Bureau for assessing business practices and information on contacting the Federal Student Aid Information Center."
