    "content": "FSMA expanded FDA's authority over FDA-regulated foods, including mandatory recalls, enhanced surveillance, preventive controls, and increased inspection frequencies. It also improved traceability and oversight of foreign food imports. The law does not cover meat and poultry products regulated by USDA. FDA has identified five key elements of FSMA: Preventive controls mandate comprehensive, prevention-based controls for food facilities and produce safety. Inspection and Compliance allow FDA to oversee compliance, conduct inspections, and access industry records. Response gives FDA recall authority for all food products and the ability to detain violative products. FSMA expands FDA's authority to detain violative food products, suspend facility registrations, enhance product tracing capabilities, and require additional recordkeeping for high-risk foods. It also includes measures for imported food safety, such as importer verification, third-party verification, certification for high-risk foods, a qualified importer program, and expedited entry for participating importers. FSMA provides FDA with enhanced partnerships to improve training of food safety officials at all levels, including state, local, territorial, and tribal agencies. It also authorizes additional appropriations and staff for FDA's future food safety activities. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that implementing the FSMA law could increase federal spending by $1.4 billion over five years. FSMA authorized an increase in FDA staff to 5,000 by FY2014. However, FDA's regulations under FSMA were not finalized until 2016, causing delays in implementation. The FDA faced delays in implementing FSMA regulations, with proposed rules released in 2013 but other regulations, industry guidance, and reports delayed beyond required dates. Delays were worsened by extended public comment periods and re-proposing key provisions. Factors like OMB review processes and limited agency resources also contributed to implementation delays. Delays in implementing FSMA regulations were caused by limited agency resources, OMB review processes, and delays in releasing proposed rules. Key regulations were not proposed until 2013, with some rules delayed until later that year. For example, rules on Preventive Controls for Human Food and Produce Safety Standards were released in January 2013, while rules on imported foods were not released until July 2013. Delays in implementing FSMA regulations were caused by limited agency resources, OMB review processes, and delays in releasing proposed rules. Proposed requirements for Preventive Controls for Food for Animals (FSMA \u00a7103) were not released until October 2013, followed by proposed requirements for Intentional Adulteration (FSMA \u00a7106) in December 2013. FDA's Sanitary Transportation of Human and Animal Food proposal (FSMA \u00a7111) was released in February 2014. Some proposed rules were held up by OMB's review process, with changes made to several rules during review. Multiple extensions were granted for public comment and review on certain proposed rules. In 2013, stakeholders requested extensions due to FDA's delayed release of FSMA rules. FDA announced changes to key provisions in regulations for Preventive Controls for Human Food and Produce Safety Standards. Changes include water quality standards, raw manure usage, mixed-use facilities, and exemptions for certain farms. In March 2014, FDA announced re-proposing regulations for Preventive Controls for Food for Animals under FSMA \u00a7103. The agency indicated it would accept additional comments on revised sections due to a court order on finalizing rules. In September 2014, FDA re-proposed aspects of major rules including preventive controls for human and animal food, produce safety, and the Foreign Supplier Verification Program under FSMA. Congress urged FDA to consider rewriting these rules. Several Members of Congress have submitted letters to FDA requesting a second set of proposed rules for the Supplier Verification Program under FSMA \u00a7301(a). Concerns were expressed about the proposed requirements in FDA's produce rule and the effects on small farms and facilities. Stakeholders, including Senators and Representatives, urged FDA to re-propose these rules. Several stakeholders, including Senators and Representatives, have urged the FDA to re-propose rules for the Supplier Verification Program under FSMA. Congressional actions have included adding provisions in the 2014 farm bill requiring FDA to provide Congress with an analysis of FSMA's impact on farm businesses before implementing final regulations. Recent appropriations bills have also addressed FDA's implementation of FSMA regulations, including directing FDA to implement a comprehensive training program for inspectors. Both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees have made recommendations regarding FDA's efforts to develop FSMA-related regulations. Concerns have been raised about delays in rulemaking and implementation, possibly due to limited resources and funding constraints. CBO estimated that implementing FSMA could increase costs. The Obama Administration has requested additional user fees to cover the costs of implementing a law that could increase federal spending by $1.4 billion over five years. Congress has not approved these fees, leading to a mismatch between appropriated funding for FDA's Food Program and requested user fees. FDA staff levels have remained below authorized levels, with 3,700 staff working on food-related activities in FY2014. FDA has conducted stakeholder outreach and public meetings as part of FSMA implementation. Enacted budgetary changes for food safety and FSMA implementation have totaled nearly $1.4 billion over the past six years. The enacted budgetary changes for food safety and FSMA implementation have totaled nearly $300 million, including a $104.5 million increase in budget authority for FDA food safety activities. FDA has stated that an additional $400 million to $450 million per year is needed to fully implement FSMA. The Center for Food Safety filed a lawsuit against FDA and OMB for not meeting statutory deadlines for rulemaking related to FSMA. The Center for Food Safety filed a lawsuit against FDA for not meeting statutory deadlines for FSMA rulemaking. FDA's motion to dismiss the complaint was denied, and they were ordered to complete regulations by specific deadlines. FDA's motion to extend the timeline for two FSMA-required rules was also denied. The FDA faced challenges in meeting deadlines for FSMA rulemaking, with a court-ordered schedule requiring final regulations by mid-2016. Full implementation of FSMA was projected to take another 10 years. The FDA's Operational Strategy for Implementing the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) was released in May 2014, outlining the next phase of FSMA implementation. Full implementation of most FSMA regulations will be phased in over the next several years to provide flexibility for farms and food businesses to comply with new requirements. Compliance dates for regulated facilities, especially small businesses, were extended in September 2016. The FDA's Operational Strategy for Implementing the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) was released in May 2014, outlining the phased-in implementation of regulations such as Preventive Controls for Human and Animal Food, Produce Safety Standards, and the Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSVP) for food imports. Compliance dates for regulated facilities, including small businesses, were extended in September 2016. Table 1 provides summary information on FSMA phased-in general compliance schedule, while Table 2 compares the compliance schedule for small and very small business compliance periods."
