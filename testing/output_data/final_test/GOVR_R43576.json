    "content": "Under estate tax regulations, a \"resident\" decedent is someone who had their domicile in the United States at the time of death. Acquiring a domicile involves living in a place with the intent to remain indefinitely. Intent to change domicile must be accompanied by actual removal. A nonresident alien, for estate tax purposes, is someone with a domicile outside the United States at the time of death. A nonimmigrant visa holder can be considered a resident for estate and gift tax if they intend to permanently stay in the US. The determination of a person's \"domicile\" for federal estate and gift tax purposes involves various factors like visas, work permits, family immigration history, and community affiliations. Federal estate tax is levied on the estate of a decedent, with deductions reducing the gross estate to the \"taxable estate.\" The estate tax liability is determined by designating the gross estate, which includes property the decedent held at the time of death. For nonresident aliens, the gross estate for federal estate tax purposes only includes property situated in the United States. This includes real property, tangible personal property, shares of stock issued by U.S. corporations, and debt obligations of U.S. persons. Nonresident alien estates with more than $60,000 in U.S. gross assets must file a federal estate tax return. The value of the nonresident alien's gross estate is based on the fair market value of the decedent's estate at the date of death. Fair market value is the price at which the estate property would change hands between a willing buyer and seller. An alternative valuation date of six months following the date of death may be used if the value of the estate is reduced between date of death and the alternate date. A decedent's taxable estate is determined by reducing the gross estate with allowable deductions. Estates of citizens, resident aliens, and nonresident aliens share many deductions, including estate administration expenses, certain debts and losses, charitable bequests, and the amount of qualified transfers to a surviving spouse. Nonresident alien estates may deduct a portion of certain expenses and losses based on the proportion of the value of the gross estate situated in the United States. The location of where the debt or loss was incurred is irrelevant for this deduction. Nonresident alien estates may deduct charitable contributions to U.S. entities for public purposes, fraternal societies, and property passing to a surviving spouse if certain conditions are met, including the spouse being a U.S. citizen. The marital deduction is allowed unless specific conditions outlined in IRC's Section 2056 are violated. If a surviving spouse is not a U.S. citizen, the bequest may not qualify for the marital deduction unless held in a qualified domestic trust (QDOT) or the spouse becomes a U.S. citizen within a specified period after the decedent's death. The purpose of a QDOT is to ensure payment of deferred federal estate tax on the first spouse's death. A Qualified Domestic Trust (QDOT) is required for assets passing to a noncitizen surviving spouse to defer federal estate tax. The trust must have a U.S. trustee with distribution veto power and must prevent distributions without estate tax withholding rights. If assets exceed $2 million, the U.S. trustee must be a bank or provide a bond. The estate executor must elect QDOT rules, and estate tax is payable on distributions to the noncitizen spouse. The remaining trust value is taxed at the spouse's death based on decedent's tax brackets. A QDOT is unnecessary if the surviving spouse is a U.S. citizen before the decedent's estate. A QDOT is not required if the surviving spouse is a U.S. citizen before the decedent's estate tax return is due. Nonresident alien estates are subject to the unified estate and gift tax system, with estate tax liability calculated based on a combination of lifetime taxable gifts and taxable estate. Credits such as the unified transfer tax credit, state death tax credit, and credit are available for nonresident alien estates. Estates of nonresident aliens are entitled to a unified transfer tax credit, which can be used against both lifetime gift tax liabilities and estate tax liability. The credit, also known as the \"applicable exclusion amount,\" covers taxable gifts or estate. Nonresident alien estates can claim a credit of $13,000, which can eliminate estate tax on the first $60,000 of assets. If a foreign tax treaty applies, the credit is $192,800 multiplied by the proportion of the gross estate situated in the United States. Estates of nonresident aliens can claim a state death tax credit based on the proportion of the decedent's property in the US. They may also receive a credit for tax on prior transfers to reduce taxes on successive deaths. The federal gift tax is imposed annually on gratuitous transfers of property made during life to prevent reducing estate tax liability at death. The tax liability on gifts depends on the value of the taxable gift, calculated by deducting available deductions and exclusions from the gross value of the gift. The federal gift tax liability for nonresident aliens is based on taxable gifts and can be reduced by the unified transfer tax credit. Nonresident aliens are only taxed on gifts of U.S. real estate and tangible personal property in the United States. The taxable gift amount is determined by the fair market value of the gift, with deductions and exclusions available such as the annual exclusion, gift tax marital deduction, and gift tax charitable deduction. Nonresident alien donors can claim an annual exclusion of $14,000 for transfers of property in 2014. They can also claim an unlimited marital deduction for transfers to a U.S. citizen spouse. Gifts to a non-U.S. citizen spouse are not deductible but may qualify for a spousal annual exclusion of $145,000 in 2014. Married couples can double the annual exclusion amount through gift-splitting. Nonresident alien donors can deduct gifts of charitable contributions to certain U.S. entities. They follow the same guidelines for gift tax liability as citizen/resident alien donors, with tax applied cumulatively to taxable gifts made over their lifetime. The gift tax is applied cumulatively to taxable gifts made over the donor's lifetime. The computation is done in three steps: totaling taxable gifts for the calendar year and preceding years, calculating tentative tax, and applying the donor's unused unified tax credit."
