    "content": "The \"Child Protection and Adoption Advancement Act\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 amends the Social Security Act regarding reasonable efforts requirements. Section 3 addresses pre-adoptive procedures. The Social Security Act is amended to require a dispositional hearing within 30 days for children placed in foster care to determine their custody status. The Social Security Act is amended to require a dispositional hearing within 30 days for children placed in foster care to determine their custody status. If a child is determined to be a victim of aggravated circumstances, paragraph (2) will apply to the child, which may include abandonment, torture, chronic abuse, sexual abuse, or having a parent with certain legal findings related to child abuse. The Social Security Act now mandates a dispositional hearing within 30 days for children in foster care to decide custody. If a child is a victim of severe circumstances like abandonment or abuse, the state must find adoptive parents within 180 days or work with a private agency. The state must find adoptive parents within 180 days for children in foster care who are victims of severe circumstances like abandonment or abuse. If adoptive parents are not found within the first 90 days, a private adoption agency must be contracted to find suitable parents within the remaining 90 days. Once found, the state designates the individuals as preadoptive parents and places the child with them. After 4 months, the preadoptive parents gain custody of the child. The preadoptive parents have the right to petition the courts for an expedited hearing to terminate parental rights of others and adopt the child. If they fail to do so within 1 year, the state may take action. If preadoptive parents fail to exercise their right to petition for termination of parental rights and adoption within 1 year, the state may revoke their designation and hold a dispositional hearing to determine the child's placement. The period can be extended by 1 year if there is good cause for the delay. If preadoptive parents do not petition for termination of parental rights and adoption within 1 year, the state may revoke their designation and hold a dispositional hearing to decide the child's placement. The period can be extended by 1 year for valid reasons. If it is determined that the child should be placed with new pre-adoptive parents, the state must find qualified adoptive parents within 180 days, or contract with a private adoption agency to do so within 90 days. If a child has been in foster care under the responsibility of the State for 12 of the most recent 18 months, the State must find preadoptive parents within 180 days or contract with a private adoption agency to do so within 90 days. Upon finding suitable preadoptive parents, the State must designate them as the child's preadoptive parents and place the child with them. When a child in foster care under the State's responsibility has not reached 13 years of age, the State must seek to terminate all parental rights unless the child can be cared for by a qualified relative willing to adopt or become the legal guardian, and it is in the child's best interests to reside with the relative. Alternatively, if a compelling reason is documented by a State court or agency, filing a petition to terminate parental rights may not be in the child's best interests. The amendment requires the State to seek termination of parental rights for children under 13 in foster care, unless a qualified relative is willing to care for the child. A report assessing the amendment's implementation must be submitted to Congress after 27 months.
