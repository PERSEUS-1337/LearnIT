    "content": "U.S. agricultural exports have been a bright spot in the U.S. balance of trade, exceeding imports every year since 1960. The value of farm exports has declined in recent years but is forecasted to reach $134 billion in FY2017, a rebound from the previous year. Lower market prices for bulk commodities have contributed to the decrease in export value. Agricultural imports are expected to remain unchanged at $113.5 billion, resulting in an agricultural trade surplus of $19.5 billion in FY2017. In FY2017, U.S. agricultural exports are forecasted to reach $134 billion, rebounding from the previous year. The value of exports has declined in recent years but still contributes significantly to the U.S. economy, accounting for 10-11% of total exports and 5% of imports. Each dollar of agricultural exports stimulates $1.27 in business activity and generates over a million full-time civilian jobs. Farmers rely on export markets to sustain prices and revenue. Export markets are crucial for agriculturally-oriented firms, accounting for around 20% of total farm production by value. Soybeans, corn, wheat, and other high value products like live animals, meat, dairy, fruits, and vegetables make up a significant portion of U.S. agricultural exports, representing 67% of the total value in FY2015. In 2015, the top 10 agricultural exporting states in the US accounted for 57% of total agricultural exports. Congress reauthorized major export promotion programs in 2014 through the farm bill. In 2016, the US Trade Representative launched dispute settlement cases against China at the WTO over alleged violations of WTO obligations. The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) launched dispute settlement cases against China at the WTO over alleged violations of WTO obligations regarding domestic support measures and management of tariff-rate quotas for wheat, rice, and corn. USTR contends that China's support for these crops exceeded its commitments by nearly $100 million from 2012 to 2015. China's support for rice, wheat, and corn has exceeded its WTO commitments by nearly $100 million from 2012 to 2015. USTR also criticizes China's management of tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) for these crops, citing lack of transparency and unfair practices. TRQs have consistently gone unfilled despite favorable global prices, leading to displacement of imports from the United States and elsewhere. The USTR has criticized China for exceeding its WTO commitments in support for rice, wheat, and corn by nearly $100 million from 2012 to 2015. They also raised concerns about China's management of tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) for these crops, citing lack of transparency and unfair practices. Following U.S. trade enforcement actions and WTO challenges, bilateral consultations have taken place but no resolution has been reached. If talks remain unproductive, the U.S. may request a WTO dispute settlement panel to examine China's TRQ administration. China's TRQ administration is under scrutiny by the USTR for exceeding WTO commitments in support for rice, wheat, and corn. If found WTO inconsistent, China may face trade sanctions. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) was a proposed FTA involving several countries, but the US withdrew in 2017. The fate of TPP is uncertain as other countries may proceed without the US. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) aimed to liberalize trade for U.S. agricultural products through lower tariffs and expanded TRQs. Export markets account for 20% of U.S. agricultural production, supporting farm prices and income. TPP countries, including Japan and Vietnam, were crucial for U.S. farm exports, with potential for growth due to increasing food demand abroad. The TPP aimed to expand U.S. farm exports by reducing tariffs in countries like Japan and Vietnam, which have higher tariffs on agricultural products. The U.S. International Trade Commission projected that TPP would increase agricultural exports by $7.2 billion by 2032. Under the TPP agreement, U.S. farm exports would increase by $7.2 billion, with most of the growth in exports focused on Japan and Vietnam. The agreement also addressed non-tariff barriers to trade, including measures related to food safety and animal diseases. Agricultural groups and food businesses support the implementation of TPP for increased market access. The TPP agreement aimed to increase market access for U.S. farm and food products, with support from agricultural groups and food businesses. However, some groups opposed the agreement due to concerns about competition from imports, lack of enforcement against currency manipulation, and potential job offshoring. Congress had not passed implementing legislation for TPP when President Trump withdrew U.S. participation. Agricultural issues are also a focus in trade negotiations between the U.S. and the EU for a free trade area under T-TIP. The U.S. and EU are negotiating agricultural issues in the context of T-TIP, aiming to expand market access for U.S. agricultural exports and address regulatory concerns. Differences in food safety regulations and intellectual property rights complicate the negotiations. In 2015, U.S. exports of agricultural products to the EU totaled $12 billion. In 2015, U.S. exports of agricultural products to the EU totaled $12 billion, while EU exports to the United States were $20 billion, resulting in a trade deficit of nearly $8 billion for the U.S. The average MFN tariff on U.S. agricultural imports was 5.1% in 2014, compared to 12.2% for the EU. Removing tariffs and TRQs could increase U.S. agricultural exports to the EU by $5.5 billion and EU exports to the U.S. by $0.8 billion. The EU is estimated to rise by $0.8 billion, covering all 28 member states. High tariff barriers are worsened by non-tariff barriers limiting U.S. agricultural exports. T-TIP negotiations aim to address SPS concerns like delays in biotech product reviews, growth hormone prohibitions in beef production, and complex certification requirements. These disputes impact transatlantic trade relations between the U.S. and EU. The United States and EU face challenges with non-tariff barriers in agricultural trade, including issues with SPS measures, food safety standards, product certification, labeling requirements, and testing requirements. Differences in regulatory approaches exist between the two entities. Removing select non-tariff barriers could increase U.S. exports to the EU by $4.1 billion. For more information on SPS issues, refer to CRS Report R43450. The negotiation between the United States and the EU involves challenges with non-tariff barriers in agricultural trade, including SPS measures and GIs. Differences in regulatory approaches complicate negotiations regarding GIs. For more information on agriculture in the T-TIP negotiations, refer to CRS Report R44564 and CRS In Focus IF10240. Additional information on the T-TIP negotiations can be found in CRS Report R43387. The T-TIP negotiations between the United States and EU began in July 2013 with the goal of reaching a comprehensive FTA within two years. However, the outcome remains uncertain due to the complexity of the issues involved and the politically sensitive nature of some. The UK's decision to exit the EU (Brexit) in June 2016 could impact the negotiations as the UK accounts for about 15% of U.S. agricultural exports to the EU annually, potentially reducing U.S. trade gains. The exclusion of the UK from the EU could reduce potential U.S. trade gains under a negotiated agreement. U.S. exports meat and poultry to various markets globally, facing export bans due to animal diseases like BSE and HPAI outbreaks. The World Organization for Animal Health has trade protocols in place. The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) has established trade protocols for countries exporting meat and poultry products during disease outbreaks. The U.S. is considered a \"negligible risk\" for BSE by OIE, with strong surveillance and safeguard systems. For HPAI, the USDA has implemented increased biosecurity measures and a system to rapidly contain outbreaks. Some foreign markets have imposed total bans on U.S. beef exports due to BSE, while others like Japan and South Korea have specific conditions for imports. China continues to ban all U.S. beef exports, while South Korea requires U.S. beef to be from cattle under 30 months old. During the HPAI outbreak, some markets imposed total bans on poultry exports, but most bans were lifted as the outbreak was contained. China still bans U.S. poultry exports. The U.S. government has been working to reopen China's beef market, with no protocol established yet. The United States and the EU are in a trade dispute over the EU's ban on hormone-treated meat, leading to retaliatory tariffs imposed by the US. Despite ongoing WTO proceedings, disagreements persist on legal and procedural issues. The United States and the EU are in a trade dispute over the EU's ban on hormone-treated meat. In January 2009, USTR announced changes to the list of EU products subject to increased tariffs, leading to an \"escalation\" of the dispute. In May 2009, a memorandum of understanding was signed, phasing in certain changes over the next several years, including market access for U.S. beef raised without hormones. The EU granted market access to U.S. beef raised without growth promotants, while the U.S. suspended retaliatory tariffs on EU products. In December 2016, USTR reinstated retaliatory tariffs on EU products, possibly due to failed T-TIP negotiations and concerns about U.S. beef access to the EU market. The EU increased the TRQ for non-hormone-treated beef, but most of the quota has been filled by other countries. The EU has been unwilling to reserve a significant part of the TRQ for the United States, leading to ongoing trade disputes in T-TIP negotiations. U.S. farm organizations are unhappy with the EU's restrictions on U.S. beef imports, which they believe are inconsistent with WTO rules. The EU continues to ban imports of hormone-treated meat. The EU bans imports of hormone-treated meat and restricts most meat exports to a limited quantity of beef imports certified as hormone-free. In 2014, the US signed agreements with Mexico on sugar trade, preventing countervailing and antidumping duties on Mexican sugar exports to the US. The US signed agreements with Mexico in 2014 on sugar trade, setting minimum reference prices for Mexican sugar above US sugar program loan levels and limiting the share of Mexican refined sugar entering the US. This marked a significant shift in US-Mexico sugar trade, as Mexico had previously enjoyed duty-free access to the US market under NAFTA. Mexico remains the largest foreign sugar supplier to the US, providing 11-18% of total US production and imports. Since the suspension agreements in 2014, stakeholders in the U.S. sugar market have criticized them for not eliminating the injury caused by Mexican sugar dumping. Cane refiners relying on Mexican imports have not received enough sugar, and Mexican exporters are not always following the agreed terms. The agreements have no set termination date, but can be ended by signatories at any time. U.S. stakeholders in the sugar market are divided on the need for changes in the terms of bilateral trade with Mexico. The American Sugar Coalition and Imperial Sugar Company advocate for withdrawal from the agreements, while the Sweetener Users Association recommends renegotiation to avoid eliminating Mexican sugar from the U.S. market. The DOC's preliminary review in November 2016 suggested some validity to allegations regarding the agreements. The DOC's review found potential issues with agreements in the dairy sector, with concerns about meeting legal standards and adherence to terms. The final results are expected in early April 2017 unless revised terms are agreed upon. The U.S. dairy industry has long been worried about Canada's supply management system and ingredient pricing strategy. The U.S. dairy industry is concerned about Canada's supply management system and ingredient pricing strategy. Canada's policies aim to limit imports of U.S. milk products like ultra-filtered milk, while promoting exports of Canadian skim milk products. Ultra-filtered milk is a high-protein liquid used in dairy product manufacturing. Ontario adopted a special pricing program in 2016 to compete with imported dairy ingredients. Ontario adopted a special pricing program (Class 6) to compete with imported dairy ingredients, adjusting milk prices based on ingredient prices. U.S. dairy interests are concerned that this program favors Canadian milk products over imports, such as ultra-filtered milk. There are worries that a similar pricing strategy could be expanded nationwide with the proposed National Ingredients Strategy. Canada is the largest export market for the U.S. dairy industry. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Canada is the largest U.S. export market for ultra-filtered milk, with sales of $149 million in 2015. U.S. dairy industry is concerned about Ontario's Class 6 pricing initiative and the potential for a nationwide program that could disadvantage U.S. exports. They argue that Canadian policies violate NAFTA and WTO commitments. The Canadian dairy industry and U.S. dairy industry are in disagreement over the classification of diafiltered milk, with Canada's compositional standards for cheese not specifying limits on milk content. The U.S. industry argues that diafiltration is part of the ultra-filtration process and does not create a different product. In a letter to government trade officials, U.S. dairy stakeholders raised concerns about Canada's ingredients pricing program violating trade agreements. The dairy industry's pricing program violates trade agreements like NAFTA, WTO, and EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement. U.S. officials have raised concerns with Canada. President Trump withdrew the U.S. from TPP in 2017. The U.S. is committed to WTO rules on farm policy and subsidy disciplines. Compliance issues may arise from the 2014 farm bill. The 2014 farm bill's new farm safety net shifts support towards potentially more market-distorting U.S. farm policy, raising concerns about compliance with WTO rules on subsidy disciplines. The bill establishes revenue support programs like ARC and PLC, with varying producer participation by crop and region. Payments under ARC and PLC are delayed due to the payment formula requiring complete data from a crop's market year. For example, payments for the 2014 crop year were not announced until October 2015, pushing outlays into the 2016 fiscal year. ARC and PLC payments have totaled over $13 billion for the first two years of the programs, raising concerns about compliance with WTO rules on subsidy disciplines. The ARC and PLC payments are partially decoupled from producer behavior but partially coupled to market conditions. This is in deference to WTO rules, with ARC using a moving average formula based on historic prices and yields to consider market conditions. PLC, with a fixed reference price, fails to consider market conditions. Projected outlays under the 2014 farm bill may make it difficult for the US to agree to future reductions in allowable caps on domestic support expenditures. The United States may face challenges in agreeing to future reductions in domestic support expenditures under WTO rules. Concerns exist about potential distortions in international agricultural markets due to U.S. policy. USDA conducts risk assessments for foreign animal diseases before allowing meat and poultry imports into the country. The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) evaluates foreign meat and poultry inspection systems for equivalence to the U.S. system. China was confirmed as having an equivalent poultry processing system in 2013, allowing them to export processed poultry meat sourced from raw poultry from approved countries. FSIS conducts onsite audits of foreign facilities and regularly verifies equivalency of countries exporting meat and poultry to the U.S. In 2016, FSIS recommended moving forward with verifying China's poultry slaughter system for export to the United States. This process began in 2005 when China requested evaluation of its poultry inspection system by the USDA. Concerns have been raised about importing poultry from China due to lax food safety enforcement. China's weak track record on food safety was highlighted during a Congressional-Executive Commission on China hearing. Concerns were raised after a Chinese meat processor supplied expired meat products to McDonald's, KFC, and other foreign food establishments in China. In response, Section 730 of the FY2016 appropriations act prohibits USDA from purchasing Chinese processed poultry products for feeding programs. Despite China notifying FSIS of eligible processing plants in 2014, no imports of processed chicken from China have occurred. China would be able to export poultry to the US after FSIS completes the rulemaking process and grants equivalency to China's poultry slaughter. USDA grants equivalency to China's poultry slaughter system, allowing poultry imports of cooked/processed products. APHIS proposed rules for fresh beef imports from Brazil and Argentina, with final rules released in July 2015. Risk assessments determined safe importation without threatening US FMD-free status. Livestock industry stakeholders support these importations. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association and the National Farmers Union oppose fresh beef imports from Brazil and Argentina due to concerns about Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD). FMD was eradicated in the US in 1929, and an outbreak could cost over $50 billion. Brazil was approved to ship fresh beef to the US in August 2016, but Argentina's beef inspection equivalency has not been verified. Beef imports from Brazil have entered the United States. The United States imports fresh beef from Brazil under a 64,805 metric ton TRQ. Argentina is working on verifying beef inspection equivalency. Cuba trade embargo dates back to 1962 but was partially eased in 2000 for agricultural exports. Since the partial easing of the Cuba trade embargo in 2000 for agricultural exports, Cuba has purchased over $5 billion in U.S. agricultural products from 2001 through 2015. However, recent years have seen a decline in U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba, with shipments amounting to $149 million in 2015, down from $285 million in 2014 and $348 million in 2013. U.S. farm sales to Cuba have included a variety of products, but the majority of trade has been concentrated among a few products. In recent years, U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba have declined, with broiler meat, soybean meal, corn, and soybeans being the main product categories. Cuba imports 70%-80% of its food needs, amounting to $2 billion per year. A report by ITC suggests that U.S. agricultural exports could increase significantly if trade restrictions were lifted, with corn, wheat, rice, and dairy products expected to see the greatest dollar increase in exports. The report highlighted key obstacles to increasing U.S. farm exports to Cuba, including prohibitions on credit and travel restrictions. USDA suggested that Cuba could develop comparative advantages in citrus, tropical fruit, vegetables, plants, and flowers. Concerns were raised about potential subsidized competition from Cuba and the risk of invasive pests. Cuba's sugar production and exports have declined sharply in recent decades. Cuba's sugar production and exports have decreased in recent decades. President Obama announced a shift in U.S. policy towards Cuba in 2014, aiming for engagement instead of sanctions. The embargo on Cuba cannot be lifted without amending or repealing legislation such as the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996. The Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 have provisions impeding economic relations with Cuba. Bills in the 114th Congress aimed to lift the embargo or remove restrictions on U.S. agricultural sales, but were not adopted. For more information on U.S. agricultural trade with Cuba and legislative initiatives, see CRS Report R44119. Geographical indications (GIs) are geographical names that act as indicators of a product's origin. Geographical indications (GIs) protect the quality and reputation of products from specific regions, such as Parmesan cheese from Italy and Champagne from France. GIs differentiate products in the marketplace and can be commercially valuable. They also help prevent deceptive labeling and unfair competition. The use of Geographical Indications (GIs) as intellectual property rights (IPR) has become a contentious international trade issue, particularly for U.S. wine, cheese, and sausage makers. GIs protect products like Vidalia onions, Washington State apples, and Napa Valley wines, but opinions differ on whether they are protected intellectual property or generic terms. For example, \"feta\" is considered generic in the U.S. but protected as a GI in Europe, leading to restrictions on exports. GIs are part of the current U.S. trade agenda and have been a point of debate in negotiations with the EU. GIs have been a contentious issue in the T-TIP negotiation between the United States and EU, with differing laws and regulations complicating the matter. The EU's proposal on GIs is included in a draft chapter on agriculture. Concerns arise from GI protections in third country markets, affecting U.S. agricultural exporters. Over 4,500 product names are registered and protected in the EU for foods, wine, and spirits. The proposed TPP addresses Geographical Indications (GIs) for foods, wine, and spirits from EU member states and other countries. It allows TPP countries to comment on and oppose GIs in other agreements and provides a process for canceling GI protection. The EU's use of GIs in T-TIP negotiations has been debated, as they protect product names that the U.S. considers generic. The ongoing T-TIP negotiations are actively debated, with the outcome remaining uncertain due to complexity and political sensitivity. USDA officials oppose EU demands to reserve food names and express concerns about the EU's GI system not aligning with US trademarks. The EU's GI program is contentious in the US Congress, especially among members with significant dairy sectors, who believe it creates trade barriers. Agricultural biotechnology involves genetically modifying plants and animals using recombinant DNA techniques. This technology has been used to create crops tolerant to herbicides and pest-resistant varieties. The United States leads in planting genetically engineered crops, with soybean, cotton, and corn farmers adopting these varieties since 1996. The United States leads in planting GE crops, with over 40% of global GE crop acres. GE varieties dominate soybean, cotton, and corn production in the US. In the EU, GE crop production is limited to about 1% of crop acreage, mainly pest-resistant GE corn in Spain. Some EU countries have banned GE crop cultivation, but EU-approved GE commodities can be imported. The EU's strict regulatory framework for biotechnology limits the approval of GE crops for commercial cultivation. GE-derived food and feed must be labeled. The EU's regulations on labeling and traceability have hindered certain U.S. agricultural exports to the EU. The European Parliament's decision to allow member countries to ban or approve GE crops complicates T-TIP negotiations on biotechnology policy. The EU generally supports GE production, but public opinion in most member states is strongly opposed to GE food and crops. This opposition has influenced the acceptance of GE crops in lesser developed countries, with most African countries following the EU in restricting or banning GE crops. South Africa, Egypt, Burkina Faso, and Sudan are the only African countries where GE crops are grown commercially. The Philippines is the only Asian country besides China to have approved a GE crop for cultivation. India, China, and Pakistan are major producers of GE cotton. U.S.-China negotiations on agricultural biotechnology have made little progress on approving GE crops. China's biotechnology approval process has been a priority for the Obama Administration. In September 2016, China agreed to improve its agricultural biotechnology approval process, but specific details were not provided. Both China and the United States emphasized the importance of transparent approval processes. However, the U.S. failed to secure commitments from China to enhance its approval process for GE crops during trade negotiations. Trade discussions also involve labeling issues for GE products and challenges in segregating GE and non-GE material in commodity supply chains. The United States aims to establish a common framework for GE approvals and labeling practices in trade agreements. Differences between the U.S. and the EU on agricultural biotechnology are hardening, with little progress seen in harmonizing regulatory regimes. Similar challenges exist in China, where little positive movement has been made in implementing the GE approval process. In January 2009, the United States escalated a dispute with the EU over imports of U.S. poultry treated with certain pathogen reduction treatments (PRTs). The EU prohibits the use of PRTs, citing stricter production rules for reducing contamination. This dispute dates back to 1997. The EU banned the use of PRTs on poultry in 1997, leading to a trade dispute with the United States. The U.S. believes the ban is unjustified and requested WTO consultations. However, the case has not progressed since a WTO panel was established in 2009. The United States and EU have not reached agreement on Pathogen Reduction Treatments (PRTs) for poultry products. The EU prohibits the use of substances other than water for contamination removal unless approved. The US seeks approval for four PRTs: peroxyacetic acid, chlorine dioxide, acidified sodium chlorite, and trisodium. This issue is part of trade negotiations for a free trade area. The US poultry industry wants better access to the EU market. The EU restricts access for U.S. poultry products due to concerns over ractopamine, an animal drug used in meat production. Despite international standards, countries like the EU, Taiwan, Thailand, and China have imposed restrictions on meat imports containing ractopamine. WTO Compliance: Major markets restrict U.S. meat exports with ractopamine. U.S. meat can be exported if raised without ractopamine and certified through USDA's program. Increased certification and testing costs may limit market opportunities. USDA and USTR engage with trading partners on ractopamine issues. Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers program originated from a 2000 Department of Labor report to assist agricultural producers affected by imports. Farmers and ranchers typically did not qualify for existing TAA. The Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers (TAAF) program was established in response to farmers and ranchers not qualifying for existing assistance programs. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) administers the program, certifying eligible commodities and producer groups, while the Farm Service Agency (FSA) processes applications and disburses cash payments to eligible producers. The Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers (TAAF) program provides training and technical assistance to eligible producers. Support includes enhanced technical assistance and seed money to develop a business adjustment plan. Producers must demonstrate a 15% decline in price, quantity, or production value due to imports to qualify for benefits. Once certified, individual producers can access assistance. The Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers (TAAF) program offers benefits to certified producer groups, with individual producers needing to meet specific requirements for program benefits. USDA certified 10 out of 30 petitions from producers of various commodity groups from 2009 to 2011. The program provided assistance to around 4,500 producers in FY2010 and 5,700 producers in FY2011. However, a 2013 audit by the USDA's Office of Inspector General identified shortcomings in program administration. TAAF is authorized to receive $90 million annually under P.L. 114-27 for FY2015 through FY2021, but Congress has not appropriated funding since the first quarter of FY2011. The Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers (TAAF) program has been inactive since the first quarter of FY2011 due to lack of funding. The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) provides duty-free tariff treatment for certain products from developing countries, with agricultural imports under GSP totaling $2.6 billion in 2015. Leading agricultural imports include processed foods, beverages, fruits, sugar, olive oil, and miscellaneous food preparations. The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) provides duty-free tariff treatment for certain agricultural imports totaling $2.6 billion in 2015. Imports include sugar confectionery, olive oil, fresh fruits, and miscellaneous food preparations. GSP was extended until December 31, 2017, with some controversy over program changes and new eligible product categories. Some countries have been suspended from GSP, such as Russia in 2014 and Argentina in 2012. In March 2012, Argentina's benefits under the GSP program were suspended. President Obama announced in September 2015 that Seychelles, Uruguay, and Venezuela would no longer be eligible for GSP benefits starting January 1, 2017. The U.S. agriculture industry has mixed opinions on the program. Authorization for GSP expires on December 31, 2017, and its renewal may be a legislative issue in the 115th Congress. Congress has previously extended GSP through short-term extensions and expressed interest in evaluating its effectiveness. Leaders are interested in evaluating U.S. trade preference programs, including GSP, for broader reform. WTO negotiations, known as the Doha Round, focus on agriculture, NAMA, rules, and services to liberalize trade in goods. The agriculture negotiations aim to balance domestic support, market access, and export competition. The Doha Round of WTO negotiations aims to achieve concessions from exporters and importers to balance domestic support, market access, and export competition. The U.S. seeks increased access for agricultural products in foreign markets by lowering spending limits and ending export subsidies. Proponents believe the negotiations offer significant market efficiencies and trade gains, particularly in expanded market access for the U.S. The current WTO Doha Round draft agreement on agricultural trade liberalization raises concerns among U.S. trade officials, Members of Congress, and commodity groups regarding exceptions for foreign importers. Outstanding differences in the Doha Round include contentious issues like designating additional products as \"sensitive\" and allowing developing countries to raise tariffs temporarily. The Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations has been deadlocked since 2009, with no signs of restarting despite an interim agreement in 2013. The Bali Package adopted at the WTO's Ninth Ministerial Conference includes measures on Trade Facilitation, Agriculture, and Development issues. The Trade Facilitation Agreement is a major policy initiative aimed at improving international trade efficiency by streamlining customs procedures. The Bali Package aims to improve international trade efficiency by addressing issues such as export competition, tariff rate quota administration, and the temporary peace clause. It is expected to facilitate U.S. and international agricultural trade in the long term. The Bali Package aims to improve international trade efficiency by addressing issues such as export competition, tariff rate quota administration, and the temporary peace clause. It includes provisions for food-security stockholding programs, green-box-eligible LDC-focused general services, and commitments to address cotton issues. Analysts predict a potential $1 trillion increase in global GDP from the Bali Package, with hopes for rejuvenating the Doha Round. Implementation of the Bali Agreement and the five agriculture sub-issues are not expected to pose significant difficulties for the United States. The 2014 farm bill eliminated the Dairy Export Incentive Program, while changes in the green box and proposed cotton negotiations maintain the status quo. Trade facilitation and TRQ administration initiatives are anticipated to reduce marketing costs and improve market access for U.S. agricultural exports. Monitoring food-security stockholding programs is crucial to prevent disruptions in commercial trade. The unresolved issue of a proposed SSM from the Doha Round remains contentious. The Doha Round is deadlocked due to disagreement over the Special Safeguard Mechanism (SSM), which aims to protect producers of special products from import surges. India, China, the United States, the European Union, and the Cairns Group are key opponents in the SSM debate. The issue remains unresolved, leading to a deadlock in the Doha Round negotiations. India's proposal to delay the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) approval deadline was narrowly avoided in the Bali Agreement. India and the United States reached an understanding on food stockholding in November 2014, allowing the WTO to proceed with full implementation of the Bali Agreement. Disagreements between the two countries in WTO negotiations have contributed to the stalemate in the Doha Round. In bilateral negotiations between India and the United States, agreement on a food-security stockholding program broke a deadlock in the Bali Agreement. This could potentially help resolve disagreements over a Special Safeguard Mechanism (SSM) in the stalled Doha Round negotiations. If the U.S. and India can find common ground on the SSM issue, it may provide momentum to address other unresolved issues in the Doha Round. The USDA implemented a final rule for country-of-origin labeling (COOL) to provide consumers with information on the origin of various food products. In 2011, the WTO found that COOL did not meet its objective and treated imported livestock less favorably than U.S. livestock. The United States appealed the ruling, but the Appellate Body upheld the findings. USDA issued a revised COOL rule in May 2013. In 2013, USDA issued a revised COOL rule requiring production steps and origin country on meat labels. However, in 2014, WTO found the regulations still discriminated against imported livestock. In 2015, Canada and Mexico were authorized to retaliate against the US. Congress repealed COOL requirements for beef and pork in 2015, settling the trade dispute. The \"Brazil-U.S. cotton case\" was a WTO dispute initiated by Brazil in 2002 against U.S. cotton programs. Brazil claimed the programs were harming its cotton exports. In 2014, Brazil and the U.S. reached an agreement to resolve the dispute, with Brazil relinquishing its rights to countermeasures. The United States and Brazil reached an agreement to resolve the WTO cotton dispute, with Brazil giving up its rights to countermeasures. The agreement included new rules for the GSM-102 export credit guarantee program, a temporary Peace Clause for U.S. cotton support programs, a $300 million payment to the Brazil Cotton Institute, and routine reporting under the MOU. This resolution avoided a potential trade war and led to significant changes in U.S. domestic support. The resolution of the WTO cotton dispute between the United States and Brazil led to substantial changes in U.S. domestic support programs for upland cotton and export credit guarantees. This case could impact future WTO trade negotiations and set a precedent for special treatment of cotton. Brazil's successful challenge of the U.S. cotton program could serve as a model for future trade disputes. The WTO's dispute settlement mechanism may play a crucial role in effecting future changes in domestic support policies, as the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations faces challenges. Disputes are costly and a lost challenge can legitimize the disputed program."
