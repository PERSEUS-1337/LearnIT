    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Improving Opportunities for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses Act of 2014\". The definition of a small business concern is consolidated. Section 3(q) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632(q)) is amended to define a small business concern owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans as one where at least 51 percent is owned by service-disabled veterans and the management is controlled by service-disabled veterans or their spouses. The Small Business Act defines a small business concern owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans as one where at least 51 percent is owned by such veterans. If the death of a service-disabled veteran causes the business to be less than 51 percent owned by veterans, the surviving spouse can take ownership. The surviving spouse of a service-disabled veteran who acquires ownership rights in a small business concern will be treated as the veteran for a specified period to maintain the business's status as owned by service-disabled veterans. This period ends upon the surviving spouse's remarriage or a specific date. The surviving spouse of a service-disabled veteran must relinquish ownership in the small business concern within a specified period after the veteran's death, depending on the disability rating. The time limit for a surviving spouse of a service-disabled veteran to relinquish ownership in a small business concern after the veteran's death, if the veteran is 100 percent disabled but does not die as a result of a service-connected disability, is three years. SEC. 3. Veterans Affairs definition of small business concern consolidated. Section 8127 of title 38, United States Code, is amended to align with the Small Business Act. SEC. 4. GAO report on verification of status. The Comptroller General must submit a report within 270 days evaluating the feasibility of the Small Business Administration or the Secretary of Veterans Affairs overseeing verification of small businesses owned by service-disabled veterans. The Comptroller General will evaluate the feasibility of the Small Business Administration or the Secretary of Veterans Affairs overseeing verification of small businesses owned by service-disabled veterans. Recommendations will be made on the advisability of these entities having Government-wide responsibility."
