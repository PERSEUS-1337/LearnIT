The Administrator must develop a strategic plan within 90 days to assess and manage risks of cyanotoxins in public water systems. This plan includes evaluating health risks, listing harmful cyanotoxins, and summarizing adverse health effects. The Administrator must develop a strategic plan to assess and manage risks of cyanotoxins in public water systems, including evaluating health risks, listing harmful cyanotoxins, and determining whether to publish health advisories for these toxins in drinking water. Factors causing cyanobacteria proliferation and toxin expression will also be considered. Guidance on analytical methods may be established. The Administrator will recommend treatment options to mitigate health effects of cyanotoxins in public water systems and provide technical assistance to affected States and water systems for managing risks. The Administrator will update and submit a strategic plan to Congress for managing risks associated with cyanotoxins. They will also identify gaps in understanding cyanobacteria, consult with relevant parties, and coordinate information on testing and monitoring for harmful cyanotoxins in water systems. The Administrator will consult with various federal agencies, states, public water system operators, multinational agencies, foreign governments, and research institutions to gather and publish information on cyanobacteria and harmful algal blooms. This will be done in accordance with scientific requirements. The Comptroller General of the United States will prepare a report for Congress within 90 days of the Act's enactment, detailing funds spent from 2010 to 2014 on cyanobacteria research and harmful algal blooms. The report will include the purpose of the funds, the authorizing law, and the receiving Federal agency. The Comptroller General will report to Congress on funds spent from 2010 to 2014 on cyanobacteria research and harmful algal blooms, including the purpose, authorizing law, and receiving Federal agency.
