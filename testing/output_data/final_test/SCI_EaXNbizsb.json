It ensures high degree of rotation invariance within a range of epsilon, allowing for arbitrary rotation of the 3D Region of Interest (ROI) while maintaining volume properties. Our method utilizes a shape descriptor derived from a set of spheres in the distance-based sphere packing algorithm to extract rotational invariant properties from the Region of Interest (ROI) in MRI Stereotactic images. The algorithm packs non-intersecting spheres within the cancer tissue voxels for treatment planning in Stereotactic Radio Surgery (SRS). Performance results on over 30 patients were demonstrated in the Slicer3D platform. Our sphere packing algorithm, based on distance transformations, exhibits e-rotation invariance, allowing for arbitrary rotations of the 3D ROI while maintaining volume properties within a certain limit of e. The rotations result in highly correlated spherical packing, with a high degree of rotation invariance within the range of \u00b1 e. A shape descriptor derived from a set of spheres in the algorithm is used to extract invariant properties from the ROI in MRI Stereotactic images. Implementation and performance results on over 30 patients were demonstrated in the Slicer3D platform. In various applications like tumor inspection or interacting with 3D volume data, the ROI can be rotated at arbitrary angles. Rotational invariance is suggested by using a sphere packing algorithm before and after rotation, indicating high correlation between spheres found. Correspondences between original and rotated ROIs can be defined using spheres' descriptors. If descriptors are highly correlated, the ROIs may be similar. Rotation of 3D volume data involves manipulation of three coordinates to maintain properties. Li et al. mentioned that rotation is more challenging than translation and scaling. Rotation invariance in the manipulation of 3D volume data involves techniques like landmarking, rotation invariant features, and brute force rotation alignment. Landmarking can be domain specific or generic, with the former rotating around a fixed point and the latter finding major axes to rotate the entire image. The brute force alignment method involves dividing the object into smaller parts for rotation, which is time-consuming and complex. Invariant feature/shape descriptor identifies invariant features in 3D image data that remain unchanged under rotation. Rotation invariance in 3D shape analysis is achieved by using feature vectors like shape signatures. Various methods such as ratio of perimeter to area, fractal measures, and shape histograms have been used in the past. Studies have utilized time series representation and spherical harmonic method to prove rotation invariance. The spherical harmonic method combined with spatial geometric moments and skeletons based on medial axis have been used as shape descriptors in 3D shape analysis. However, the medial axis method is sensitive to noise and computationally expensive. This paper explores using a set of spheres as shape descriptors and analyzing sphere packing for similarity measures before and after rotations. Our study analyzed sphere packing before and after rotations to demonstrate the invariance of sphere size and center distances. Using a sphere packing algorithm, non-intersecting spheres were packed into ROIs before and after rotations, serving as shape descriptors. The method characterizes 3D object similarity based on sphere geometries, correspondence, and spatial relationships. This novel featureless approach is independent of specific features or textures, relying on the sphere packing generated by the algorithm. In this work, sphere packing is used as a novel approach for characterizing and compressing shape information for 3D volume and voxel data in Stereotactic radio surgery planning. The goal is to arrange beams on spheres to target unhealthy tissue while minimizing damage to healthy tissue. A key geometric problem is filling irregular tumor shapes with disjointed spheres. The Sphere Packing algorithm is used to fill irregular tumor shapes with disjointed spheres in Stereotactic radio surgery planning. This region-based descriptor method uses spheres to represent the 3D object, with each sphere characterized by its radius and center. The density of volume coverage can be customized, with the solution involving finding nonintersecting spheres using a greedy method. The size of the regions can be controlled based on treatment planning requirements. The algorithm for sphere packing involves filling irregular tumor shapes with disjoint spheres in Stereotactic radio surgery planning. The coverage density can be customized, with 50% to 90% coverage taking 25 minutes to 7-72 hours. The algorithm aims to pack disjoint spheres inside the ROI using a uniform grid to calculate distances and iteratively extract new spheres. The algorithm involves filling irregular tumor shapes with disjoint spheres in Stereotactic radio surgery planning. New spheres are extracted iteratively with constraints to maximize coverage using a greedy strategy. Sphere placements are based on maximum distance values inside the ROI. The technique has been successfully applied to MRIs using the Slicer3D platform, creating a spatial template represented by the spheres' centers. The algorithm fills irregular tumor shapes with spheres in radio surgery planning. Spheres are placed based on maximum distance values inside the ROI. A spatial template is created by the spheres' centers, representing the intersection of the sphere's centers as vertices of a graph. The graph captures inner distances between spheres' centers to compute differences in 3D shape descriptors before and after rotation. This geometric accuracy is crucial for beam planning in radio surgery. The representation abstracts the geometric meaning of 3D shapes and characterizes connectivity information. It involves comparing distances between centers of original and rotated spheres to find sphere packing descriptors. The inner distances capture shape changes before and after rotation, aiding in distance transformation based shape descriptors. The relationship between sphere centers is crucial for accurate shape representation. Our algorithm in Slicer3D uses Euclidean distances between sphere centers to preserve relative positions. Slicer3D is an open-source medical visualization tool with modules in C++ and Python, built on VTK framework for data visualization. Our Slicer3D Python module for sphere packing works with VTK for volume rotation. 3D arbitrary rotations for medical images are introduced, using VtkTransform for rotation via matrix multiplications around x, y, and z axes. Rotation angles are specified in 3D space using MRML, displaying images in patient coordinates system RAS. Rotation is applied using sphere packing information, origin, and spacing. Before applying rotation using VtkTransform, the volume data including position, bound box, origin, and spacing needs to be known. Rotation is done in six phases by creating a TransformNode with VtkMRMLTransformNode, adding it to the MRML scene, and using RotateX, RotateY, and RotateZ to create the rotation matrix around the origin (0,0,0). The rotation algorithm using VtkTransform rotates the volume around its center by translating it to the center, rotating it based on user-defined angles, and then translating it back. The transformation is applied by multiplying the current values with the transformation matrix and concatenating multiple transformations. Phase 5 involves concatenating multiple transformations and attaching volume to transform node. Phase 6 includes hardening the transform by applying transformations and saving it as a transformed model. The Euclidean sphere packing rotation algorithm is used for changing orientation and generating the output volume. Experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of this method using thirty MRIs of segmented brain tumors from the BRATS dataset. In experiments using thirty MRIs of segmented brain tumors from the BRATS dataset, three datasets with ten patients each were used. The tumors varied in size, shape, and complexity. The proposed method is applicable to different volume shapes and arbitrary rotations. A rotation invariant descriptor is sought to improve matching similarity performance by partitioning regions with non-intersecting spheres packing. Similarity measurements are based on distances ratios and radii of spheres. After analyzing 30 patients' MRIs, the study found that the radius of spheres and distance ratios were within an acceptable range of \u00b10.8 mm before and after rotation. The epsilon value measure for similarity management accounted for differences in voxel sizes. The study observed that spheres were close enough before and after rotation, meeting the epsilon criteria. The study found that the radius of spheres and distance ratios were within \u00b10.8 mm before and after rotation. Testing different packing densities showed consistent results within \u00b10.8 for epsilon value. The distance ratio between consecutive spheres should be within \u00b12.5, but increases with packing density to \u00b14 in 60%, \u00b112 in 70%, and \u00b132 in 80%. The study demonstrated high accuracy in approximating radiuses and ratios after rotation, with an average accuracy of 96.86% for radiuses and 69.23% for ratios. Further 3D-spatial improvements are expected to enhance results. Varying the volume dimensions showed varying results, indicating the need for larger grid sizes for increased accuracy. Increasing the grid size for patients resulted in a greater number of voxels of smaller sizes, leading to improved accuracy. Analyzing the data further, the mean absolute error (MAE) was calculated for patients using the distribution of ratios and radiuses in 30 patients, showing a high algorithm approximation for the targeted object. The algorithm showed a high MAE of 0.2 for patient analysis in medical applications. It plays a crucial role in differentiating patients with varying risks of recurrence and determining appropriate treatments. The algorithm's accuracy is high, especially in calculating similar radiuses after rotation. The spheres radius was found to be effective in finding similarities. The algorithm's consistency in calculating similar radiuses within epsilon is due to selecting the maximum radius distance at each iteration. Increasing the number of packed spheres affects the topology and epsilon value. Choosing which sphere to place first impacts the topology changes significantly. When radiuses are equal, the descriptor graph may change based on the algorithm's suggestion, requiring equal spheres to be replaced by the average center. Our study focuses on replacing equal spheres with the average center to maintain consistency in shape descriptors before and after rotation. This approach aims to reduce epsilon values and improve accuracy in shape analysis for feature extraction. Our novel medical visualization techniques promise to enhance efficiency, diagnostic quality, and treatment outcomes. The paper presents a method for defining invariant shape descriptors from 3D-image data for similarity matching. The method is applicable to various data types and has shown 96% invariance under rotations. The system was implemented in Slicer3D and tested on 30 patient databases, with future work including 3D-spatial sorting. For future improvements, 3D-spatial sorting and minimal volume enclosing sphere methods will be applied to enhance epsilon value. The plan is to share the experimental Slicer3D system under BSD license for global community feedback on 3D volume data."
