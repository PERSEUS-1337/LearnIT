    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Deleting Online Predators Act of 2006\". The Congress finds that sexual predators target minors on the Internet through chat rooms and social networking sites, leading to one in five children being approached sexually online. Predators use these platforms to befriend children, engage in explicit conversations, request photos, and attempt to arrange in-person meetings. The increasing popularity of chat rooms and social networking sites makes it challenging to monitor and protect minors from individuals with harmful intentions, especially when unsupervised by parents. SEC. 3. CERTIFICATIONS TO INCLUDE PROTECTIONS AGAINST COMMERCIAL SOCIAL NETWORKING WEBSITES AND CHAT ROOMS. Section 254(h)(5)(B) of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to require schools to enforce an Internet safety policy for minors, including monitoring online activities and using technology protection measures to block access to obscene, child pornography, or harmful content. The amendment to Section 254(h)(6)(B) of the Communications Act of 1934 requires libraries to enforce an Internet safety policy that includes using technology protection measures to block access to harmful content for minors. The amendment to Section 254(h)(6)(B) of the Communications Act of 1934 mandates protection measures to block minors' access to harmful online content, including obscenity, child pornography, and content harmful to minors. It also requires safeguards against minors accessing commercial social networking sites or chat rooms without parental consent, warning parents about potential risks from sexual predators on these platforms. The Commission will define 'social networking website' and 'chat room' within 120 days of the Deleting Online Predators Act of 2006 enactment. Considerations include commercial entity ownership, user profile creation with personal information. The text chunk discusses amendments to the Act regarding the disabling of certain features during adult or educational use, including the creation of online journals, sharing personalized information, and enabling communication among users. FTC Consumer Alert on Internet dangers to children. The Federal Trade Commission will issue a consumer alert and establish a website to provide information on the dangers of Internet child predators, specifically focusing on commercial social networking websites and chat rooms where personal information about children can be accessed. Commercial Social Networking Websites and chat rooms may be accessed by child predators. The terms are defined in accordance with the Communications Act of 1934. Passed the House of Representatives on July 26, 2006. Attest: KAREN L. HAAS, Clerk."
