    "content": "Since the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010, Congress has focused on compensatory liability provisions in the Oil Pollution Act for responsible parties. This includes covering cleanup costs, economic damages, and addressing the deaths of 11 workers. The liability provisions aim to compensate those affected by the spill. The report discusses federal civil and criminal penalty provisions related to the Gulf spill and worker fatalities, separate from compensatory liability provisions under the Oil Pollution Act. Attorney General Eric Holder announced an investigation into the spill, emphasizing the punitive and deterrent nature of these penalties. The report discusses federal laws that may have been violated in relation to the Gulf spill, including provisions that extend beyond U.S. territorial sea. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act applies laws of the United States to the spill site, even though it is 50 miles off the coast of Louisiana. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act extends U.S. laws to the subsoil and seabed of the Outer Continental Shelf, including artificial islands and installations. The Deepwater Horizon spill location does not hinder the imposition of penalties under relevant statutes. Civil penalty ceilings are adjusted every four years to account for inflation. The Civil Penalty Inflation Adjustment Act requires adjustments to maximum civil penalties every four years to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index. The Criminal Fine Improvements Act aims to increase fines for violations under the U.S. Code. The Criminal Fine Improvements Act (CFIA) aims to increase fines for violations under the U.S. Code. The maximum criminal fine imposed can be up to the greater of the specified amount in the offense law or alternative ceilings in the CFIA. For organizations, the penalty caps range from twice the gross gain or loss to $500,000 for felonies. Individuals face half the penalties of organizations. The CFIA does not apply in certain circumstances. The CFIA may not apply in certain circumstances, such as when a law explicitly exempts an offense from CFIA penalties. A district court has ruled that CFIA penalty caps do not override lower caps in the Endangered Species Act, as applying the CFIA cap would nullify the lower cap enacted after the CFIA. This ruling is based on the principle of statutory construction to give every word operative effect. The CFIA controls over other statutes that do not exempt themselves. One court's view on penalty caps under the Endangered Species Act may not be accepted by other courts. Civil administrative penalties under CWA section 311(b)(6) allow for Class I or Class II penalties up to $10,000 per violation.

The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) imposes fines of up to $15,000 or six months imprisonment for violations. The Gulf oil spill violated MBTA section 2, making it illegal to harm migratory birds. Oil companies have been convicted under the MBTA for bird deaths, even without specific targeting. OPA section 4303(a) imposes a civil penalty of up to $27,500 per day for non-compliance with financial responsibility requirements. The penalty amount considers the violation's nature, circumstances, and culpability. The agency has the authority to adjust, compromise, modify, or remit the penalty.
