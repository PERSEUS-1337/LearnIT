The \"Satellite Access to Local Stations Act\" amends Chapter 1 of title 17, US Code by adding a new section on limitations for satellite carriers transmitting television broadcast stations within local markets. This includes statutory licensing for secondary transmissions that comply with FCC regulations and involve charging subscribers. The Satellite Access to Local Stations Act requires satellite carriers to report semiannually to the Register of Copyrights on secondary transmissions subject to statutory licensing. This includes providing information on television broadcast stations whose signals were transmitted within local markets and the total number of addresses provided to subscribers. The Satellite Access to Local Stations Act mandates satellite carriers to report semiannually to the Register of Copyrights on secondary transmissions subject to statutory licensing. This includes details on television broadcast stations and the number of addresses provided to subscribers. Satellite carriers have no royalty obligation for these transmissions, but noncompliance with reporting requirements can lead to infringement actions. The term 'distributor' refers to an entity that distributes secondary transmissions from a satellite carrier to subscribers. A 'local market' of a television broadcast station is defined as per the Communications Act of 1934. A 'television broadcast station' is a licensed over-the-air commercial or noncommercial station. A 'subscriber' is an individual receiving these transmissions. The term 'subscriber' refers to a person or entity receiving a secondary transmission service from a satellite and paying a fee for it. The terms 'satellite carrier' and 'secondary transmission' are defined under section 119(d) of the law. SEC. 3. RETRANSMISSION CONSENT. Section 325(b) of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to state that no cable system or other multichannel video programming distributor can retransmit a broadcasting station's signal without express authority or specific conditions outlined in sections 614 and 337. The Satellite Access to Local Stations Act requires the FCC to update regulations on retransmission consent by TV stations within 45 days. The rulemaking process must align with existing regulations and be completed within 180 days. SEC. 4. MUST-CARRY FOR SATELLITE CARRIERS RETRANSMITTING TELEVISION BROADCAST SIGNALS. Title III of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to include a new section requiring satellite carriers to carry local television signals. Satellite carriers must offer to carry all local television broadcast stations within a market, except for those not retransmitting signals under the statutory license. Carriage of additional stations is at the carrier's discretion. Duplication of signals from local stations is not required to be carried by the satellite carrier. The satellite carrier must offer to carry all local television broadcast stations in a market on contiguous channels and in a nondiscriminatory manner. They cannot accept payment for carrying these stations as required by regulations. The satellite carrier must offer to carry local television broadcast stations in a market on contiguous channels without discrimination. Stations may need to cover costs for delivering a good quality signal to the carrier's main headend. If a station believes the carrier has not met its obligations, it can file a complaint. The satellite carrier must carry the signal of a local television broadcast station within 30 days of notification or provide reasons for not doing so. If denied carriage, the station can file a complaint with the Commission alleging the carrier's failure to meet its obligations. The Commission will provide the satellite carrier with an opportunity to present data and arguments to prove compliance with its obligations under the section. Within 120 days of a complaint being filed, the Commission will determine if the carrier has met its obligations. The Commission will order a satellite carrier to carry a station for at least 12 months if it fails to meet obligations. If the carrier complies, the complaint will be dismissed. Within 180 days, the Commission will issue regulations implementing the requirements of this section. The term \"television broadcast station\" refers to a full-power station, excluding low-power or translator stations. The term 'local market' refers to the designated market area where a station is located, encompassing all commercial television broadcast stations licensed within the same area. This definition applies to both the 150 largest designated market areas and those outside this range. The term 'local market' refers to the designated market area where a station is located, including all commercial television broadcast stations licensed within the same area. This definition also applies to noncommercial educational television broadcast stations within the designated market area as determined by Nielsen Media Research. The term 'designated market area' is defined by Nielsen Media Research and published in the DMA Market and Demographic Report. The term 'principal headend of the satellite carrier' refers to the main facility of the satellite carrier. The term 'principal headend of the satellite carrier' is the reception point where a satellite carrier initially receives the signal of a broadcast television station for transmission to the carrier's satellites for secondary transmission to subscribers. The Act and its amendments will be effective starting January 1, 1999."
