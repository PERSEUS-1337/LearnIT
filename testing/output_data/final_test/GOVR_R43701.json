    "content": "The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 was created to end the use of federal troops for enforcing civil law, maintaining the separation between military and civilian affairs. However, Congress has authorized the President to deploy military force in certain circumstances, such as assisting in law enforcement or during times of insurrection and domestic violence. The National Defense Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1989 directed the Department of Defense to take a leading role in detecting and monitoring illegal drug activities, making it the primary agency for drug interdiction efforts. This included placing Coast Guard law enforcement detachments on naval vessels in drug-interdiction areas. The National Defense Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1989 directed the Department of Defense to lead drug interdiction efforts by placing Coast Guard law enforcement detachments on naval vessels in drug-interdiction areas. It also authorized DOD to provide equipment and funding for drug interdiction operations, including transferring excess defense equipment to federal and state agencies for counter-drug activities. The National Defense Authorization Act allowed the transfer of excess defense equipment to federal and state agencies for counter-drug activities. The termination date for this authority was extended to September 30, 1997. Congress considered making this authority permanent, with the House version of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 proposing expanded eligibility for property transfers to all law enforcement. The Senate amended the bill to extend priority in property transfer to counter-narcotics and counter-terrorism activities, with no additional costs to the Department of Defense. The program is administered by the Law Enforcement Support Office (LESO) of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) in Battle Creek, Michigan, with DLA retaining final authority over the transfer of excess military equipment to law enforcement agencies. Law enforcement agencies can receive a variety of equipment through the 1033 Program, including office furniture, household goods, exercise equipment, generators, tents, law enforcement supplies, heavy equipment, watercraft, aircraft, and weapons. To participate, agencies apply through their state coordinator and appoint officials to visit a DLA Disposition Services Site. Law enforcement agencies appoint officials to visit DLA Disposition Services Site to screen and request specific items. Forms are reviewed by state coordinator and approved by LESO for property transfer. Approved agencies must cover transportation costs. 11,000 agencies are registered nationwide, with 8,000 currently using program property. Each state must have an MOA with DLA and appoint a state coordinator to oversee correct program usage and property accountability. The state coordinators oversee property accountability records and investigate misuse, reporting violations to DLA. They can suspend participation of states or agencies not complying. DLA conducts compliance reviews to ensure proper maintenance of records and prevent fraud. Some equipment offered includes weapons and tactical vehicles. The 1033 Program offers military equipment to law enforcement agencies on loan, with ownership never transferred. Equipment must be returned when no longer needed, and non-military property is controlled for the first year before ownership is transferred to the agency. Regular reports to Congress are not required for the program. The 1033 Program does not require regular reports to Congress. More information can be found on the LESO website and some states have their own law enforcement support offices with tailored program information. Section 1208 of the National Defense Authorization Act for 1990 allows the Secretary of Defense to transfer excess personal property to Federal and State agencies for counter-drug activities. The Secretary of Defense can transfer excess personal property to Federal and State agencies for counter-drug activities without cost. The transfer must be made from existing stocks and without using Department of Defense funds. The authority to transfer personal property expires on September 30, 1992. The Secretary of Defense may transfer excess personal property to Federal and State agencies for law enforcement activities, including counter-drug and counter-terrorism efforts. The transfer must be from existing Department of Defense stocks and made without cost. The Secretary must consult with the Attorney General and the Director of National Drug Control Policy. The Secretary of Defense may transfer excess personal property to Federal and State agencies for law enforcement activities, including counter-drug and counter-terrorism efforts. The transfer is made without cost, and the recipient accepts the property on an as-is, where-is basis. All costs incurred after the transfer are borne by the recipient. The Secretary may transfer personal property without charge, giving preference to applications for property used in counter-drug or counter-terrorism activities."
