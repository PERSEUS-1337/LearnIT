The new tax credit allows for a 50 percent credit on qualified infectious disease research expenses incurred during the taxable year. The tax credit for qualified infectious disease research expenses is modified to increase the incentive for contract research payments. Qualified infectious disease research expenses exclude amounts funded by grants or contracts from another person or governmental entity.

The tax credit for qualified infectious disease research expenses is modified to increase the incentive for contract research payments. Antibiotic drugs and antivirals must be in formulations deemed necessary by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Antibiotic drugs are defined as per the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, while antivirals impede virus reproduction. Biological products are also included in the definitions. The terms 'biological product', 'device', 'diagnostic test', 'drug', and 'qualifying pathogen' are defined in relation to infectious human diseases. The term 'qualifying pathogen' includes methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, life-threatening gram negative bacteria like E. coli, Acinetobacter, Klebsiella, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), and any other infectious pathogen identified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services as a significant threat to public health due to drug resistance or other factors. The term 'vaccine' refers to a vaccine intended for human use. Coordination with credit for increasing research expenditures states that qualified infectious disease research expenses for a taxable year under this section shall not be considered for the research credit allowable under section 41, except for expenses included in determining base period research expenses. The section provides special rules for determining research expenses for subsequent taxable years. Rules similar to section 41(f) apply, and expenses for infectious disease research cannot be used for the research credit under section 45C. Taxpayers must elect to apply this section for a taxable year. The section allows for the application of the infectious disease research credit for taxable years before December 31, 2012.

The amendment disallows a deduction for qualified infectious disease research expenses equal to the credit determined under section 45O(a). Rules similar to subsection (c) apply, and a deduction for the unused portion of the credit is allowed under section 196(c).
