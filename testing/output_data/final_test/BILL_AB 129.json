    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 18546 of the Government Code is amended to define \"career executive\" as an employee eligible for specific assignments with varied conditions of employment. Section 18990 is also amended to provide further details. Section 18990 of the Government Code is amended to allow Legislature employees with two or more years of consecutive service to request civil service appointment list eligibility by taking relevant exams. Legislative experience will be considered as state civil service experience for comparable positions. Employees who meet requirements can take civil service exams even if they resigned from Legislature service. Section 18991 of the Government Code is amended to allow retired military personnel with service-connected disabilities to apply for civil service exams. Military experience will be considered as state civil service experience for qualification evaluation. Section 18992 is also amended. Persons in nonelected exempt positions in the executive branch can request civil service appointment list eligibility by taking relevant exams. Experience in exempt positions will be considered as state civil service experience for qualification evaluation. Persons who meet requirements and resigned or were released from exempt executive branch employment can take promotional civil service exams. Section 18993 of the Government Code allows legislative or exempt executive branch employees appointed to career executive assignments to compete in promotional examinations and request deferred exams if their assignment is terminated. Section 19057 of the Government Code is repealed, and Section 19057.1 is amended to specify the certification process for eligibles on employment lists. Requests for deferred examinations after termination of career executive assignments must be made within 10 days, with the exam to be administered within 30 days of the request. For ranking purposes, scores of eligibles on employment lists are rounded to the nearest whole percent, with a rank consisting of one or more eligibles with the same score. If there are fewer than three ranks on the list, additional eligibles may be certified from lower lists until three ranks are reached. If fewer than three names are available for certification, the appointing authority may demand certification of three names, and examinations will be conducted until at least three names can be certified for appointment. Fractional examination scores are used by the California Highway Patrol for peace officer classes. The department can certify less than three ranks if the group size is disproportionate to vacancies. Section 19057.2 of the Government Code is repealed, and Section 19057.3 is amended for positions in the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Names and addresses of top three eligibles willing to accept appointment are certified. For ranking purposes, scores of eligibles on employment lists are rounded to the nearest whole percent. If fewer than three ranks of willing appointees are on the list, additional names are certified from lower lists until three ranks are filled. The appointing power must choose from the certified names to fill the position. The department may certify less than three ranks if the group size is disproportionate to vacancies. Names of eligibles can be transferred between lists for the same or comparable classes. Section 19057.4 of the Government Code is repealed, and Section 19889 is amended. The State Personnel Board establishes a merit system for selecting and placing executive personnel. The department is responsible for salary administration, position classification, and training of executive personnel. A category of civil service appointment called \"career executive assignments\" is created for high administrative and policy influencing positions. The department designates positions for this category, subject to review by the State Personnel Board. Section 19889.2 of the Government Code is amended to exempt \"career executive assignments\" from certain civil service provisions, with State Personnel Board rules governing termination. Employees can appeal termination to the Board if it violates specified reasons. Section 19889.3 outlines the process for termination of career executive assignments. Section 19889.3 of the Government Code is amended to establish eligibility for career executive assignment positions through competitive examinations. Candidates must meet minimum qualifications determined by the State Personnel Board. No rights or status in civil service positions other than career executive assignment are acquired through such service. Section 19889.4 outlines rules for terminating career executive assignments. An employee with permanent civil service status appointed to a career executive assignment can choose to be reinstated to a civil service position not at the executive level, with a salary equal to or higher than their previous position. If the employee had five years of state service, they may return to a position at the same or slightly lower salary level. An employee appointed to a career executive assignment from outside civil service can compete in promotional examinations if they meet the minimum qualifications. Passing scores will result in placement on the promotional list or eligibility for appointment. Request for deferred examinations is allowed for open eligible lists. Employees appointed to a career executive assignment from outside civil service can compete in promotional examinations if they meet the minimum qualifications. Passing scores will result in placement on the promotional list or eligibility for appointment. Deferred examinations are allowed for open eligible lists, and related experience gained in a career executive assignment will be considered as state civil service experience in a comparable class. List eligibility can be transferred between appointing powers for civil service employees. A request for deferred examination must be made within 10 days of the termination of a career executive assignment. The Department of Finance is appropriated $300,000 for posting budget requests online. This act is related to the Budget Bill and takes effect immediately."
