The Congress finds that in 2005, fire departments responded to 1,600,000 fires, resulting in 3,675 civilian deaths, 17,925 civilian injuries, and 87 firefighter fatalities. Fire caused $10.67 billion in property damage, with sprinklers reducing property damage by 70% in various types of buildings. Fire departments respond to fires in various types of buildings every 20 seconds in the United States. The Station Nightclub in Rhode Island, lacking a sprinkler system, burned down and resulted in 100 fatalities. Conversely, the Fine Line Music Cafe in Minneapolis, equipped with an automated sprinkler system, prevented injuries during a fire incident. The National Fire Protection Association highlights the effectiveness of sprinkler systems in preventing multiple fatalities in properly installed buildings. The financial cost of upgrading fire counter-measures in buildings built prior to fire safety codes is prohibitive for most property owners. Many State and local governments lack requirements for existing structures to contain automatic sprinkler systems. There is a disincentive for building safety improvements due to a low rate of return on investment. The Nation needs incentives for the voluntary installation and retrofitting of buildings with automated sprinkler systems.
