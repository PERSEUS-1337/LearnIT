    "content": "Under the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, the President and the Senate share responsibility for making appointments to the Supreme Court and lower federal courts. While the President nominates judges, Senate confirmation is required. Historically, appointments to lower courts have not sparked much public disagreement. However, in recent decades, appointments to certain lower federal courts have become more contentious. Appointments to lower federal courts have historically not sparked much public disagreement, but in recent decades, appointments to U.S. district and circuit courts have been the focus of heightened Senate interest and debate. This report provides an overview of the appointment process for these judges, including the selection of nominees by the President, the role of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the Senate's floor consideration. The report focuses on the appointment process of U.S. circuit and district court judges through presidential nomination and Senate confirmation. It discusses the final steps after Senate confirmation, such as receiving commissions and taking oaths of office, as well as possible outcomes for nominees whose nominations are not confirmed. The report discusses judicial appointments, including recess appointments by the President for U.S. district and circuit courts. These courts handle the majority of federal court litigation, making important policy decisions. Congress has shown increased interest in the lower federal courts and judges in recent decades. In recent decades, Congress has shown increased interest in the lower federal courts and judges. The judicial appointment process in the Senate has become a center of debate, with discussions on evaluating nominees, their impartiality, ideological agendas, and the timeliness of confirmations. Confirmation processes have become longer during the presidencies of Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. The Senate confirmation process for judicial nominees has become more contentious in recent years, with longer confirmation times and fewer unanimous consent votes. There have been divisions over when to hold up-or-down confirmation votes, with motions to close debate sometimes opposed by a substantial number of \"nay\" votes. The debate over judicial nominations in the Senate often revolves around the pace of processing nominations. Senators from the President's party accuse the opposing party of obstructionism, while the opposing party emphasizes the need to thoroughly review judicial nominees. Vacancies in district and circuit judgeships also contribute to the ongoing debate. The Senate established a standing order to accelerate the consideration of judicial nominations, reducing the maximum time for district court nominations from 30 to 2 hours in the 113th Congress. This bipartisan agreement aimed to address frustrations over delays in the judicial appointment process. The Senate established a standing order to accelerate the consideration of judicial nominations, reducing the maximum time for district court nominations from 30 to 2 hours in the 113th Congress. However, the order excluded circuit court nominations, leading to periodic divisions along party lines over how quickly the Senate should act on lower court nominations and whether various circuit court nominations should receive confirmation votes. Confirmation votes on three circuit court nominations were prevented late in the session when motions to close Senate debate on them failed to receive the required three-fifths supermajority. The Senate faced challenges in closing debate on nominations, leading to a proposal to change the procedure to require a simple majority vote. This change, known as the \"nuclear option,\" was approved by a vote of 52-48 on November 21, 2013, lowering the threshold for cloture on most presidential nominations. The Senate reinterpreted its cloture rule on November 21, 2013, requiring a simple majority vote to close debate on most presidential nominations, except those to the Supreme Court. This change led to the use of cloture motions instead of unanimous consent agreements for confirmation votes on circuit and district court nominations for the rest of the 113th Congress. During the 113th Congress, cloture motions were used for circuit and district court nominations, leading to successful confirmations without unanimous consent agreements. However, the Senate eventually returned to using unanimous consent agreements for confirmation votes on judicial nominations. On December 16, 2014, the Senate used a unanimous consent agreement instead of the cloture process for district court nominations. Regular reliance on unanimous consent agreements for judicial nominations continued in the 114th Congress. Regular reliance on unanimous consent agreements for judicial nominations continued in the 114th Congress, with confirmations only proceeding through unanimous consent agreements requested by the majority leader or his designee. The future reliance on unanimous consent or the cloture process for confirming judicial nominations remains uncertain. This report discusses the two procedural paths in Senate floor consideration of judicial nominations. The Senate has two procedural paths for confirming judicial nominations when vacancies arise due to judges assuming senior status, retirement, resignation, death, or elevation to a higher court. Vacancies also occur with new judgeships created by legislation. Judges often give advance notice of departure, allowing for the search for replacements to begin early. The federal judiciary prefers judges to give advance notice of their intention to leave full-time active status, allowing for the search for replacements to begin early. Sometimes, judges may announce their departure upon the Senate's confirmation of their successor, leading to the selection of a nominee before a judicial vacancy occurs. There is a judicial vacancy listed on the federal judiciary's website, including vacancies designated as \"judicial emergencies\" due to high workload. There are no formal restrictions on potential candidates for circuit or district court judgeships, with no specified requirements for profession, age, or citizenship. Federal law does not require exams, minimum age, native-born citizenship, or a law degree for judicial appointments. Candidates are typically lawyers with professional merit, evaluated for qualifications for circuit and district court judgeships. Judgeships are rigorously evaluated for professional qualification, with the American Bar Association playing a key role in assessing candidates. Presidents emphasize the importance of nominees meeting high standards and being impartial. Informal requirements include party affiliation with the President. The selection of judicial candidates is influenced by informal standards such as party affiliation with the President, judicial philosophy acceptable to key decision-makers, and support from the President's political base and interest groups. Additionally, candidates must meet representational standards for the court in question. The selection of judicial candidates is influenced by informal standards such as party affiliation with the President, judicial philosophy acceptable to key decision-makers, and support from interest groups. Representational considerations like ethnicity, religion, gender, and place of residence are also taken into account. The Administration or home state Senators typically play a role in identifying candidates, depending on party alignment and the type of judgeship being considered. Candidates for U.S. district court judgeships are usually identified by Senators of the state where the judicial districts are located. The selection of judicial candidates for U.S. district court judgeships is typically influenced by party affiliation with the President and support from home state Senators. Senators of the President's party usually provide recommendations for district court judgeships in their state. The selection of federal district judgeships is heavily influenced by Senators of the President's party, who have the power to recommend candidates for judgeships in their state. If the Administration has concerns about a candidate, they must resolve them with the Senator. If both Senators are of the President's party, they may share the role in selecting candidates. The selection of federal district judgeships is influenced by Senators of the President's party, who recommend candidates for judgeships in their state. If both Senators are of the President's party, they may share the role in selecting candidates based on their prerogatives and interests. The selection of federal district judgeships is influenced by Senators of the President's party, who recommend candidates for judgeships in their state. If both Senators are of the President's party, they may share the role in selecting candidates. In states where both Senators are from the opposition party, exceptions can occur, with the President sometimes allowing active senatorial participation in judicial candidate selection. Additionally, in some cases, officials of the President's party recommend judicial candidates, but opposition party Senators have veto power over objectionable recommendations. Even when neither Senator is of the President's party, a consultative role is expected in the appointment process through the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Senate Judiciary Committee's \"blue slip\" policy allows Senators to block judicial nominees by not returning a positive blue slip. The Administration is advised to consult with home state Senators before selecting nominees. Before selecting a judicial nominee, the Administration is advised to consult with home state Senators to ensure acceptability. Senators have discretion in evaluating candidates, using methods like nominating commissions to identify potential candidates. The Senator may publish notice of a judicial vacancy and invite applications, followed by a screening process to select candidates for nomination to the President. Criteria for selection include professional qualifications, integrity, judicial temperament, and political party considerations. In the judicial candidate search, Senators evaluate candidates based on party affiliation, representation of certain groups, normative criteria, and values underlying decision-making. The President ultimately decides on nominations, and Senators consider standards set by the Administration. Eleven of the 13 U.S. circuit courts of appeals are geographically based courts encompassing multiple states. Circuit courts are geographically based courts covering multiple states, with seats traditionally linked to specific states. Presidents often follow a \"state seat\" tradition when appointing judges. Senators have less influence on circuit court nominees compared to district court nominees. Home state Senators of the President's party typically recommend district judges, while circuit court nominees compete with other suggestions. President Obama's Administration faced this dynamic early on. President Obama had the prerogative to select circuit court nominees independently of Senators' recommendations. Senators can suggest nominees for vacant judgeships in their state's circuit, especially if they are of the President's party. Senators of the President's party typically recommend district judges, while circuit court nominees compete with other suggestions. During the Obama presidency, the White House Counsel's Office served as the main liaison with Senators for judicial appointments, following a long-standing blue slip policy where home state Senators expect consultation on circuit court nominees to avoid opposition. The White House Counsel's Office, along with the Department of Justice, evaluates judicial candidates for nomination, consulting with Senators and conducting preliminary vetting before recommending candidates to the President. Consideration for nomination to a judgeship involves a preliminary vetting process where candidates are interviewed and their background information is reviewed. This includes filling out various forms and questionnaires. Once a candidate is selected, they undergo detailed vetting before being cleared for nomination. During detailed vetting, administration staff review the candidate's written opinions, conduct interviews with the candidate and legal community members, and the FBI conducts a background investigation lasting four to six weeks. Preliminary vetting is typically done by the White House Counsel's Office, while detailed vetting is handled by the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Policy. The Department of Justice's Office of Legal Policy conducts detailed vetting of potential nominees for vacancies, usually limited to a single nominee per vacancy. The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary may also evaluate judicial candidates. The ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, composed of 15 lawyers, conducts impartial peer-review evaluations of judicial nominees focusing on integrity, competence, and temperament. This evaluation does not consider philosophy or political affiliation. The ABA committee evaluates judicial nominees based on their intellectual capacity, judgment, writing abilities, legal knowledge, and professional experience. The evaluation includes reviewing the candidate's responses to a questionnaire, legal writings, court decisions, and conducting confidential interviews with judges, lawyers, and others who have worked with the candidate. The ABA committee evaluates judicial nominees based on their integrity, professional competence, and judicial temperament. The evaluator prepares an informal report rating the candidate as \"well qualified,\" \"qualified,\" or \"not qualified,\" which is then shared with the White House for further consideration. The ABA committee evaluates judicial nominees based on integrity, competence, and temperament. If the candidate receives a \"qualified\" rating or better, a formal report is prepared and each committee member votes on the candidate's rating. The chair then confidentially advises the White House of the committee's rating. The rating remains confidential until the candidate is nominated. The ABA committee rating becomes part of the candidate's profile for the Administration to consider during the pre-nomination evaluation process. The ABA committee evaluates judicial nominees based on integrity, competence, and temperament. The majority of the committee's members' ratings can influence a candidate's nomination. A \"not qualified\" rating may deter the President from nominating. If nominated despite a majority \"not qualified\" rating, reasons will be disclosed if a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing is held. ABA committee evaluations are advisory to the Administration. The ABA committee provides advisory ratings on judicial candidates to the Administration. The President has discretion on how much weight to give these ratings when deciding on nominations. A \"not qualified\" rating may deter a nomination, but a \"well qualified\" or \"qualified\" rating does not guarantee a nomination. Administration staff may conduct follow-up interviews with candidates as part of the vetting process. The Administration staff evaluates the results of the vetting process and recommends to the President whether to nominate the candidate. If nominated and approved by the President, a nomination message is sent to the Senate. The Judiciary Committee plays a crucial role in deciding if the nomination moves forward in the confirmation process. The Judiciary Committee plays a crucial role in processing judicial nominations, which involves three phases: pre-hearing, holding a hearing, and voting on whether to report the nomination to the Senate. Professional staff conduct investigations into the nominee's background and qualifications, reviewing documents provided by the Administration. The pace of the staff investigation may vary depending on circumstances. The Judiciary Committee's pre-hearing evaluation of a nominee includes reviewing the ABA rating, the nominee's responses to the questionnaire, and information on their background and qualifications. The timing of the staff investigation may be influenced by the return of blue slips from home state Senators. The Judiciary Committee requires nominees to complete a questionnaire before scheduling a hearing. The questionnaire helps members assess the nominee's qualifications and may prompt additional questions. Some responses are kept confidential, such as any past investigations for legal violations. The Judiciary Committee requires nominees to complete a questionnaire before scheduling a hearing to assess qualifications and prompt additional questions. Nominees are expected to fully respond to the questionnaire and provide follow-up responses if necessary. The committee may also receive documents from various sources, including confidential FBI reports that are only available to select individuals. The Judiciary Committee requests nominees to complete a questionnaire and may receive confidential FBI reports. Reports on nominees are shared with designated staff and Senators, with a scholar noting they usually do not contain damaging information. Senators provide their opinions on nominees through a blue slip procedure. The Judiciary Committee uses a blue slip procedure where home state Senators can approve or prevent the consideration of nominees. The American Bar Association's rating of nominees is also important to the committee. The American Bar Association informs the Judiciary Committee of a nominee's rating, which can be \"well qualified,\" \"qualified,\" or \"not qualified.\" The ABA committee's ratings are made public on their website, including a chart for current nominees and past Congresses. The letter to the Judiciary Committee does not provide an explanation of the rating. The ABA committee informs the Judiciary Committee of a nominee's rating, which can be \"well qualified,\" \"qualified,\" or \"not qualified.\" If a nominee receives a unanimous or majority \"not qualified\" rating, the ABA committee will provide a written statement to the Judiciary Committee 48 hours before the confirmation hearing. The chair of the ABA committee will also testify at the hearing to explain the rating further. The ABA rating of a judicial nominee is an important factor for the Judiciary Committee to consider during the pre-hearing investigation. A \"qualified\" or higher rating is seen as a positive endorsement, while a \"not qualified\" rating may raise concerns for further investigation. The pre-hearing phase for circuit or district court nominees can last for months, with varying wait times across presidencies and Congresses. The confirmation hearing process for lower court nominees can be influenced by various factors such as the completion of questionnaires, volume of investigative information, controversies surrounding the nominee, and partisan differences. The scheduling of confirmation hearings is at the discretion of the Judiciary Committee chair. The Judiciary Committee chair has discretion over scheduling confirmation hearings for lower court nominees. The committee must provide public announcement of any hearing at least seven days prior to the start, unless good cause exists to begin earlier. Confirmation hearings involve a question and answer session with members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, often including multiple nominees in one hearing. The chair or a delegated committee member presides over the hearing. During confirmation hearings for judicial nominees, the Judiciary Committee or a delegated member presides. Nominees are introduced by their home state Senators or other officials, followed by opening statements and questioning by Senators on qualifications, legal interpretation, judicial temperament, and the role of judges. The Judiciary Committee presides over confirmation hearings for judicial nominees, where Senators question nominees on qualifications, legal interpretation, judicial temperament, and the role of judges. Nominees should be prepared to discuss their legal career, writings, and speaking engagements. Confirmation hearings may not be attended by all Committee members, but typically at least one member of the minority party is present along with the presiding Senator. Confirmation hearings for judicial nominees are usually routine, with Senators questioning nominees on qualifications. However, hearings may become more intensive or extended if there are concerns about a nominee's qualifications. In some cases, more Senators than usual may attend, especially for controversial nominees. Rarely, a hearing may be held exclusively for a nominee, or additional days may be scheduled for questioning. These hearings serve as a means for the Judiciary Committee to evaluate nominees firsthand and also have a public education function. Confirmation hearings for judicial nominees typically involve live webcasts for public viewing and allow nominees to address concerns from Senators. Statements from public witnesses are usually in written form, including those from the ABA, local or state bar associations, and interest groups. Oral testimonies are rare, with the focus primarily on written submissions. Confirmation hearings for judicial nominees often involve written statements from Senators not on the committee, public witnesses may testify in person on rare occasions, especially if a nominee has a negative ABA rating. The ABA committee may appear at the confirmation hearing to explain the rating. In some controversial cases, public witnesses may provide in-person testimony for or against confirmation. Nominees may also be required to provide written responses to follow-up questions from Senators after the hearing. Written responses to follow-up questions from Senators on the Judiciary Committee are necessary before the committee will consider reporting the nomination to the Senate. These questions may be posed during the hearing or provided afterwards for the nominee to reply to. The responses will be included in the public record of the hearing. Hearings on judicial nominations are not required by Senate rules. The Judiciary Committee requires written responses to follow-up questions from Senators before considering reporting a nomination to the Senate. Hearings on judicial nominations are not mandated by Senate rules, and the decision to hold a hearing lies with the committee chair. Without a hearing, some nominations may not advance to the reporting stage. Re-nominated judicial nominees who did not receive a hearing on their first nomination may receive a hearing on a later nomination to the same court. Typically, there is only one hearing for a circuit or district court nominee, even if they were nominated more than once. The Judiciary Committee usually does not require a new hearing for a re-nominated judicial nominee who already had a hearing on a previous nomination. During the nomination process, a committee vote is crucial for a nomination to move forward to the Senate. The committee chair decides when to schedule judicial nominations for a vote, which is publicly listed in the agenda for the committee's next meeting. If the committee votes against reporting the nomination, it will not move forward for Senate confirmation. The Judiciary Committee meeting is webcast live and results are posted on the committee website. A majority of members must be present for a nomination to be reported. The chair can move for nominations to be reported to the Senate, but votes can be delayed at a member's request. The Judiciary Committee may delay a vote on a nomination by one business meeting, as per committee rules. The committee can ultimately vote to report favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation. In rare cases, a nomination can advance for Senate consideration despite lacking majority support in the committee. The committee can vote on a nomination by voice vote or roll call. In Senate committees, judicial nominations can be voted on by voice vote or roll call. Roll call votes have become more common in recent years. A majority vote is required for approval, and nominations can die in committee if they fail to gain approval. Rejection by the Judiciary Committee prevents a nomination from Senate consideration. In Senate committees, judicial nominations can die if they fail to receive committee action, leading to their return to the President. Nominations can also be withdrawn by the President while in committee. Judicial nominations can reach the Senate floor without committee approval if the Senate agrees to discharge the committee. This process is often simplified by unanimous consent. After being reported by the Judiciary Committee, a judicial nomination is listed on the Executive Calendar with basic information about the nominee. The Executive Calendar includes nominations for circuit or district court positions, along with other nominations and treaties eligible for floor consideration. The nominations are listed chronologically based on the date they were reported. The Executive Calendar provides essential details about each nomination, such as the nominee's name, office, and the committee's report. It is published daily when the Senate is in session and can be accessed online. Nominations on the Executive Calendar, including judicial ones, are considered in executive session by the Senate. The Senate majority leader typically makes motions to enter executive session for judicial nominations. Nominations must be on the Executive Calendar for at least one day before Senate consideration. Most uncontroversial nominations are confirmed through unanimous consent agreements, while others facing opposition follow a different process. The Senate majority leader typically makes motions to enter executive session for judicial nominations. Nominations must be on the Executive Calendar for at least one day before Senate consideration. Unanimous consent is used for uncontroversial nominations, while others facing opposition require a cloture motion for a confirmation vote. The routine use of unanimous consent for lower court nominations stopped in 2013. The Senate reinterpreted Rule XXII on November 21, 2013, lowering the votes needed to close debate on nominations to a simple majority. This change led to a shift in confirming circuit and district court nominations, allowing a Senate vote on confirmation with a simple majority. The cloture process was routinely used for judicial nominations in the 113th Congress, but on December 16, 2014, the Senate reverted to using a unanimous consent agreement for confirmation votes on 11 district court nominations. Since then, in the 114th Congress, all confirmations of judicial nominations have been reached by a different process. In the 114th Congress, all confirmations of judicial nominations have been reached by unanimous consent, returning to traditional Senate reliance on this process. Senate floor consideration of judicial nominations by unanimous consent is typically scheduled by the majority leader in consultation with the minority leader and all interested parties. In the Senate, confirmations of judicial nominations are typically scheduled by the majority leader in consultation with the minority leader and all interested Senators. The majority leader seeks to establish that no Senator will object to the nomination receiving a vote on confirmation before making a unanimous consent request during a legislative session. The request asks for permission to proceed to executive session to consider and vote on the nomination, with or without debate. The Senate typically schedules judicial nominations for confirmation with input from both majority and minority leaders. Unanimous consent requests are made for the Senate to confirm nominations without debate, setting time limits for discussion and voting. This process ensures a timely vote and prevents delays. The Senate typically schedules judicial nominations for confirmation with input from both majority and minority leaders. Unanimous consent requests are made for the Senate to confirm nominations without debate, setting time limits for discussion and voting. During debate on a circuit or district court nomination, statements are made by the chair of the Judiciary Committee and the ranking minority member. Home state Senators may also speak on the nominee. The presiding officer then asks the Senate to advise and consent to the nomination, with a roll call vote taken if requested. A roll call vote is required for the Senate to approve a nomination if requested. Unanimous consent agreements for judicial nominees may result in varied voting outcomes, from unanimous support to significant opposition. Despite unanimous consent, it does not guarantee absence of opposition, but rather allows for a vote without prior debate. The Senate may consider and vote on a judicial nomination without prior debate through a unanimous consent agreement. This agreement typically indicates that the nomination is uncontroversial and will be confirmed without debate. Sometimes, a request for immediate consideration and confirmation of judicial nominations without debate or vote by Members may be made. Members may request confirmation of a single nomination or a group of nominations \"en bloc.\" If agreed to, nominations are confirmed immediately without debate or vote, typically for uncontroversial judicial nominations. Sometimes, unanimous consent is requested to proceed to consideration without a confirmation vote, indicating potential objections. The request for unanimous consent to proceed to consider a judicial nomination, without providing for a Senate vote, allows for the nomination to be championed by Senate supporters in executive session. This agreement sets the stage for supporters to use the cloture process to force a confirmation vote. During the 113th Congress, Senate floor votes on court nominations were often delayed due to controversy. The Senate struggled to agree on scheduling confirmation votes, leading to the use of the cloture process for every circuit or district court nomination. Only a few unanimous consent requests were made, with objections raised each time. The Senate rules allow opponents to indefinitely block a nomination without a time agreement for a vote. If unanimous consent is not reached, a cloture motion must be voted on to end debate and move the nomination forward. The Senate rules require a cloture motion to end debate and move a nomination forward. At least 16 Senators must sign the motion, which is read by the clerk and states the intention to close debate on the nomination. The Senate rules require a cloture motion to end debate and move a nomination forward. The Senate will not vote on the cloture motion until the second day of session after it has been presented. A unanimous consent agreement typically provides for a specified period of debate before the cloture vote. Cloture can be invoked on most nominations by a majority vote. After a cloture motion is invoked in the Senate on nominations, including circuit and district court nominations, a simple majority of Senators voting in favor is required. Senate Rule XXII allows for a maximum of 30 hours of consideration after cloture is invoked. In the 113th Congress, district court judge nominations had a 2-hour post-cloture consideration limit, but in the 114th Congress, all nominations reverted back to 30 hours. After cloture is invoked in the Senate on nominations, a common practice is to proceed to a confirmation vote without debating for the maximum 30 hours allowed. This can be achieved through agreements that yield back post-cloture time or use time for unrelated business. The Senate then confirms with a majority vote, sometimes after multiple cloture motions. During the 113th Congress, multiple cloture motions were filed on judicial nominations, resulting in same-day confirmations. This was done by moving between legislative and executive sessions to consider nominations. During the 113th Congress, the Senate majority leader used various methods to file multiple cloture motions on judicial nominations, leading to same-day confirmations. This included moving between legislative and executive sessions and using unanimous consent. The cloture motions ripened two days after being filed, with the Senate voting on cloture for the first nomination followed by consideration and confirmation. During the 113th Congress, the Senate majority leader employed different tactics to expedite confirmation votes on multiple judicial nominations in a single day. This involved utilizing unanimous consent and moving between legislative and executive sessions. The process included filing cloture motions that ripened after two days, with the Senate voting on cloture for the first nomination before proceeding to consideration and confirmation. In the 114th Congress, post-cloture consideration limits reverted back to 30 hours for all nominations, making same-day confirmations more challenging. During the 113th Congress, the Senate majority leader used various tactics to speed up confirmation votes on multiple judicial nominations in a single day, including unanimous consent and moving between legislative and executive sessions. Cloture motions were filed with a two-day ripening period, allowing the Senate to vote on cloture for the first nomination before moving to consideration and confirmation. In the 114th Congress, post-cloture consideration limits returned to 30 hours for all nominations, making same-day confirmations more difficult. Prior to 1949, nominations could not be subjected to cloture attempts in the Senate. From 1980 to November 21, 2013, only 1.4% of circuit and district court nominations were confirmed after cloture was invoked. The super-majority vote required for cloture was a disincentive for its frequent use on judicial nominations. After November 21, 2013, it only required a simple majority to invoke cloture on judicial nominations, making it easier to confirm nominees. The previous super-majority requirement of 60 Senators made it difficult to invoke cloture, leading to fewer attempts and delays in the confirmation process. After November 21, 2013, the Senate confirmed 14 circuit court nominations and 71 district court nominations through the cloture process, with voting majorities falling short of the previous 60 Member supermajority requirement. The Senate confirmed numerous circuit and district court nominations through the cloture process, with voting mostly along party lines. However, on December 16, 2014, a unanimous consent agreement was used for confirmation votes on district court nominations for the first time in over a year. The Senate confirmed judicial nominations through the cloture process, mostly along party lines. On December 16, 2014, a unanimous consent agreement affected 11 district court nominations, withdrawing cloture motions and confirming the nominations by voice vote. This marked a departure from the usual party-line cloture process for judicial confirmations. In the 114th Congress, the Senate shifted from using cloture to confirm judicial nominations to relying on unanimous consent agreements requested by the majority leader. This change was due to the minority party winning a majority of Senate seats in the November 2014 elections. In the 114th Congress, the Senate returned to using unanimous consent to confirm most judicial nominations, with the possibility of relying on cloture in the future depending on various factors, such as the party of the President and Senate majority. The cloture process could be used by the majority party to confirm nominations with just a simple Senate majority needed to close debate. In the 114th Congress, the Senate used unanimous consent to confirm most judicial nominations. The cloture process could be an alternative path if unanimous consent could not be attained, especially if nominations were controversial or opposed by Senators. In the 114th Congress, the Senate used unanimous consent to confirm most judicial nominations, but for controversial nominations, scheduling confirmation votes by unanimous consent could be problematic. The cloture process could be an alternative path if unanimous consent could not be attained, especially if nominations were opposed by Senators. In the 114th Congress, the Senate used unanimous consent for most judicial nominations, but for controversial ones, scheduling confirmation votes by unanimous consent could be difficult. The cloture process could be an alternative if unanimous consent was not possible, especially for nominations opposed by Senators. The use of cloture could be influenced by the time-consuming nature of the process, which could discourage the Senate majority from using it and instead seek unanimous consent for judicial nominations. After November 21, 2013, nominations in the 113th Congress could be considered through the cloture process with reduced post-cloture consideration time. The Senate may confirm nominations by unanimous consent, voice vote, or recorded roll call vote. A roll call vote is taken if the Senate orders \"the yeas and nays.\" In recent decades, confirmations by roll call votes have become more common for district and circuit court nominations. During the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama, roll call votes were the most common way the Senate confirmed lower court nominees. President Reagan and George H.W. Bush had a small percentage of nominees confirmed by roll call vote. During the Reagan presidency, no district court nominees were confirmed by roll call votes. Confirmation by roll call vote became more common during Clinton's presidency, and it peaked during George W. Bush's tenure. This trend continued under President Obama, with a majority of lower court nominees being approved by roll call votes. Senate Rule XXXI allows Senators who voted with the majority to move nominations after confirmation. The Senate allows Senators who voted with the majority to move to reconsider a confirmed nomination. Typically, the Senate preempts the motion to reconsider by arranging for it to be considered tabled if the nomination is confirmed. This is often done through unanimous consent agreements before the confirmation vote. The Senate allows Senators who voted with the majority to move to reconsider a confirmed nomination. The motion to reconsider is typically tabled if the nomination is confirmed, preventing any subsequent attempt to reconsider. The Secretary of the Senate then attests to the confirmation resolution and transmits it to the White House. Upon notification of confirmation, the President signs the nominee's commission, empowering them to assume the judicial office. The President signs the nominee's commission, allowing them to assume the judicial office. The commission is transmitted to the Department of Justice, along with other necessary documents, for the nominee to take the statutory oath of office before exercising judicial authority. The oath is administered by a legally authorized individual, such as the chief judge or another judge on the court. The nominee signs the commission and takes the oath of office, which combines the judicial oath required by law with a general oath for federal officials. Seniority among confirmed nominees is determined by age. The process includes receiving documents from the Department of Justice, administering the oath, and obtaining the nominee's signature on the commission. The final step in the appointment process for a nominee is the investiture ceremony, where the new judge is sworn in again in a courtroom, typically attended by family and friends. This ceremony is not mandatory for assuming office and can take place weeks or months after the oath of office is executed. Some circuit and district court nominations may not receive Senate confirmation during a Congress, with the progress in the confirmation process varying for each nominee. The confirmation process for judicial nominations can vary greatly, with some nominees not receiving committee consideration, others advancing partially through the committee stage, and some not receiving Senate floor consideration or a confirmation vote. Factors such as support from Members, scheduling considerations, and timing of nominations can impact a nomination's progress. If a judicial nomination fails to be confirmed, it can end with rejection by the Senate, withdrawal, or other outcomes. The confirmation process for judicial nominations can end in rejection by the Senate, withdrawal by the President, or return of the nomination to the President. Re-nominating a person is possible after a nomination is returned, especially for circuit or district court nominations. Rejection by the full Senate for a lower court nomination is very rare. The Senate can reject a judicial nomination, but this does not prevent the nominee from being renominated. The President can also withdraw a nomination for various reasons. When a judicial nomination is withdrawn, it can happen due to lack of support, nominee's request, or for re-nomination to a different judgeship. Senate Rule XXXI, paragraph 6 states that all pending nominations are returned to the President when the Senate adjourns sine die or recesses for more than 30 days. The nomination then becomes unconfirmed, but the President can choose to re-nominate the individual. When the Senate adjourns or recesses for more than 30 days, all pending nominations are typically returned to the President, as per Senate Rule XXXI, paragraph 6. However, the Senate can waive this rule by unanimous consent, allowing nominations to remain in status quo during long recesses. In some cases, certain nominations may be excluded from this agreement if opposed by one or more Senators, requiring their return to the President. When the Senate recesses, nominations are usually returned to the President. If the Senate does not reach an agreement to keep nominations in place, the President can choose to renominate all or most of the nominees. Exceptions may be made for nominees with uncertain confirmation chances. When the Senate recesses, nominations are typically returned to the President. The return of specific nominations may signal opposition in the Senate. The President can decide whether to renominate or choose new nominees. In the next Congress, the President can re-nominate individuals whose previous nominations were returned. However, the new nominations will have to go through certain confirmation steps again. In the new Congress, nominations must go through confirmation steps again, including approval by the Judiciary Committee. A confirmation hearing may be skipped for nominees who had one in the previous Congress."
