    "content": "The \"School Bus Safety Act\" and \"Kadyn's Act\" are titles of legislation related to school bus safety. Kadyn's Act includes provisions for withholding apportionments for noncompliance with school bus passings. The Secretary will withhold 10 percent of apportionments for states that do not enforce penalties for illegally passing a stopped school bus. The Secretary will withhold funds from states that do not enforce penalties for illegally passing a stopped school bus, with fines and possible jail time for offenders. Funds withheld will not be available for apportionment to the state and will lapse. Title II of the legislation focuses on providing grants for motion-activated detection systems on school buses. The title may be cited as the \"Grants for Motion-Activated Detection System on School Buses Act.\" The Secretary of Transportation may provide grants to States for equipping school buses with motion-activated detection systems. States must submit an application containing specific information and assurances to qualify for the grant. Grant amounts will be sufficient to meet the requirements, and funding will be provided for the grants. The Secretary will use unapportioned funds from title 23 to fund grants for motion-activated detection systems on school buses. States must report on the system's effectiveness in preventing accidents and provide a cost benefit analysis. The system uses radio signals or radar waves to detect moving targets near the bus. The motion-activated detection system on school buses alerts the driver when a moving target is detected near the bus. TITLE III--SCHOOL BUS DRIVER SAFETY ENFORCEMENT\nSEC. 301. WITHHOLDING FOR NONCOMPLIANCE OF BACKGROUND CHECKS OF SCHOOL BUS DRIVERS. Title III of the United States Code introduces withholding apportionments for states that do not comply with background checks for school bus drivers. The Secretary will withhold 10 percent of the apportioned amount if a state fails to require employers to conduct background checks, including reviewing court information and sex offender registries, before hiring school bus drivers. Title III of the United States Code mandates withholding funds from states that do not enforce background checks for school bus drivers. If a state does not require employers to conduct thorough background checks, including reviewing court records and sex offender registries, the Secretary will withhold 10% of the apportioned amount. Additionally, funds withheld will not be available for apportionment to that state and will expire. Title IV introduces the School Bus Seat Belt Demonstration Program. The Secretary of Transportation may award grants to States for a school bus seat belt program to purchase or equip type 1 school buses with lap/shoulder seat belts. States must submit an application with specific assurances, including compliance with certain regulations and a list of selected educational agencies to receive the seat belt equipped buses. The State selects agencies to receive school buses with seat belts, requiring local educational agencies to develop plans for seat belt usage and safety education. Grants must be sufficient for program requirements, funded using specific sources. The term \"type 1 school bus\" refers to a school bus weighing over 10,000 pounds. Within a year of this Act's enactment, the State must report to the Secretary on the effectiveness of the lap/shoulder seat belt program in local educational agencies, including student seat belt usage and impact on school bus seating capacity. NHTSA Study under Title V is mandated by SEC. 501. The National Highway Traffic Safety Board will conduct a study on the effects of illegal passing of school buses, including a pilot program with additional technologies, enforcement schemes, and performance standards for school buses. The National Highway Traffic Safety Board will conduct a study on the impact of illegal passing of school buses, including the use of additional technologies and driver training. A report will be submitted to Congress with recommendations for changes to laws and regulations to prevent and enforce illegal school bus passing."
