    "title": "AB 1689",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Legislature of California recognizes the importance of service learning in improving educational performance and character development of pupils. Research studies show that quality service learning programs lead to increased academic achievement in students. Pupils benefit from service learning by reducing dropout rates, improving attendance, developing civic responsibility, accepting cultural diversity, and increasing self-esteem and social competence. This act aims to promote volunteer service among students for positive outcomes. Senior pupils engaged in volunteer work have higher civics assessment scores. Service learning partnerships improve community attitudes towards youth. Schools supporting service learning have positive relationships with the community. Section 51221.1 is added to the Education Code to promote volunteer service among students. The Superintendent will develop curriculum standards for courses with a service learning component to meet requirements. Consultation with various stakeholders will ensure diverse representation in the development process. The Superintendent will submit proposed curriculum standards to the state board by March 1, 2018, for review. The state board must adopt or reject curriculum standards with a service learning component by July 1, 2018. If adopted, the standards will be implemented by school districts starting in the 2018-19 school year. If rejected, the state board must provide written explanations for the decision. In grades 9 to 12, a pupil must complete specific coursework to receive a high school diploma, including courses in English, mathematics, science, and social studies. In grades 9 to 12, students must complete coursework in various subjects to earn a high school diploma. This includes courses in English, mathematics, science, and social studies. Additionally, students must also take courses in visual or performing arts, foreign language (including American Sign Language), physical education, and other requirements set by the school district. Starting with the class of 2021-22, one course must include a service learning component. Service learning is a method where pupils learn through active participation in community service that meets community needs and fosters civic responsibility. It is integrated into the academic curriculum and includes structured time for reflection. The governing board of the school district oversees this program. The governing board of the school district, along with parents, administrators, teachers, and students, will establish alternative methods for students to complete the required course of study. This may include practical demonstrations, work experience, career technical education classes, independent study, and credits from postsecondary institutions. Graduation requirements and alternative study options will be accessible to students, parents, and the public. The section outlines that completion of a career technical education course meeting specific requirements before a certain date will fulfill the necessary criteria. It also states that the section will become effective when another related section becomes inoperative. Additionally, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the act imposes state-mandated costs, reimbursement will be provided to local agencies and school districts."
