The Act, known as the \"Special Criminal Contempt of Congress Procedures Act of 2009,\" applies if a current or former Executive branch officer violates a specific statute. Upon House of Representatives' finding of a violation, the Speaker certifies it to the US attorney for grand jury action. If the Department of Justice declines prosecution or no action is taken within 30 days, a Special Counsel may be appointed. If a grand jury does not return an indictment based on the violation alleged in the certification, the Chief Judge of the district will appoint a special counsel. The Attorney General must inform the court and the House if no indictment is returned within 30 days. The Speaker of the House or any interested party can suggest the appointment of a special counsel if circumstances arise after the 30-day period. SEC. 3 outlines the appointment, qualifications, prosecutorial jurisdiction, and administrative matters related to the special counsel. The Chief Judge appoints a special counsel with prosecutorial experience to investigate and prosecute violations, conspiracies, and related offenses. A special counsel appointed under this Act has full power and independent authority to exercise prosecutorial functions and powers within their jurisdiction, except in matters requiring the Attorney General's personal action. The special counsel must comply with Department of Justice policies unless it conflicts with the Act's purposes. The special counsel appointed under this Act must comply with Department of Justice policies, including those related to national security and classified material. They receive a salary equivalent to the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia and can appoint up to 12 staff members. The Department of Justice covers all expenses for the special counsel's office.

The Department of Justice covers all expenses for the special counsel's office. The Attorney General shall submit an annual report to Congress on amounts paid for expenses of investigations and prosecutions by the special counsel, while each special counsel must also report annually to Congress on their activities, including progress on investigations and justifying costs. SEC. 4. REMOVAL OF SPECIAL COUNSEL. A special counsel can only be removed from office by the Attorney General for good cause, physical or mental disability, or any condition that impairs their duties. If removed, a report must be submitted to the Chief Judge and Congress. The special counsel can seek judicial review of the removal, and may be reinstated or granted relief by the court. Upon removal, a replacement can be appointed. Upon removal of a special counsel, the Chief Judge appoints a replacement to continue their functions. SEC. 5. TERMINATION OF SPECIAL COUNSEL'S AUTHORITY. The special counsel's authority shall cease two years after appointment, extendable by the Chief Judge for one year for good cause. Good cause includes delays caused by uncooperative witnesses and the need for participation in appellate proceedings. The Chief Judge or Attorney General may terminate the special counsel's office at any time. The special counsel's investigation and prosecutions must be completed or substantially completed for the Department of Justice to take over. SEC. 6 amends Section 102 of the Revised Statutes to increase the penalty for contempt of Congress to a fine of up to $1,000,000 or imprisonment for up to 2 years, or both. SEC. 7 states that this Act will take effect on January 20, 2009."
