The Constitution does not specify the number of Justices required, historically Congress has set the number at nine. Only six Justices are needed for a quorum. The Constitution does not specify the number of Justices required, historically Congress has set the number at nine. Only six Justices are needed for a quorum. The President's prerogatives under the Appointments Clause are unclear, with the Obama Administration believing the President has a constitutional obligation to nominate and appoint a Supreme Court Justice when there is a vacancy. The Appointments Clause states that the President \"shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint ... judges of the Supreme Court.\" Courts have generally interpreted the word \"shall\" as imposing a mandatory obligation. The Supreme Court has not clarified when the President needs to act on vacancies, giving the President significant discretion. The Senate's role in the Appointments Clause is less clear, as it does not specify when or how the Senate must give its advice and consent for judicial appointments. The Supreme Court has not fully interpreted the terms \"advice\" and \"consent\" in the Appointments Clause, leading to uncertainty about the Senate's role in presidential appointments. There is disagreement in the legal community on how the Senate should provide its advice and consent, with past methods including committee hearings and floor votes. The Senate's role in presidential appointments is a topic of debate. Some believe the Senate has an active duty to consider nominees, while others argue there is no obligation to act once a nomination is made. The interpretation of the terms \"advice\" and \"consent\" in the Appointments Clause remains unclear, leading to differing opinions on the Senate's constitutional obligations. The President nominates a new Justice, with debates on the Senate's role in the nomination process. Some Senators believe it is up to the Senate to decide how to handle advice and consent. Disputes between the President and Senate may be resolved through negotiation. The Constitution's Recess Appointments Clause gives the President power to fill vacancies during recess. The President can fill vacancies during Senate recess by granting temporary commissions, but the legality of appointing Article III judges through recess appointments remains uncertain. Some courts argue that the Recess Appointments Clause includes filling judicial vacancies, citing a case where President George W. Bush appointed a judge during a Senate recess. However, there is tension between this interpretation and the requirement of \"good behaviour\" for judges in Article III. The tension between Article III and the Recess Appointments Clause arises from the issue of appointing Article III judges during Senate recess. The Supreme Court's refusal to review Evans raised doubts about the Eleventh Circuit's decision. The President can make temporary appointments using the Recess Appointments Clause, but the Senate must be in recess for at least 10 days for it to be valid. Presidential nominations under the Appointments Clause expire at the end of the congressional term. The President can re-nominate a Supreme Court nominee who was previously rejected or not voted on by the Senate. Cases can be reheard by the Supreme Court if parties petition for a rehearing after an adverse ruling or denial of review. A majority of the Court must grant the petition for rehearing. The Supreme Court may order cases to be reheard if they cannot resolve them before the summer recess, typically at the request of a Justice who concurred in the judgment. For example, the Court decided to rehear three cases after Chief Justice Rehnquist's death but before the vacancy was filled."
