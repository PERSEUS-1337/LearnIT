    "content": "In the context of the controversy surrounding the renewal of China's most-favored-nation (MFN) status, it is important to note that historically, the specific MFN issue involved is tariffs rather than the general MFN treatment. The MFN status in question is limited to nondiscriminatory tariff treatment of China, applying the same concessional customs duty rates agreed to in reciprocal negotiations with other trading partners. The United States has applied this MFN tariff treatment as a statutory policy since 1934, with modifications made in 1951. The Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951 required the President to suspend MFN tariff treatment of the Soviet Union and countries in the Sino-Soviet bloc. President Truman suspended China's MFN status in 1951 and Tibet's in 1952. Restoration of MFN status to a suspended country required specific law since 1962, until the Trade Act of 1974 provided authority for temporary restoration to \"nonmarket economy\" countries. The procedure for temporarily restoring MFN status to an NME country involves concluding a bilateral trade agreement with reciprocal MFN status and meeting freedom-of-emigration requirements. This can be achieved through a presidential determination or waiver. In 1979, President transmitted a trade agreement with China, granting a Jackson-Vanik waiver, which was approved by Congress in 1980. The Jackson-Vanik waiver agreement with China was approved by Congress in 1980 and entered into force on February 1, 1980. The agreement includes the grant of Most Favored Nation (MFN) status and requires triennial extensions and compliance with the Jackson-Vanik amendment for continuation. Termination can occur with a 30-day notice before the expiration of any 3-year term. The Jackson-Vanik waiver agreement with China, approved in 1980, requires triennial extensions and compliance with the Jackson-Vanik amendment for continuation. The agreement is renewed if a satisfactory balance of concessions is maintained, and the President determines reciprocity in tariff reductions. The most recent extension was through January 31, 2001. The renewal procedure for the overall waiver authority and specific China waiver requires the President's recommendation by June 3 annually. The extension is automatic unless disapproved by a joint resolution, with a prescribed fast-track procedure for consideration. The renewal procedure for the overall waiver authority and specific China waiver requires the President's recommendation by June 3 annually. The resolution must be approved by August 31, with a 20-hour debate divided equally between supporters and opponents. Congressional opposition to China's MFN status has increased, but legislative action to disapprove it has been consistently unsuccessful. The controversy in Congress has shifted towards granting China unconditional and permanent most-favored-nation status. Public opposition to this is partly due to a misunderstanding of the term. Legislation was enacted to replace \"most-favored-nation treatment\" with \"normal trade relations\" in all statutes. China's MFN status could be withdrawn through direct legislation, specific means provided in the Trade Act of 1974, or by the President's action. Termination of the agreement could also lead to the loss of MFN status. MFN status for China could be terminated through direct legislation, actions specified in the Trade Act of 1974, or by the President. Congress has attempted to restrict China's MFN status in the past, particularly in the area of human rights, but none of these measures have become law. In 1993, the President extended China's waiver for another year. In mid-1993, the President extended China's waiver for another year but also set specific additional conditions for the extension, including compliance with human rights agreements, release of political prisoners, and protection of Tibet's heritage. The President extended China's waiver in mid-1993 with additional conditions related to human rights, political prisoners, and Tibet's heritage. In response, China denounced the action but U.S. officials were tasked with ensuring China's compliance with trade practices and nonproliferation commitments. The linking of China's MFN status to human rights was abandoned in mid-1994 when President Clinton renewed the China waiver. In mid-1994, President Clinton renewed China's waiver based solely on compliance with the freedom-of-emigration requirement of the Jackson-Vanik amendment. Legislative attempts to disapprove the renewal or impose broader human rights conditions failed in the 104th Congress. Various bills proposing different conditions for China's waiver also did not pass. In the 105th Congress, joint resolutions were introduced to disapprove the mid-year renewals of the waiver authority for China's MFN status, but they failed to be enacted. No specific legislation was introduced to withdraw China's MFN status, although proposals were made regarding goods produced by the People's Liberation Army. Additionally, a bill requiring quarterly adjustments of U.S. tariffs on imports from China could have impacted China's MFN status. In the 106th Congress, legislation was introduced but not passed to require prior congressional approval for U.S. support of China's admission to the WTO. The President renewed the 1979 trade agreement with China for three years. Congressional action on China's MFN status reflected the ongoing debate on China's admission to the WTO, with measures introduced to prohibit U.S. support without legislative approval. The proposed legislation in the 106th Congress aimed to require congressional approval for U.S. support of China's WTO admission. It also included measures to withdraw from the WTO if China joined without U.S. support, which would have had serious consequences for U.S.-China trade relations and international trade leadership. Additionally, the \"snap-back\" provision in the China Market Access and Export Opportunities Act of 1999 would have increased U.S. duty rates on Chinese imports if China did not provide adequate trade benefits or progress towards WTO membership. The criteria for continuing China's MFN status is compliance with freedom-of-emigration requirements, which is no longer a practical obstacle. Opponents of MFN status cite China's human rights violations, unfair trade practices, market access barriers, trade deficit, noncooperation in nonproliferation efforts, and lack of transparency as reasons to deny MFN status. China's uncooperative attitude in weapons and nuclear nonproliferation, alleged illegal Chinese donations to the Democratic National Committee, and nuclear espionage are key issues. Supporters of China's MFN status argue for resolution through negotiations and consultations, especially in ongoing trade talks for China's accession to the World Trade Organization. They believe withdrawing MFN status would increase friction, hinder dialogue, exacerbate human rights issues, and have adverse economic consequences. The withdrawal of China's MFN status would result in significant duty increases on 95% of U.S. imports from China, totaling $99,580.5 million in 2000. The termination of China's MFN status would lead to substantial cost increases for imports from China due to differences in duty rates. The average trade-weighted MFN duty rate on all imports from China in 2000 was 3.8%, which would have been around 45% without MFN treatment. Termination of China's MFN status would increase importers' costs by over one-third, mostly between 25% and 65%, for products that accounted for 67.0% of all U.S. imports from China in that year. The data shows a larger concentration of China's exports to the United States in duty-free or low-rate products, accounting for 36.5% and 26.0% of total imports, respectively. The termination of China's NTR status is likely to substantially change the trade pattern of articles imported from China. The termination of China's NTR status is expected to lead to a significant shift in sourcing to other countries or domestic suppliers, resulting in higher costs for importers and consumers. This restructuring would likely increase costs due to higher non-NTR duties on low-priced imports from China, leading to higher prices for goods like clothing, footwear, electronics, and toys. China's termination of NTR status will impact the supply of electrical and electronic products, toys, and other goods to the U.S. market. This could lead to higher costs and reduced availability, disproportionately affecting lower-income consumers. The decrease in demand for Chinese imports would have a substantial adverse effect on China's economy, particularly in the southern provinces heavily reliant on exports. Additionally, Hong Kong would also be negatively impacted as a port of transit. Hong Kong's opposition to China's MFN status withdrawal is due to its economic ties as a port of transit for China's exports to the US. The reversion to China's sovereignty has not changed its international trade status. The withdrawal of China's MFN status would also affect other major investors in South China like Taiwan, Japan, and the US. The potential loss of U.S. exports to China could be significant, impacting grain, power generating machinery, aircraft, and fertilizer products. Overall U.S. economic relations with China, including investment and establishment of American businesses, would also be adversely affected. Denying China's MFN status would go against Congress's intent to normalize trade relations with China. Denial of China's MFN status would need to consider the 1979 U.S.-China trade agreement, which allows for termination with a 30-day notice. The agreement also allows for suspension if a party lacks the legal authority to fulfill its obligations. This provision could apply to MFN treatment if the waiver authority is withdrawn under the Jackson-Vanik amendment. The MFN treatment towards China could be suspended if the waiver authority is withdrawn under the Jackson-Vanik amendment or by a specific newly enacted statute. Another provision (Article IX) allows for actions to protect security interests. China's pending WTO membership obligates the US to provide unconditional MFN treatment as per GATT 1994. China's negotiations for WTO accession, including a bilateral trade agreement with the United States, intensified before Premier Zhu Rongji's visit in 1999. An agreement on market access was reached, but other key differences were temporarily suspended after NATO's accidental bombing. The bilateral negotiations between China and the United States were temporarily suspended after NATO's accidental bombing of China's embassy in Belgrade. However, negotiations resumed and a comprehensive bilateral agreement was successfully concluded on November 15, 1999. Some unresolved issues are being negotiated multilaterally with the WTO, including China's accession. The U.S. Congress has introduced measures requiring statutory approval for U.S. support of China's accession to the WTO. Violating U.S. obligations under the GATT could occur if the current U.S. policy towards China's MFN treatment is changed upon China's accession. The U.S. could violate GATT obligations if it changes China's MFN status upon accession. China could bring the issue to the WTO Dispute Settlement Body. To avoid violation, the U.S. could use WTO Article XIII to not apply multilateral agreements with China before approval. Reciprocal application of other WTO provisions could be achieved through amending the bilateral agreement. The focus of the congressional China MFN debate has shifted from annual renewals to granting China permanent unconditional MFN/NTR status, which could violate GATT obligations. The U.S. could use WTO Article XIII to avoid violation by not applying multilateral agreements with China before approval. Reciprocal application of other WTO provisions could be achieved through amending the bilateral agreement. The shift in the congressional China MFN debate is towards granting China permanent unconditional MFN/NTR status due to its imminent WTO membership. Denial of permanent NTR treatment by the US would hinder reciprocal application of WTO and bilateral agreements. Legislation was passed in the 106th Congress to authorize the President to terminate Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974. The President authorized the termination of Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 for China and extended permanent nondiscriminatory treatment. Legislation was introduced in Congress to grant China permanent NTR status in line with its WTO accession terms. The bills in Congress aim to grant China permanent NTR status in line with its WTO accession terms, with provisions for product-specific remedial action against import surges from China for 12 years. The bipartisan proposal in H.R. 4444 addresses concerns about import surges from China by implementing special anti-surge provisions. The bill also includes measures to monitor China's human rights, compliance with WTO commitments, and anti-slave-labor statute enforcement. The House passed H.R. 4444 on May 24, 2000, and the Senate approved it on October 10, 2000. The legislation approves China's permanent normal trade relations but will only take effect once China accedes to the WTO. China's accession to the WTO was delayed due to a negative reaction in Congress and the public following a collision between a U.S. Navy plane and a Chinese fighter. Legislation was introduced to repeal nondiscriminatory trade treatment of China. On June 1, 2001, the President renewed China's Jackson-Vanik waiver for one year, as China's permanent NTR status will only come into effect after its accession to the WTO. Legislation was introduced to repeal the permanent NTR status granted to China, but no further action was taken in Congress. The Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee held a meeting on July 11, 2001. H.J.Res. 50 was reported adversely on July 18, 2001, and was defeated in the House on July 19, 2001. China's J-V waiver remains in force through July 2, 2002."
