    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Marine Ferry and High-Speed Marine Ferry Act.\" It includes findings related to marine transportation. The Congress recognizes that ferries play a crucial role in transportation, offering vital services for passengers and vehicles in areas with limited alternatives. Ferries provide a solution to capacity constraints in other transport modes, require less infrastructure investment, reduce single-occupancy vehicle travel, and offer flexibility in response to changing demands or emergencies. Ferry transportation is crucial for offering vital services in areas with limited transport alternatives. Private operators and local governments have successfully innovated ferry operations in urban areas. Technological advancements have enhanced the potential for high-speed marine vessels. The Department of Transportation emphasizes modes of transportation that promote clean air, reduced energy consumption, and cost-effective transportation. Ferry transportation is cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and unique. Ferry transportation is a vital component of the national transportation system that should be supported in applicable communities. The report on utilization potential is highlighted in Section 3. The Secretary of Transportation will conduct a study on ferry transportation in the United States and its possessions, identifying existing ferry operations, sources of funding, economic impact, and potential for high-speed ferry services. Additionally, the study will identify potential domestic ferry routes and gather information on those routes. The Secretary of Transportation will conduct a study on ferry transportation in the United States and its possessions, identifying potential domestic ferry routes and gathering information on those routes. The study will include locations, capacity estimates, capital costs, operating costs, economic impact, and potential for high-speed ferry services. The results of the study will be reported to the relevant committees in Congress within one year of the enactment of the Act. After conducting a study on ferry transportation, the Secretary of Transportation will meet with State and Municipal planning organizations to discuss the results and available resources for marine ferry service. Funding for the service will also be addressed. The Secretary of Transportation will authorize $18,000,000 annually for ferry operations providing daily transportation for workers and students residing on noncontiguous U.S. islands. Amendments are made to section 1064 of the Act (23 U.S.C. 129 note) regarding ownership and operation of transportation facilities. SEC. 6. LOAN GUARANTEES. The Secretary of Transportation may guarantee the payment of obligations for marine ferry operations in the US and its possessions, subject to specific standards and requirements. The guarantee is subject to applicable laws and regulations, with simplified application and compliance procedures provided by the Secretary. The Secretary will provide a simplified application process for guarantees and commitments. $7,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated annually for carrying out the provisions of this section. SEC. 7 amends title 46, United States Code, to include leasing for small passenger vessels, passenger vessels, or ferries. SEC. 8 focuses on marine high-speed ferry safety. The Coast Guard will review the International Code of Safety for High-Speed Craft for non-regulated high-speed vessels and provide recommendations to relevant committees. Section 8101(a) of title 46, United States Code, is amended to include manning requirements for high-speed passenger vessels. The Secretary of Transportation will set manning standards for high-speed passenger vessels in the US waters and exclusive economic zone, including crew duties, qualifications, training, and appropriate crew sizes. The Secretary of Transportation will establish manning standards for high-speed passenger vessels in US waters, including crew qualifications, training, emergency actions, simulator courses, cross-training, operational training periods, re-training intervals, and type rating certificate requirements for the master. The Secretary of Transportation will establish manning standards for high-speed passenger vessels in US waters, including crew qualifications, training, emergency actions, and type rating certificate requirements for the master and officers with operational roles. The standards will align with the International Code of Safety for High-Speed Craft, defining high-speed passenger vessels as per specific criteria. The Transportation Research Board will study high-speed marine ferry technology and report findings to relevant committees within a year of the enactment of this Act."
