    "content": "The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs administers programs to assist veterans in purchasing and rehabilitating homes, including guaranteeing home mortgages, providing direct loans, and offering grants and loans for housing adaptations. The report discusses legislative history and current operations of these programs, as well as funding for VA loan programs. The VA Loan Guaranty Program provides mortgage insurance for eligible veterans entering into mortgages with private lenders. VA-guaranteed loans are available for various types of dwellings, including homes with up to four units, single condominium units, and manufactured homes classified as real property. The program also offers financing for the purchase of a farm and farm residence. The report does not cover VA housing assistance for homeless veterans. For more information on this topic, refer to CRS Report RL34024, Veterans and Homelessness. The VA loan guaranty program was created as an alternative to cash bonuses for veterans returning from World War II. It helps veterans finance the purchase of homes, including manufactured homes and farms, by providing mortgage insurance. The program was part of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, which also included educational benefits and employment services for veterans. The VA loan guaranty program was established to assist unemployed veterans reintegrate into civilian life by providing benefits such as home, farm, or business loans. The guaranty was limited to 50% of the loan or $2,000, with an interest rate cap of 4%. Amendments later increased the maximum guaranty to $4,000, extended the maturity period to 25 years, and addressed program inefficiencies. The VA loan guaranty program has evolved over time to include all veterans who served on active duty from World War II onwards, with varying service requirements. Changes have been made to the amount of the guaranty, eligibility criteria, and uses of the loan guaranty. The program now covers refinancing, energy efficiency improvements, and the purchase of manufactured homes. The VA loan guaranty program has expanded over time to include all veterans who served on active duty from World War II onwards, with different service requirements. Eligibility extends to veterans, members of the Selected Reserve, and spouses of veterans who meet specific criteria. Spouses of veterans who died in action, of a service-connected disability, or are missing/captured are eligible for the VA loan guaranty. Underwriting criteria ensure financial capability for mortgage payments. The VA loan underwriting standards consider a veteran's income, expenses, and credit history to determine eligibility for a guaranteed loan. A veteran must meet requirements such as a debt-to-income ratio standard and residual income analysis. The debt-to-income ratio should not exceed 41%, with exceptions allowed if justified to the VA by the lender. Unreliable income sources like VA education benefits are not considered in the stable and reliable monthly income calculation. The VA Loan Guaranty Program does not require a specific credit score for veterans to qualify for a loan, but lenders must analyze credit history. Residual income test assesses if a veteran's income can cover living expenses beyond debt payments. Lenders must justify extending credit to borrowers with adverse credit history, which may disqualify them in certain situations. A previous foreclosure does not disqualify a borrower from obtaining a VA-guaranteed loan, but borrowers with foreclosed VA-guaranteed loans may need to repay the government for losses. Loan guarantees are available for purchasing, constructing, or improving a dwelling or farm residence. A dwelling is a building primarily used as a home, with no more than four single family units, one occupied by an eligible veteran. Physical presence is not required daily, but occupancy must be more than intermittent. The VA loan guaranty requires the property to be near the borrower's place of employment, with continuous presence in the community. A vacation home does not qualify, except for active duty situations where spouses or dependent children can occupy the property. Various types of housing qualify as a dwelling for VA loan guaranty purposes, including single condominium units and manufactured homes if the veteran owns the land and it is classified as real property. The VA loan guaranty can include the purchase of land for construction of a single-family home or placement of a manufactured home. Eligible veterans can also get a guaranteed loan for housing construction, with funds placed in an escrow account and paid out as construction progresses. A VA inspector ensures the construction meets VA minimum property requirements and appraised value before issuing the loan guaranty. The VA loan guaranty can be used for purchasing a property that requires significant work, with major systems being safe and structurally sound. Improvements costs are factored into the loan amount, and energy efficiency improvements are limited to $6,000. The VA loan guaranty can cover improvements such as solar heating, insulation, and furnace replacement for manufactured housing. There are two ways in which manufactured housing is classified and guaranteed under the law. Despite flexibility in the program, the VA has not guaranteed new manufactured housing. The VA has not guaranteed new manufactured housing loans under Section 3712 since 1996. Manufactured housing is defined as a movable dwelling unit designed for year-round occupancy by a single family, with permanent eating, cooking, sleeping, and sanitary facilities. Double-wide manufactured homes are designed for occupancy by one family and can consist of two or more units intended to be joined together horizontally or have sections that unfold along the entire length of the unit. The Section 3710 guaranty for manufactured homes requires permanent affixation to a lot and classification as real property under state law. This involves placing the home on a foundation that meets local building codes, potentially connecting to utilities, and owning the land. Congress created this guaranty in 1970 to assist Vietnam veterans in affording homes. The President's Committee on the Vietnam Veteran recommended including mobile homes as eligible properties for loan guaranty due to rising costs of conventional homes. Manufactured housing loans under Section 3712 have shorter mortgage terms and are often financed with chattel mortgages. The VA offers loan guaranty for manufactured housing with differences in mortgage terms, maximum loan amounts, and fees compared to conventional housing. However, the Section 3712 loan has not been popular due to higher interest rates, down payment requirements, and appraisal standards. Veterans can use the loan guaranty to refinance existing loans to reduce interest rates. The VA offers loan guaranty for refinancing existing loans to reduce interest rates for eligible veterans. Refinancing options include interest rate reduction refinancing loans (IRRRL) or cash-out refinancings. Veterans can also refinance from adjustable-rate to fixed-rate loans without requiring a lower rate. A veteran can refinance from an adjustable-rate loan to a fixed-rate loan through an Interest Rate Reduction Refinancing Loan (IRRRL) without needing a lower rate. The new loan amount cannot exceed the original loan balance plus closing costs, and the term cannot exceed the original loan term by more than 10 years. Energy efficiency improvements can be included in the IRRRL, and no occupancy requirement is needed after refinancing. No appraisal or new underwriting is required, and closing costs can be financed. A veteran can also refinance without restrictions through a cash-out refinance, allowing for additional funds to be taken out against the property's value. Unlike an IRRRL, a cash-out refinance requires the veteran to occupy the property as their home, undergo an appraisal, credit check, and underwriting. Cash from the refinancing can be used for any approved purpose, including property improvements. Unlike an IRRRL, a cash-out refinance requires an appraisal, credit check, and underwriting. Congress has imposed limitations to prevent multiple refinancings within a short period to protect veterans from excessive fees and potential destabilization of Ginnie Mae loans. These limitations were established in the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018. The interest rate of the new loan must be lower than the previous loan by a certain percentage for fixed rates, and even lower for refinancing into an adjustable rate loan. All fees must be recouped within 36 months. Veterans must wait a specific period before getting another loan. VA-guaranteed loans make up a small percentage of mortgages in the US. During periods of falling interest rates, refinance loans increase in share among total VA loans. In the mid-2000s, VA-guaranteed purchase loans decreased due to looser lending standards on private mortgage loans, making them more attractive to veteran borrowers. Higher home prices during that time also made it challenging for veterans in high-cost areas to benefit from the loan guaranty. Legislation in 2008 expanded the coverage of the VA loan guaranty to include more properties. The VA loan guaranty did not cover high-cost properties exceeding $417,000 until legislation in 2008. There is no limit to the amount a veteran can borrow with a VA loan guaranty, but it typically covers at least 25% of the loan balance. The guaranty helps avoid the need for private mortgage insurance by covering what would be a down payment in a conventional mortgage. The VA loan guaranty covers a percentage of the loan amount to avoid the need for private mortgage insurance. The guaranty amount varies based on the loan balance, with different coverage categories. For loans above $144,000, the maximum guaranty is 25% of the loan amount. The VA loan \"maximum guaranty amount\" is 25% of the loan or $453,100 for single-family homes, with a limit of $679,650 in high-cost areas. The guaranty amount is the same for 2-4 unit housing as for single units. If the mortgage exceeds the maximum amount, a veteran may need to cover the difference. The VA loan limit is $453,100 for single-family homes, with a maximum of $679,650 in high-cost areas like Alaska, Hawaii, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam. Veterans may need to make a down payment equal to 25% of the amount over the loan limit to qualify for the loan. In high-cost areas like Alaska, Hawaii, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam, the loan limit can exceed $1 million. VA loans are securitized through Ginnie Mae, which may secure \"high balance loans\" exceeding the $453,100 conforming loan limit. The VA loan requires at least 25% of the principal balance to be guaranteed or covered by a down payment. The term \"entitlement\" refers to the lifetime limit on loan insurance coverage for veterans. The statute limits a veteran's entitlement to $36,000 or the maximum guaranty amount for loans exceeding $144,000. The VA loan entitlement limits a veteran's loan insurance coverage to $36,000 or the maximum guaranty amount for loans exceeding $144,000. Unused entitlement cannot be used to purchase more than one home at a time, but it can be restored in certain circumstances, such as when a veteran sells a property or it is destroyed. The VA loan entitlement can be restored in certain circumstances, such as when a property is sold or destroyed. Entitlement is restored when a loan is paid off in full, a loss on the loan is repaid, or the VA is released from liability. If a veteran pays off a VA-guaranteed loan but has not sold the property, a one-time restoration of entitlement may be done for the purchase of another property. If available entitlement is less than 25% of the loan, a down payment may be required to make up the difference. The FHA loan insurance program and VA loan guaranty program both provide borrowers with government promises to reimburse lenders in case of default on mortgages. Despite similar purposes, the programs differ in specifics such as coverage amount, borrower fees, loan processing, and terms. VA borrowers must meet service requirements, and if available entitlement is less than 25% of the loan, a down payment may be required. The VA loan guaranty covers only a portion of the mortgage loan in case of default, while FHA insurance covers 100% of the loan amount. Veteran borrowers in the VA program do not pay upfront fees or annual premiums, and are not required to make a down payment. Borrowers in the FHA program pay upfront fees and annual premiums based on the loan amount and loan-to-value ratio. The VA loan guaranty does not require a specific credit score from a borrower, while FHA requires a credit score of at least 500. Fees charged at closing are more restricted for VA loans compared to FHA loans. The VA loan guaranty program does not require a specific credit score from a borrower, while FHA mandates a credit score of at least 500. VA-approved appraisers are selected by the VA, while FHA appraisers are chosen by the lender. Veterans entering FHA loans were initially given special terms, including higher maximum mortgages and exemption from a 3% cash down payment requirement. However, changes over time removed these benefits, with the FHA Downpayment Simplification Act in 2002 and the Housing and Economic Recovery Act in 2008 eliminating these provisions for veteran borrowers. The VA loan guaranty program exempts veterans from a 3% down payment requirement. VA offers direct loans to veterans, including specific programs for rural, disabled, and Native American veterans. Acquired and vendee loans are provided in cases of borrower default on guaranteed loans. The VA direct loan program was established for veterans who couldn't get mortgages from private lenders. It was meant as a last resort option and was expanded to include veterans in rural areas in 1958 and veterans with disabilities in 1970. Congress later specified that VA direct loans be made only for veterans with disabilities through the Specially Adapted Housing Program. The VA direct loan program was established for veterans who couldn't get mortgages from private lenders. It was expanded to include veterans in rural areas and those with disabilities. Congress enacted a direct loan program specifically to provide mortgage assistance for Native American veterans and other eligible groups. The VA direct loan program was expanded to include Native American veterans, who faced obstacles in obtaining housing assistance due to the unique nature of tribal land ownership. Tribal land, held in trust by the federal government, includes approximately 56 million acres, with 45 million for tribes and 11 million for individuals. Land cannot be encumbered or transferred without federal approval, posing challenges for mortgage arrangements. Similar issues exist in American Samoa and CNMI, where land ownership is restricted and transfers require government approval. The CNMI Constitution restricts land ownership to those of Northern Marianan descent, similar to tribal land restrictions. Congress enacted a program for Native American veterans to receive housing loans, included in the Veterans Home Loan Program Amendments of 1992. The Benefits Improvement Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-233) allows tribes to participate in the VA direct loan program by signing a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the VA. This MOU enables the transfer of a veteran borrower's leasehold interest in a property to a lender in case of default. The VA has MOUs with 98 tribes or Pacific Island territories, and has issued over 1,000 loans through the program for Native American veterans. The Direct Loan program for Native American veterans, established in 2006, has seen significant participation in Hawaii and the territories. Reasons for low lending to Native American veterans include low income, lack of infrastructure, and poor credit. The VA may intervene in cases of delinquency or default on guaranteed loans through Acquired Loans and Vendee Loans. The VA acquires properties from lenders in cases of veteran default on guaranteed loans and may enter into direct loans with purchasers. Between 50% and 85% of properties acquired are financed by the VA. After 2012, the VA stopped issuing vendee loans. Bundled vendee loans are sold to investors with VA guarantees for full and timely payments. The VA acquires properties from lenders in cases of veteran default on guaranteed loans and may enter into direct loans with purchasers. Between 50% and 85% of properties acquired are financed by the VA. The bundled loans appear in the VA budget as \"Guaranteed Loan Sales Securities.\" The number of acquired loans, vendee loans entered into, and vendee loans sold from FY1998 through FY2017 depend on borrower defaults, purchaser interest in foreclosed VA homes, and investor interest in VA securities. The vendee loan program suspension in 2003 and 2013 led to a decrease in vendee loans entered into and sold. The number of VA acquired loans has also fallen in recent years due to efforts on loan modification and other borrower assistance options. The VA and loan servicers focused on loan modification and other options to help borrowers keep their homes, reducing the need for the VA to acquire loans. Efforts increased in 2008 and thereafter, with new incentives offered for servicers to work with borrowers. VA loans are funded through congressional appropriations, borrower fees, proceeds from foreclosed properties, borrower payments, and penalties paid by lenders. Understanding how VA loans are funded includes how loans are accounted for in the federal budget. The cost of loan programs involves an upfront outlay of funds and recoupment through payments of principal, interest, fees, and penalties over the loan's lifetime. Government practice since 1992 is to determine the net present value of loans over their lifetime and record it in the budget when the loans are extended. This method helps in understanding how funds are appropriated for VA loans and reading VA budget documents. The VA loan programs receive discretionary and mandatory appropriations from Congress. Discretionary funds cover administrative expenses, while mandatory funding supports the loans themselves. Mandatory funding is expressed as a percentage of the total loan volume, known as the \"subsidy rate.\" This rate is included in the President's Budget Appendix for the Department of Veterans Affairs each year. The subsidy rate in the President's Budget Appendix for the Department of Veterans Affairs is based on the net present value of expected expenses and income for guaranteed loans. If expenses exceed income, the subsidy rate is positive, and the program receives funding. If income exceeds expenses, the subsidy rate is negative, and excess revenue is returned to the Treasury. The VA estimates individual subsidy rates annually as part of the budget process. The VA estimates subsidy rates for different types of loans annually as part of the budget process. Subsidy reestimates are made each year due to uncertainty in projecting cash flows, with additional funding available to cover any shortfalls. Factors affecting the subsidy rate include changes in interest rates. The VA estimates subsidy rates annually for different types of loans, considering factors like interest rate changes, borrower default rates, property management decisions, and fee discrepancies. Reestimates can lead to adjustments in mandatory funding needed for loan programs. Appropriations for VA loans are managed through the Veterans Housing Benefit Program Fund, with separate on-budget and off-budget accounts tracking funding inflows and outflows. The VA manages appropriations for direct and guaranteed loans through multiple accounts based on loan extension dates. Pre-1992 loans are in a housing liquidating account, while post-1992 loans are in direct and guaranteed loan financing accounts. Fees paid by borrowers support the costs of the programs, with fees based on factors like down payment amount. The VA manages appropriations for direct and guaranteed loans through multiple accounts based on loan extension dates. Fees may be waived for veterans with service-connected disabilities or surviving spouses. Veterans were not always charged fees as part of the loan guaranty transaction. In 1982, the VA started requiring veterans to pay a 0.5% fee on the principal balance of each loan to cover program costs. Despite objections, Congress implemented the fee as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1982. The fee was initially in effect from FY1983 through FY1985, with exemptions for veterans with service-connected disabilities. The VA implemented a 0.5% fee on veterans' loans in 1982, which was later raised to 1% in 1984. Congress then established a more complex fee schedule based on down payment amount and loan type in 1989. These VA loan fees have remained unchanged since 2004 and are currently extended until September 30, 2027. The VA generates income from acquired loans, vendee loans, and loan sales to investors, but this income may not always cover losses. The Specially Adapted Housing Program provides grants to veterans and servicemembers with certain service-connected disabilities to assist them in constructing, purchasing, or remodeling homes to fit their needs. Introduced in 1948, the program initially targeted veterans with paralysis in the legs or lower body, with grants being the majority of funds distributed. The Specially Adapted Housing Program, introduced in 1948, provides grants to veterans and active duty servicemembers with certain service-connected disabilities for home construction, purchase, or remodeling. Congress expanded eligibility over the years to include various disabilities and benefits, such as loans and grants. Two grant programs are available: the Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) Grant for mobility impairments and the Special Housing Adaptation (SHA) Grant for blindness or loss of use. The Specially Adapted Housing Program provides grants to veterans with service-connected disabilities for home construction, purchase, or remodeling. The program includes two grant programs: the Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) Grant for mobility impairments and the Special Housing Adaptation (SHA) Grant for blindness or loss of use of hands. Veterans with severe burn injuries are eligible for both types of adapted housing. Grant limits are higher for the first category of adapted housing. Veterans can use the SAH and SHA grants up to three times, as long as total funding does not exceed grant limits. The original law authorized grants of up to $10,000 for veterans to build or purchase homes with adapted features. The Specially Adapted Housing Program provides grants to veterans with service-connected disabilities for home construction, purchase, or remodeling. The program includes two grant programs: the Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) Grant for mobility impairments and the Special Housing Adaptation (SHA) Grant for blindness or loss of use of hands. Veterans with severe burn injuries are eligible for both types of adapted housing. Grant limits were increased to accommodate a broader range of mobility impairments for veterans and servicemembers with permanent and total service-connected disabilities. Veterans and servicemembers with specific disabilities, such as loss of upper extremities, severe burn injuries, or limitations in lower extremities, may qualify for the Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) Grant. The grant is available for home construction, purchase, or remodeling to accommodate their mobility impairments. The program includes two grant programs: SAH for mobility impairments and SHA for blindness or loss of use of hands. Grant limits have been increased to support a broader range of disabilities for veterans and servicemembers with permanent and total service-connected disabilities. In 2013, VA regulations expanded the Specially Adapted Housing Program to include veterans with service-connected ALS. The program also covers veterans needing home modifications, known as the Special Housing Adaptation Grant. This expansion was driven by concerns for blind veterans who previously did not qualify unless they also had a lower extremity disability. In 1980, Congress created a new category in the Specially Adapted Housing Program for blind veterans with severe visual impairment or loss of both hands. Grant amounts for these veterans were initially limited to $5,000, lower than those for veterans with mobility issues. The program has since been expanded to include veterans with severe burns. The Special Housing Adaptation Grant has been expanded to include veterans with severe burn injuries. Eligibility includes veterans with blindness in both eyes, loss of both hands, or severe burn injuries. Veterans may use the grant to modify homes of family members. The Temporary Residence Adaptation (TRA) grant, established in 2006, allows veterans and servicemembers to modify family members' homes for temporary living situations. This grant was created to assist injured veterans returning from Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom who did not have their own homes. The Temporary Residence Adaptation (TRA) grant, established in 2006, allows veterans and servicemembers to modify family members' homes for temporary living situations. The program is authorized through December 31, 2022 (P.L. 112-154). The grant limits were increased over the years, with the most recent limits set at $63,780 for Section 2101(a) grants and $12,756 for Section 2101(b) grants. The VA Secretary adjusts the levels annually based on a residential home cost-of-construction index. In FY2019, the levels were set at $85,645 for Section 2101(a) grants and $17,130 for Section 2101(b) grants. The TRA grants for veterans and servicemembers were initially set at $14,000 for Section 2101(a) and $2,000 for Section 2101(b) recipients. In August 2012, the limits were increased to $28,000 and $5,000 respectively. The maximum TRA grants are now $37,597 and $6,713 in FY2019, with adjustments made annually based on a cost of construction index. Veterans may qualify for multiple housing grants under the Specially Adapted Housing Program. A veteran may qualify for multiple housing grants under the Specially Adapted Housing Program, with grants used in one component counting against the maximum grant for another component. Grants can be restored if a previous adapted home is destroyed or substantially damaged. The Specially Adapted Housing Program allows veterans to receive funds to acquire another suitable home if their previous adapted home is destroyed or substantially damaged in a disaster. The assistance provided does not count towards a veteran's maximum benefit and is based on the cost to repair or replace the property. Funding for the program is mandatory and provided through the Readjustment Benefits portion of the Veterans. The Specially Adapted Housing Program provides grants to veterans and servicemembers based on eligibility rather than specific amounts appropriated. The number and dollar amount of grants nearly doubled from FY2007 to FY2008 and have remained high since then, attributed to increased need from veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan and broadened eligibility criteria. The Recovery Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-289) expanded grants for veterans, including active duty servicemembers, with severe burn injuries now eligible. Maximum grants increased to $60,000 for Section 2101(a) and $12,000 for Section 2101(b). Ownership interest in the property is required for maximum assistance. Allowable forms of ownership were limited, including fee simple interest, lease, cooperative interest of 50 years, or life estate through a revocable trust. Individuals on Native American trust land may face challenges. In 2010, the VA updated regulations to allow individuals living on Native American trust land or in certain territories to qualify for a Section 2101(a) grant with a life estate, long-term lease, tribe-VA lease, or beneficial interest in property outside the US. The Section 2101(b) grants provide eligible individuals with a meaningful right to occupy a housing unit as a residence. Veterans or servicemembers may qualify for the full grant even if they do not have ownership interests. Delinquencies and foreclosures for all loan categories increased during the recession, with the foreclosure rate peaking at 4.64% in the fourth quarter of 2010. During the recession, delinquency and foreclosure rates for VA-guaranteed loans were lower than FHA loans and overall rates. The VA attributed this to factors like underwriting practices and a robust default servicing program. Subprime loans' popularity before the recession may have led veterans away from VA loans. Options are available for veterans facing delinquency. The VA Loan Guaranty Program offers servicer workouts to prevent foreclosure by incentivizing agreements with delinquent borrowers. Efforts include repayment plans, forbearance agreements, loan modifications, compromise sales, or deeds in lieu of foreclosure, introduced in 2008. Lenders can modify loans without prior VA approval if the borrower's default reasons are resolved. On December 20, 2011, the VA published a final rule in the Federal Register modifying regulations to encourage loan modifications. Lenders can request VA approval to modify loans if certain conditions are not met. Maximum interest rates for modified loans will be tied to Freddie Mac rates, and legal fees can be added to the loan balance. The VA may intervene if the servicer is unwilling to assist with loss mitigation efforts. The VA may intervene in loss mitigation efforts if the servicer is uncooperative or if loan servicing is inadequate. The VA rarely purchases loans but may do so if delinquency was temporary and the veteran can resume payments. The Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) helps borrowers behind on mortgage payments by modifying loans to be affordable. VA loans are not part of HAMP, but loan servicers must still assess eligibility. The VA requires loan servicers to assess borrowers for \"HAMP-style\" modifications before foreclosure. Modifications can include reduced interest rates or principal forbearance to lower payments to 31% of income. VA-guaranteed loans are potentially eligible for modification, with no trial period and lasting interest rate reductions. In addition to increased foreclosures, the downturn in the economy resulted in situations where some borrowers may have mortgages that exceed the value of their homes, making it difficult to refinance. Borrowers who are current on their mortgage payments but owe more than their homes are worth may qualify for an interest rate reduction refinancing loan (IRRRL) through the VA. This loan does not require an appraisal, allowing lenders to refinance even if the loan exceeds the current property value. Under an agreement in March 2012, VA borrowers who are delinquent or underwater may be eligible for assistance from 5 large mortgage servicers. $25 billion was allocated for certain borrowers, with $17 billion for foreclosure prevention and $3 billion for underwater homeowners. Loans serviced by Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, or Ally Financial are eligible, as long as they were not purchased by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Additionally, $5 billion was awarded to states, including $1.5 billion in payments to borrowers who lost their homes to foreclosure. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) provides financial protections for active duty servicemembers, including home mortgage protections. It may assist veterans who entered into mortgages prior to active duty and are struggling with payments. The SCRA allows courts to stay proceedings if a lender takes action against a borrower during active duty or within nine months after. It also invalidates any foreclosure or home sale during this period. The SCRA invalidates foreclosures or home sales during active duty or within nine months after. Loan servicers may acquire the property at foreclosure sale and sell it to the VA based on property value and amount owed by the veteran borrower. The VA ensures not to spend more than the guaranteed loan amount and pays the lender's claim against the guaranty. If total indebtedness decreases, the guaranty is prorated. Since 2008, the number of homes with VA loans in foreclosure has increased significantly, reaching over 20,000 in each year except FY2013. The VA acquires foreclosed properties and aims to resell them, with an average time of six months between acquisition and sale in FY2016. Purchasers of these properties do not need to be veterans. The report discusses the disposition of property, specifically focusing on Direct Loans Resulting from Borrower Delinquency or Default (Acquired and Vendee Loans)."
