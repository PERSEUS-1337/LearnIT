    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Department of Veterans Affairs Mammography Quality Standards Act\" and it establishes mammography quality standards. The \"Department of Veterans Affairs Mammography Quality Standards Act\" requires that mammograms at Department facilities must be performed by accredited organizations meeting specific quality standards set by the Secretary in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Secretary ensures compliance with mammography standards through annual inspections of equipment and facilities in Department health care facilities. Inspections are consistent with those for certified facilities by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. State agencies cannot perform these inspections. Mammograms performed for the Department by non-Department facilities must meet quality standards. The Department ensures mammography standards compliance through annual inspections of equipment and facilities in Department health care facilities. Non-Department facilities must meet quality standards for mammograms. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must prescribe mammography quality standards within 120 days of either the Secretary of Health and Human Services setting standards or the enactment of this Act. The transition period allows for waivers during the implementation of these standards. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs may waive mammography quality standards requirements for Department facilities if deemed safe and accurate by the Under Secretary for Health. The transition period lasts six months, extendable by 90 days for Department facilities. The Under Secretary for Health can extend the transition period for Department facilities if access to mammography services would be significantly reduced without it. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must submit an implementation report to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs within 180 days. The report must be submitted within 180 days after the Secretary prescribes the quality standards."
