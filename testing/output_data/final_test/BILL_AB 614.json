    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 1254.5 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to specify that the treatment of eating disorders involves various components and should be provided only in state licensed hospitals. The definition of \"eating disorders\" is based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The Health and Safety Code is amended to allow the department to create rules and regulations for implementing the chapter. All regulations related to licensed health facilities adopted by certain state departments before December 31, 1973, will remain in effect until changed or repealed. The Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development will establish building standards for health facility physical plants. The building standards for outpatient services of licensed health facilities shall not be more restrictive than those for clinics and facilities licensed under Chapter 1. The licensing standards for outpatient services in freestanding physical plants of health facilities shall not be more restrictive than those for clinics and facilities licensed under Chapter 1. All health care professionals providing services in authorized settings must be members of the medical staff of the health facility. The department has the authority to update references to health care standards without regulatory action when outdated standards are named in the California Code of Regulations. The department must post notice of proposed adoption of health care standards on its website for 45 days, notify stakeholders, submit notice to the Office of Administrative Law, and accept public comment for 30 days. If a public hearing is requested during the comment period, it must be held before adopting health care standards. If no hearing is requested, comments received during the public comment period will be considered before adoption. If public comments oppose proposed standards or if the named association no longer exists, the department will use the regulatory process for adoption. If no opposition is received, the department will update its website with the adopted standard and effective date. \"Freestanding physical plant\" refers to a building not attached to one providing inpatient services. No reimbursement required by this act as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions, as defined by the California Constitution."
