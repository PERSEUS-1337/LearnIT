It introduces a new part for the designation of amounts towards reducing the public debt. Every individual with adjusted income tax liability can designate up to 10 percent of their liability to reduce the public debt. This designation must be made when filing the tax return and is subtracted from the income tax liability. The amendments in this section apply to taxable years ending after the enactment date. A new section is added to the Internal Revenue Code for a Public Debt Reduction Trust Fund. The Public Debt Reduction Trust Fund is established in the Treasury of the United States, funded by appropriations and transfers designated for public debt reduction. The Secretary of the Treasury can use the funds to pay off or buy back federal government obligations, excluding certain specific funds. The Public Debt Reduction Trust Fund in the Department of Defense Military Retirement Fund cancels and retires obligations paid with fund amounts, prohibiting reissuance. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for the subchapter.

Additionally, there will be reports on sequestration to reduce the public debt.
