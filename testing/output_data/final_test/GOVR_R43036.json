    "content": "Many adults in the United States receive adult education services funded by the federal government under the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act. These services aim to improve literacy, numeracy, and English language skills for adults not enrolled in school. Instruction is provided at the secondary level and below, as well as English language training, with an average of 124 hours of instruction per student. The Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) provides adult education services funded by the U.S. Department of Education. In FY2013, $575 million was appropriated, with $554 million distributed to states for programs. AEFLA, enacted as Title II of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, replaced previous literacy acts. The report details the state grants program and its implementation, including data on providers and participants. The Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) replaced previous literacy acts and authorizes funding for adult education services. It aims to assist adults in becoming literate, obtaining skills for employment, supporting their children's education, and completing secondary education. AEFLA has been funded through annual appropriations since its expiration. The Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) authorizes funds for adult education activities, including services for individuals lacking basic skills, without a high school diploma, or unable to speak English. AEFLA specifies funding allocations for certain programs and distributes the remaining funds to states through formula grants. The Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) specifies funding allocations for adult education activities, including services for individuals lacking basic skills or a high school diploma. Section 211(b) of AEFLA outlines a two-step process for distributing state grant funds, with an initial allotment followed by a formula-based distribution based on each state's share of qualifying adults. States must also match their grants with 25% of adult education resources from non-federal sources. The Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) requires states to match their grants with 25% of adult education resources from non-federal sources. Non-federal matches may be cash or in-kind, with a minimum of 12% in outlying areas. AEFLA's provisions ensure states receive grants equal to at least 90% of the previous fiscal year's grant, and maintain effort by spending at least 90% of prior year's adult education expenses. Funding allocations include a set-aside for integrated English literacy and civics education services for limited-English-proficient populations. The EL-Civics grant funds are distributed to states based on recent immigration data. 65% is based on immigrants admitted for legal permanent residence in the 10 most recent years, and 35% is based on immigrants admitted in the three most recent years. States must competitively subgrant at least 82.5% of their allotment to local service providers. State allotment must be competitively subgranted to local service providers, with up to 10% for entities serving individuals in correctional facilities. Additionally, up to 12.5% can be allocated to state leadership activities. A maximum of 5% or $65,000 for administrative expenses is allowed. Recipients of local subgrants must use funds for adult education, family literacy, or English literacy programs. Eligible entities include educational agencies, community organizations, and nonprofits. AEFLA mandates states to consider specific factors when selecting local providers. AEFLA requires states to consider certain factors when selecting local subgrant recipients, focusing on serving high-need populations and reporting performance data. States must submit a five-year state plan outlining adult education needs, funded activities, evaluation measures, public participation, and comment processes. The state must develop a plan for public participation and comment in the state plan, program strategies for specific populations, integration of AEFLA-funded activities with other services, and ensure equitable access to funds. States can opt for a unified plan combining AEFLA requirements with other workforce development programs. Section 212 establishes a performance accountability system for grantees, tracking core indicators like literacy skill improvement in reading, writing, and speaking English. The AEFLA program focuses on improving literacy skills in reading, writing, and speaking English, numeracy, problem solving, and other literacy skills. States report performance data through the National Reporting System (NRS). Section 211(a) of AEFLA specifies set-asides for National Leadership Activities (NLA), including technical assistance and national research activities. The National Institute for Literacy (NIFL) receives 1.5% of the appropriation or $8 million for professional development and national research activities. NIFL operates under an interagency agreement between ED, DOL, and HHS to provide leadership in literacy, coordinate services, and serve as a resource for adult education programs. Additionally, 1.72% is allocated for WIA Title V Incentive Grants, available to states achieving superior performance in WIA programs. Since FY2009, the National Institute for Literacy (NIFL) has not received funding and some functions have been consolidated into National Leadership Activities. The set-aside for National Leadership Activities in appropriations legislation has exceeded 1.5% of AEFLA appropriations. AEFLA specifies requirements for state grants but leaves many decisions to states and localities. Program data from the NRS illustrates states' and localities' adult education services, providers, students, and outcomes. NRS data is reported by program year (PY), which runs nine months behind the fiscal year. AEFLA-funded adult education services are typically administered at the local level, with many states contributing beyond their required match. NRS data divides services into three categories: Adult Basic Education (ABE) for those below high school literacy, Adult Secondary Education (ASE) for those needing higher-level instruction. In PY2011-2012, 47% of adult education students were enrolled in ABE classes. In PY2011-2012, adult education services funded by AEFLA were divided into Adult Basic Education (ABE) for those below high school literacy and Adult Secondary Education (ASE) for high school level instruction. About 13% of students were in ASE, while 40% were in English literacy (EL) courses. There were significant variations in enrollment levels among states, with Nevada having 80% in EL courses and Louisiana with 81% in ABE courses. Eligible providers of AEFLA-funded services include public and private entities. In PY2011-2012, AEFLA-funded adult education services were provided by a combination of public and private entities. Local education agencies received the largest share of federal and state funding. Non-federal contributions to adult education activities are not fully captured in Table 1. AEFLA services are delivered by paid staff and volunteers, with local teachers being the largest personnel group in PY2011-2012. In PY2011-2012, adult education services were provided by public and private entities. Local teachers were the largest personnel group, with almost 85% being part-time or volunteers. Each state's adult education personnel varied, with Kentucky having 50% full-time teachers and Pennsylvania having over 70% volunteers. Data on AEFLA participants show characteristics vary by service type, with ASE students being younger and more white, while EL students are older and more Hispanic or Latino. The AEFLA program serves an older population with a higher concentration of Hispanic or Latino students. Grantees are required to track services, student outcomes, and educational gains. Data on participants' hours of attendance and educational progress are available, with progress defined by completing levels within the ABE, ASE, or EL tracks. States must also track outcomes related to employment, secondary degree completion, and postsecondary education. Data on participant outcomes regarding employment, secondary degree completion, and postsecondary education are somewhat limited compared to demographic and educational progress data. Follow-up outcomes are only tracked when a client states an objective beyond education, leading to a small portion of AEFLA participants stating follow-up objectives. Reasons for not stating an objective may include already attaining a goal, educational progress being the only goal, or choosing not to state a follow-up objective. Follow-up outcomes may be tracked through surveys in some cases. The available data on follow-up measures in Table 5 should be interpreted with caution due to limitations in tracking follow-up outcomes for AEFLA participants. Using this data to evaluate program efficacy may be difficult."
