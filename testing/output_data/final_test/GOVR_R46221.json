    "content": "The FDA must approve new drugs and biologics before they can be marketed. The approval process involves submitting a new drug application (NDA) demonstrating the drug's safety and effectiveness through clinical data. Developing a new drug can cost between $1 billion to $3 billion and take over twelve years for FDA approval. This lengthy and expensive process aims to ensure the safety and efficacy of new drugs. The Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 created a streamlined approval process for generic drugs, allowing them to file an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) based on FDA's prior approval of a reference listed drug (RLD). Biologics are derived from biological material and are distinct from drugs, requiring a separate approval process. Biological products are large, complex molecules produced through biotechnology in living systems. They require FDA approval through a biologics license application (BLA) to ensure safety, purity, and potency. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA) allows for an abbreviated approval process for biosimilar or interchangeable biologics. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA) allows for an abbreviated approval process for biosimilar or interchangeable biologics. Manufacturers must demonstrate biosimilarity to the reference product with no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity, and potency. Regulatory exclusivities are in place to balance competition and encourage innovation by limiting FDA's ability to approve generic drugs and biosimilars under certain circumstances. Patents grant exclusive rights to inventors to prevent others from using, selling, or importing their invention without permission. This exclusivity is necessary to incentivize inventors to create new technological innovations. Infringement of a patent can lead to legal consequences and monetary damages. Patents grant exclusive rights to inventors to prevent others from using, selling, or importing their invention without permission. This exclusivity incentivizes inventors to create new technological innovations. Competitors could freely copy inventions once marketed, reducing the incentive to create. Patents may lead to increased prices for goods or services they cover, as only the patent holder can use the patented process until it expires, allowing for higher prices. Patents are obtained by filing a patent application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), where a patent examiner evaluates the application for legal requirements. If granted, a patent typically lasts for twenty years from the filing date, with possible extensions for delays in examination. In the pharmaceutical field, patents protect drug products or medical devices. Patents granted by the PTO last for twenty years and can be extended for delays. In the pharmaceutical field, patents protect drug products or medical devices. Patent rights are separate from FDA regulatory exclusivities. Patents are enforced through lawsuits for infringement, leading to monetary damages and injunctions. Patents grant a negative right to prevent infringement, but do not give the holder the right to practice the invention. In the pharmaceutical industry, having a patent does not allow marketing without FDA approval. The PTO grants patents for inventions that meet requirements, such as a chemical for human disease treatment. Pharmaceutical product patents protect active ingredients. Patents on pharmaceutical products cover various features beyond the active ingredient, including formulations and methods of use. Primary patents on active ingredients are valuable but not always the most important for manufacturers. For biologics with naturally occurring active ingredients, patenting unaltered forms may not be possible due to patent-ineligible subject matter. Patents on pharmaceutical products cover various features beyond the active ingredient, including formulations, methods of use, manufacturing technologies, and other related chemicals. To receive a patent, the innovation must be new, useful, nonobvious, and adequately described in the patent application. Improvements on these technologies can also be patented, granting their own patent term. Improvements on patented technologies can also be patented, receiving their own patent term. The new version does not need to be \"better\" but must be new and nonobvious. Permission is required from both the original patent holder and the improvement patent holder. Specialized procedures exist for pharmaceutical patent disputes to encourage early resolution. The Hatch-Waxman Act governs the early resolution of disputes related to generic and biosimilar market entry by treating FDA applications as acts of patent infringement. This affects when these products can be marketed and when brand-name products face competition. The procedures vary based on whether the pharmaceutical is regulated as a drug or biologic. When a generic manufacturer files an ANDA, it must provide a certification for each patent listed in the Orange Book with respect to the referenced drug. The certifications include stating there is no patent information listed, the patent has expired, the date the patent will expire, or that the patent is invalid and/or not infringed. These certifications affect FDA's ability to approve the ANDA, with Paragraph (III) certification delaying approval until the patent expires, and Paragraph (IV) triggering specialized patent dispute procedures. The Hatch-Waxman Act outlines patent dispute procedures for generic drug applicants, including a 30-month stay if litigation occurs. The first generic to file a Paragraph (IV) certification can receive 180 days of marketing exclusivity. Biologics and biosimilars follow a different patent dispute resolution scheme under the BPCIA, where regulatory approval is not directly tied to patent disputes. No patent information needs to be listed in the original BLA for biologics. The BPCIA outlines a patent dispute resolution scheme for biosimilars, where no patent information needs to be listed in the original BLA. The \"patent dance\" process involves the biosimilar applicant providing information to the reference product sponsor for patent evaluation. This process helps in preparing and adjudicating claims of infringement. The BPCIA outlines a patent dispute resolution scheme for biosimilars, involving a \"patent dance\" process where the biosimilar applicant and reference product sponsor exchange information on relevant patents. Injunctive relief to compel participation in the patent dance is unavailable under federal law. Some patenting practices have been challenged under antitrust laws, which aim to protect and promote competition for lower prices. Antitrust law aims to prevent anticompetitive conduct and mergers that lead to market power. The Sherman Antitrust Act prohibits agreements in restraint of trade and monopolization. Certain pharmaceutical patenting practices have been challenged under these provisions, with Section 1 of the Sherman Act focusing on unreasonable restraints on trade. Some agreements are considered invalid per se, while others are illegal based on specific circumstances. Antitrust law prohibits agreements in restraint of trade unless falling within a per se illegal category. Courts use a \"rule-of-reason\" analysis to determine reasonableness. Per se illegal restraints have manifestly anticompetitive effects and include horizontal price fixing. Liability attaches without the need for proof of power, intent, or impact. The Rule-of-Reason Analysis is used to assess restraints that are not per se illegal. Courts analyze these restraints by looking at anticompetitive effects in the relevant market. The burden shifts from the plaintiff to the defendant to justify the challenged practice if anticompetitive effects are proven. The Rule-of-Reason Analysis is used to assess restraints that are not per se illegal. If a plaintiff alleges higher prices due to a restraint, the defendant must justify it. If no justification is provided, the plaintiff may prevail. However, if a procompetitive justification is shown, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to prove anticompetitive effects outweigh the procompetitive effects or could be achieved less restrictively. Courts may use a \"quick look\" analysis in some cases for a more abbreviated review. In the Rule-of-Reason Analysis, the Supreme Court allows for a sliding scale in assessing reasonableness, with the quality of proof varying based on circumstances. In cases where the anticompetitive nature of an agreement is clear, plaintiffs can establish a prima facie case without traditional market power evidence. Some courts use a modified burden-shifting approach in \"quick look\" cases to assess restraints likely to harm consumers. In the Rule-of-Reason Analysis, when a challenged restraint is deemed \"inherently suspect,\" the defendant can rebut the presumption by providing \"plausible reasons\" for the practice. If the defendant fails to do so, the plaintiff prevails. If the plaintiff shows that the restraint likely harms consumers, the evidentiary burden shifts to the defendant to prove otherwise. The burden shifts to the defendant to show that the restraint does not harm consumers or has procompetitive virtues that outweigh its burden. Monopolization under Section 2 of the Sherman Act is only illegal if accompanied by anticompetitive conduct, not for possessing monopoly power from superior products or business acumen. To establish a Section 2 violation, it must be proven that the defendant possessed monopoly power in the relevant market and acquired or maintained it using anticompetitive means. The FTC Act gives authority to combat unfair competition, including violations of the Sherman Act. Enforcement actions can be brought by the DOJ, FTC, or private parties. Investigations may lead to consent orders addressing anticompetitive practices. The FTC may issue a cease-and-desist order if an administrative proceeding finds a violation of anticompetitive practices by a company. Patent holders aim to use their rights fully, while critics question the appropriateness of these practices. Critics argue that drug innovators engage in harmful patent practices, such as evergreening, to extend patent protection. The number of patents per pharmaceutical product has been increasing since the enactment of Hatch-Waxman in 1984, with an average of 2.7 patents listed for each product in the Orange Book. Profitable products may have even more patents protecting them. One recent study found that pharmaceutical manufacturers obtain an average of seventy-one patents on the top twelve drugs by gross U.S. revenue. For example, Celgene filed 106 U.S. patent applications for Revlimid, resulting in ninety-six issued patents. The price of Revlimid increased by 79% since 2012. Critics argue that obtaining secondary patents on improvements or ancillary aspects of a drug extends patent protection unfairly, shielding it from generic competition. Patents shield pharmaceutical products from generic competition, leading to higher drug prices. Critics argue that secondary patents, often of questionable validity, create barriers to entry for generics. Litigating Hatch-Waxman lawsuits can cost $1.8 million, compounding with multiple weaker patents. Critics of evergreening contend that even products with weak patents are unfairly protected. Defenders of evergreening argue that secondary patents are not inherently suspect and must meet the same requirements as any other patent. They believe that the value of a follow-on patent can be comparable to or even exceed that of a primary patent. One example supporting the value of secondary patents is the drug Evista, initially studied for breast cancer but later approved for osteoporosis prevention. Without the ability to patent new uses, there may be insufficient incentives for R&D investment. Additionally, receiving a patent for a later-developed formulation can incentivize improvements to the original product, as seen with Lumigan for glaucoma treatment. Researchers developed an improved formulation with decreased risk of side effects, defending secondary patents for incentivizing research and recouping development costs. Delays in patent and FDA approval can reduce market exclusivity, impacting the ability to recover fixed costs for research and development. Brands argue that secondary patents are narrower than primary patents, allowing generics to enter the market after the primary patent expires. Doctors and patients must weigh the benefits of products covered by secondary patents against the cost of generic versions. Recent congressional action has made challenging patents more affordable, reducing the impact of \"evergreening\" patents. Inter partes review (IPR) is a PTO procedure for challenging patents after they are granted, aiming to improve patent quality and reduce litigation costs. Any non-patent owner can file a petition for IPR nine months after the patent is issued. The challenger must prove the patent's invalidity by a preponderance of evidence, with a final decision from the PTO within one year. The median cost for litigating an IPR is $324,000, making it a relatively fast and cost-effective option. IPR offers a quick and cost-effective way to challenge patents, with a median cost of $324,000 for litigation. Substantive patent law, particularly obviousness, sets limits on granting later-filed patents based on differences from prior art. The Supreme Court uses a flexible approach to determine obviousness, considering the state of the art. The law of obviousness sets limits on patentability, preventing patents for inventions that are predictable variations of prior art. Statutory double patenting prohibits obtaining a later patent for the same invention as an earlier patent. Courts also extend this to bar patents for obvious variations of earlier patents by the same inventor. The doctrine of obviousness-type double patenting prohibits an inventor from patenting obvious variations of their earlier patents. This issue can be addressed by using a \"terminal disclaimer\" to disclaim any portion of the later patent's term after the expiration of the earlier patent. Critics have noted that patent evergreening and \"product hopping\" are practices used in the pharmaceutical industry to extend patent protection. The brand uses its market position to switch doctors, pharmacists, and consumers to a newer version of the same drug with later-expiring patents, often accompanied by marketing campaigns or discounts. This can take the form of a \"hard switch\" where the original product is removed from the market, or a \"soft switch\" where both versions are available. In the case of Abbott Laboratories v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., a hard switch occurred when Abbott made changes to its drug TriCor, including lowering the strength, changing the form from capsule to tablet, and marking the old version as \"obsolete.\" In contrast, a soft switch was seen in Schneiderman v. Actavis PLC with the drug Namenda IR for Alzheimer's disease. Actavis introduced Namenda XR as a once-daily version of the drug to compete with generic versions of Namenda IR for Alzheimer's disease. They allegedly promoted XR over IR by offering discounts, rebates, and stopping marketing for IR. Initially, both versions were on the market together, but Actavis implemented a hard switch to convert more users to XR when the soft switch was not successful. Actavis allegedly implemented a hard switch from Namenda IR to XR, discontinuing IR and attempting to prevent Medicare health plans from covering IR. Critics view this as anticompetitive, hindering generic competition and maintaining higher prices without benefiting consumers. All fifty states have drug product selection laws to promote generic drug use. Pharmacists can only substitute a generic drug for a branded drug if the generic version is \"AB-rated\" by the FDA, indicating therapeutic equivalence in active ingredient, form, dosage, strength, and safety. The generic must also be bioequivalent in absorption rate. Changes in form or dosage of the branded drug may prevent a generic from receiving the AB rating for substitution. Obtaining an AB rating for a generic can take years, hindering automatic substitution with a new product. One argument for product hopping is that it allows brands to create new patented products, giving them an exclusive period to charge higher prices and recoup costs. Once a branded drug's patents expire, the brand loses sales to generic drugs. According to one commentator, brands have little incentive to continue marketing a product facing generic competition as it would result in a significant loss of sales to generic competitors. Product hopping aims to maximize profits for the brand and prevent free-riding by generics, rather than preventing competition. Generic manufacturers could reduce the impact of product hopping by marketing their own products instead of relying on Drug Product Selection (DPS) laws for sales. Generic manufacturers could promote their own products instead of relying on DPS laws for sales. Patients and doctors can choose to use the generic version if the brand's new product is not worth the cost. Product hopping practices have been challenged under antitrust laws as attempts to maintain a monopoly. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that a soft switch was not anticompetitive as long as both brand and generic drugs were available for evaluation. The Second Circuit ruled that Actavis violated Section 2 by implementing a hard switch from brand to generic drugs, crossing the line from persuasion to coercion. The court found Actavis's procompetitive justifications to be pretextual, affirming an injunction requiring Actavis to make the brand drug available on the same terms. Critics argue that pharmaceutical manufacturers use \"patent thickets\" to protect their products. Patent thickets refer to situations where multiple parties hold overlapping patent rights on a product, leading to high transaction costs and coordination challenges. It can also describe a manufacturer amassing numerous patents on a product to deter competitors from entering the market. Patent thickets involve multiple parties holding overlapping patent rights on a product, leading to high transaction costs and coordination challenges. For example, a single smartphone may be protected by as many as 250,000 patents, with various technologies covered by multiple patents. Unlike pharmaceuticals, patents on products like semiconductors or smartphones are typically not all owned by the same entity, creating the first type of patent thicket. This type of patent thicket generally does not confer the same market power as a patent portfolio on a new pharmaceutical owned by a single drug manufacturer. In the pharmaceutical context, concerns about patent thickets mainly involve biologics, which are derived from living cells or biological material. Manufacturing biologics using living cells offers more opportunities for patenting compared to chemically synthesizing small-molecule drugs. Changes made to the biologic product or its manufacturing process during the original patent term can be claimed as inventions to extend patent protection. The patent thickets in the pharmaceutical industry, particularly with biologics, involve extending patent protection by patenting different aspects of a product. AbbVie's patent portfolio for Humira is an example, with 247 patent applications and 132 issued patents. Critics claim this has kept competitors off the market, with AbbVie filing 75 patents before biosimilar competition, extending protection until 2034. Challenging these patents could cost roughly $3 million each. AbbVie's patent portfolio for Humira includes 247 patent applications and 132 issued patents. Boehringer settled a lawsuit with AbbVie over patent infringement, delaying biosimilar entry into the U.S. market until January 31, 2023. Litigation surrounding Humira's patents has also involved antitrust claims. The welfare fund filed an antitrust suit against AbbVie for doubling the cost of Humira, alleging it violated the Sherman Act. Baltimore's mayor and city council also sued AbbVie, claiming biosimilars of Humira could have been available earlier. Concerns have been raised about other drug manufacturers amassing patent portfolios to delay biosimilar competition. Biogen/Genentech protects cancer treatment Rituxin with a patent thicket of over 200 applications and 90 patents, potentially blocking competition for 47 years. This strategy has led to speculation that other companies may follow suit. Defenders argue that these patents incentivize innovation and have passed rigorous examination processes. AbbVie defends Humira's multiple patents as representing true innovation in biologics. Experts note that AbbVie's patent strategy for Humira is not unusual and is seen as taking advantage of existing laws. Creating a biologic like Humira involves complex steps that require innovative solutions, leading to a portfolio of patents that evolve as new discoveries are made. This practice is viewed as a legitimate way to protect significant innovations in the biologic industry. Defenders see patent thickets as a legitimate way to protect innovations, with restrictions based on patent law. Terminal disclaimers can help overcome double patenting issues. The alleged goal of evergreening is to extend exclusivity, while patent thickets aim to accumulate multiple patents for a single product. Terminal disclaimers have less impact on preventing patent thickets compared to evergreening. Patent litigation can arise when generic manufacturers challenge brand-name companies' patents to market their products before expiration. Settlement agreements may resolve such disputes. Settlement agreements between brand-name and generic manufacturers involve payments to delay market entry, known as \"reverse payment settlements\" or \"pay-for-delay settlements.\" This allows the brand-name company to avoid patent challenges, delay competition, and extend exclusivity. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit recently addressed a pay-for-delay settlement involving Wyeth, Inc.'s drug, Effexor XR. The plaintiffs alleged an anticompetitive pay-for-delay settlement between Wyeth and Teva regarding the generic version of Effexor XR. This agreement allowed Teva to delay market entry for nearly five years, while Wyeth agreed not to market a competing \"authorized generic\" during Teva's exclusivity period. Wyeth and Teva reached a pay-for-delay settlement regarding the generic version of Effexor XR. Wyeth agreed not to market a competing \"authorized generic\" during Teva's exclusivity period. Teva was allowed to sell a generic version of Effexor IR before the original patent expired without a Wyeth-authorized generic. Teva also agreed to pay royalties to Wyeth on its sales of both generic versions of Effexor. The FTC did not object to the agreement, noting that it had significant adverse effects on competition. Pay-for-delay settlements have been alleged to have significant adverse effects on competition, violating antitrust laws. The court evaluates agreements for potential antitrust violations based on the competitive significance and surrounding circumstances. The Supreme Court has recognized that reverse payment settlements can sometimes violate antitrust laws. Defenders argue that there are benefits from pay-for-delay settlements. AbbVie has settled suits with various companies. AbbVie has settled suits with companies seeking to introduce biosimilars to Humira, despite accusations of \"patent abuses.\" The Biosimilars Council sees settlements between brands and biosimilars as a way to resolve patent issues. They argue that the Humira settlements are \"pro-consumer\" because biosimilar market entry will still occur before certain secondary patents expire. The Supreme Court has acknowledged that pay-for-delay settlements can have procompetitive benefits, with the appropriate level of analysis being the rule of reason in challenges to such agreements. The rule of reason is the appropriate level of analysis in challenges to pay-for-delay agreements, recognizing potential anticompetitive effects but also allowing for justifications like avoided litigation costs. The FTC must fully prove anticompetitive effects before burden shifts to the defendant, as seen in the Third Circuit case involving Wyeth and Effexor XR. Plaintiffs alleged an unlawful restraint of trade under the Sherman Act, showing a plausible anticompetitive impact. The Third Circuit found that plaintiffs had plausibly alleged an anticompetitive pay-for-delay settlement between Wyeth and Teva regarding Effexor XR. The agreement ensured Teva's exclusivity in the market, leading to all generic sales during that period. The court ruled that the payment couldn't be justified as avoiding litigation costs, violating the Supreme Court's ruling in Actavis. This report discusses various patent practices, such as product hopping, which can be combined with pay-for-delay settlements to delay generic competition. The manufacturer may use product hopping along with pay-for-delay settlements to delay generic competition by switching the market to a new product before the generic enters. An example involves Cephalon, maker of Provigil, who combined these tactics to prevent competition for their product. In 2006, Cephalon faced potential competition from generic companies entering the market with noninfringing products. To prevent this, Cephalon settled patent lawsuits with generics, paying over $200 million to delay market entry until 2012. Despite claiming this would allow generic versions of Provigil to enter the market earlier, Cephalon increased the price of Provigil and promoted their patent-protected product, Nuvigil. Cephalon used product hopping and pay-for-delay settlements to extend its exclusivity period for Nuvigil, avoiding competition from generics. Various proposals aim to address pharmaceutical patenting practices to reduce consumer prices in the complex market. The discussed proposals aim to reduce drug prices by targeting evergreening practices in pharmaceutical patenting. Increasing patent examination resources is suggested to decrease weaker later-filed patents. Some proposals suggest allocating more resources to the PTO to prevent low-quality patents, reducing the need for defending against infringement. One commentator proposes raising patentability requirements for later-filed patents to combat evergreening practices. One proposal suggests raising patentability requirements for secondary inventions to combat evergreening practices in the pharmaceutical industry. This would require clear evidence of increased efficacy compared to the original invention, incentivizing companies to create new drugs rather than making minor changes to extend monopolies. The TERM Act of 2019 aims to limit patent evergreening by presuming that later-filed patents expire when the first patent does. Patentees can challenge this presumption by proving increased efficacy with later-expiring patents. The TERM Act of 2019 aims to limit patent evergreening by requiring patentees to prove increased efficacy with later-expiring patents, shifting the burden of proving patent validity for certain pharmaceutical patents. The Act also mandates the PTO to review patent examination procedures to prevent the issuance of duplicative patents. The REMEDY Act, like the TERM Act, aims to reduce evergreening by limiting the benefit of later-filed patents. It would only trigger Hatch-Waxman's thirty-month stay for generic drugs if the patent claims the drug's active ingredient, not just a drug product or method of use. The REMEDY Act aims to limit evergreening by only triggering the thirty-month stay for generic drugs if the patent claims the drug's active ingredient, not just a drug product or method of use. The Act would also allow FDA to approve generic products immediately if the patent claims the drug substance itself, speeding up market entry. Additionally, patents canceled by the PTO would be removed from the Orange Book, and challenges to patents struck from the Orange Book would not affect the first-generic-filer 180-day exclusivity period. Other proposals, like the Second Look at Drugs Patents Act of 2019, aim to incentivize challenges to pharmaceutical patents after they are issued. The SLDPA of 2019 would require brands to notify the PTO when adding patents to the Orange Book, allowing challenges to be filed. Patents would be provisionally included until confirmed or challenged within specific time frames. If patent claims are canceled, the brand must request removal from the Orange Book. The SLDPA of 2019 aims to encourage challenges to patents listed in the Orange Book by providing notice and incentives for generics to challenge weak patents. One proposed method is the implementation of an \"Invalidity Challenge Reimbursement Program\" (ICR program) that would reimburse fees and expenses for accused infringers who successfully invalidate a patent claim. This program could be funded by charging an \"ICR fee\" on each patent in force. The commentator suggests that reimbursing successful challenges to patents may incentivize the PTO to examine applications more carefully. The Affordable Prescriptions for Patients Act of 2019 aims to address certain pharmaceutical patenting practices, such as product hopping, by making it an antitrust violation and limiting the number of patents asserted in biologics litigation. The bill would amend the FTC Act to define product hopping as a violation of federal antitrust laws. The Affordable Prescriptions for Patients Act of 2019 aims to address product hopping by defining \"hard switch\" and \"soft switch\" actions by manufacturers within a specific timeframe after receiving notice of a generic drug or biosimilar license submission. The bill would prevent manufacturers from requesting FDA to withdraw approval for a product and then marketing a new version to hinder competition. The Affordable Prescriptions for Patients Act of 2019 aims to address product hopping by defining \"hard switch\" and \"soft switch\" actions by manufacturers to impede competition from generics or biosimilars. The bill would prevent manufacturers from marketing a follow-on product after withdrawing or discontinuing the original product. The Affordable Prescriptions for Patients Act of 2019 aims to address product hopping by defining \"hard switch\" and \"soft switch\" actions by manufacturers to impede competition for generic or biosimilar products. The bill would allow manufacturers to rebut a prima facie case of product hopping by establishing legitimate pro-competitive reasons for their actions. Additionally, the bill aims to reduce the impact of patent thickets for biological products. The Affordable Prescriptions for Patients Act of 2019 addresses product hopping by defining \"hard switch\" and \"soft switch\" actions to impede competition for generic or biosimilar products. It also aims to reduce the impact of patent thickets for biological products by broadening the types of patents that brand biologic manufacturers can assert in premarketing litigation and limiting the number of certain patents that can be asserted. The APPA would authorize a court to increase the number of patents a brand can assert in premarketing litigation if it is in the interest of justice or for good cause. The Orange Book Transparency Act of 2019 (OBTA) would change patent listing requirements for the Orange Book, clarifying the types of patents that may be listed. The OBTA would limit the types of patents that can be listed in the Orange Book to only include patents claiming methods of using a drug or claiming the drug as a substance or product. This would impact the availability of the thirty-month stay for FDA approval of generics. Additionally, the OBTA would require FDA to list regulatory exclusivity periods for each drug and mandate a report on patent types in the Orange Book. Other bills aim to increase transparency to facilitate generic entry. The Purple Book Continuity Act of 2019 (PBCA) aims to increase transparency by requiring BLA holders to provide patents to FDA for publication in the Purple Book. It also mandates FDA to update the Purple Book every thirty days with new biologics and patent information. Additionally, the PBCA requires listing of exclusivity periods for each biologic and removal of products with withdrawn or suspended licenses. This bill supports combatting patent thickets and facilitating generic or biosimilar entry. The Biologic Patent Transparency Act (BPTA) complements the Purple Book Continuity Act (PBCA) by requiring broader patent information to be listed in the Purple Book, including patents that could potentially be infringed. It also aims to make the Purple Book easily searchable in a single list. The BPTA would require FDA to update the Purple Book every thirty days and prevent brands from suing for patent infringement if the patent was not listed in the Purple Book. The PAAGBA aims to limit brand's ability to delay generic or biosimilar market entry by presuming certain patent settlement agreements as illegal. The legislation would authorize the FTC to enforce against such agreements with presumed anticompetitive effects. The PAAGBA would presume agreements as anticompetitive if brands provide generics with anything of value in exchange for limiting research, development, or sales. However, agreements providing compensation for other goods or services or with procompetitive benefits could overcome this presumption. The legislation does not make such agreements illegal but aims to limit brand's ability to delay generic market entry. The PAAGBA evaluates agreements based on whether the \"procompetitive benefits outweigh the anticompetitive effects.\" The FTC can impose civil penalties on violating parties, up to three times the value gained from the agreement. Penalties are calculated based on the value gained by the violating party. The FTC ALJ considers various factors when determining penalties for violating parties under the PAAGBA, including the nature of the violation, impact on commerce, culpability, history of violations, ability to pay, and profits gained. Penalties are in addition to any imposed by other federal laws and may include injunctions and cease-and-desist orders. Additionally, an ANDA filer involved in such agreements would lose its 180-day exclusivity for challenging a patent."
