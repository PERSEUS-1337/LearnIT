    "content": "The \"Safe Bridges Act of 1997\" recognizes the importance of bridges in the US transportation system, emphasizing the need for proper maintenance to save lives. Over 25% of Interstate System bridges are deficient, requiring an annual investment of $5 billion for upkeep. The \"Safe Bridges Act of 1997\" amends Section 144(g) of title 23, US Code, to create a discretionary bridge program with a $500 million set-aside annually before any apportionment. This amount can be used at the Secretary's discretion, with $8.5 million allocated each fiscal year. For each fiscal year, specific amounts are allocated to carry out different sections, with $8.5 million for section 144A, $12.5 million for section 144B, and $15 million for section 144C. The remaining funds are available as per paragraph (2), and state funds received under this provision do not affect other apportionments. The Highway Trust Fund will provide amounts for the Highway Timber Bridge Research and Construction Program under Title 23 of the United States Code. Section 1039 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 is transferred, redesignated as section 144A, and inserted after section 144. Amendments include renaming the section as the Highway timber bridge research and construction program. The Highway Timber Bridge Research and Construction Program under Title 23 of the United States Code is amended for fiscal years 1998 through 2003, with changes to funding allocations and the removal of subsection (f). SEC. 4. Innovative highway steel bridge research and construction program. The Innovative Highway Steel Bridge Research and Construction Program involves making grants for research on cost-effective steel bridge applications, engineering design criteria for steel products, developing bridges that can withstand natural disasters, and creating new products and materials for highway structures. The program involves research on new products and materials for highway steel bridges, rehabilitation methods for bridge structures, and technology transfer to state and local transportation departments. The Secretary will provide construction grants to states for steel bridge projects on Federal-aid highways. The Secretary will provide construction grants to states for steel bridge projects on Federal-aid highways based on specific approval criteria including design integrity and innovation potential. The Federal share of the cost for research or construction projects under this section is 80 percent. Funding for the Secretary to carry out the subsections includes $2,500,000 for subsections (a) and (b) and $10,000,000 for subsection (c), available until expended. The Federal share of the cost for research or construction projects under this section is 80 percent. Funding for the Secretary includes $2,500,000 for subsections (a) and (b) and $10,000,000 for subsection (c), available until expended. Conforming Amendment: The analysis for chapter 1 of title 23, United States Code, is amended by inserting after the item relating to section 144A the following: (1) shall remain available until expended. SEC. 5. CARBON COMPOSITE BRIDGE RETROFIT RESEARCH AND DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM. The Carbon Composite Bridge Retrofit Research and Demonstration Program involves making grants for research on developing economical carbon composite highway bridge retrofit systems, engineering design criteria for carbon composite products, and deployment systems for incorporating carbon composites in highway bridges. The program involves grants for research on alternative processes for seismic retrofit and rehabilitation of structurally deficient bridges, carbon composite transportation system structures for various highway infrastructure applications, and rehabilitation measures using carbon composites. The Secretary ensures technology transfer to State and local transportation departments. The Secretary provides grants to States for projects involving the reconstruction or seismic retrofit of bridges on the National Highway System. States must submit applications meeting specified criteria for approval. The Federal government provides grants for bridge projects that focus on structural integrity, use carbon composite materials, have innovative designs, ensure safety during seismic events, extend the service life of bridges, and use American-made retrofit technology. The Federal share of project costs is 80 percent, and funding is reserved for approved projects. From 1998 to 2003, funds are reserved for the Secretary of Transportation to carry out various subsections, with $1,000,000 allocated for subsections (a) and (b) and $14,000,000 for subsection (c). The funds remain available until expended. The text chunk \"144C. Carbon composite bridge retrofit research and demonstration program.\" is a part of a funding allocation for the Secretary of Transportation from 1998 to 2003."
