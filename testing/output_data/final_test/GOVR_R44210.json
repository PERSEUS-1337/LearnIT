Recent disputes found US labeling requirements violated nondiscrimination obligations. This analysis provides insight for future regulatory programs. This report examines Appellate Body decisions in U.S. disputes over country of origin labeling (COOL) and tuna products. Canada and Mexico challenged U.S. COOL requirements for beef and pork, arguing they discriminated against foreign livestock. The WTO Appellate Body ruled in favor of Canada and Mexico, finding the COOL program violated U.S. obligations under the TBT Agreement. The WTO Appellate Body ruled in favor of Canada and Mexico, finding that the U.S. COOL program discriminated against foreign livestock. Canada and Mexico requested permission to retaliate against the U.S. through tariffs or concessions suspension, claiming trade impairment of approximately $3 billion per year. The U.S. is challenging these claims at the WTO. In a recent WTO case, Mexico challenged the United States' \"dolphin-safe\" labeling program for tuna products, claiming it violated the TBT Agreement by treating Mexican tuna less favorably. The WTO ruled in favor of Mexico, and an appeal is pending. If Mexico wins the appeal, they could seek retaliation against the U.S. These disputes were among the first to apply the nondiscrimination requirements of the TBT Agreement. The report focuses on the United States' failure to comply with nondiscrimination requirements of the TBT Agreement in disputes related to U.S. \u2013 COOL and U.S. \u2013 Tuna II. It provides an overview of the TBT Agreement, analyzes the regulatory programs in question, and discusses how the Appellate Body applied Article 2.1. The report also examines the test for determining discriminatory measures, the U.S.'s amendments in response to WTO decisions, and subsequent rulings on non-compliance. Following World War II, developed countries established the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1947 (GATT 1947) to reduce barriers to international trade. The agreement aimed to liberalize trade markets and promote a greater flow of goods across borders. In the decades that followed, countries worked to further open global markets by reducing non-tariff barriers to trade. The TBT Agreement aims to prevent unnecessary obstacles to international trade by ensuring technical regulations and standards do not distort trade. It provides legal obligations for WTO members to follow when implementing measures that regulate a product's characteristics. The TBT Agreement covers measures regulating a product's characteristics based on intrinsic qualities, related qualities, or lacking qualities like identification, presentation, and appearance. In EC \u2013 Sardines, Peru challenged an EU regulation on preserved sardines, specifying only Sar d ina pilchardus could be labeled as such. The Appellate Body ruled this measure prescribed product-related characteristics by conditioning labeling on specific product qualities like the species of fish. Similarly, in EC \u2013 Asbestos, a French decree criminalizing asbestos-containing products was deemed within the TBT Agreement's scope. The French decree criminalizing the sale of products containing asbestos fibers fell under the TBT Agreement as it required all products to be asbestos-free, falling under technical regulations, standards, and conformity assessment procedures. These measures regulate product characteristics such as labeling requirements, import bans, and certification procedures. The TBT Agreement sets out obligations for WTO members regarding technical regulations, standards, and conformity assessment procedures. Disputes related to the TBT Agreement can be resolved through the WTO's dispute settlement procedures. Most disputes have focused on provisions in Article 2 of the Agreement, which outlines requirements for issuing technical regulations. Article 2 of the TBT Agreement outlines obligations for WTO members regarding technical regulations. It requires adherence to international standards, justification for regulations upon request, participation in creating international standards, and transparency. Members must ensure their measures are not overly trade restrictive. Article 2.1 specifically mandates compliance with national regulations. The TBT Agreement in Article 2.1 mandates compliance with \"national treatment\" and \"most-favored nation\" obligations, prohibiting discrimination in technical regulations. The Appellate Body found U.S. labeling programs violated these obligations. Unlike other WTO agreements, the TBT Agreement does not provide explicit exceptions to these obligations. Article XX of the GATT allows members to implement measures that may otherwise violate GATT obligations for reasons such as protecting human health, the environment, natural resources, or public morals. These measures must not be disguised restrictions on trade or implemented arbitrarily. The TBT Agreement lacks explicit exceptions, leading to questions about its stricter application compared to other WTO agreements. The Appellate Body has interpreted some aspects of the TBT Agreement in a specific manner. The Appellate Body has read exceptions into the TBT Agreement, specifically regarding labeling cases. The COOL program for beef and pork products was implemented in 2008, with regulations amended in 2013 after WTO determinations of TBT Agreement violations. The COOL statute requires muscle cuts to be labeled by country of origin based on production steps. Categories A-D distinguish origin based on where animals were born, raised, and slaughtered. Under the COOL statute, meat is categorized into A-D based on origin. Category A is labeled \"Product of the United States,\" Category B includes both US and foreign country on the label, Category C is \"Product of [Country X] and the United States,\" and Category D is labeled \"Product of [Country X].\" The 2009 regulations allowed commingling of meat from different origins during production. The COOL regulations categorize meat into A-D based on origin and allow commingling of meats from different origins during production. The statute imposes record-keeping requirements and penalties for noncompliance, with exemptions for processed products. The USDA defines processed meat as exempt from COOL requirements if cooked, cured, smoked, or restructured. Food sold in restaurants is also exempt. Upstream producers must still track origin. The DPCIA, enacted in 1990, regulates tuna products to protect dolphins. The DPCIA, enacted in 1990, regulates tuna products to protect dolphins, specifically denying the \"dolphin-safe\" label for tuna caught using purse seine nets set on dolphins in the eastern tropical Pacific where yellowfin tuna swim underneath dolphin pods. Mexico challenged the program in the WTO due to more stringent requirements in this area. The Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act (DPCIA) regulates tuna fishing practices to protect dolphins. Fishing boats sometimes set nets around dolphins to catch tuna, leading to dolphin mortality. The DPCIA establishes criteria for tuna to be labeled \"dolphin-safe,\" with penalties for mislabeling. The Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act (DPCIA) regulates tuna fishing practices to protect dolphins. Tuna caught in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) can be labeled \"dolphin-safe\" only if specific criteria are met, including no intentional use of purse seine nets around dolphins and no dolphin mortality during the expedition. Tuna caught in the ETP using purse seine nets set on dolphins are not eligible for the dolphin-safe label if dolphins are harmed. Outside the ETP, captains only need to certify that nets were not intentionally deployed on dolphins to be labeled dolphin-safe. The DPCIA regulates the dolphin-safe label but does not prohibit certain fishing practices. The DPCIA regulates the dolphin-safe label but does not ban non-qualifying tuna. Canada and Mexico disputed the U.S. COOL program at the WTO, alleging violations of the TBT Agreement. Mexico also raised concerns about the dolphin-safe labeling program. Mexico requested a dispute panel regarding the U.S. labeling program for tuna, claiming it violated the TBT Agreement. The WTO's Appellate Body decisions provide insight into Article 2.1 and determining if a measure qualifies as a technical regulation. A technical regulation must meet three criteria according to the EC-Sardines case. The COOL program in the United States applies to beef and pork products, requiring labeling and mandatory compliance. The labeling program for tuna was also considered a technical regulation under the TBT Agreement. The United States argued that the dolphin-safe label for tuna was not mandatory because it did not prohibit the sale of any tuna, only certain tuna could be labeled as \"dolphin-safe.\" Compliance with the labeling program was considered voluntary. The Appellate Body agreed with Mexico that the dolphin-safe labeling program should be viewed as mandatory, as producers were required to comply with specific requirements to use the label. This decision outlined a method for determining if a measure is \"mandatory\" under the TBT Agreement. The fact that producers must meet certain criteria to use a label does not automatically classify the measure as a technical regulation. The Appellate Body found that a labeling requirement can be considered a technical regulation even if it does not prevent the sale of the product on the market. This was highlighted by comparing it to a case involving the sale of fish labeled as \"preserved sardines.\" The Appellate Body determined that a labeling measure can be a technical regulation even if the label is not necessary for product sale. There is no clear test, but a case-by-case evaluation is needed based on the measure's characteristics and circumstances. The assessment should consider if the measure is a law or regulation, mandates certain conduct, and is the only way to address an issue. The labeling program was found to be mandatory under the TBT Agreement. The DPCIA and its regulations enforce labeling laws for tuna products, specifically regarding dolphin-safe labeling. The law prohibits any reference to marine mammal safety on labels unless complying with DPCIA terms. The Appellate Body emphasized that the DPCIA is the sole method for identifying tuna products as dolphin-safe in the US, covering the entire concept of 'dolphin-safe' for tuna products. The Appellate Body found that the DPCIA is a technical regulation subject to the TBT Agreement, ensuring equal treatment for imported products. In U.S. \u2013 COOL and U.S. \u2013 Tuna II cases, Canada, Mexico, and Mexico alleged violations of national treatment and most-favored nation requirements. The Appellate Body evaluates these obligations under the same test, which includes determining if the regulation is technical, if the products are similar, and if foreign products are treated less favorably. The WTO found that the COOL program and DPCIA qualified as technical regulations in disputes involving national treatment and most-favored nation claims. The Appellate Body assessed whether foreign products were treated less favorably than domestic products based on detrimental impact and legitimate regulatory distinctions, noting that discrimination can be both de jure and de facto. The Appellate Body emphasized that Article 2.1 prohibits both de jure and de facto discrimination, requiring a review of the measure's impact on the market for products to determine if it is detrimental. If the detrimental impact is due to private parties' actions rather than the regulation itself, it will not be considered detrimental. The Appellate Body emphasized that Article 2.1 prohibits discrimination, requiring a review of the measure's impact on the market for products to determine if it is detrimental. The central question is whether the regulatory action affects the conditions under which like goods compete in the market within a Member's territory. This examination considers market characteristics, consumer preferences, market share, and trade history. If the regulation favors domestic products over foreign ones, it has a detrimental impact. The WTO panel reviews if a technical regulation has a detrimental impact and if it is based on a legitimate regulatory distinction. Mere detrimental effect is not enough to violate Article 2.1, as long as the regulation is based on a legitimate distinction applied even-handedly. The Appellate Body clarified that a detrimental effect does not mean less favorable treatment, as technical regulations inherently distinguish between products. The Appellate Body clarified that technical regulations, by nature, distinguish between products based on their characteristics, which does not automatically constitute \"less favorable treatment\" under the TBT Agreement. Article 2.2 of the TBT Agreement guides the interpretation of Article 2.1, stating that regulations should not be \"more trade restrictive than necessary.\" The preamble of the TBT Agreement recognizes legitimate regulatory objectives, such as protecting human or environmental health, allowing measures to restrict trade to some extent. The judicial test for determining less favorable treatment is complex and goes beyond just showing trade restrictions. The evaluation of whether a technical regulation constitutes \"less favorable treatment\" under the TBT Agreement is complex. It depends on whether the regulation is based on a legitimate regulatory distinction applied even-handedly or in an arbitrary manner, which would reflect discrimination. The reviewing body must determine the regulatory distinction made by the regulation and how products are being distinguished, such as in the DPCIA dispute based on labeling conditions. In the DPCIA dispute, the regulatory distinction is based on labeling conditions for tuna caught in the ETP compared to tuna caught outside the ETP, imposing different requirements. The reviewing body must assess if this distinction is justified as a legitimate regulatory measure, evaluating if it is applied even-handedly on a case-by-case basis. This fact-intensive inquiry considers whether the harm to foreign products is being addressed in a legitimate manner. The COOL program, which requires livestock processors to segregate animals by origin, was found to have a detrimental impact on Canadian and Mexican livestock by the WTO. This measure was deemed to treat foreign livestock less favorably than domestic livestock. The COOL program, requiring livestock segregation by origin, led to significant costs for producers. The WTO found that it incentivized processing only domestic livestock, causing a detrimental impact on foreign products. The WTO found that the COOL statute had a detrimental impact on foreign products due to the requirement for livestock segregation by origin. The purpose of COOL was to provide consumers with origin information on meat products, but the labeling system was confusing and ineffective in conveying this information to consumers. The labeling system under the COOL statute was found to be confusing and ineffective in providing consumers with origin information on meat products. The labels failed to convey the required information about where animals were born, raised, and slaughtered in the supply chain, leading to consumer confusion. Additionally, the commingling of different categories of meat further added to the confusion, as meat could receive a label based on the day it was processed rather than its actual origin. The Appellate Body ruled that the COOL labeling system failed to effectively inform consumers about the origin of meat products, leading to confusion. Despite requiring extensive information from producers, the labels did not adequately convey origin details to consumers, especially for exempt meat categories like processed or restaurant-sold meat. This discrepancy in required information and consumer knowledge caused a detrimental impact on foreign livestock producers due to increased costs from segregation requirements. The WTO found that the COOL labeling system did not effectively inform consumers about the origin of meat products, leading to confusion and a detrimental impact on foreign producers. The labeling requirements did not distinguish legitimate regulatory needs and discriminated against foreign products. The \"dolphin-safe\" labels added value to U.S. tuna products, causing a detrimental impact on Mexican tuna products. The WTO found that \"dolphin-safe\" labels added value to U.S. tuna products, leading to a preference for labeled tuna in the market. The Appellate Body determined that the technical regulation imposed more stringent requirements on Mexican fishers operating in the ETP, affecting their access to the dolphin-safe label. The WTO ruled that a technical regulation imposed more stringent requirements on Mexican fishers in the ETP, impacting their access to the dolphin-safe label and causing a detrimental effect on Mexican tuna products in the U.S. market. The Appellate Body held the U.S. responsible under the TBT Agreement for the regulation's impact, despite arguments that private consumer choices played a role. The Appellate Body found that the DPCIA represents discrimination in violation of Article 2.1 as it does not stem from a legitimate regulatory distinction, despite the United States' argument that the measure aimed to prevent consumer deception about dolphin-safe tuna. The Appellate Body acknowledged the threat to dolphins in the ETP but concluded that the technical regulation treating tuna differently based on where it was caught was not justified. The Appellate Body found that fishing in the ETP poses a significant threat to dolphins, but also noted threats from other fishing methods outside the ETP. The technical regulation did not address these threats adequately, leading to a discrepancy in dolphin-safe labeling between tuna caught in the ETP and elsewhere. The WTO criticized the regulation for being too strict in the ETP where Mexico fishes, while being more lenient in other parts of the world. The Appellate Body criticized the US measure for not being even-handed in addressing adverse effects on dolphins from different fishing methods. They found that the Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act (DPCIA) was not properly calibrated and led to discrimination against Mexican tuna products, violating the TBT Agreement. The DPCIA reflects discrimination in violation of the TBT Agreement. The US had a \"reasonable period of time\" to comply with WTO findings but changes to regulations did not cure defects. Disputes have proceeded to retaliation phase and awaiting Appellate Body's opinion. The USDA amended regulations for the COOL program in 2013 to provide more detailed information on meat labels, including where production steps occurred. Labels now must specify \"born, raised, slaughtered in the U.S.\" to prevent commingling of meats. The USDA amended regulations for the COOL program in 2013 to provide more detailed information on meat labels, including specifying \"born, raised, slaughtered in the U.S.\" to prevent commingling of meats. However, Canada and Mexico were unsatisfied with the changes and requested a WTO compliance panel review, which found that the new regulations did not fully comply with WTO obligations. The panel noted that the burden on upstream producers was still not commensurate with the information provided to consumers due to exemptions for processed meat and meat sold at prepared food establishments. The WTO found that the COOL program was discriminatory and not based on a legitimate regulatory distinction, leading Canada and Mexico to seek retaliation for $3 billion in damages. The dispute over the amount of impairment caused by the COOL program is currently being heard by an arbitration panel at the WTO, with Canada and Mexico potentially raising tariffs on U.S. products based on the panel's decision. The United States may face tariffs on its products if it does not comply with WTO obligations regarding the COOL program. To comply, Congress will need to amend the COOL statute. The DOC amended regulations for the DPCIA to address dolphin mortality issues, aiming to meet WTO requirements. The United States amended regulations for the Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act (DPCIA) to address dolphin mortality issues, aiming to meet WTO requirements. The amended regulations required ETP vessels to have an independent observer onboard to certify no dolphins were harmed, and added a new requirement for non-ETP vessels to have the captain certify the same. This had a detrimental impact on the Mexican tuna fleet, mostly operating in the ETP. The compliance panel found that the technical regulation was not applied evenly, making it more difficult and costly for Mexican tuna products to qualify for the dolphin-safe label. The varying provisions could lead to less accurate information on dolphin mortality for tuna caught outside the ETP, contradicting the objectives of the amended tuna measure. The United States has appealed the panel's decision. The United States has appealed a ruling regarding the tuna measure, which is not even-handed. The Appellate Body is expected to release its report in November 2015. If the DPCIA program is found to violate the TBT Agreement, Mexico may seek permission to retaliate. The Appellate Body's decisions in labeling disputes offer insight into obligations under the agreement, guiding Congress and executive agencies in formulating technical regulations. Legislators and agency officials must ensure that any regulatory scheme does not harm foreign trade. The DPCIA program must be tailored appropriately to ensure even-handed application in trade."
