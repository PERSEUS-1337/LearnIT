    "content": "The international trade in textiles and clothing has seen a gradual reduction of trade barriers over the last 40 years, mainly under the WTO or GATT. The Multifibre Arrangement (MFA) replaced the Long Term Agreement on Cotton Textiles in 1974, expanding to include wool and man-made fibers. Negotiations to end the MFA were challenging due to concerns about the economic impact on domestic manufacturers in industrialized and less industrialized countries. The Multifibre Arrangement (MFA) was renegotiated four times over 20 years due to difficulties in negotiations among countries. In 1995, the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) replaced the MFA, initiating a 10-year process to eliminate quotas for international trade in clothing and textiles. The ATC's quota phase-out involved gradually removing quantitative restrictions on trade, allowing manufacturers time to adjust to the global market. The Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) replaced the Multifibre Arrangement (MFA) in 1995, initiating a 10-year process to eliminate quotas for international trade in clothing and textiles. The ATC required parties to gradually remove quotas and increase quotas for certain products, opening domestic markets to more imported goods. The quota phase-out process was designed to be gradual in theory but was abrupt in practice, with the United States and other nations strategically selecting products for integration in the first three stages. The final quota phase-out on January 1, 2005, marked a significant transition for domestic manufacturers as quotas on most traded products were lifted. This event was referred to as a \"cliff,\" providing companies with a 10-year window to enhance competitiveness. The \"cliff\" posed both benefits and challenges, depending on how companies utilized the transition period. The ATC provided longer protection for companies when quotas were lifted, but import tariffs could still be imposed. US tariff rates show efforts to erect selective import barriers, with significant variation in tariffs for clothing and textiles. The United States imposes a wide range of tariffs on clothing and textile imports, with general tariff rates ranging from 3.9% to 32.0% and peak tariff rates from 60.0% to 113.5%. These high tariff rates indicate a pattern of protection for the clothing and textile market. Additionally, the ATC's impact is limited as countries can still use safeguard measures, antidumping, and countervailing duty cases to restrict imports. The ATC's impact is limited as countries can still use safeguard measures, antidumping, and countervailing duty cases to restrict imports. China agreed to special provisions allowing other WTO members to utilize safeguard mechanisms against Chinese clothing and textile products. The clothing and textile safeguard mechanism can be invoked by any WTO member by requesting consultation with China, imposing a quota equal to 6% or 7.5% more than the previous 12 months' imports. The WTO member can enforce the import quota even without China's agreement, lasting for one year until December 31, 2008. Brazil, Colombia, the European Union, and the United States have utilized this provision. Another safeguard mechanism is available until December 10, 2013, requiring notification to the WTO's Committee on Safeguards before imposing measures. The WTO member can impose safeguard measures after consultations or in critical circumstances, allowing for quotas, tariffs, or import restrictions. General safeguard measures can last up to three years, unlike clothing and textile specific measures limited to 12 months. The ATC did not achieve \"free trade\" for clothing and textiles as it eliminated a key mechanism for altering trade patterns. Expectations for significant changes in international trade in clothing and textiles were reasonable after the termination of the ATC. After the termination of all ATC quotas on January 1, 2005, there was a predicted shift in production to quota-constrained countries, with China expected to benefit the most. Analysts agreed that global trade in clothing and textiles would grow faster, and China and India would increase their market shares, although the extent of this increase was uncertain. After the termination of all ATC quotas on January 1, 2005, analysts predicted a shift in production to quota-constrained countries, with China expected to benefit the most. Estimates varied for China's increase in clothing and textile exports, ranging from 3% to 10%. The United States would import more clothing and textiles from China, leading to job losses in U.S. manufacturers. Preferential trade arrangements could help mitigate the impact on manufacturers in other regions. There is a possibility of trade remedies being imposed by the United States, the EU, and other WTO members in response to increased imports from China, India, and other Asian suppliers. Between 2004 and 2005, China and India saw significant growth in clothing exports, with China's exports increasing by $12.3 billion (19.9%) and India's by $1.7 billion (25.0%). Together, they captured nearly 85% of the total increase in clothing trade during that period. On the other hand, Hong Kong, Mexico, Romania, and the United States experienced declines in clothing exports. In the post-ATC era, global clothing trade showed a shift towards emerging centers of growth. While South Korea and Taiwan experienced export declines, major exporters saw modest increases, with China and India leading the growth. Global textile trade followed a similar pattern, with China, Pakistan, and India enjoying significant growth in exports. In 2005, Pakistan and India had double-digit growth in textile exports, while Turkey and the United States had more modest gains. Traditional textile exporting nations like Germany, South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan saw declines in their export totals. Despite a shift to China and India, clothing and textile production and exports in 2005 remained at similar levels to 2004. In 2005, textile production and exports saw growth in China and India, while the United States remained a major player in both clothing and textiles trade. The US imported over $80 billion in clothing and nearly $23 billion in textiles, making it the largest importer in the WTO. The global textile trade is three-quarters the size of clothing trade, but in the US, textile trade is about two-fifths the size of clothing trade. The United States has a trade deficit in clothing and textiles, with imports exceeding exports. The trade deficit for clothing and textiles combined was over $79 billion in 2004 and increased to over $85 billion in 2005. Despite the termination of ATC quotas, there was only a slight increase in clothing and textile imports. The source of imports shifted between 2004 and 2005, with a carry-over effect into 2006. Between 2004 and 2006, there was a significant increase in clothing imports from China, leading to a trade deficit in clothing and textiles for the United States. Despite the termination of ATC quotas, the growth in imports was not as predicted by experts. The value of U.S. clothing imports in 2006 was much higher than textile imports, with China being the main beneficiary in both sectors. The termination of ATC quotas did not result in the predicted increase in clothing imports, with both clothing and textiles experiencing year-on-year declines in 2001. Mexico, not China, made the greatest gains in the U.S. clothing market between 1990 and 2006. Since joining the World Trade Organization in 2001, China has surpassed Mexico in the U.S. clothing market, increasing its market share from 11.9% in 2001 to 22.6% in 2006. Meanwhile, Mexico's market share declined from 13.0% in 2002 to 7.4% in 2006. Hong Kong, once the top source of U.S. clothing imports, gradually declined and dropped out of the top five suppliers by 2006. India emerged as a major player, entering the top five list in 2001 and rapidly increasing its market share. In 2006, India rose to third place in U.S. clothing imports with a market share of 5.1%, while China's market share increased to 29.1%. Mexico's market share declined to 7.4%. Indonesia entered the top five for the first time, pushing out Honduras. Bangladesh overtook Hong Kong for fifth place. In 2006, Bangladesh surpassed Hong Kong to become the fifth-largest supplier of U.S. textile imports. China has become the top supplier of U.S. textile imports, but it does not dominate the market like it does for clothing. The top textile suppliers to the United States have not experienced absolute declines in sales, unlike clothing suppliers. From 1990 to 2006, Canada was the leading source of textile imports, but in 2006, China took over that position. In 2006, Bangladesh became the fifth-largest U.S. textile supplier, with China leading the market. Japan dropped from the top five, while India rose to third place. Italy, Mexico, and South Korea maintained their market share among U.S. textile suppliers. Italy held a 4.9% market share in 2006, South Korea's share decreased to 7.6%, and Mexico's share declined to 7.4%. In 2006, China remained the top U.S. textile supplier, with Bangladesh entering the top five. Textile imports from Canada increased by $177 million, while Canada's exports rose by $324 million. South Korea and Mexico also saw increases in textile imports by $250 million and $224 million respectively between 1997 and 2006. The elimination of clothing and textile quotas occurred in four phases from 1995 to 2005. The removal of clothing and textile quotas in four phases from 1995 to 2005 did not lead to a significant increase in U.S. imports. Data shows no apparent growth in imports after quota elimination in phases 2 and 3, with only a modest increase in phase 4 followed by a decline in 2006. This suggests other factors may have influenced U.S. clothing and textile imports. The removal of clothing and textile quotas from 1995 to 2005 did not significantly increase U.S. imports. Several mitigating factors complicate the analysis, including China's WTO accession, the economic impact of the September 11 attacks on U.S. imports, and the imposition of U.S. trade policies. The imposition of U.S. safeguard measures on Chinese clothing and textile imports may have obscured the effects of quota removals on trade flows. U.S. clothing imports grew faster than textile imports, with China and India emerging as leading suppliers. The rise of China and India as leading suppliers of clothing and textiles to the United States did not result in a major decline in imports from other suppliers. U.S. import data does not show significant surges in imports following the termination of quotas. China's accession to the WTO and the phased elimination of trade barriers allowed it to become the top supplier of clothing and textiles to the U.S. The ATC removed trade barriers for China to export more clothing and textiles to the US. Official trade statistics between the US and China differ significantly. Analyzing China's clothing exports can determine if the recent increase is unique to the US or a general trend. China's clothing export data shows a similar trend over the last 10 years. China's clothing export data is similar to the U.S., with minor differences. The U.S. reports higher clothing imports from China, but the gap is narrowing. Chinese data shows a spike in clothing exports in 2005, while U.S. data shows a smoother increase from 2003 to 2006. These differences may have political implications. It is important to determine if China's clothing exports are rising in general. China's clothing exports to the United States have been steadily increasing, with the U.S. capturing a growing portion of China's clothing exports. In 2006, the U.S. represented 18.0% of China's clothing export market. China's total clothing exports have been rising steadily since 2002, but its exports to the U.S. have grown in a more uneven fashion, with significant increases in 2004, 2005, and 2006. China's textile exports also saw a steady increase in value starting in 2001, contributing over $37 billion to China's exports in 2006. Textile exports from China to the United States saw a steady increase in value starting in 2001, with a significant acceleration in 2005. The U.S. market share of China's textile exports rose from 3.2% to 5.3% in 2005 but declined to 4.7% in 2006. China and the United States both show rapid growth in clothing and textile trade over the last decade, with notable increases after the termination of the ATC. There was a significant jump in China's clothing and textile exports in 2005, followed by a growth slowdown in 2006. Trade levels between 2001 and 2002 saw a notable increase, with higher growth rates continuing until 2004. In 2006, U.S. clothing and textile imports from China declined to $3.6 billion, similar to annual increases from 1991 to 1995. The data also highlight differences between clothing and textile trade. China has become a key source of U.S. clothing and textile imports, with the U.S. market increasing in importance for China over the last decade. However, Canada poses competition for China in the textile market. The U.S. is more reliant on importing clothing and textiles from China than vice versa, with implications for trade imbalance and potential trade remedies. The termination of the ATC could impact the U.S. clothing and textile industry, leading to potential job losses and reduced competitiveness for manufacturers. Statistics show mixed evidence on the impact of the quota elimination on domestic production and employment in the industry from 1990 to 2005. The value of clothing and textile production in the U.S. rose between 1990 and 1997, but employment declined. Starting in 1998, both production and employment for U.S. clothing and textile manufacturers began to decline. The recent decreases in domestic clothing and textile production and employment coincide with the removal of ATC quotas, but the timing and pace of these decreases raise doubts about the significance of the correlation. Domestic clothing production remained largely unchanged after the phase 1 quotas were eliminated, and the value of textile output actually increased. The largest reduction in textile production and the second largest declines in clothing production occurred in 2001, not a year when quotas were lifted. While the value of U.S. clothing production has sharply declined since 2001, textile production has nearly leveled off. The impact of quota removal on domestic clothing and textile labor trends is analyzed. Job losses in the clothing industry peaked from 1995 to 2003, coinciding with the first three phases of quota removals. However, job losses have slowed since 2005. In the textile industry, staff reductions accelerated after the second quota removal in 1998. The decline in production and employment in the U.S. clothing and textile industry during the quota removals may indicate an adverse impact. Statistical analysis questions impact of quota removal on U.S. manufacturers. Mixed results from econometric models on production decline. Anecdotal evidence suggests increase in imports harming U.S. manufacturers. Government report highlights secular increases in imports. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) highlighted the rise in Chinese brassiere and sock imports as evidence of market disruption post-quota removal. However, there was no direct proof linking increased imports to a decline in U.S. production or employment. U.S. clothing and textile manufacturers often use import spikes, particularly from China, to show harm from quota removal. For instance, a coalition of manufacturers noted a 140% surge in Chinese exports alongside the closure of 50 U.S. factories, implying a connection. The coalition of manufacturers claimed a 400% increase in Chinese imports of clothing and textiles, with China capturing a significant portion of the U.S. market. They urged the U.S. government to initiate a special safeguard to prevent further plant closings and job losses. The surge in clothing and textile imports from China led to the U.S. invoking a safeguard provision to prevent market disruption. This resulted in pressure on U.S. manufacturers to reduce production costs and jobs due to lower import prices. The surge in clothing and textile imports from China led to the U.S. invoking a safeguard provision to prevent market disruption. The special safeguard provision for Chinese clothing and textile imports expires on December 31, 2008, and is regulated under section 204 of the Agriculture Act of 1956. The Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements (CITA) administers safeguard measures for Chinese imports. U.S. manufacturers petitioned CITA in 2003 and 2004 for quotas on Chinese imports. Clothing and textile manufacturers petitioned the CITA for quotas on Chinese imports due to market disruption. Quotas were imposed on 10 categories in 2005, with concerns of a second surge in Chinese exports after safeguards were removed. In 2004, U.S. clothing manufacturers and labor unions petitioned the CITA for preemptive quotas on Chinese imports. The CITA agreed to consider the petitions, leading to negotiations between China and the United States. In 2005, they signed the \"U.S.-China MOU\" to restrict the rate of increase in clothing and textile exports. The U.S.-China MOU covers most categories of clothing and textiles for 2006-2008, setting annual import increase rates. Safeguards are enforced cooperatively using ELVIS. CITA terminated pending petitions after the MOU signing. Oversight is by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and China's Ministry of Commerce. Chinese exporters bid for export visas under \"Measures for Administration on Textile Export.\" In 2006, the U.S.-China MOU established quotas for clothing and textiles, but many quotas were underutilized. Some analysts believe that market adjustments to the termination of the ATC quotas occurred in 2005, while others think U.S. importers were risk-averse in 2006. Trade data confirm predictions made by market analysts before the quotas were terminated. Global clothing and textile trade has grown rapidly after 2005, with China benefiting significantly. China secured a large portion of the increase in clothing trade and its textile exports also rose substantially. The United States is importing more clothing and textiles from China as predicted. However, there are unexpected patterns in the trade data, with no major shifts in production as anticipated. Most nations have been able to maintain the value of their clothing exports. The data suggests that after the termination of ATC quotas, most nations maintained their clothing and textiles exports value. China and India were able to expand their exports, with China capturing most of the market growth. The surge in Chinese exports in 2005 was smaller than expected, possibly due to safeguard measures. China's share of the U.S. clothing and textile markets in 2006 was below projections. The U.S.-China MOU quotas were underutilized in 2006, suggesting a decrease in Chinese clothing and textile exports. U.S. clothing and trade data show mixed impacts of the end of ATC quotas on production and employment. U.S. clothing textile production increased initially but declined after China's WTO accession. Employment in the industry decreased steadily from 1990 to 2005, not necessarily linked to quota elimination. Safeguard measures may have lessened the negative effects of quota termination. The 2006 ATC quotas were not fully utilized, indicating that safeguards may not be preventing Chinese imports from replacing U.S. manufacturers and workers. A significant increase in clothing and textile imports began before the end of the quotas, with U.S. total imports rising by $5.8 billion in 2003. The textile market saw a major increase in total imports in 2004. China's accession to the WTO in 2001 may have contributed to this growth. The use of trade remedies by the United States was predicted accurately, but some aspects were not foreseen. The analysts did not predict the \"pre-emptive\" petitioning of the CITA for safeguard measures before January 1, 2005. There are reports of U.S. clothing and textile companies considering legal action against Chinese imports following a countervailing duty decision. The termination of ATC quotas in 2005 led to a growth in clothing and textile imports, contributing to the U.S. bilateral trade deficit with China. The termination of ATC quotas in 2005 led to a surge in Chinese imports, contributing to the U.S. bilateral trade deficit. There are legal uncertainties regarding U.S. manufacturers petitioning for safeguard measures or countervailing duties. Several bills have been introduced to address countervailing duties on non-market economies like China. Several bills, including H.R. 321, H.R. 782, H.R. 1002, S. 364, and S. 796, aim to reduce Chinese imports by addressing currency undervaluation. The Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform Act of 2007 (H.R. 1729) seeks to expand assistance for clothing and textile workers. Despite the increase in Chinese goods, trade promotion programs like GSP are helping nations maintain their export volumes to the U.S. Trade preference programs like GSP, Andean Trade Preference Act, and Caribbean Basin Initiative, along with free trade agreements such as NAFTA, can benefit competitive industries in less industrialized nations. These programs may help clothing and textile manufacturers in beneficiary countries compete against Chinese suppliers. Congress should consider the clothing and textile industry in the post-ATC era during deliberations on renewing trade preference programs and ratifying free trade agreements."
