    "content": "In the United States, flood-related responsibilities are shared among local, state, and federal governments. Local governments make zoning decisions for floodplain development, while state and federal activities influence flood risk management. State and local entities are mainly responsible for constructing and maintaining flood control measures, while the federal government plays a significant role in building infrastructure and providing support for hazard mitigation and insurance. The federal government supports hazard mitigation, flood and crop insurance, and provides emergency response and disaster aid for significant floods. Dams serving flood control purposes have varying ownership and operational responsibilities, with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers playing a key role. FEMA is responsible for federal hazard mitigation, the National Flood Insurance Program, and disaster assistance. The Corps also repairs damaged flood control works, with extensive demand expected post-Sandy. Funding for Corps activities is often appropriated separately. The federal government supports hazard mitigation, flood and crop insurance, and provides emergency response and disaster aid for significant floods. Various federal agencies are involved in flood-related activities, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Interior, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and the International Boundary and Water Commission. There is a growing interest in reducing reliance on emergency supplementals for flood response funding and reevaluating flood responsibilities and investments. In July 2012, the 112th Congress enacted modifications to FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program through September 30, 2017. Despite improvements in forecasting and emergency response, significant flood risk remains, with storms causing flooding outside the 100-year floodplain and storm surges leading to extensive damages. Congress has made few changes to federal flood policies and programs since 2005. Significant storms can cause flooding that exceeds the ability of levees, floodwalls, seawalls, and dunes to protect lives and investments. Hurricane Sandy and Hurricane Katrina showed the risks to life, economic disruption, and social hardships during floodwaters and storm surge. Flood risk is determined by the threat of an event, vulnerability, and consequences. Flood risk increases with development and population in flood-prone areas. Various options are available for reducing flood risk. Ex-post analysis of Hurricane Sandy will help understand the storm's surge and flood hazard compared to previous storms and future conditions. FEMA and the Corps are the main agencies involved in flood control projects and repair. FEMA's role is broader in coordinating federal activities for emergency flood assistance. The Stafford Act authorizes FEMA to direct federal agencies to provide assistance for flood response and recovery. Public Assistance program funds can reimburse communities for flood-fighting activities and emergency repairs to eligible infrastructure, but not for new flood control measures. Hurricane Sandy caused significant damage to existing hurricane protection projects. FEMA's policies on disaster assistance eligibility for hurricane protection projects using dunes and sand-based measures are under scrutiny. Congress granted the Corps emergency response authority in P.L. 84-99 to combat floods and repair flood control works. Limited funding for these activities is typically included in the annual Energy and Water Development appropriations acts. The Corps has received $25 billion in supplemental funding since 2001, with the majority going towards reengineering Hurricane Katrina-damaged floodwalls and levees in Southeast Louisiana. This reliance on significant supplemental funding is prompting questions about alternative funding methods for Corps work. Supplemental funding for Corps work is raising questions about alternative ways to fund activities. Congress has authorized the Corps to conduct disaster preparedness, advance measures, emergency operations, emergency dredging, and flood-related rescue operations. The Corps assists with repairs to damaged flood control works like dams, levees, and dunes. The Corps conducts repair and rehabilitation activities on damaged flood control works like dams, levees, and dunes through its Rehabilitation and Inspection Program (RIP). Funding for these repairs often comes from emergency supplementals, with smaller repairs funded within existing budgets. For example, in 2011, $388 million was allocated for repairs related to Midwest flooding, and in 2008, $740 million was allocated for repairs in response to Midwest flooding. The program received $740 million for repairs in response to Midwest flooding through the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008. Eligible repairs for flood control projects must be in active status with the RIP program at the time of damage. Works eligible for inclusion in RIP include locally maintained levees and floodwalls, as well as federally authorized hurricane and shore protective measures. Repair costs for locally constructed projects are split 80% by the Corps and 20% by the nonfederal entity, while federally constructed projects are entirely a federal responsibility. The cost of repair for hurricane protection projects damaged by Hurricane Sandy is a federal responsibility, except for the costs of obtaining materials. Rehabilitation assistance is limited to restoring projects to their pre-disaster level, with no betterments allowed. Nonfederal entities must cover rehabilitation costs due to deficient maintenance. Actions eligible for repair must address critical project functions, and nourishment may be part of the repair effort or occur later. Timing and nourishment can be planned for immediately as part of a repair, but improvements are restricted under RIP funds. If federal participation is needed for increased protection, a separate flood damage reduction project through a Corps study is typically pursued. Congress has historically authorized Corps studies and construction projects for flood-damaged communities after significant storms. Since 2010, congressional action on committee resolutions for Corps studies, WRDA bills, and Corps appropriations have been complicated by earmark moratoriums. Developing and investing in flood-prone areas represents a tradeoff between economic benefits and flood hazards. Recent natural disasters have renewed interest in tools to improve flood resiliency. Congress faces the challenge of enacting feasible flood policies to reduce risk and incentivize mitigation efforts. To address the challenge of reducing flood risk while respecting private property rights and local decision-making, adjustments are needed in flood insurance, disaster aid, and flood risk reduction programs."
