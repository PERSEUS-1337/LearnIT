Summarized curr_chunk: Section 1120A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to address comparability of services in local educational agencies. Section 1120A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to address comparability of services in local educational agencies, focusing on state and local per-pupil expenditures for schools not served under this part. Alternative comparability is required for agencies serving all schools under their jurisdiction, ensuring equitable funding for high-poverty schools compared to low-poverty schools. The local educational agency must exclude certain State or local funds when determining comparability of services for high-poverty and low-poverty schools. This exclusion applies to excess costs for English learners and children with disabilities, as well as capital expenditures. The local educational agency must demonstrate compliance with expenditure requirements by submitting per-pupil, personnel, non-personnel, and total expenditures for each school served. Unpredictable changes in student enrollment or personnel assignments after the school year begins are not included in determining compliance. The local educational agency must report per-pupil, personnel, non-personnel, and total expenditures for each school served to the State educational agency by October 31, 2014. This requirement does not apply to agencies with only one building per grade span. Each State educational agency must ensure that information on per-pupil expenditures is publicly available, including a school-by-school listing. Local educational agencies failing to meet requirements must develop a compliance plan for the following year. Prior to the 2015-2016 school year, local educational agencies had to meet certain requirements to receive funds under this part. The Secretary was responsible for ensuring a smooth transition between the old and new requirements of this section. The Secretary will define terms such as 'per-pupil expenditure' and 'high-poverty school' in the regulations for this subsection."
