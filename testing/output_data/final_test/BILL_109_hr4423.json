    "content": "The \"Ethiopia Consolidation Act of 2005\" supports human rights, democracy, and economic freedom in Ethiopia to enhance its role in promoting stability, democracy, and economic development in Africa. Despite improvements in its human rights record, the Government of Ethiopia continues to violate the rights of its citizens, including unlawful killings, arbitrary arrests, long detentions without trial, and torture, with violations increasing after the 2005 elections. According to reports, the Ethiopian judiciary shows signs of independence but the justice system remains inadequate in upholding human and civil rights. Ethiopia allows freedom of religion but local authorities infringe on this right. Journalists are imprisoned, and the government refuses to revise a repressive media bill. Literacy in Ethiopia is below 50 percent. The Ethiopian Government's delay in issuing licenses for private radio and television has led to a monopoly by the Ethiopian Broadcasting Service, limiting freedom of information. The President will provide support for human rights training and capacity building in Ethiopia, including training for government officials on international human rights standards. The President will provide necessary training for Ethiopian police, security, and prison personnel in recognizing international standards for handling prisoners. Additionally, support will be given for training Ethiopian court personnel on ensuring human and civil rights during the pre-trial and trial process. The Government of the United States will encourage Ethiopia to follow its laws and ensure transparent licensing of independent radio and television to broaden citizens' access to information. The United States will support democratization in Ethiopia. The ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front has maintained power since 1991. Human Rights Watch reported harassment and torture of government critics. The European Union accused the Ethiopian government of using hate speech during the 2005 elections. The Government of Ethiopia expelled three US NGOs promoting democratic development in 2005. Complaints about the 2005 elections were lodged by opposition and ruling parties, with most opposition filings dismissed. International election observers reported on the turnout. The Government of Ethiopia failed to release full election results from May 15, 2005, creating uncertainty and suspicion about the validity of the election. Congress urges transparency and a legal review of questionable results. Congress urges the Government of Ethiopia to readmit expelled United States Democracy Organizations and provide support for training political parties and civil society groups in election monitoring to ensure progress in the electoral process. The President will provide assistance to facilitate communication between political parties and the Government of Ethiopia through the National Electoral Board to address issues related to the credibility of the next election in Ethiopia. Support for economic development in Ethiopia. The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia's governance ratings have worsened in government effectiveness, regulatory quality, and control of corruption. The economy is ranked as mostly unfree due to bureaucratic obstacles and a lack of property rights protection. Ethiopia's land policy remains unchanged despite concerns. Ethiopia's land policy, which considers all land as public property, hinders financing for ventures and exposes investors to risks from smallholders. The Ethiopian diaspora in the US accuses the government of not fulfilling promises to return confiscated property. The country's poverty reduction strategy highlights widespread poverty, affecting nearly half of the population in urban and rural areas. The dire situation in Ethiopia's agriculture sector is worsened by government policies such as refusal to allow private land ownership, excessive taxation of farmers, and high fertilizer costs. Economic policy assistance is provided to address obstacles like budgeting, taxation, debt management, and anti-money laundering. The President will provide assistance for sustainable development of Ethiopia's Nile and Awash River resources, including technology for dams, irrigation systems, and hydroelectric power to prevent famine. Adequate financing for US-Ethiopian commercial ventures will be facilitated through various programs. The Small Business Administration, Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and Export-Import Bank of the United States offer programs to support small and medium enterprises, structural finance, and export initiatives, including the Short-Term Africa Pilot Program. SEC. 6. ENSURING GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, DEMOCRACY, AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. Congress finds that Ethiopia is a key US partner in the Horn of Africa region, with a strong military involved in peacekeeping operations. Two opposition groups have engaged in armed struggle against the government, but attacks have been limited. Ethiopia has seen significant growth in its Muslim population, now nearly equal to Christians. This religious shift poses a potential conflict that requires proactive efforts to minimize. The US has suspended joint security activities with Ethiopia until a certification is made. The President must certify to Congress that Ethiopia is upholding human rights and the rule of law, including investigating civilian killings. Congress acknowledges the border dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea as a potential conflict that needs resolution. Assistance is prohibited until the issue is addressed. Funds for assistance to the central Governments of Ethiopia or Eritrea are prohibited unless the Secretary of State certifies compliance with the Algiers Agreements. Assistance for democracy, rule of law, peacekeeping, child survival, and health is exempt from this prohibition. Assistance for democracy promotion in Ethiopia may be provided to ruling and opposition parties, with restrictions on non-essential assistance if the government obstructs support for opposition parties. Support for OLF Reintegration: Congress urges the US government to encourage Ethiopia to engage in discussions with the Oromo Liberation Front to facilitate their participation in the country's political and economic affairs. The US government should assist Ethiopia in legalizing the Oromo Liberation Front as a political party to help achieve their participation in the country's affairs. The President must report to Congress within 180 days on the implementation of the Act, addressing security, human rights, democratization, and economic concerns in Ethiopia. $10,000,000 is authorized for each of the fiscal years 2007 and 2008 to carry out the Act."
