    "content": "The Act titled \"Federal Land Invasive Species Control, Prevention, and Management Act\" aims to effectively manage Federal land, including National Monuments and National Heritage Areas, to protect important natural resources from invasive species such as soil, vegetation, archeological sites, water resources, and rare habitats. The Act defines key terms such as \"control\" as eradication, suppression, or reduction of invasive species, \"ecosystem\" as a community of organisms and their environment, \"eligible State\" as including states and territories, and \"invasive species\" as alien species introduced into an area. The term \"alien species\" refers to non-native species that can cause economic, environmental, or human health harm. This includes any species not native to a specific ecosystem, as determined by relevant authorities. The terms \"manage\" and \"management\" for invasive species involve actively reducing spread, preventing infestations, and investigating detection methods. \"Prevent\" refers to hindering the introduction of invasive species onto land or water. The term \"Secretary concerned\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior, responsible for Federal land administered through various agencies. The term \"species\" refers to a group of organisms with physical and genetic similarities, interbreeding among themselves, and showing differences from allied groups. Federal efforts to control and manage invasive species on federal land are outlined in Section 4. Each Secretary concerned must plan and implement activities to control and manage invasive species on land managed by them, aiming to reduce invasive species populations and support restoration efforts. They are required to develop a strategic plan to achieve a net reduction of invasive species populations or infested acreage annually, in coordination with affected eligible States. The Secretary concerned must develop a strategic plan in collaboration with eligible States, political subdivisions, and Indian tribes to address invasive species. Factors such as economic and ecological costs must be considered in the planning process. SEC. 5. PROGRAM FUNDING ALLOCATIONS. The Secretary concerned must allocate at least 75 percent of the funds for invasive species management programs for on-the-ground control and management. This includes purchasing necessary products, using integrated pest management options, biological control agents, and revegetation methods to improve ecosystems. The Secretary concerned must allocate at least 75 percent of funds for on-the-ground control and management of invasive species. Up to 15 percent can be used for investigations, development activities, and outreach efforts, while no more than 10 percent can be used for administrative costs. Reporting Requirements: Each Secretary must submit a report to Congress within 60 days after the second fiscal year, detailing the use of funds for programs addressing invasive species management and specifying the percentage of funds spent on different purposes. SEC. 6. PRUDENT USE OF FUNDS. The Secretary must prioritize cost-effective methods for controlling invasive species, based on scientific data and economic assessments. Certain projects are exempt from environmental impact assessments under the National Environmental Policy Act. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 exempts certain projects from environmental impact assessments if they are conducted in accordance with applicable agency procedures and are located in high-risk areas managed by the Secretary concerned. The curr_chunk states that certain projects are restricted within 1,000 feet of various locations such as ports of entry, water projects, schools, and other valuable infrastructure. The curr_chunk discusses the Secretary's authority in relation to controlling, preventing, and managing invasive species, as well as the limitations on interfering with public water supply systems for the same purpose. The Secretary's authority in controlling invasive species and limitations on interfering with public water supply systems. Use of partnerships emphasized. The Secretary may enter contracts or agreements with other entities to control invasive species, requiring a memorandum of understanding outlining the partnership and management activities. The Secretary may enter contracts or agreements with other entities to control invasive species, requiring a memorandum of understanding detailing the management activities, including a prioritized listing of invasive species, assessment of infested areas, expected outcomes after control efforts, and descriptions of pest management options with economic assessments. The Secretary may enter contracts or agreements with other entities to control invasive species, requiring a memorandum of understanding detailing management activities, including coordination of control efforts and compliance with the Federal Noxious Weed Act. Public outreach and awareness efforts are included in contracts or agreements related to invasive species control. The purpose of invasive species-related investigations is to develop solutions and recommendations for their management and control. The curr_chunk focuses on faster implementation of control and management methods for invasive species. The curr_chunk emphasizes the need for coordination with affected local governments for projects and activities under the Act, in line with the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976."
