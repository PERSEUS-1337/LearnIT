    "content": "The Oil Subsidy Elimination for New Strategies on Energy Act, also known as the Oil SENSE Act, includes provisions for the termination of certain sections of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, suspension of royalty relief, and repeal of energy tax incentives. Congress finds that record highs in oil and natural gas prices have led to significant profits for producers and refiners. Oil prices are expected to remain high, with a substantial amount of oil and gas extracted from the Gulf of Mexico exempt from royalty payments, potentially resulting in a significant loss of government revenue. The top 5 oil companies' CEOs acknowledged these issues during a joint hearing in November 2005. The CEOs of top oil companies stated in a 2005 hearing that they did not require federal tax incentives from the Energy Policy Act. The President urged the Senate to eliminate subsidies for oil and gas exploration, focusing instead on renewable energy development. The development of renewable energy resources in the United States will promote jobs, investment, innovation, and economic development in rural, agriculture-dependent areas. TITLE I--TERMINATION OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE ENERGY POLICY ACT OF 2005\n\nSEC. 101. TERMINATION OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE ENERGY POLICY ACT OF 2005. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 provisions related to production incentives, natural gas production, royalty relief, Alaska offshore royalty suspension, OCS oil and gas resources inventory, and Federal oil and gas leasing programs are repealed. Subtitle J of title IX (42 U.S.C. 16371 et seq.) relates to ultra-deepwater and unconventional natural gas and petroleum resources. Section 8(a)(3)(B) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act is amended to terminate the Alaska Offshore Royalty Suspension, effective as of the date of enactment of this Act. TITLE II--SUSPENSION OF ROYALTY RELIEF\n\nSEC. 201. SUSPENSION OF ROYALTY RELIEF. The Secretary of the Interior shall suspend relief from royalty payments for oil and gas production on Federal land if certain price thresholds are met. The Secretary determines average prices based on Energy Information Administration data and adjusts dollar amounts annually based on changes in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers. SEC. 202. RENEGOTIATION OF EXISTING LEASES. The Secretary must renegotiate existing leases on Federal land for oil or gas production to ensure royalties are paid. Failure to renegotiate will result in ineligibility for new leases or lease transfers. The Secretary must renegotiate existing leases on Federal land for oil or gas production to ensure royalties are paid. (B) enters into an agreement with the Secretary to modify the terms of the lease. SEC. 301. Repeal of certain provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 that provided tax subsidies for the oil and gas industry. Repeal of tax subsidies for oil and gas industry by amending certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Effective dates for changes specified in the Oil Subsidy Elimination for New Strategies on Energy Act. The amendment repeals tax subsidies for the oil and gas industry, affecting property placed in service after the enactment date. It also modifies the treatment of natural gas gathering lines and the rule for determining small refiner exceptions to the oil depletion deduction. Effective dates for these changes are specified in the Oil Subsidy Elimination for New Strategies on Energy Act. The code is amended to exclude certain refiners from subsection (c) if refinery runs exceed 50,000 barrels. The effective date for this amendment is after the enactment of the Act. Additionally, the amortization of geological and geophysical expenditures is repealed by striking subsection (h) in Section 167 of the Code. The code amendment excludes certain refiners if refinery runs exceed 50,000 barrels. The effective date for this change is after the Act's enactment. Amendments made by this subsection apply to amounts paid or incurred after the enactment date."
