This section adds a new part to Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, focusing on promoting youth financial literacy. The `Youth Financial Education Act' aims to promote financial literacy among young adults to help them succeed in the American economy. Despite the importance of financial knowledge, many high school graduates lack basic skills in managing personal finances. A 1997 survey by the Jump$tart Coalition found that on average, 12th graders answered only 57 percent of financial knowledge questions correctly. The survey found that only 57 percent of respondents answered questions correctly, with just 5 percent receiving a `C' grade or better. An evaluation showed that 10 hours of financial education can significantly impact teens' money management. Despite recognition of the importance of financial education, only 14 states required schools to implement personal finance standards by 1999. States mandated schools to incorporate personal finance standards into the academic curriculum to enhance youth financial literacy. Teacher training is crucial for this goal, as many economics teachers lack formal education in personal finance. Personal financial education equips students with essential life skills, individual responsibility, and consumer economics knowledge for financial independence and workforce readiness. Financial education in schools integrates valuable life skills with economics, covering income, taxes, money management, investment, spending, and personal savings. The teaching of personal finance is encouraged at all levels of the educational system, from kindergarten through grade 12, to prepare the consumers and investors of tomorrow. The State Grant Program (SEC. 10994) aims to support financial education in schools, teaching valuable life skills related to income, taxes, money management, investment, spending, and personal savings from kindergarten through grade 12. The Secretary is authorized to provide grants to State educational agencies for youth financial education programs in elementary and secondary schools. States must submit an approved State plan to receive a grant, detailing fund usage, program coordination, and evaluation methods. The Secretary allocates funds to States based on student populations in grades K-12. Each State must receive a minimum of $500,000 if they have an approved plan. Reallocation of funds may occur in any fiscal year. In any fiscal year, funds allocated to States without an approved plan or with a disapproved plan will be reallocated to States with approved plans. Grant funds must be used to provide financial education programs for students in grades K-12. The curr_chunk discusses the allocation of grant funds for financial education programs, including teaching personal financial management skills, professional development for educators, and program monitoring. States receiving grants are limited to using 4% for administrative costs. Each state educational agency must submit a report to the Secretary annually regarding the grant's use. The report must detail the programs funded by the grant and the State's evaluation of those programs. The report must detail the programs funded by the grant and the State's evaluation of those programs. SEC. 10995. CLEARINGHOUSE. The Secretary will grant funds to an organization experienced in financial education to establish a national clearinghouse for financial education programs. Organizations must apply to operate the Clearinghouse on a competitive basis for a 5-year term. The Clearinghouse, established through a competitive grant, will maintain instructional materials for financial education programs in schools and provide dissemination and technical assistance to States and the public. The Clearinghouse provides technical assistance on financial education programs for schools, consulting with relevant government agencies, receiving program information from federal departments, and complying with copyright laws. \"SEC. 10996. EVALUATION AND REPORT.\" The Secretary will develop performance measures to evaluate programs assisted under sections 10994 and 10995. Using these measures, programs will be evaluated for performance, effectiveness, best practices, and potential replication. A report will be transmitted annually for each fiscal year with appropriations under section 10999(a). The Secretary will transmit a report to Congress detailing the implementation status of this part, including evaluation results and descriptions of supported programs under section 10994. \"SEC. 10997. DEFINITIONS.\" The term 'financial education' refers to educational activities supervised by qualified teachers that help students understand economic principles and manage personal finances. 'Local educational agency', 'State educational agency', and 'outlying area' have specific meanings. A 'qualified teacher' holds a valid teaching certification or is deemed qualified by the State educational agency. The term 'Secretary' refers to the Secretary of Education, and 'State' includes the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and outlying areas. SEC. 10998 prohibits federal officers from controlling state or local educational content for funding eligibility. SEC. 10999 authorizes appropriations. Authorization of Appropriations: $100,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated annually from 2000 to 2004 for the purposes outlined in this section. Additionally, there are limitations on the use of funds for specific purposes such as clearinghouse activities and Secretary evaluation. Administrative costs are also restricted to ensure efficient use of the allocated funds."
