    "content": "The \"Save Our Seas Act of 2017\" or the \"SOS Act of 2017\" amends the Marine Debris Act to include working with other Federal agencies to develop outreach and education strategies for marine debris and promoting international action to reduce marine debris. It also provides assistance for severe marine debris events. Section 3 of the Marine Debris Act is amended to include assistance for severe marine debris events. The Administrator can provide funding for cleanup and response efforts in cooperation with affected states. The Administrator can prioritize assistance for activities in response to severe marine debris events in rural or remote communities or habitats of national concern. The Federal government will fund a portion of the costs for these activities. The Federal Government will fund 100% of the cost for activities responding to severe marine debris events if funded by a foreign entity, and 75% for other activities. Administrative expenses are limited to 5% of the funds for the activity. The Sense of Congress on international engagement to respond to marine debris is highlighted in Section 4. The President should support funding for research on environmentally friendly materials to reduce ocean waste, collaborate with countries contributing to marine debris, and conduct studies on waste management's impact on oceans. The President should work with countries contributing to marine debris to establish new international agreements aimed at reducing land-based sources of marine debris and increasing investment in waste management infrastructure. Encourage the United States Trade Representative to consider the impact of marine debris in future trade agreements. SEC. 5. Membership of the Interagency Marine Debris Coordinating Committee is amended to include the Department of State and the Department of the Interior. SEC. 6. Authorization of Appropriations under the Marine Debris Act is amended. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2018 through 2022 includes $10,000,000 for the Administrator and $2,000,000 for the Coast Guard Commandant, with limits on administrative costs."
