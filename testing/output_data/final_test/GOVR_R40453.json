    "content": "Tibet became a recurring issue in congressional deliberations in the late 1980s due to the Dalai Lama's political activities, reports of human rights abuses in Tibet, and the lack of consensus on U.S. policy towards China. Congressional views on Tibet often differed from the White House, which officially recognizes Tibet as part of China. Since normalization of relations with China in 1979, U.S. Administrations have favored engagement with China, despite disagreements on Tibet. The Dalai Lama and the Tibetan exile community launched an international campaign in 1986-1987 to gain Western support for Tibet's cause and pressure Beijing for political concessions. This initiative aimed to protect Tibetan culture and garner U.S. support, despite the White House's recognition of Tibet as part of China. In 1987, Congress pressured the White House to protect Tibetan culture and elevate Tibet's status in U.S. law, despite China's objections. The Dalai Lama's political speech in the U.S. and Congress's non-binding measures marked significant steps towards supporting Tibet. In 2002, Congress increased activity on Tibet's status by mentioning Tibet separately in legislation related to China. In 1990, Congress singled out Tibet in foreign relations legislation, closely resembling the Dalai Lama's proposed five points. In 1994, Congress enacted Tibetan-related provisions in the Foreign Relations Authorization Act. Since 1986, Congress has made efforts to raise the profile of Tibet, but U.S. Administrations have generally resisted in a low-profile manner. In 2002, Congress mentioned Tibet separately in legislation related to China, and in 1990, singled out Tibet in foreign relations legislation resembling the Dalai Lama's proposed five points. Since 1986, Congress has worked to elevate Tibet's status, leading to U.S. Administrations subtly acknowledging the Tibetan community-in-exile. President George H. W. Bush and President Bill Clinton met with the Dalai Lama, causing tension with Chinese leaders. The Clinton Administration compromised with Tibet's supporters by creating the Special Coordinator for Tibet position, and Congress proposed establishing a U.S. Special Envoy for Tibet with ambassadorial rank in 1994. In 1994, Senator Claiborne Pell proposed creating a Special Envoy for Tibet to focus White House attention on Tibet-related issues. Despite not being enacted, similar provisions were introduced in subsequent Congresses, calling for the Special Envoy to have ambassadorial rank and promote negotiations between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese government. The Clinton Administration opposed these provisions due to concerns about creating an ambassadorial rank position. The 101st Congress began providing U.S. assistance to Tibet in 1990 through various legislative provisions, including funding for Voice of America and Radio Free Asia broadcasts in Tibetan, scholarships for Tibetans living outside Tibet, and an educational and cultural exchange program with Tibet. Congressional earmarks have played a significant role in the allocation of assistance to Tibet. Establishment of an educational and cultural exchange program with Tibet, later renamed the Ngawang Choepel Exchange Program, funded at $500,000 in each of fiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2003; Authorization of funds for humanitarian assistance to Tibetans who have fled from China to Nepal and India, amounting to $2 million in each of fiscal years 2001 and 2002, and $2 million in FY2003; Provision of Economic Support Fund (ESF) assistance for non-governmental organizations supporting Tibetan environment and cultural traditions, starting at $1 million in FY2000 and increasing to $5 million in the 110th Congress. The Tibetan Policy Act of 2001, introduced by Senator Dianne Feinstein and Representative Tom Lantos, aimed to support the Tibetan people's identity. The main components of the act were later included in the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of FY2003 as \"The Tibetan Policy Act of 2002.\" This act established U.S. principles on human rights, religious freedom, political prisoners, and economic development in Tibet, and created the position of Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues within the State Department. Annual reporting requirements on Sino-Tibetan relations were also mandated. The Tibetan Policy Act of 2001 established the position of Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues within the State Department to promote dialogue between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese government. It also mandates reporting on Sino-Tibetan negotiations and urges the State Department to seek establishment of a U.S. Consulate in Lhasa. The Tibetan Policy Act of 2001 established the position of Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues within the State Department to promote dialogue between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese government, maintain contact with Tibetan leaders, consult with Congress on Tibet policies, and coordinate with other foreign ministries for a negotiated settlement for Tibet. Congress has considered creating a U.S. Special Envoy for Tibet with ambassadorial rank to actively promote negotiations. The Tibetan Policy Act of 2001 established the position of Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues within the State Department to promote dialogue between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese government. Clinton Administration officials opposed giving ambassadorial rank to the Special Envoy due to concerns about political repercussions. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright designated a Special Coordinator without ambassadorial rank, with Gregory Craig initially serving in the position. Julia Taft later assumed the role but stepped down in 2001. The Tibetan Policy Act of 2001 established the position of Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues within the State Department. Paula Dobriansky served as the highest-level official in this role during the Bush Administration. The Act requires annual reporting on Sino-Tibetan dialogue and specifies steps for encouraging dialogue. As of now, a replacement for Dobriansky has not been named. The Tibetan Policy Act of 2001 mandates reporting on Sino-Tibetan dialogue and requires the inclusion of Tibet in relevant reports. It also amends P.L. 106-286 to include the status of Sino-Tibetan negotiations in the CECC's annual report. Additionally, the Act advocates for supporting Tibetan economic development projects that meet specific principles. The Tibetan Policy Act of 2001 emphasizes the importance of projects that meet specific principles for Tibetan economic development, including assessments of Tibetan needs, self-sufficiency, and cultural preservation. It also calls for efforts to release political and religious prisoners in Tibet and establish a monitoring office in Lhasa. The Tibetan Policy Act of 2001 emphasizes Tibetan language training for Foreign Service officers, urges the assignment of Tibetan-speaking U.S. officials in China, and calls for meetings with the 11th Panchen Lama. It also aims to end Chinese interference in Tibetan religious affairs. Views on the Act's effectiveness vary. The Tibetan Policy Act of 2001 focuses on Tibetan language training for Foreign Service officers, assigning Tibetan-speaking U.S. officials in China, and addressing Chinese interference in Tibetan religious affairs. Interviews with various stakeholders suggest that the Special Coordinators for Tibet have shown commitment to their responsibilities, with U.S. leverage benefiting from the senior-level position held by Paula Dobriansky. According to observers, a Special Coordinator at the Under-Secretary level has significant influence in U.S. policy issues, with access to the Secretary of State, participation in senior-level government meetings, and the opportunity to travel with the President to China and meet with the Dalai Lama. However, constraints hinder the position's ability to coordinate U.S. Tibet policy with other government departments. The TPA imposes obligations on U.S. government agencies regarding Tibet but lacks clear communication lines and coordination mechanisms. Suggestions include giving the Special Coordinator authority to convene a Policy Coordinating Committee on Tibet and revisiting the idea of granting ambassadorial rank to enhance the position's stature within the State Department. Some suggest broadening the TPA's mission to foster Sino-Tibetan dialogue through institutional mechanisms. Others believe the narrow focus on dialogue between the Dalai Lama and Beijing is counterproductive. The Special Coordinator for Tibet should focus on addressing internal Tibetan grievances for the well-being and autonomy of Tibetans, rather than solely relying on formal dialogue with the Dalai Lama, which may raise unrealistic expectations and lead to worsening situations in Tibet. The Tibetan Policy and Support Act (TPA) is being implemented, with provisions for Tibetan language training for U.S. foreign service officers and annual reports on Tibet submitted by U.S. agencies. The State Department provides regular reports to Congress on efforts to encourage negotiations with the Dalai Lama. Suggestions include making reports more accessible to the public, providing dates for coverage periods, and expanding the scope beyond Sino-Tibetan negotiations. The State Department provides annual reports on Tibet to Congress, including status reports on U.S. inter-agency meetings and coordination on Tibet policy. Tibet is also included in other annual reports mandated by Congress, such as the Country Reports on Human Rights Practices and the Report on International Religious Freedom. The Congressional-Executive Commission on China has included a section on Tibet in its annual reports since 2002. The effectiveness of the Tibetan Policy and Support Act has faced challenges, mostly due to actions by Beijing. The U.S. government has faced challenges in addressing issues with China, such as political and religious prisoners, meeting with the 11th Panchen Lama, and establishing an additional U.S. Consulate in the PRC. Despite efforts, little progress has been made in these areas. The U.S. government has struggled to address various issues with China, including political and religious prisoners, meeting the 11th Panchen Lama, and establishing a new U.S. Consulate in the PRC. Some observers believe that the implementation of \"Tibet Project Principles\" is hindered by the Special Coordinator's inability to involve other government agencies."
