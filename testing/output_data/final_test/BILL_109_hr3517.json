    "content": "The \"Greater Access to E-Governance Act\" or the \"GATE Act\" aims to establish a grant program for State and local governments to deploy broadband computer networks for electronic governance transactions in local schools and libraries. The Secretary will make grants to State and local governments for deploying community-based schools or communities of learning with electronic governance systems. Grants can be used to hire contractors for broadband networks enabling electronic governance transactions. The Secretary will provide grants for electronic governance systems in community-based schools or communities of learning. The grants can be used to acquire broadband infrastructure, computers, and software to support such networks. The Secretary will allocate funds for electronic governance systems in community-based schools or communities of learning, which can be used to acquire broadband infrastructure, computers, and software. The Secretary will decide grant allocation criteria for State and local governments to carry out activities related to broadband infrastructure deployment. Criteria include cost-benefit analysis, limiting Federal share to 60%, documentation of preexisting systems, expertise in IT deployment, and partnership contracts. The grant allocation criteria for broadband infrastructure deployment include partnership contracts, allocation to State agencies, and a requirement for 50% of the grant to benefit rural areas. The Secretary has the authority to issue necessary regulations for the Act. Appropriations are authorized for grants under the Act for fiscal year 2003 and the following 4 years. Definitions are provided in the Act. The Act defines \"broadband infrastructure\" as various mediums for internet access and \"electronic governance transaction\" as electronic interactions between citizens and government agencies. The curr_chunk discusses the definitions of terms related to the deployment of broadband infrastructure, such as deployment partnership contract, deployment entity, and Secretary. These terms are crucial for understanding the process of deploying and managing broadband networks."
