    "content": "Indoor pollution issues like toxic drywall, formaldehyde emissions, mold, asbestos, lead-based paint, radon, and PCBs in caulk have been a concern for scientists and regulators in the past 30 years. EPA identified indoor air quality as a significant environmental health risk in 1987, with human health risks indoors often greater than outdoors due to higher pollutant concentrations. EPA's Science Advisory Board endorsed this ranking in 1990 and called for increased funding for high-risk environmental problems. The agency was urged to prioritize funding for high-risk environmental problems, with indoor pollution identified as a significant public health risk. A 2011 report warned that climate change adaptations could worsen indoor air quality issues. Effective filtration and treatment technologies are needed to address increasing indoor pollutant concentrations resulting from energy-efficient home improvements. Federal statutes addressing indoor pollution and key issues are also discussed in the report. The focus is on indoor chemical contaminants that are potentially harmful to people and may be found in various buildings. Indoor pollutants can be natural or synthetic and may originate indoors or outdoors. Some substances, like lead or ozone, are also outdoor air pollutants. Some indoor pollutants, whether natural (like radon) or synthetic (such as PCBs), can come from indoor or outdoor sources. People can be exposed to these contaminants through air, water, or dust. Indoor pollution can result from fuel combustion for heating or cooking, with factors like fuel type, ventilation, and combustion efficiency affecting emissions. Smoke and carbon monoxide are common pollutants from combustion, which can worsen health conditions like asthma. In developing countries, indoor smoke is a significant concern according to the World Health Organization. Indoor air pollution, caused by inefficient stoves burning biomass fuels or coal, is responsible for 2 million deaths annually according to WHO. In the United States, indoor combustion from unvented heaters and generators can lead to carbon monoxide poisoning. Smoking and environmental tobacco smoke also contribute to indoor air pollution, especially harmful to young children's respiratory health. Indoor air pollution poses various health risks, including exposure to secondhand smoke, radon gas, and asbestos. Radon, a colorless gas formed naturally from rocks, can enter homes and accumulate, increasing the risk of lung cancer. EPA recommends testing homes for radon levels and fixing any levels above 4 picocuries per liter of air. Exposure to radon in homes contributes to about 20,000 lung cancer deaths annually. Asbestos, a fibrous mineral found in natural rock formations, is a leading cause of lung cancer deaths. Widely used in fire-retardant materials, asbestos fibers are released into indoor air when materials deteriorate or are disturbed during remodeling. Lead hazards in homes from lead-based paint, plumbing, or contaminated soil can lead to various health issues, especially in children, including brain damage, learning problems, and headaches. Exposure to lead in dust can lead to various health issues like slowed growth, hearing problems, and headaches. Indoor air pollution can also occur due to synthetic chemicals from building materials, paints, furnishings, and cleaning supplies. Outdoor contamination can intrude into homes through porous walls, heating/air conditioning systems, or contaminated drinking water. Prominent examples of industrial pollutants found indoors include formaldehyde from composite wood products, PCBs from deteriorating materials, and dry cleaning solvents like TCE and PERC. Perchlorate contamination from military munitions and fireworks is also a concern for indoor exposure. Pesticides can also contribute to indoor pollution. Pesticides released indoors, such as termiticides and insecticides, can be persistent indoor contaminants. Federal agencies have limited authority over indoor pollution, with the EPA having some control under the Toxic Substances Control Act for addressing asbestos, radon, and lead-based paint hazards. Key agencies and authorizing statutes related to indoor air quality, radon, and lead-based paint hazards in housing are briefly described. For more information on federal agencies' activities, refer to EPA's 1989 Report to Congress on Indoor Air Quality and the U.S. General Accounting Office's 1999 report on Indoor Pollution. Additional information can be found in the Report of the Surgeon General's Workshop on Healthy Indoor Environment from 2005. Visit agency websites for more details on indoor environmental quality programs. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was established in 1970 under the Nixon Administration to integrate federal pollution control laws. Numerous federal environmental laws provide the statutory authority for EPA to carry out its responsibilities. Visit agency websites for more information on indoor environmental quality programs. The EPA's responsibilities have grown over time as Congress has amended laws to address specific needs. The agency has delegated implementation to states and used statutory authorities to address indoor pollution in various ways. Selected statutory authorities related to indoor pollution are abstracted below. Title I of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) grants EPA broad authority to regulate chemicals, including indoor pollutants. EPA can require testing for toxicity and control exposure to chemicals posing health or environmental risks. However, EPA must consider the balance between risk reduction and regulatory burdens before implementing controls. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) grants EPA authority to regulate chemicals, including indoor pollutants like asbestos and PCBs. EPA has restricted chemicals under TSCA Title I and AHERA addresses asbestos hazards in schools. EPA must consider balancing risk reduction with regulatory burdens. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) sets standards for responding to asbestos in schools, requiring inspections and management plans. Title II mandates certification for contractors and laboratories, as well as training for workers. EPA can take emergency action if schools fail to protect children from asbestos exposure. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) mandates actions for schools to protect children from asbestos exposure. Citizen and EPA actions are authorized for enforcement, with civil penalties for violations. The Asbestos School Hazard Abatement Act of 1984 provides grants and loans for schools with asbestos issues. Congress added Indoor Radon Abatement to TSCA in 1988 for financial and technical support. Title III of the Indoor Radon Abatement Act (15 U.S.C. 2661 et seq., P.L. 100-551) provides financial and technical assistance to states for radon monitoring and control. EPA is required to update its pamphlet, develop construction standards for controlling radon in new buildings, establish an information clearinghouse, and conduct research on radon. The EPA conducts research on radon measurement methods, develops new mitigation methods, operates a program to rate radon devices and services, and provides training seminars. In 1994, final standards for radon control in new residential buildings were established. A matching grant program was created to assist states with radon monitoring and control. In 1998, a matching grant program was established to assist states in developing radon assessment and mitigation programs. Funds were targeted to projects that ensured adoption of EPA's construction standards, gave preference to low-income individuals, and addressed serious radon contamination issues. Other sections of Title III required EPA to conduct studies on radon contamination in schools, identify high-risk areas, establish regional radon training centers, and provide guidance to federal agencies on radon measurement and remediation. Title IV of TSCA directs EPA to ensure proper training for lead hazard detection and control, inform the public about lead hazards, and establish quality controls for detection and reduction methods. It applies to federal facilities and activities creating lead hazards. Title IV of TSCA authorizes states to propose programs for training and certifying inspectors and contractors in detecting and controlling lead-based paint hazards. EPA is responsible for approving state proposals and providing grants for program implementation. Additionally, the 110th Congress added a fifth title to TSCA for Healthy High-Performance Schools. Title V of TSCA, added as part of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, authorizes EPA to establish a state grant program for technical assistance in schools' environmental health programs, focusing on building design, construction, and renovation. The program addresses contaminants, hazardous substances, and pollutant emissions, with EPA's grant authority expiring five years after enactment. Additionally, Title V requires the EPA Administrator to issue voluntary guidelines for selecting school sites in consultation with the Secretary of Education and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Title V of TSCA authorizes EPA to establish a state grant program for technical assistance in schools' environmental health programs, focusing on building design, construction, and renovation. The program addresses contaminants, hazardous substances, and pollutant emissions. EPA is required to issue voluntary guidelines for selecting school sites and developing state environmental health programs for schools, taking into account various factors affecting the health and well-being of occupants. In July 2010, Congress enacted the Formaldehyde Standards for Composite Wood Products Act (P.L. 111-199), adding a new Title VI to TSCA. The new title mandates specific formaldehyde emission standards for hardwood plywood, medium-density fiberboard, and particleboard in the United States, based on ASTM International standards. EPA is required to ensure compliance with the emission standards through regulations on labeling, chain of custody requirements, and sell-through provisions. The Formaldehyde Standards for Composite Wood Products Act (P.L. 111-199) mandates emission standards for hardwood plywood, medium-density fiberboard, and particleboard in the US. The law includes provisions for labeling, chain of custody requirements, third-party testing, and certification. It also addresses auditing, reporting, recordkeeping, enforcement, laminated products, and exceptions for products with minimal composite wood amounts. The act prohibits stockpiling of pre-act products for sale after the effective date and labeling requirements for products manufactured before the designated date. EPA's authority under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act focuses on responding to hazardous substance releases and is funded by the Hazardous Substance Superfund Trust Fund. The Superfund program focuses on cleaning up hazardous sites on the National Priorities List, with states participating in cleanup decisions and sharing costs if responsible parties cannot pay. EPA oversees federal facility cleanups in collaboration with states, while agencies like the Department of Defense and Department of Energy handle cleanup with their own funds. CERCLA defines \"environment\" as the outdoor environment only. CERCLA primarily applies to releases into the outdoor environment, but can also be applied to releases inside buildings if they originated from an outside source and pose an exposure risk. EPA's authority to respond to releases is limited for naturally occurring substances and releases from structural components within buildings if they do not result in an outdoor release. EPA can respond to releases inside buildings if they pose an exposure risk, with an exception for public health emergencies. The Libby Asbestos Site in Montana is a unique case where CERCLA was used due to asbestos contamination. The EPA is considering including a ranking criteria for vapor intrusion risks in determining NPL listing eligibility. Sites with vapor intrusion as the only exposure pathway have historically not been listed on the NPL, making them ineligible for Superfund appropriations. The EPA is considering adding a ranking criteria for vapor intrusion risks to determine NPL listing eligibility. Sites with vapor intrusion as the sole exposure pathway have historically been ineligible for Superfund appropriations. EPA may still use Superfund funds for emergency removal actions at NPL sites. EPA is also revising its policy on evaluating vapor intrusion risks at Superfund-eligible sites and brownfields. Subtitle C of RCRA allows for corrective actions to clean up contamination from hazardous waste facilities, while Subtitle I addresses petroleum contamination from leaking underground storage tanks. Both CERCLA and Subtitle C of RCRA may apply to the cleanup of hazardous wastes, with overlapping cleanup authorities. EPA has issued guidance on this matter. CERCLA and Subtitle C of RCRA may apply to cleanup hazardous wastes. Subtitle C authorizes enforcement actions for facilities to perform corrective actions, but does not provide federal funding for cleanup if owners/operators cannot pay. CERCLA allows EPA to fund cleanup under the Superfund program even without responsible parties. EPA has issued guidance to avoid overlap between the two statutes. The EPA delegates hazardous waste corrective action authorities to most states under Subtitle C of RCRA, retaining authority to issue cleanup orders in delegated states. The LUST Trust Fund under Subtitle I of RCRA funds corrective actions at petroleum sites if responsible parties cannot be found or pay, similar to the Superfund program for sites without viable parties. The Radon Gas and Indoor Air Quality Research Act, enacted as Title IV of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, directs EPA to establish a research program to gather data on indoor air quality and coordinate research efforts to improve indoor air quality. EPA has compiled guidelines for evaluating risks from vapor intrusion at petroleum sites to assist states in carrying out corrective actions under Subtitle I of the Superfund program. The Radon Gas and Indoor Air Quality Research Act, part of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, mandates EPA to conduct research on indoor air quality, establish advisory committees, disseminate information, and report to Congress. EPA is not authorized to implement regulatory programs, only research, development, and related activities. Title XIV of the Public Health Service Act, known as the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), directs EPA to regulate contaminants in drinking water to protect public health. Some contaminants like benzene, xylene, radon, or trichloroethylene can be released into indoor air. EPA uses its SDWA authority to protect against adverse health effects from indoor air exposure. EPA announced plans to regulate volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in drinking water as a group and is authorized to regulate radon to reduce indoor air levels. The Clean Air Act (CAA) does not grant EPA authority in this area. The Clean Air Act does not authorize EPA to directly control indoor air pollution, but it indirectly improves indoor air quality by regulating outdoor air pollution sources. For example, restrictions on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and wood stove emissions help reduce indoor pollution levels. EPA also regulates radon to reduce indoor air levels. The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) requires EPA to regulate the sale and use of pesticides in the United States through registration and labeling of pesticide products. EPA restricts the use of various pesticides for indoor use to prevent adverse effects on people and the environment. EPA considers risks from pesticide exposure through food, water, and indoor air when registering pesticides. Under the Atomic Energy Act, EPA issues environmental radiation standards for radioactive nuclides like radon, with authority transferred from the Atomic Energy Commission. EPA also provides guidance to federal and state agencies for developing radiation protection requirements. CERCLA established the ATSDR to assess health risks at Superfund sites, and potentially contaminated sites. The ATSDR assesses health risks at potentially contaminated sites in response to petitions, focusing on indoor exposure risks from hazardous substances. They evaluate human exposure through all pathways, including indoor exposure risks like vapor intrusion. ATSDR's public health assessments aim to inform the public of health hazards and assist decision-makers. The ATSDR informs the public about health hazards at contaminated sites and helps decision-makers evaluate cleanup actions. They do not have regulatory authority but provide information. The CPSC can control indoor pollution from consumer products through regulations like setting standards or issuing recalls. The CPSC collaborates with industries and the public to promote best practices and develop guidelines for consumer products. They focus on applied research to support the development of voluntary standards and disseminate information to the public. Consumer products are items produced for sale or personal use in households, schools, or recreational settings. Not all products fall under CPSC regulations, with exemptions for certain items like tobacco, firearms, and drugs. The CPSC does not have authority over entire buildings or indoor air quality standards. The CPSC has authority to regulate building components but it is unclear. Attempts to ban urea-formaldehyde foam insulation were unsuccessful. CPSC relies on product recalls and voluntary methods to reduce consumer risks. The FHSA authorizes CPSC to require labeling for hazardous household products and ban sale of children's articles containing hazardous substances. The FHSA regulates substances that may cause harm when used indoors. The Department of Defense is authorized to clean up environmental contamination at military facilities under its jurisdiction. DOD primarily administers cleanup under its Defense Environmental Restoration Program, overseen by EPA and states. CERCLA is the main federal law governing DOD cleanup, with RCRA corrective action also used at some sites. DOD addresses indoor exposure risks during environmental cleanup at sites, following EPA and CERCLA guidelines. They assess all potential pathways of contamination, including indoor sources like water supplies and vapor intrusion. DOD has its own guidelines for evaluating vapor intrusion risks, supported by research programs to understand contamination migration into buildings. The Department of Energy (DOE) conducts research on vapor intrusion to assess contamination migration into homes and buildings. DOE plays a leadership role in federal energy policy and research, focusing on energy efficiency and its impact on the environment and human health. They share their expertise on indoor air quality with other federal agencies. The Department of Energy (DOE) shares its knowledge on indoor air quality with other federal agencies and regulates potentially polluting materials in its facilities. DOE also focuses on mitigating risks from past contamination at facilities involved in nuclear activities. The Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 authorizes DOE to establish programs to minimize adverse environmental effects of energy projects. The Department of Energy (DOE) has authority related to indoor environmental quality, energy conservation, cleanup of environmental contamination, and research programs. DOE promotes energy efficiency in buildings through various public laws and programs targeting residential, commercial, and federal facilities. The DOE authorizes energy efficiency programs for residential, commercial, and federal facilities, including the Weatherization and Intergovernmental Program. These programs aim to retrofit existing residences and commercial buildings, considering indoor environmental quality. The Energy Conservation and Production Act (ECPA) directs the DOE to establish and manage the Office of Commercial High-Performance Green Buildings, coordinate activities with the GSA's Office of Federal High-Performance Green Buildings, promote research and development of high-performance green buildings, establish a national high-performance green building clearinghouse, and ensure coordination of high-performance green building information and activities with relevant federal agencies. The DOE is responsible for cleaning up nuclear facilities involved in national defense and energy research. This includes addressing contamination migration indoors and outdoors, such as through water supplies or vapor intrusion. The cleanup is managed under the Office of Environmental Management. The cleanup of DOE facilities is managed by the Office of Environmental Management. Once cleanup is complete, long-term stewardship is overseen by the Office of Legacy Management. CERCLA and RCRA govern hazardous substance and waste cleanup, while the Atomic Energy Act regulates radiological and nuclear waste management. EPA and states oversee cleanup actions by DOE. The Department of Energy (DOE) oversees cleanup actions under CERCLA and RCRA, with no comparable oversight mechanism under the Atomic Energy Act. DOE conducts research on energy efficiency, pollutants, pollution prevention, and remediation. The Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 expanded the research scope beyond nuclear power. Five DOE laboratories collaborate on building technologies. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory collaborate on advancing energy-efficient building technologies. They conduct research, provide technical advice, and work with private sector building owners to evaluate and test technologies for indoor environmental quality. For example, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory develops model building-energy code language, while the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory focuses on reducing energy usage for indoor air quality improvement. The Environmental Remediation Science Program at Brookhaven National Laboratory focuses on understanding human exposures to environmental pollutants, improving air quality, and developing scientific knowledge to inform public policy on reducing hazardous air pollutants. Their research priorities include investigating contaminant transport within the subsurface to better inform long-term site stewardship. The Ames Laboratory and Pacific Northwest Laboratory conduct research on improving environmental remediation of hazardous waste, including indoor contamination. Health-related programs under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services focus on indoor environmental quality and are administered by eight agencies in the U.S. Public Health Service. The Public Health Service Act (PHSA) directs HHS to conduct research on physical and mental diseases, water purification, sewage treatment, and pollution control. It authorizes grants, mandates an annual report on carcinogens, and requires research on low-level ionizing radiation effects and pollution from human activity. Various research institutes and centers like NIH and CDC are established under the PHSA. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) share the responsibility of conducting research on environmental pollution and health outcomes. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) supports studies on the relationship between physical and chemical factors and respiratory disease. The CDC proposed the creation of a Healthy Home and Community Environments program in FY2013 to address environmental exposures in homes, reduce disease burden, and control asthma through science-based interventions and comprehensive asthma control. The CDC is transitioning to a new Healthy Home and Community Environments program to address various health hazards in homes and communities, including asthma triggers, air pollution, lead poisoning, and unsafe drinking water. This program aims to collaborate with states and federal agencies to reduce housing-related health risks and support data collection for targeting vulnerable populations. The ATSDR, under HHS, assesses pollution risks at contaminated sites and investigates the link between contaminants and disease. HHS also has responsibilities under TSCA to study lead exposure in children and reduce occupational lead exposure during abatement activities. NIOSH is authorized to conduct research on indoor environments and provide scientific support for occupational health and safety regulation. OSHAct empowers NIOSH to investigate work environments and develop health-based criteria for toxic substances, which OSHA can use to set safety standards. Indian Health Service also has authorities related to indoor environmental quality. The Indian Health Service's authorities on indoor environmental quality are based on the U.S. Constitution, treaties, and relevant statutes like the Snyder Act of 1921 and the Indian Health Care Improvement Act of 1976. Various laws, court cases, and executive orders define the relationship between tribal governments and the federal government. The Indian Health Service functions similarly to the U.S. Public Health Service on tribal lands. The Federal Property and Administrative Services Act established the General Services Administration to centralize federal administrative services and management policy. The General Services Administration (GSA) oversees federal administrative services, management policy, and provision of products and services. The Public Buildings Service (PBS) within GSA is responsible for the design, construction, operation, maintenance, and disposal of federally owned properties, owning or leasing 9,624 assets with over 370.2 million square feet of workspace for federal employees. PBS establishes design standards, criteria for new buildings, and environmental guidance to ensure indoor environment protection in compliance with federal laws. The PBS program under GSA ensures indoor environment protection in compliance with federal laws and executive orders. GSA follows energy efficiency mandates from the Energy Policy Act of 1992, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, and recent executive orders by Presidents Obama and George W. Bush. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 established the Office of Federal High-Performance Green Buildings within GSA to coordinate green building activities and indoor air quality programs for federal facilities. The Act also mandated cooperation with DOE to establish a clearinghouse for public outreach on green buildings. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 established a clearinghouse for public outreach on high-performance green buildings, ensuring information availability on environmental hazards in school facilities. Executive Order 13423 directed federal agencies to conduct activities in an environmentally sustainable manner. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 and Executive Order 13423 promote environmentally sustainable practices in federal buildings, including the use of integrated pest management and EPA guidelines for radon in federal buildings. GSA, following EPA guidelines, implements the Federal Radon Action Plan and enforces a smoke-free environment in federal buildings. President Clinton's Executive Order 13058 and GSA's FMR Amendment 2008-08 restrict the use of specific pollutants in GSA-controlled buildings, aiming to enhance indoor environmental quality. The National Housing Act directs HUD to provide decent homes for American families, with specific provisions authorizing programs for indoor environment quality. HUD regulates formaldehyde emissions from wood products in manufactured homes. The National Housing Act directs HUD to regulate formaldehyde emissions from wood products in manufactured homes, in accordance with the Formaldehyde Standards for Composite Wood Products Act. Additionally, HUD is authorized to provide financing for energy conservation improvements in housing through various assistance programs. Other statutes govern HUD activities related to lead-based paint hazards in federally assisted housing. The LBPPPA Title II provided grants to cities and communities to eliminate lead-based paint poisoning causes in the 1970s. Funding for poisoning prevention decreased after 1978 when programs were combined into block grants. In 1991, the Office of Lead Based Paint Abatement and Poisoning Prevention was created. The Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 directs the office to develop a national strategy to eliminate lead-based paint hazards in public and private housing constructed before 1978 receiving federal assistance. Title X of the LBPPPA requires risk assessments and interim measures to reduce lead-based paint hazards in housing. HUD administers federal grants for construction, renovation, and lead abatement in public housing. Grants are also available for state and local governments to establish lead poisoning prevention programs for low-income residents in private housing, with a focus on children in housing built before 1978. The Occupational Safety and Health Act authorizes OSHA to enforce health and safety standards in various workplace settings. These standards apply to all private sector employers and federal agencies, but not to public sector employers at the state or local levels. Each state has the authority to set its own occupational safety and health standards under Section 18 of the OSH Act. The Occupational Safety and Health Act allows states to adopt their own safety plans, providing OSHA-approved protections for employees. OSHA loses jurisdiction in states with approved plans, but retains it for private-sector workers in states with plans only for public sector employees. OSHA sets standards for toxic substances to prevent health issues from regular exposure. Inspections and enforcement are carried out by OSHA to ensure compliance with these standards. The Office of the Federal Environmental Executive, authorized by Executive Order 13514, promotes sustainability and environmental stewardship in the federal government. It works with agencies to support sustainability efforts and ensure implementation of Executive Orders on federal environmental performance. Many federal agencies have authority related to indoor environmental quality. The Department of Transportation oversees indoor environmental quality in enclosed spaces like airliner cabins and buses for interstate commerce. The U.S. Coast Guard has jurisdiction over indoor environmental quality of ships in interstate commerce. The Access Board is an independent agency that addresses architectural and transportation barriers compliance. The Access Board is an independent federal agency focused on accessibility for people with disabilities under the ADA and ABA. It provides guidelines for constructing accessible buildings, with ADA standards governing public accommodation, commercial facilities, and government facilities. DOJ maintains ADA standards for all facilities except transportation, which falls under DOT standards. Federal facilities adhere to ADA standards issued under the Architectural Barriers Act. The Access Board sponsored a study on improving indoor environmental quality with the help of the National Institute of Building Sciences. The resulting report is available on the Access Board website. The Tennessee Valley Authority is authorized to make alterations and improvements in its jurisdiction. TVA has also investigated indoor radon levels. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) investigates indoor radon levels, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and nitrogen dioxide concentrations in the region. They also study wood stove emissions and indoor pollution levels post-weatherization. TVA distributes information on indoor environmental quality to residents. The Architect of the Capitol (AOC) is responsible for maintaining and developing buildings in the U.S. Capitol vicinity, including the House and Senate office buildings, Capitol Visitor Center, Library of Congress, Supreme Court, U.S. Botanic Garden, and Capitol Power Plant. AOC Design Standards address sustainable design. The AOC Design Standards focus on sustainable design to conserve energy resources and improve environmental performance. The Department of Commerce, through NIST, plays a role in controlling indoor environmental quality by advancing measurement science and technology. NIST research helps assess and remediate indoor contaminants, including evaluating air quality impacts in low-energy buildings. NIST is evaluating air quality impacts of technologies in low-energy buildings and developing tools to measure nanoparticles emitted by various household items. NIST staff are involved in developing standard measurements and procedures for various organizations related to building safety and construction. The Department of Agriculture (USDA) through its Rural Development division is committed to improving the economy and quality of life in rural America. They offer assistance programs for renewable energy systems, energy efficiency improvements, and lead-based paint hazard reduction. The USDA provides assistance for lead-based paint hazard reduction, asbestos and radon control measures, and Rural Housing Repair Loans for low-income rural residents. The Agricultural Research Service investigates ways to reduce indoor contaminant levels. Twenty-three federal agencies, including the USDA, are part of an interagency committee on indoor air quality. The EPA coordinates indoor air research with assistance from a federal interagency committee and advisory committee. The interagency committee includes EPA, DOE, OSHA, NIOSH, and CPSC as co-chairs. Other agencies involved in the CIAQ are the Department of Interior, NASA, Small Business Administration, Department of State, and Department of the Treasury. These agencies can improve environmental quality in their facilities, implement EPA or OSHA regulations, or conduct relevant research. The National Atmospheric and Space Administration conducts research on gases emitted from test materials for vehicles or stations. The Internal Revenue Service administers the tax code, affecting energy conservation and alternative fuels. State governments have statutes on indoor pollutants like radon, asbestos, and lead. Some states have laws prohibiting smoking in workplaces, restaurants, and bars to protect worker health. California, New Jersey, and Washington are active in promoting indoor environmental quality. Local governments can intervene by issuing ordinances and enforcing regulations to improve indoor air quality. City zoning, building codes, and licensing of contractors also play a role in ensuring healthy indoor conditions. Federal agencies play a significant role in understanding and controlling indoor environmental quality, with some questioning the effectiveness of current initiatives. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has been critical of federal efforts, suggesting a need for a more focused approach or greater involvement of state and local programs. The 1980 GAO report on indoor air pollution highlighted the lack of federal agency responsibility, hindering effective efforts. In 1991, GAO found that EPA's funding for indoor air research did not match the health risks, calling for better coordination among federal agencies. The indoor air program lacked legislatively mandated time frames and goals, unlike other EPA programs. The GAO report highlighted the lack of federal agency responsibility in addressing indoor air pollution. Despite the establishment of CIAQ, limited commitment from other agencies hindered its effectiveness. The program lacks a clear charter defining roles and responsibilities. However, a later GAO report noted progress in understanding indoor pollution and developing strategies to mitigate exposures. The GAO report identified gaps in knowledge about indoor pollution and the need for comprehensive research efforts involving experts from various disciplines. The GAO report highlighted the lack of a governmentwide effort to collaborate on green building issues in the nonfederal sector, emphasizing the need for shared goals and common performance measures. Coordination concerns regarding federal efforts to address indoor pollution have been raised by the general public, GAO, and the U.S. Congress. After the 9/11 attack, Congress investigated EPA's testing and clean-up efforts in contaminated areas. Lawsuits challenged EPA's adequacy in handling the situation, with criticism from the Inspector General and the Natural Resources Defense Council. Ambiguous jurisdictional issues led to governmental functions related to environmental health emergencies being overlooked. Following the September 11th attacks, there were shortcomings in communicating health risks and safety precautions to the public. Environmental health protection for Ground Zero workers was not a top priority, leaving residents and office workers to deal with debris cleanup and health symptoms on their own. While registries were created for some workers, there was no comprehensive registry for nearby residents and office workers who experienced health issues. Coordination efforts improved after the National Response Plan was released in 2004. After Hurricane Katrina, coordination issues arose regarding mold identification and clean-up, as well as formaldehyde levels in FEMA trailers used for displaced residents. In 2007, GAO found EPA lacked protocols for indoor contamination response post-disasters. Concerns remain about EPA's preparedness for future indoor contamination crises, especially with predicted climate change impacts on extreme weather events. The National Academy of Sciences warns that indoor air quality problems may worsen with climate change adaptations. The role of the federal government in addressing indoor pollution is debated, with proposed legislation in the 102nd Congress aiming to develop a national system for pollution prevention. In the 102nd Congress, H.R. 1066 aimed to develop a national response plan to reduce indoor air contaminants and allow states to create their own programs. H.R. 2952 in the 105th Congress focused on EPA publishing guidelines for indoor air health risks and potentially certifying contractors. EPA could also provide grants for this purpose. The bill proposed a voluntary certification program and grants for states and local governments to address indoor air risks. Real estate developers suggested limiting the federal role to research, as building codes already address indoor pollution concerns at the regional and local levels. State building and housing codes traditionally address indoor pollution concerns by controlling smoke, dust, carbon monoxide, pests, lead-based paint, formaldehyde emissions, and pesticide use through ventilation, insulation, screening, filtration, and mechanical cooling or heating. Private consensus organizations like ASHRAE and real estate trade associations are involved in addressing asbestos management and disclosure. Federal regulations focus on preventing indoor air quality issues rather than remediation. Federal regulations for indoor environments are reactive, focusing on cleanup rather than prevention of pollution. Congress has various options to address indoor pollution, from maintaining the status quo to expanding or reducing federal involvement in research, information dissemination, financial incentives, or regulation. Some policymakers may prefer to leave current directives and authorities intact, allowing federal agencies to continue implementing programs as before. This approach offers familiarity, predictability, and experienced personnel without requiring new resources. Congress has options to address indoor pollution, including forming a panel to assess the need for federal programs, coordinating existing federal involvement, and potentially enacting legislation for a coordinated strategy among EPA, CPSC, and OSHA. The commission recommended legislation mandating a coordinated strategy by EPA, CPSC, OSHA, and other federal agencies to address indoor pollution, noting that current efforts are insufficient and a mandate from Congress is necessary. Congress could also consider reducing federal support for research and programs if they believe the issue is not significant or can be better handled by local or state governments or the private sector, leading to cost savings for taxpayers. Reduced federal involvement in controlling indoor environments could lead to cost savings for taxpayers but may result in less research and knowledge for agency programs. This could also lead to less effective coordination between agencies and potentially duplicative or inefficient efforts by states and other entities. If Congress curtailed federal activities and funding for controlling indoor environments, public health impacts of exposure to pollutants could worsen. State and local governments may not have consistent programs to address indoor environmental controls. Congress could consider eliminating or reducing specific federal activities. Congress could examine current programs in oversight hearings or ask a panel of experts to inform the process by providing a report. Legislative action could follow to reduce authority or funding for initiatives found to be redundant or relatively unimportant, potentially saving money without sacrificing public health benefits. Another option for Congress is to increase the federal role, which could lead to greater consistency across states in housing or building codes and regulation of consumer products, facilitating interstate commerce and business development. Standardized guidance and regulations could simplify building construction and maintenance. Increased federal funding for indoor pollution-related research is needed as the costs of indoor pollution on individuals and society are estimated to be in the tens of billions of dollars. This funding could be focused on research and information dissemination initiatives to address the burden that indoor pollution imposes on health and productivity. The laboratory estimated the costs to the United States in the tens of billions of dollars and potential productivity gains. Savings and productivity gains from reduced respiratory diseases, allergies, asthma, and sick building syndrome were estimated annually. Additionally, direct improvements in workers' performance unrelated to health were estimated to result in significant productivity gains. The DOE scientists estimate that improving indoor environments could result in economic benefits exceeding costs by a large factor, potentially between $12 billion and $125 billion annually. Increased federal funding for research and dissemination could lead to improved indoor environmental quality, benefiting public health and the national economy. However, there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of expanded federal research and cost estimates."
