    "content": "The Act titled \"Juvenile Accountability and Diversion Act of 1999\" amends Title II of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 by establishing a program for Juvenile Accountability Coordinators. The Juvenile Accountability and Diversion Act of 1999 establishes a program for Juvenile Accountability Coordinators who provide services to juveniles in the justice system not alleged to have committed serious crimes. Grants are given to local governments based on factors like the rate of offenses by juveniles and the economic resources available to respond to such offenses. The Juvenile Accountability and Diversion Act of 1999 provides grants to local governments to respond to offenses committed by juveniles, with a maximum limit of $300,000 per fiscal year. The Juvenile Accountability and Diversion Act of 1999 offers grants to local governments for juvenile offenses, with a maximum limit of $300,000 per fiscal year, based on eligibility. The Juvenile Accountability and Diversion Act of 1999 provides grants to local governments for juvenile offenses. To be eligible, the chief executive officer of a local government unit must submit an application with specific assurances, including employing qualified juvenile accountability coordinators. These coordinators are responsible for juveniles within the system who have not committed serious crimes. Whenever a juvenile is taken into custody for a non-serious offense, the local government must assign a juvenile accountability coordinator to assist the legal guardian in participating in proceedings. The coordinator also provides assistance upon request from the juvenile or their legal guardian. The juvenile accountability coordinator provides information and referral for mental and physical health services, substance abuse services, family counseling, and social services. They also monitor compliance with judicial or administrative orders and maintain written records for each juvenile. The written record for a juvenile includes details such as the circumstances of custody, immediate events leading to custody, events during custody, family relationships and history, and medical and school history. While in the juvenile justice system, a coordinator assists authorities in reviewing and addressing the basis of the arrest, creating a diversion accountability plan to prevent future unlawful behavior. Juveniles can comply with this plan instead of facing adjudication by the judicial authority. Juvenile accountability coordinators assist in creating diversion accountability plans for juveniles in the justice system. They provide information to judicial authorities and cooperate with various parties to determine appropriate sanctions. The curr_chunk discusses the responsibilities of juvenile accountability coordinators, including collecting data on juvenile compliance with diversion accountability plans and monitoring subsequent offenses. It also includes an assurance that juveniles who comply with such plans will not be adjudicated for the offense. Juvenile accountability coordinators are not restricted from sharing information gathered from actions related to juvenile arrests for first or second offenses, excluding serious crimes. The term 'diversion accountability plan' in this part refers to a plan that includes restitution to the victim, community service, counseling, health services, writing essays, or other actions to address the offense or prevent future offenses. The recipient of a grant must submit reports to the Administrator as required to ensure compliance and effectiveness of financial assistance. Authorization for $50,000,000 annually for part J of the title is provided for fiscal years 2000-2002."
