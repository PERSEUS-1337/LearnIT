    "content": "The \"Protecting Student Privacy Act of 2014\" may be cited as the short title. It includes improvements to FERPA. Subsection (b) of section 444 of the General Education Provisions Act is amended to require educational agencies to implement information security policies protecting personally identifiable information from education records. The educational agency must have security policies to protect personally identifiable information from education records. An \"outside party\" refers to individuals not affiliated with the agency. No funds will be provided to agencies that knowingly share student information for advertising purposes. Each State educational agency and educational institution must ensure that any outside party accessing education records with personally identifiable information complies with providing parents the right to access and challenge inaccurate information. The outside party accessing education records must ensure accuracy and maintain a record of requests for access. They should also have information security policies in place. No funds will be available if these requirements are not met. No funds will be available to educational agencies unless they promote data minimization to protect privacy and require the destruction of personally identifiable information when no longer needed. The agency or institution must describe the information shared with outside parties, agencies, or organizations when obtaining information."
