    "content": "This report provides a statistical breakdown of demographic and background characteristics of active judges on U.S. courts of appeals and district courts, including gender, race, age, length of service, and professional occupation at the time of appointment. Circuit courts handle appeals from district court decisions and have the final say in most cases. The decision in a case is usually final, unless it is sent back for further proceedings or reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court. There are currently 179 authorized circuit court judgeships distributed across 13 judicial circuits. The First Circuit has the fewest judgeships with 6, while the Ninth Circuit has the most with 29. U.S. district courts are federal trial courts with 673 judgeships in total. Currently, there are 673 U.S. district court judgeships authorized by law, distributed across 91 district courts. The number of judgeships for each district court ranges from 1 to 28. The demographic characteristics and professional experiences of U.S. circuit and district court judges are of interest to Congress, especially during nominations. The Senate considers circuit and district court nominations, focusing on nominees' demographic characteristics and professional qualifications.
