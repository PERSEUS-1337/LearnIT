    "content": "Peru's political history has been turbulent, with periods of democratic and authoritarian rule. Since independence in 1821, Peru has had 13 constitutions and only nine elected governments completing their terms. The transition to democracy in 1980 followed 12 years of military rule. The 1980s saw economic crisis and the government's struggle against the Shining Path insurgency. Alan Garc\u00eda's presidency from 1985-1990 was marked by challenges. During Alan Garc\u00eda's presidency from 1985-1990, his antagonistic relationship with the international financial community and excessive spending on social programs led to hyperinflation and a debt crisis. His security policies were ineffective against the Shining Path insurgency, resulting in a near collapse of Peru. His administration was plagued by corruption and human rights violations. In 1990, the Peruvian population elected Alberto Fujimori as an independent candidate. Fujimori implemented aggressive economic reforms and counterinsurgency efforts, including a \"self coup\" in 1992 to consolidate power. Fujimori was re-elected in 1995, but faced challenges with tensions between the legislature. President Fujimori's popularity declined due to economic slowdown and increased civic opposition. His authoritarian leadership style, use of military tactics against the Shining Path, and controversial third term win in 2000 led to allegations of corruption and human rights violations. Fujimori eventually resigned in November 2000, leading to an interim government under President Valentin Paniagua that aimed to tackle political corruption. Alejandro Toledo succeeded Fujimori as President of Peru from 2001 to 2006, focusing on rooting out corruption, preventing recession, and holding free elections. Despite low approval ratings, his administration saw high economic growth rates, significant reforms to increase tax collection, reduce expenditures, and negotiate a free trade agreement with the US. Toledo faced allegations of corruption and protests during his presidency. After his comeback in 2001, Alan Garc\u00eda softened his populist rhetoric and pledged to maintain orthodox macro-economic policies. He narrowly defeated nationalist Ollanta Humala in the 2006 presidential election and was elected for a second term. Garc\u00eda governed as a moderate, maintaining economic orthodoxy and receiving support for his policies from much of the political opposition. Garc\u00eda's economic policies have been affected by corruption scandals and deadly protests. His party, APRA, has limited control in the legislature and relies on alliances to pass legislation. In response to a bribery scandal, Garc\u00eda dismissed several cabinet members and appointed a new prime minister. President Garc\u00eda appointed Simon as prime minister on October 14. Simon, a former governor with a reputation for fighting corruption, was expected to defuse social tensions and reduce poverty. However, social unrest has increased due to inflation and lack of improvement in conditions for Peru's poorest. This crisis peaked on June 5, 2009, when deadly conflicts erupted between police and indigenous protesters in the Amazon, resulting in numerous casualties. The deadly clash between indigenous protesters and police in the Amazon led to over 30 deaths. President Garc\u00eda resigned on July 11, and a Cabinet reorganization followed, raising concerns about the government's ability to negotiate with protesters over natural resource exploitation. The protests stem from disputes over resource rights, with Garcia promoting foreign investment for development. Indigenous peoples in the Amazon rainforest are in conflict with the government over oil and gas concessions. The government argues for investment benefits, while indigenous groups claim their property rights are being violated. They have the right to control their traditional lands, but receive little benefit from foreign investments, leading to environmental damage. The poverty rate in the region is high compared to the national average. The Interethnic Association for the Development of the Peruvian Jungle (AIDESEP) criticizes the government for favoring oil and logging companies over settling indigenous property claims. AIDESEP's leader, Alberto Pizango, briefly called for an \"insurgency\" before seeking asylum in Nicaragua. Many blame the government for the violent outcome of protests against the rushed implementation of a free trade agreement with the United States. Peruvian President Garc\u00eda faced criticism for issuing decrees related to a trade agreement with the United States without consulting Congress or the public. Protests led to the repeal of some decrees, but conflicts continued over land development in the Amazon. Garc\u00eda's party blocked attempts to repeal certain decrees, leading to further unrest. The government was accused of favoring oil and logging companies over indigenous tribes, sparking violent protests. President Garc\u00eda faced criticism for issuing decrees without consultation, leading to protests and repeals. His heavy-handed response deepened polarization, with protests spreading beyond the Amazon. If social unrest continues, Garc\u00eda may struggle to implement policies, heightening regional tensions over poverty and foreign relations. Garc\u00eda implied support from Presidents Chavez and Morales in promoting leftist policies. President Garc\u00eda's governance has faced challenges due to protests and decrees issued without consultation, leading to deepening polarization and regional tensions. The opposition in Peru may benefit from ongoing political unrest, potentially impacting the upcoming elections in April 2011. President Garc\u00eda is constitutionally prohibited from seeking a consecutive term, but he expressed interest in running for a third term in 2016. Opposition leader Ollanta Humala closely trailed Garc\u00eda in the 2006 elections. Opposition leader Ollanta Humala, a retired army officer who led a failed coup attempt in 2000, plans to run in the 2016 elections. His political influence is limited due to his inexperience and a court investigation into his alleged involvement in disappearances and torture in 1992. Former Prime Minister Simon's candidacy is unlikely following his resignation and damaged reputation. Former President Fujimori was convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison for \"crimes against humanity,\" including corruption and human rights abuses. This landmark legal case marked the first time an elected President in Peru was found guilty of such offenses. The conviction is seen as a significant achievement for Peru's judicial system, which has been perceived as weak and politically influenced. Despite this, some still support Fujimori for defeating the violent guerrilla movement Sendero Luminoso. The conviction may deepen political divisions in the country and strain Garc\u00eda's leadership. The trial of former President Fujimori resulted in a 25-year prison sentence for crimes against humanity. This conviction could deepen political divisions and strain Garc\u00eda's alliances. Fujimori's defense also raised allegations against Garc\u00eda for human rights violations during his first term. Additionally, Peru's economy, which had been strong, faced challenges with rising inflation and reduced demand for its products in 2009. Peru's sound public finances and foreign reserves can help offset global financial crisis damage, but institutional weaknesses may limit economic stimulus effectiveness. President Garc\u00eda continues orthodox economic policies, focusing on reducing fiscal deficit. Peru's well-managed economy sees increased revenues from better tax collection and growth. Large surpluses support social policies, but limited institutional capacity hampers implementation. Poverty rates have decreased since 2000, with a drop from 54.3% in 2001 to 39.3% in 2007. Poverty rates in Peru decreased from 54.3% in 2001 to 39.3% in 2007. Extreme poverty also decreased from 24.1% to 13.7% during the same period. However, poverty rates are still high, especially in rural areas where about 65% of the population lives in poverty. The economy is divided between a modern sector along the coast and a subsistence sector in the mountains, with economic power concentrated in the hands of a small elite. Social unrest is rising as the poor feel left behind by the country's economic prosperity. Peru's income distribution gap is vast, with the poorest 20% receiving less than 4% of national income, while the wealthiest 20% receive almost 57%. Employment has increased since 2004, but underemployment remains high, with over 60% of the workforce in the informal sector. Mining and fisheries are top export earners, with mining accounting for 62% of export earnings in 2007. Peru's dependence on primary products makes it vulnerable to economic shocks from commodity price volatility and weather conditions. Manufacturing has grown, benefiting from preferential access to the U.S. market for exports. The Peruvian government's ability to carry out poverty reduction programs is somewhat limited by its institutional capacity, still recovering from the erosion of democratic institutions under Fujimori. Post-Fujimori governments have tried to restore the independence of democratic institutions, despite the world economic downturn. Peru's weak institutional capacity may hinder the government's ability to implement economic policies effectively. In 2009, Peru initiated a $3 billion stimulus package to boost economic growth and create new jobs. The United States supports Peru's democratic institutions, human rights, and bilateral trade relations, being Peru's top trading partner. The U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement was signed in April 2006. The U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA) was signed in April 2006 and ratified by both countries' legislatures. In 2008, Congress extended Peru's trade preferences until 2009. President George W. Bush implemented the PTPA in 2009. There were concerns about Peru's legislation being inconsistent with commitments. Peru had a trade surplus with the United States in 2007. The United States provided financial assistance to Peru, focusing on democratic institutions, economic growth, environmental practices, and social investments. Assistance for FY2009 included funds for the Andean Counterdrug program and Development Assistance. In FY2009, the United States provided financial assistance to Peru, including funds for the Andean Counterdrug program, Development Assistance, Global Health, Child Survival, Foreign Military Financing, and International Military Education and Training. The increase in funding was mainly for alternative development programs, support for the Peru trade promotion agreement, and counter-narcotics programs. Military assistance was also increased to improve security forces' participation in international peacekeeping operations. Additionally, a two-year, $35.6 million Millennium Challenge Threshold program was signed to support Peru's efforts in reducing corruption and improving immunization coverage. In October 2008, Peru and the United States signed a debt-for-nature swap to reduce Peru's debt by over $25 million. Peru will use the funds to protect its tropical forests. The two countries also collaborate to combat illegal drug trafficking, with Peru being a major cocaine producer. The Garcia Administration made progress in eradicating coca cultivation and disrupting cocaine production in 2008. Peru's government has taken action against illicit coca cultivation and cocaine production through various operations and decrees. The country has received U.S. assistance for interdiction, eradication, and alternative development. Special police training programs have improved Peru's ability to combat drug trafficking and other organized crime. The Peruvian Congress passed laws to address drug trafficking, money laundering, terrorism, and other criminal activities. Peru has strengthened its capacity to combat drug-related crimes, including trafficking, money laundering, and terrorism. Despite corruption in the judicial system, efforts have been made to coordinate with neighboring countries for regional counter-narcotics initiatives. Public awareness campaigns have reduced support for coca growers involved in illegal drug trafficking. The U.S.-supported alternative development program in Peru has weakened support for violent cocaleros. The program helps farmers grow legal crops like cacao, coffee, and African oil palm, leading to sustainable reductions in coca cultivation. Despite government claims of eradication gains in the Upper Huallaga Valley, independent analysis shows a 16.4 percent increase in coca cultivation from 2005 to 2008. A 16.4 percent increase in coca cultivation from 2005 to 2008 in Peru has led to rising narcotics trafficking, with Mexican drug cartels vying for control from Colombian cartels. The Shining Path guerrilla movement, previously suppressed under Fujimori, has resurfaced and is now linked to drug trafficking, posing a terrorism concern for Peru. The Shining Path guerrilla movement has a limited presence in urban areas but has shifted its primary bases to remote drug-producing areas. It funds its activities through drug production and protecting drug traffickers. Sendero Luminoso has between 200 and 800 members, with two factions cooperating. Escalating drug trafficking could increase the group's size. In 2008, the group launched a violent attack, killing 13 soldiers and two civilians, leading to further attacks resulting in 33 deaths and 43 injured soldiers. The recent attacks by the Shining Path guerrilla group resulted in 33 deaths and 43 injured soldiers. The military is reevaluating its tactics and acknowledging challenges due to reduced funding for intelligence and equipment. Opposition parties criticize the use of conscripts in counter-terrorism operations, leading to high army casualties. The guerrilla group is now known to possess rocket launchers, grenade launchers, and heavy machine guns, sourced from the black market, stolen arms, and possibly Colombian drug cartels. The government responded to increased Sendero Luminoso activity by reopening military bases and deploying counter-insurgency units. General Edwin Donayre proposed increasing police presence in active areas and improving coordination between army and police. Community-based patrols with enhanced social programs were suggested, despite past human rights violations. Modest success was seen in capturing suspected guerrillas in the Huallaga Valley. Plans were made to establish 19 counter-terrorism bases with 2,000 troops in the Apurimac-Ene River Valleys. The government's efforts to combat terrorism in Peru have faced challenges, with the \"Plan VRAE\" in the Apurimac-Ene River Valleys struggling due to various issues. The T\u00fapac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) has not engaged in terrorist activities since 1996, but former members are working to establish a political party. Drug trafficking has also impacted port security in Peru. Drug trafficking in Peru has adversely affected port security, with cocaine being exported to various countries. Mexican drug cartels have increased violence in Peruvian ports, particularly in Paita. There was a rise in maritime criminal incidents near the port of Callao in February 2009, but these acts do not match piracy levels in other regions. Criminals do not typically hijack vessels in this area. In 2008, piracy attacks worldwide involved criminals boarding anchored vessels to steal goods. Peru and Chile have a maritime dispute, with Ollanta Humala stirring anti-Chile sentiment. Peru filed a petition against Chile with the International Court of Justice, concerning Bolivia's access to the Pacific Ocean. The Peruvian government generally respected human rights, but faced issues like alleged unlawful killings. Human rights issues in Peru included alleged unlawful killings by government forces, disappearances in military-controlled areas, abuse of detainees and inmates, harsh prison conditions, trial delays, attacks on the media, corruption, harassment of civil society groups, violence and discrimination against women, children, indigenous communities, ethnic minorities, and LGBTQ+ individuals. Discrimination against indigenous communities, ethnic minorities, and LGBTQ+ individuals, child labor, and trafficking in persons were reported in Peru. Former President Alberto Fujimori's trial implicated President Garcia in alleged human rights violations. Human rights groups attributed abuses during the guerrilla war to security forces under Garcia's first administration. A declassified U.S. government document revealed secret paramilitary organizations linked to Garcia's party during his presidency. Peru's APRA party supervised a secret police force, with the minister wanting to \"eliminate\" terrorists. The country is rated as a Tier 2 for human trafficking, with trafficking for forced labor and sexual exploitation being prevalent within Peru. Over 20,000 people are estimated to be forced into labor in various sectors within the country. Peru has a Tier 2 rating for human trafficking, with victims trafficked for forced labor in sectors like brick-making and domestic servitude, as well as for commercial sexual exploitation. The country also sees victims trafficked abroad, particularly to Ecuador, Spain, Italy, Japan, and the United States. Child sex tourism is a significant issue, with many victims being girls and young women from impoverished regions. In response, Peru passed anti-trafficking laws in 2007 and improved enforcement efforts in 2008, including setting up a dedicated anti-trafficking police unit and increasing prosecutions for sex trafficking crimes. The Peruvian government's efforts to combat forced labor and protect trafficking victims are considered inadequate by the State Department. Peru participates in Disaster Preparedness programs with the U.S. Agency for International Development, coordinating responses with local authorities during disasters. Peru collaborates with organizations like the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and the Peruvian Red Cross to enhance disaster preparedness and response. The country has a dedicated disaster management unit within the Ministry of Health, offering training programs at universities. While progress has been made, PAHO highlights the need for continued efforts in disaster preparedness and risk reduction. CARE International is working on improving accountability of disaster assistance providers in Peru through information sharing, transparency, and meaningful participation. They suggest forming a permanent inter-agency team to develop accountability practices."
