    "content": "The 113th Congress is considering an omnibus farm bill to replace expiring farm commodity programs from the 2008 bill. The Senate and House have passed their versions of the bill, proposing a new margin-based income support program for dairy. The Senate bill includes a market stabilization program, while the House bill does not. The 2013 farm bill (H.R. 1947) saw an amendment introduced by Representatives Goodlatte and Scott to remove the DMSP and make adjustments to DPMPP. The amendment was initially defeated but later passed during the House floor debate. The amended bill was rejected by the full House but a second version (H.R. 2642) containing the amendment was passed. The report discusses existing U.S. dairy programs and compares the proposed dairy programs in the Senate and House-passed farm bills. Examples of how the proposed dairy programs might operate for individual dairy operations are provided. The report includes cost projections of historical program outlays and proposed new dairy programs under both bills, academic analyses of potential market effects, and a discussion on disagreement over market stabilization. The 2008 farm bill was extended through FY2013 by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 extended the 2008 farm bill through crop year 2013, avoiding a \"fiscal cliff\" and preventing a reversion to 1949 permanent law. This extension also included the Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) program and the Dairy Product Price Support Program (DPPSP) until September 30, 2013, and December 31, 2013, respectively. If USDA had reverted to permanent law, dairy product purchases would have doubled farm prices, leading to a significant increase in retail prices. A doubling of farm prices could result in a substantial increase in retail prices, known as the \"milk cliff.\" The potential reversion to permanent law without new farm legislation or extension is seen as an incentive for policymakers. Current federal dairy policy includes five major programs aimed at providing support and stability for dairy producers. Additional smaller programs assist the U.S. dairy sector with various aspects such as market promotion, research, and disaster assistance. The Dairy Product Price Support Program (DPPSP) indirectly supports the farm price of fluid milk at $9.90 per hundred pounds through government purchases of dairy products. The program is countercyclical, ceasing purchases as product prices rise. USDA makes temporary price adjustments to avoid excess inventories. The DPPSP expires in 2013 and would be replaced with new policy under the Senate- and House-passed farm bills. The annual farm price of milk has trended higher since the mid-1990s, while federal support remains at $9.90 per hundredweight. The Dairy Product Price Support Program (DPPSP) indirectly supports the farm price of fluid milk at $9.90 per hundred pounds through government purchases of dairy products. Analysts at the Dairy Policy Analysis Alliance (DPAA) have noted that price supports have impeded U.S. dairy exports, distorted domestic markets, and constrained dairy product innovation. Milk producers argue that support levels have become too low to provide meaningful support. Since 2006, feed costs for dairy producers have sharply escalated due to the rise of the U.S. ethanol industry, leading to feed costs accounting for 80% of operating costs in 2011. The Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) program provides support to dairy farmers when the farm price of milk falls below a target price adjusted for feed costs. The MILC program provides support to dairy farmers when the farm price of milk falls below a target price adjusted for feed costs in the Boston market. Payments are based on the difference between the target price and the market price, with an adjustment factor added for rising feed costs. The program limits payments to the first 2.985 million lbs. of annual milk production per farm, which has led to limited popularity among large dairy producers. The MILC program, unpopular among large dairy producers, made significant payments during the 2002 farm bill period due to low milk prices. In 2009, the U.S. dairy industry faced financial pressure from low milk prices and high feed costs, leading to large MILC payments. By early 2012, high corn prices triggered MILC payments again. The MILC program parameters were altered in September 2012, resulting in zero payment for that month. The ATRA extension of the 2008 farm bill extended the MILC program through September 30, 2013, with parameters reset to pre-September 1, 2012 values. MILC operated with more restrictive parameters only in September 2012. The MILC program parameters were adjusted in September 2012, with no payment for that month. The extension of the 2008 farm bill did not incur additional costs except for an extra $110 million needed to maintain MILC at the higher support rate before September 2012. This funding was offset by a reduction in a nutrition education program. The House-passed farm bill would eliminate MILC immediately, while the Senate-passed bill suggests a temporary extension. The Senate-passed farm bill proposes a temporary extension of the MILC program, using a 45% payment factor for about nine months. FMMOs regulate milk marketing across state lines in geographically defined areas to provide price support and market stability for dairy producers. FMMO provisions involve classified pricing of milk based on end use and pooling of receipts to pay farmers a blended price. Dairy processors must pay a minimum price for farm milk depending on its end use, using formulas based on wholesale prices of dairy products and adjusting for processing costs and yield. The Federal Milk Marketing Orders (FMMOs) establish a uniform average price for milk sales within each zone, pooling all milk sales to pay dairy farmers. FMMOs regulate about two-thirds of U.S. milk production, with state marketing orders covering another 20%. FMMOs are permanently authorized and amended through a public hearing process. The Federal Milk Marketing Orders (FMMOs) regulate milk pricing through administrative changes approved by farmers in a referendum. Senate bill S. 954 proposes pre-hearing procedures for alternative milk pricing formulas and analysis of pricing effects. House bill H.R. 2642 includes a provision to repeal the FMMO system. The House-passed H.R. 2642 includes a provision to repeal the Federal Milk Marketing Order Review Commission, which subsidizes dairy product exports to enhance export competitiveness. The Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) supports higher-priced U.S. dairy products in international markets but has been rarely used due to declining global dairy subsidies. DEIP, extended by ARTA, expires on December 31, 2013, and would be eliminated under both the Senate-passed (S. 954) and House-passed (H.R. 2642) farm bills. Tariff Rate Quotas (TRQs) protect domestic dairy products by limiting imports of foreign dairy products. Tariff Rate Quotas (TRQs) protect domestic dairy products by limiting imports of foreign dairy products. TRQs provide price support to the domestic dairy industry while raising consumer prices. U.S. dairy trade policy influences the competitive environment for dairy exports and imports, leading to milk price instability in domestic markets. Foreign demand for dairy products is growing faster than U.S. demand, offering potential growth in U.S. milk production. Dairy TRQs are not affected by proposed changes to the farm bill. The 113th Congress is proposing changes to dairy programs in the farm bill, replacing DPPSP, MILC, and DEIP with margin insurance programs. The Senate's S. 954 introduces the Dairy Production Margin Protection Program (DPMPP), while the House's H.R. 2642 introduces the Dairy Producer Margin Insurance Program (DPMIP). These programs provide income support based on the margin between milk prices and feed costs. The Senate's S. 954 also includes the Dairy Market Stabilization Program (DMSP) to reduce payments to producers during low margins. The House 2013 farm bill initially included the Dairy Market Stabilization Program (DMSP) but it was later removed through an amendment. The amended bill, H.R. 2642, replaced DMSP with the Dairy Producer Margin Insurance Program (DPMIP) in July 2013. The National Milk Producers Federation proposed the Foundation for the Future (FTF) in 2010, leading to the Dairy Security Act (DSA) in Congress. The DSA was included in the farm bills of the 112th Congress. Proposed changes to U.S. dairy policy are outlined in the Senate-passed S. 954 and House-passed H.R. 2642. Both bills anticipate a final farm bill before the 2008 farm bill expires in 2013. The USDA needs to work out details to implement new dairy programs proposed in S. 954 and H.R. 2642. The current Dairy Product Price Support Program, Milk Income Loss Contract program, and Dairy Export Incentive Program will be eliminated. The report provides a preliminary description of the new programs. The Milk Income Loss Contract program is eliminated immediately under H.R. 2642, but extended through June 30, 2014 under S. 954 to provide income support for dairy producers during a transitional period. Dairy producers have extra time to understand and evaluate the new programs. If producers opt for margin protection instead of MILC, the decision is irrevocable. Dairy Forward Pricing, Dairy Indemnity, and Dairy Promotion and Research Programs are extended. Both bills extend Pricing, Dairy Indemnity, and Dairy Promotion and Research Programs until September 30, 2018. S. 954 requires increased reporting frequency for dairy product prices. Federal Milk Marketing Orders remain unchanged by H.R. 2642, while S. 954 suggests minor adjustments to milk pricing formulas. S. 954 (Sec. 1476) proposes funding options beyond annual appropriations for the Federal Milk Marketing Order Review Commission. H.R. 2642, on the other hand, would eliminate the Commission. The new margin insurance program would replace the DPPSP and MILC programs, offering protection from low operating margins without production or dollar payment limits. Participation in margin insurance is voluntary. The margin insurance program under S. 954 is voluntary but mandates participation in the Dairy Market Stabilization Program. H.R. 2642 aims to eliminate the DMSP. The program uses USDA data to estimate the margin between milk prices and feed costs. The cost of an average feed ration used to produce milk is a key factor in dairy production operating margins. This formula excludes important production costs such as labor, utilities, and veterinary services, making it a crude indicator of dairy profitability. The new dairy program would take effect on October 1, 2013, under both bills. The new dairy program, under bills S. 954 and H.R. 2642, will take effect once the farm bill is passed by both the House and Senate and signed into law by the President. USDA must announce the DPMPP program 30 days after the farm bill becomes effective. S. 954 requires the implementation of the DPMPP program 120 days after the act is signed into law, while H.R. 2642 authorizes USDA to issue interim rules for the dairy producer margin insurance program (DPMIP). All U.S. dairy producers are eligible to participate in the margin protection program. Both S. 954 and H.R. 2642 dairy proposals require registration for the margin protection program. Producers have specific timeframes to opt in or out, with provisions for new entrants and transferring eligibility. S. 954 offers Basic Margin Protection (BMP) and Supplemental Margin Protection (SMP) plans. The dairy proposals offer two plans: Basic Margin Protection (BMP) and Supplemental Margin Protection (SMP). BMP is fully subsidized with a $4.00/cwt. margin, while SMP is partially subsidized with coverage from $4.50/cwt. to $8.00/cwt. Dairy operators must first sign up for BMP before participating in SMP. Participation in BMP is a one-time choice lasting until September 30, 2018, while SMP coverage levels can be adjusted annually. The dairy proposals offer two plans: Basic Margin Protection (BMP) and Supplemental Margin Protection (SMP). BMP is fully subsidized with a $4.00/cwt. margin, while SMP is partially subsidized with coverage from $4.50/cwt. to $8.00/cwt. Dairy producers can opt in or out of SMP annually, with an administrative fee based on milk volume. H.R. 2642 offers a voluntary margin protection program with coverage from $4.00/cwt. to $8.00/cwt. in $0.50/cwt. increments, no annual registration fee, and no expiration date. The dairy margin insurance program under H.R. 2642 includes retroactive margin protection for producers who sign up within 150 days of the USDA announcement in the Federal Register. S. 954 does not have a provision for retroactive signup. Basic Margin Protection (BMP) provides coverage for catastrophic losses when the average operating margin falls below $4.00 per cwt. A government payment is made to cover the difference up to a maximum of $4.00 per cwt. The BMP payment rate is applied to 80% of the BPH prorated to a two-month period or the actual quantity of milk marketed. BMP payments continue as long as the average margin is below $4.00/cwt. SMP offers additional margin protection from sustained low margins above $4.00/cwt. Dairy producers can buy SMP in $0.50/cwt. increments from $4.50 to $8.00 per cwt. The Supplemental Margin Protection (SMP) program offers dairy producers additional margin protection from sustained low margins above $4.00/cwt. Producers can choose to participate annually and select a margin threshold between $4.50/cwt. to $8.00/cwt., along with a coverage percentage of 25% to 90%. Payments are triggered when the operating margin falls below the selected threshold for two consecutive months based on the annual production history. The SMP program offers dairy producers margin protection above $4.00/cwt. Payments are made when the margin falls below the selected threshold for two consecutive months. The payment rate is based on the difference between the margin threshold and the actual margin or $4.00. Historical data shows margin levels and likelihood of payments. SMP payment is calculated based on the coverage percent and either the contracted APH or actual milk quantity marketed. H.R. 2642 introduces a margin protection program for dairy producers with coverage ranging from $4.00/cwt. to $8.00/cwt. SMP payments continue if margin is below threshold for two months, ceasing when it exceeds the threshold. The program eliminates registration fees and does not cap margin protection at $4.00/cwt., incorporating excess feed costs into margin payments to enhance protection. S. 954 introduces a margin protection program for dairy producers, excluding negative margins from payment calculations. Payments are made when the operating margin falls below the selected threshold for two consecutive months. Margin payments will continue as long as the margin remains below the threshold. The margin protection program for dairy producers under S. 954 and H.R. 2642 requires annual premium payments based on coverage percentage and production history. Payments are triggered when the margin falls below the selected threshold for two consecutive months, and cease when it reaches or exceeds the threshold for a two-month period. The premium rate for dairy producers under H.R. 2642 varies based on the size of the operation and margin protection level selected. Producers with over 4 million lbs. of production history would be charged different rates. In 2011, 88% of U.S. dairy farms had annual production of 4 million pounds or less. USDA would develop rules for premium payments, with instructions to provide multiple payment methods for flexibility and program integrity. H.R. 2642 offers dairy producers flexibility in payment options, allowing for a single annual payment or semi-annual payments. Participation in the Dairy Market Stabilization Program (DMSP) is mandatory under S. 954 but not under H.R. 2642. DMSP may result in lower returns for dairy operations if certain margin conditions are not met, with payment reductions starting at $6.00/cwt. Dairy producers can avoid these reductions by limiting milk deliveries based on the DMSP base percentage. The Dairy Market Stabilization Program (DMSP) will be in effect when the trigger is met, diverting a portion of milk payments to USDA for purchasing dairy products for donation and demand-building programs. Producers delivering \"penalty\" milk incur production costs with no revenue, while USDA receives funds for demand-enhancing initiatives. The Dairy Market Stabilization Program (DMSP) involves producers forgoing penalty milk production to reduce costs but also revenue. This temporarily removes milk from the market, impacting future revenue and USDA's ability to stimulate demand. DMSP has entry and exit triggers, with a two-month gap between programs. Payment reductions aim to increase future milk prices through demand stimulation using diverted funds. The higher farm price for milk can be influenced by demand or supply effects, leading to a cessation of USDA margin payments. Estimating the significance of these effects is challenging due to varying assumptions on participation and coverage levels. The Congressional Budget Office's analysis showed potential federal budgetary savings without the DMSP component. Payment reductions can be avoided by reducing milk production. Reductions in milk production can avoid payment reductions under the DPMPP program outlined in S. 954. USDA must establish and implement the program 120 days after the farm bill is signed into law. Dairy producers registering for DPMPP are automatically covered by DMSP provisions and must select a method for calculating their DMSP base. The Dairy Margin Stabilization Program (DMSP) allows dairy producers to choose between two base formulas for calculating their monthly milk marketings. Payment reductions are triggered if the margin falls below $6.00/cwt for two consecutive months or below $4.00/cwt for a single month. USDA announces payment reductions if these conditions are met, using the higher one-month average margin to assess the $6.00/cwt threshold. The Dairy Margin Stabilization Program (DMSP) assesses margins using the higher one-month average to determine if the $6.00/cwt threshold is breached. Payment reductions are triggered if margins fall below $6.00, $5.00, or $4.00, with reductions applied to the DMSP base and actual milk marketings. No reduction is made if milk marketings are less than the calculated amount. The Dairy Margin Stabilization Program (DMSP) triggers payment reductions if margins fall below $6.00, $5.00, or $4.00. Reductions are based on a rolling two-month average margin, with larger reductions required as margins decrease. The reduction factor remains at the maximum level reached, even if margins rise above the thresholds. The Dairy Margin Stabilization Program (DMSP) triggers payment reductions if margins fall below $6.00, $5.00, or $4.00. Reductions are based on a rolling two-month average margin, with larger reductions required as margins decrease. The payment reduction factor remains at the maximum level until the margin exceeds $6.00/cwt. for two consecutive months, whereupon the DMSP is shut off. The DMSP design aims to increase the price of farm milk and exportable dairy products through demand or supply effects, with measures in place to prevent negative consequences for U.S. dairy exports. The Senate-passed bill directs USDA to study the economic impact of the Dairy Margin Stabilization Program (DMSP) on the dairy product value chain and the competitiveness of the U.S. dairy industry in international markets. The report is due by December 1, 2016. Differences between the Senate-passed S. 954 and House-passed H.R. 2642 dairy proposals need to be resolved in a conference agreement. Dairy producers participating in the DMPP are subject to payment reductions or supply restrictions under S. 954. H.R. 2642 does not include DMSP, payment reductions, or supply restrictions like S. 954. It combines BMP and SMP into a single margin protection program with no registration fee. Premium rates are similar to S. 954, with $4.00/cwt. margin protection free on the first 4 million lbs. of milk marketing. The milk marketing programs in S. 954 and H.R. 2642 have different premium structures, with S. 954 favoring participation at a $6.50/cwt. margin protection level and H.R. 2642 favoring participation at a $7.00/cwt. level. S. 954 requires the use of NASS full-month, all-milk price estimates for margin calculations, while H.R. 2642 does not specify this requirement. H.R. 2642 allows for annual updating of production history base, while S. 954 fixes the base for the program's duration. S. 954 and H.R. 2642 differ in their premium structures for milk marketing programs. S. 954 fixes the production base for the program's duration, while H.R. 2642 allows for annual updating. H.R. 2642 has no limit on potential per-unit payment rate, while S. 954 excludes negative margins. Additionally, S. 954 allows participation in either DPMPP or LGM, but not both, while H.R. 2642 is silent on this issue. H.R. 2642 ends the MILC program immediately, while S. 954 extends it for nine months. H.R. 2642 requires USDA to announce DPMPP program within 30 days of the farm bill being signed, while S. 954 mandates USDA to establish DPMPP program within 120 days. S. 954 requires a USDA study on the economic impact of DMSP program, while H.R. 2642 has no similar provision. H.R. 2642 removes exemptions for DPMPP and DMSP from standard rulemaking procedures, requires USDA to assess market impacts, and eliminates the FMMO review commission. S. 954 includes provisions for alternative milk pricing formulas, funding options for the FMMO review commission, and reporting requirements for dairy price reporting. Several empirical studies have been conducted on the proposed dairy programs, including the margin-based protection programs (BMP and SMP) and the dairy market stabilization program (DMSP). These studies suggest that the new programs will provide a higher safety net in low margin events and help stabilize dairy operating margins. Optimal benefits are seen for dairy farms of all sizes participating at either $6.50/cwt. or $7.00/cwt. supplemental margin protection levels. The studies on dairy programs suggest that participation at $6.50/cwt. or $7.00/cwt. levels is beneficial for all farm sizes. Effects on milk supply, prices, and trade were relatively small, with contradictory results on milk exports. An analysis of a margin insurance program without market stabilization showed varying costs and results under different participation assumptions. Three studies in 2013 compared the economic effects of the Dairy Security Act with different participation assumptions. Two studies used a fixed historical milk base, while the passed version allowed for annual updates, resulting in varying program costs. Three studies in 2013 compared the economic effects of the Dairy Security Act with different participation assumptions. The studies found that both DSA and GSA provide catastrophic risk insurance and revenue enhancement for farms with stable and moderately growing milk marketings. The potential cost savings associated with GSA may be overstated due to the inclusion of milk marketings under the margin protection program. The Dairy Security Act (DSA) and Government Security Act (GSA) provide risk insurance and revenue enhancement for farms with stable milk marketings. DSA encourages participation at $6.50/cwt level, while GSA at $7.00/cwt level, resulting in higher government costs under GSA. DSA's margin protection program led to short-term reductions in milk supplies, but overall milk production remained unchanged. Market prices for milk increased by $0.06/cwt under DSA. Under the Dairy Security Act (DSA), milk supplies decrease by up to 3%, while market prices increase by $0.06/cwt. Exports of dairy products decline under DSA with DMSP. Producer net revenue increases by $0.55/cwt. under DSA. Woodward and Baker found that the government loss ratio is higher for DPMPP with DMSP compared to GSA. The analysis focused on equity issues related to program benefits redistribution. The analysis focused on equity issues related to the redistribution of program benefits among producers of various sizes under the shift from the MILC program to the DPMPP program. The payment cap of 2.985 million pounds under MILC favors smaller milk producers, while DPMPP with no payment cap tends to favor larger producers. There is a large divergence in program benefits by farm size, with MILC favoring smaller dairy farms and DPMPP favoring large farms due to the removal of production caps. MILC pays out more for producers under the production cap, while DPMPP pays out 11 times more for producers well over the cap. The analysis compared the MILC program with the DPMPP program, showing that DPMPP payouts are significantly higher than MILC. States supporting DMSP tend to have higher feed costs and larger farms, while states with more small farms reject supply controls. Assumptions are made about farm participation across margin thresholds. When estimating marketwide effects, studies consider distribution across margin thresholds and coverage levels. Higher participation levels in programs lead to more positive outcomes, such as lower costs to taxpayers and better margin stabilization. Evaluating dairy producers' response to the market stabilization program is challenging due to the unique nature of DMSP and the lack of historical precedent. Supply management programs in the US have been primarily voluntary with participation incentives. The United States' Dairy Margin Coverage Program (DMSP) is a penalty-based program with a reward opportunity, unlike previous voluntary programs. Milk processors strongly oppose supply management that could restrict milk supplies and limit their ability to meet consumer demand. The proposed tiered-premium structure of DMSP seems to favor smaller farmers, but the cost and distribution of benefits remain uncertain. The USDA's dairy support programs have seen decreasing outlays since the 1980 farm bill period. The outlook for dairy product prices is strong, leading to relatively small net outlay projections for the next 5 to 10 years. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected additional budgetary outlays for dairy programs over 5 and 10 years under different versions of the 2013 farm bills. The House and Senate dairy proposals would result in increased budgetary outlays above baseline. The CBO projected budgetary outlays for dairy programs under different versions of the 2013 farm bills. The DMSP market stabilization proposal is being debated by dairy producer groups and dairy processors. The National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF) supports the dairy market stabilization concept to reduce margin volatility for dairy producers. The Dairy Market Stabilization Program (DMSP) acts as an early warning system for producers to make temporary adjustments in milk production to maintain overall margins. The DMSP addresses market imbalances swiftly and infrequently. The National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF) supports the dairy market stabilization program to reduce margin volatility for dairy producers during market imbalances. The program acts as an early warning system for producers to adjust milk production temporarily to maintain margins, especially during times of low milk prices and high feed costs. The International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) opposes the program, arguing that it would increase domestic prices above international prices and harm the competitiveness of the dairy industry. The government supply management program in the dairy industry raises domestic prices above international prices, hindering competitiveness. Representatives Goodlatte and Scott introduced an amendment to remove the market stabilization program while keeping the margin protection program. They argued that the program penalizes consumers and manufacturers by raising milk prices artificially. The U.S. does not have a mandatory dairy supply management program like Canada and the EU. Concerns about such a program include limiting milk supply and raising prices for consumers. The goal of dairy supply management programs is to stabilize milk prices by controlling the amount of milk marketed. The U.S. does not have a mandatory dairy supply management program like Canada and the EU. Concerns about such a program include limiting milk supply and raising prices for consumers. The goal of dairy supply management programs is to stabilize milk prices by controlling the amount of milk marketed. In the mid-1980s, two government-sponsored voluntary supply management dairy programs were authorized by Congress\u2014the 1984-85 Milk Diversion Program and the 1987 Dairy Termination Program. Under these programs, dairy farmers were incentivized to reduce milk marketings, but the long-term effects were limited. The government accepted bids from dairy farmers to slaughter all their cattle and stay out of the dairy business for five years under the Whole Herd Buyout Program. This program helped moderate milk production trends but negatively impacted beef markets. The Dairy Market Stabilization Program (DMSP) punishes farmers for increasing milk marketings. The industry-sponsored voluntary supply management program, Cooperatives Working Together (CWT), requires participating dairy farmers to commit 2\u00a2 per cwt. of milk marketed. Participants in CWT include dairy farmers from all states, producing 70% of the nation's milk. CWT funds are used for herd retirement and export assistance. Foreign Government-Sponsored Mandatory Supply Management Programs in Canada and the EU use marketing quotas to control milk sales. Potential problems with supply management programs include funding and free riders. The CWT program faces challenges such as funding, free riders, and export market issues. There is uncertainty about the reliability of CWT export subsidies and their compatibility with World Trade Organization obligations."
