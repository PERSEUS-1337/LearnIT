    "content": "The \"Voter Choice Act of 2005\" permits the use of multiseat districts for House elections in states with a proportional voting system. The \"Voter Choice Act of 2005\" allows states with multiple Representatives to establish fewer districts for election as long as certain conditions are met, including majority rule, equal voting power, and ensuring candidates with a share of votes greater than one-third are elected in multiseat districts. The \"Voter Choice Act of 2005\" allows states to establish multiseat districts where each Representative represents an equal number of residents. States can elect candidates with less than one-third of the total votes in a multiseat district. Single-seat districts can also be used in combination with multiseat districts. The \"Voter Choice Act of 2005\" allows states to establish multiseat districts for Representatives. The rights and remedies in this title do not override the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Instant Runoff Voting is required for federal general elections. Each State must conduct general elections for Federal office using an instant runoff voting system, except for House elections in multiseat districts. Definitions for \"Federal office\" and \"instant runoff voting system\" are provided. The instant runoff voting system for the election of candidates involves conducting runoff counts in rounds, allowing voters to rank candidates by preference on the ballot, eliminating candidates with the fewest votes in each round until a majority is reached, and automatically tabulating the runoff counts at the time of voting. The term \"State\" refers to each of the several States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, and the United States Virgin Islands at the time of voting. Grants are provided to states to cover costs of administering instant runoff voting system. The Election Assistance Commission establishes a grant program to fund instant runoff voting systems or proportional voting systems in eligible States. The Commission will develop criteria for grant applications and oversee fund usage without requiring states to match funds. Eligibility of states is determined for participation in the program. Eligibility of States for grant program under Election Assistance Commission is based on submission of application with required information and assurances. Application deadline is within 60 days of plan public release, and response deadline is within 120 days. Commission may approve or reject applications based on set criteria. The Election Assistance Commission may reject an application if the state's election equipment is not compatible with certain voting systems or if there is a lack of voter education. Grants awarded to states cannot exceed the product of the state's population and $12. Authorization of Appropriations for the Election Assistance Commission program includes $500 million for fiscal year 2006 and additional funding as needed for subsequent years. SEC. 203. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER LAWS. This title does not override the Voting Rights Act of 1965 or the National Voter Registration Act of 1993."
