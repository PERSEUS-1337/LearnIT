    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Local Flexibility for Transit Assistance Act\". Congress finds that transit ridership has increased despite falling disposable income, leading to deep service cuts, fare increases, and layoffs due to declining revenues and rising fuel prices. 84 percent of transit systems have raised fares or cut service in the past 2 years. This has resulted in a significant reduction in rush hour and off-peak services, leaving many transit drivers unemployed. The Government aims to increase access to public transportation to help Americans reach jobs and economic opportunities. This is crucial due to cuts in transit services leaving many without a way to commute to work. The Government also seeks to improve citizens' ability to move efficiently and affordably, especially with growing traffic congestion impacting productivity and economic strength. SEC. 3. URBANIZED AREA FORMULA GRANTS. Amends Section 5307(b)(1) of title 49 to include operating costs for public transportation in urbanized areas with a population over 200,000. SEC. 4. TARGETED AND TEMPORARY FLEXIBILITY FOR DESIGNATED RECIPIENTS IN CRISIS. Adds flexibility for designated recipients in crisis situations in Chapter 53 of title 49. Chapter 53 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to include a new section, SEC. 5341, providing targeted and temporary flexibility for designated recipients or direct recipients in crisis situations. The term 'crisis period' is defined as when the unemployment rate in a metropolitan area is 7% or higher, or when the national average retail price of gasoline increases by more than 10%. If a transit agency operates at least 100 buses in a populated urban area and is certified to be in a crisis period, they may have flexibility in their operations. During a crisis period, funds from section 5307 can be used for operating costs of equipment and facilities by designated recipients or direct recipients meeting specific criteria. The percentage of funds that can be used varies based on the population size of the urbanized area. During a crisis period, designated recipients or direct recipients in urbanized areas with a population over 1,000,000 can request certification from the Secretary to use funds for operating costs. The Secretary will monitor the agency quarterly to determine if it still qualifies as in a crisis period, allowing for 3 additional quarters of fund usage if no longer in crisis. \"SEC. 5342. LOCAL CONTROL OF TRANSIT OPERATING FLEXIBILITY.\" Designated or direct recipients operating at least 100 buses in urbanized areas with a population over 200,000 can use funds for operating costs if revenue from non-Federal sources meets certain criteria. Designated or direct recipients operating at least 100 buses in urbanized areas with a population over 200,000 can use a percentage of funds based on population size, with limits ranging from 20-30%. If revenue from non-Federal sources exceeds the previous fiscal year, they may increase the percentage limits. The designated recipient or direct recipient can increase the specified percentage by a percentage not exceeding the year-over-year increase in the amount."
