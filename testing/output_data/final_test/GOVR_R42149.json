    "content": "The THUD appropriations subcommittee provides annual funding for DOT, HUD, and related agencies. DOT's mission is to ensure a safe and efficient transportation system through grants and regulations, focusing on highways, transit, and rail. The Department of Transportation (DOT) administers grants and regulations for freight rail, commercial trucking, and maritime industries. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) oversees aviation operations and air traffic control. Title II of the annual THUD appropriations bill funds the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), which focuses on creating inclusive communities and affordable housing for low-income households. HUD's programs provide rental assistance for the poor, elderly, and disabled. HUD's nonemergency funding is mainly allocated to project-based rental assistance and flexible block grant programs like HOME and CDBG. Other specialized grant programs cater to homeless individuals, including those with AIDS. The Federal Housing Administration insures mortgages for home buyers with low downpayments and developers of affordable rental buildings. Title III of the THUD appropriations bill funds various transportation and housing-related agencies. The THUD appropriations bill funds various transportation and housing-related agencies, including the Access Board, Federal Maritime Commission, National Transportation Safety Board, Amtrak Office of Inspector General, NeighborWorks, US Interagency Council on Homelessness, and costs related to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. House and Senate Appropriations Committees reorganized subcommittee structures between 2003 and 2008. The Transportation, Department of Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies subcommittees underwent changes in jurisdiction from FY2003 to FY2008, affecting appropriations bills for DOT and HUD. Comparisons between years are complicated by factors like supplemental appropriations for disasters and departmental reorganizations. Funding trends for DOT and HUD from FY2005 to FY2010 are shown in Table 3. Table 3 displays funding trends for DOT and HUD from FY2005 to FY2010, excluding emergency and supplemental funding. The purpose is to highlight funding trends for these agencies, with emergency appropriations not included in the figures. Different totals may be reported due to various funding and savings mechanisms in the THUD appropriations bill. The THUD appropriations bill includes various types of funding, such as regular annual appropriations, advance appropriations, and emergency appropriations. Emergency appropriations are provided outside of regular appropriations acts, often in response to disasters, and are in addition to regular annual appropriations. These funds may come from the general fund but are not always included in discretionary appropriations. The Department of Transportation's budget includes contract authority from federal trust fund resources like the Highway Trust Fund and airport trust fund. Congressional appropriators have limits on discretionary funding, which can be managed by appropriating within allocated amounts or finding offsets for higher funding levels. The THUD bill's regular annual appropriations are offset through rescissions and offsetting receipts. Appropriations Committee subcommittees receive 302(b) allocations, which include net discretionary budget authority. This can cause confusion as the annual discretionary budget authority allocations for THUD are typically around half of the total funding provided in the bill. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established overall limits on federal discretionary appropriations for FY2012 through FY2021. These limits are enforced through a sequestration process involving spending cuts if breached. The FY2012 302(b) allocations, including for the THUD subcommittee, are part of this process. The FY2012 302(b) allocations, including for the THUD subcommittee, reflect discretionary spending caps under the Budget Control Act. Once allocated, funds are distributed among agencies. HUD receives the majority of appropriations, but DOT has more resources when contract authority is considered. The amount of new appropriations provided by the THUD subcommittee each year depends on various factors. The THUD subcommittee's new appropriations depend on savings from rescissions and offsets, reducing the cost of providing funding. Without these savings in FY2011, an additional $8 billion would have been needed. The federal aviation and surface transportation programs have had multiple extensions, with the aviation program extended 22 times. The aviation reauthorization bill is pending, while the surface transportation program has been extended. DOT funding has fluctuated, with a decrease in FY2011. The Obama Administration proposed restructuring surface transportation programs with a $50 billion upfront appropriation in FY2012. The Obama Administration proposed a $50 billion upfront appropriation in FY2012 for transportation infrastructure improvement and job creation, as an alternative to the typical surface transportation reauthorization funding plan. The proposal front-loaded a large increase in funding in the first year of the proposed six-year plan, with lower funding levels for the subsequent five years. Legislation to implement the proposal was not submitted during the 1st session of the 112th Congress. The Obama Administration proposed a $50 billion upfront appropriation in FY2012 for transportation infrastructure improvement and job creation. The funding allocation between discretionary and mandatory funding was a key consideration in the proposal. The Senate Committee on Appropriations allocated $20 billion to discretionary funding and $30 billion to mandatory funding, resulting in a total request of $94.4 billion. The Obama Administration proposed a $94.4 billion funding request for transportation infrastructure in FY2012, with most funding coming from the Highway Trust Fund. The fund has faced deficits, requiring transfers from the general Treasury fund to remain solvent. Reports indicate that current spending levels are insufficient to maintain the nation's transportation infrastructure. The Obama Administration proposed increased funding for transportation infrastructure in FY2012, highlighting the need for higher spending levels to maintain and improve the nation's transportation infrastructure. Despite calls for increased funding, there is little support for raising the federal gas tax as a means of generating additional revenue. The President's FY2012 budget aimed to rename the fund the Transportation Trust Fund and increase authorized expenditures to $554 billion over the next six years. The budget proposal for FY2012 included adding the Federal Railroad Administration and the Federal Transit Administration's New Starts transit construction program to the programs funded by the fund. It did not suggest an increase in the gas tax but aimed to work with Congress to find new revenue sources. The House draft reduced funding from the Highway Trust Fund by 35% from FY2011. The Senate bill recommended funding levels for highway and transit similar to FY2011, with $39.9 billion for highways and $1.7 billion for infrastructure repairs. This represented a 35% reduction in funding from FY2011 levels for the two largest accounts supported by the Highway Trust Fund. The highway program funding for FY2012 is $2.0 billion less than FY2011, depleting the Highway Trust Fund by the end of the fiscal year. Without additional revenues, the fund won't support a federal-aid highway program in FY2013. The President's budget requested $123 million for the EAS program, a $27 million decrease from FY2011. The conference agreement provided $143 million for the program. The conference agreement for the EAS program in FY2012 allocated $143 million, with a total funding of $193 million available. The program aims to preserve air service to small communities by subsidizing costs. Supporters argue it fulfills a commitment made during airline deregulation in 1978, while critics highlight high subsidy costs per passenger and low passenger numbers at some airports. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program has seen a significant increase in costs since FY2008, with route reductions leading to more communities joining the program each year. Critics argue that the requirement for planes to carry a minimum of 15 passengers is unnecessary, as smaller planes could be more cost-effective. The Administration proposed limiting funding to communities that received subsidies in the previous year and eliminating the 15-passenger aircraft requirement. The Senate-passed bill and House draft bill supported limiting funding to previous year's recipients and eliminating the 15-passenger aircraft requirement for the Essential Air Service program. The conference agreement also included a provision against implementing a plan for EAS communities to cover subsidy costs. Additionally, the budget proposed $5 billion for a national infrastructure bank to finance transportation projects of national or regional significance. The Administration proposed a national infrastructure bank to evaluate and finance projects, but it was not funded in the House draft, Senate-passed bill, or conference agreement. The budget allocated $4 billion for high speed and intercity passenger rail development as part of a proposed six-year, $53 billion program aimed at creating jobs and improving transportation options. Congress has provided $10.1 billion for DOT's high speed and intercity passenger rail grant program, but funding was eliminated for FY2011 and $400 million rescinded from previous appropriations. The FY2012 Senate bill recommended $100 million for the grant program, while the House draft did not include any funding. The conference agreement did not provide any funding for the program. The high speed rail program did not receive any funding in the conference agreement. The program aims to develop intercity passenger rail service with speeds of 90 or 110 miles per hour, not just high speed lines like in other countries. Critics question the economic efficiency of building expensive rail lines. After the elections of November 2010, three states - Wisconsin, Ohio, and Florida - rejected $3.6 billion in grants for rail projects due to concerns about ongoing operating costs. The Administration redistributed the funds to other states pursuing passenger rail development. The budget proposed $4 billion for a new Federal Railroad Administration account to fund public rail asset development and maintenance, with Amtrak initially being the sole recipient of grants. The budget request for Amtrak in FY2012 included $1.5 billion for \"base\" funding and an additional $2.5 billion from supplemental funding, totaling $4 billion. The Senate recommended $1.48 billion, the House draft recommended $1.12 billion, and the conference agreement provided $1.42 billion. The FTA's Capital Investment Grants program funds new transit lines, including New Starts and Small Starts projects. The Capital Investment Grants program funds New Starts and Small Starts projects with total costs under $250 million seeking federal funding. Projects must pass multiple evaluations by FTA and sign a full-funding grant agreement detailing funding and project development steps. Cost overruns are the responsibility of the grantee. The program received $2.0 billion in FY2010 and $1.6 billion in FY2011, with a requested $3.2 billion for FY2012. The Senate bill proposed $2.0 billion for FY2012. The Senate-passed bill proposed $2.0 billion for New Starts funding, covering most costs for grant agreements. The House draft recommended $1.6 billion, while the conference agreement settled at $1.955 billion. The federal share for projects can be up to 80%, with a provision limiting it to 60%. Critics argue that this limit is lower than federal shares for highway projects. Advocates argue that requiring a higher local match for New Starts funding allows the FTA to support more projects with available funding and encourages communities to scrutinize transit project costs more closely. The Senate proposed $2.0 billion for New Starts funding, while the House recommended $1.6 billion, with a federal share of up to 80% for projects. The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program is the largest HUD assistance program for low-income families, with roughly 2 million vouchers needing annual renewal. The President's budget estimates the funding needed for renewal, but it is up to the appropriations committees to decide on the final amount. The President's budget estimates the funding needed for renewal of the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program, but recent estimates suggest that the amount provided in the Senate bill may not be sufficient. The Senate bill included the President's requested level for renewals but also rescinded $750 million from agencies with reserve funding above a specified level. The President's budget estimates funding for Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program renewal. The bill funds voucher renewals at the requested level but rescinds $650 million from agencies with reserves. The Public Housing Operating Fund provides formula-based funding to PHAs for ongoing operation and maintenance. The President's budget proposes a 14% reduction in the Operating Fund and suggests offsetting funding allocations to PHAs with reserves above a certain level. The proposal aims to force certain PHAs to spend down their reserves, which has been opposed by industry groups. HUD argues that limiting funding ensures higher levels for agencies without large reserves. The Senate bill and P.L. 112-55 fund the operating fund at the requested level but cap the offset at $750 million. The President's FY2012 budget includes statutory changes related to income and rent determination for HUD's rental assistance programs. The proposed reforms aim to streamline HUD's rental assistance programs, reducing costs and allowing property owners to leverage outside resources. President Obama's FY2012 budget includes funding for a \"Transforming Rental Assistance\" initiative, but the House draft bill did not include the requested reforms. The $200 million requested by HUD would be used to convert HUD-assisted housing units to a new form of project-based rental assistance. This new rental assistance would allow families to take their subsidies with them if they choose to move to a new unit of private market housing. The Senate bill included authority for HUD to conduct a \"Rental Assistance Demonstration\" without additional funding, while the House draft bill did not include this authority. P.L. 112-55 includes a modified version of RAD with no extra funding and a cap of 60,000 units. The President's FY2012 budget requested $88 million for HUD's housing counseling program, but Congress did not provide any funding for it in FY2011 due to concerns over distribution delays. Some policymakers questioned HUD's funding for housing counseling, citing concerns over duplication with NeighborWorks. The Senate bill proposed $60 million for HUD's program and encouraged coordination with NeighborWorks to avoid overlap. The House draft bill did not include funding for HUD's housing counseling. In FY2011, funding for HUD's Section 202 and Section 811 supportive housing programs was cut in half. The President's FY2012 budget requested restoring funding levels for Section 202 and increasing funding for Section 811. In FY2011, funding for HUD's Section 202 and Section 811 supportive housing programs was cut in half. The President's FY2012 budget requested restoring funding levels for Section 202 and increasing funding for Section 811. The President requested lower funding for Section 811 in FY2012 due to changes in program funding. The Senate proposed lower funding for Section 202 and equal funding for Section 811, while the House proposed significant increases for both programs. P.L. 112-55 funded both programs slightly above the Senate's proposed levels. An amendment was approved to increase loan limits for high-cost communities under GSE and FHA programs until December 31, 2013. On October 1, 2011, loan limits under programs reverted to lower statutory limits with a fee increase. P.L. 112-55 included FHA loan limit increases but not GSE loan limit changes. Appropriations for related agencies within the Transportation, HUD, and Related Agencies bill have increased since FY2008, including funding for Neighborworks for a National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program. In FY2011, Congress did not provide funding for HUD's housing counseling program due to concerns over distribution time and duplication of services. The President's FY2012 budget requested $88 million for HUD's Housing Counseling Program, in addition to $80 million for NeighborWorks NFMCP. In FY2011, Congress did not fund HUD's housing counseling program due to concerns over duplication. The Senate and House bills allocated different amounts for NeighborWorks NFMCP and HUD's program. P.L. 112-55 included $80 million for NFMCP and $45 million for HUD. Loan limits for high-cost areas reverted to lower levels on October 1, 2011. For more information, refer to CRS Report R41351 on housing counseling. The conforming loan limit determines the maximum mortgage size that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can purchase, impacting HUD FHA insured loans and Department of Veterans Affairs loans. S.Amdt. 857 aimed to increase the GSE conforming loan limits for high-cost communities until December 31, 2013, with a budgetary cost noted by the Congressional Budget Office. The proposed loan limits in S.Amdt. 857 would come with a fee increase to offset costs. P.L. 112-55 extends FHA loan limits but does not increase GSE loan limits. For more details on conforming loan limits, refer to CRS Report RS22172."
