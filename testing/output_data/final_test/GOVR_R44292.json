    "content": "The Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) became law on December 19, 1995, endorsed by President Clinton as a necessary measure for transparency in government. While lobbying is seen as a valuable part of the American system, there is concern about the influence industry operating in secret and gaining special privileges. Lobbyists who rewrite laws in back rooms and seek loopholes are not welcomed in a democracy. President Clinton emphasized the need for transparency in government and questioned how individual citizens' rights can be balanced against the access of special interests to government. James Madison also addressed the role of factions in advocating for their interests in American history. Madison believed in addressing the negative role of factions by either banning them or encouraging multiple groups to prevent domination. Lobbying laws focus on registration and disclosure to ensure citizens' right to petition is protected. This report analyzes the Lobbying Disclosure Act on its 20th anniversary, emphasizing the importance of citizens' access to government. The report discusses the historical background of citizens' right to petition and lobbying in the United States, as well as the regulation of contact between citizens and government. It also addresses contemporary issues affecting lobbying and potential options for congressional action. Congress has historically created boundaries to the right to petition, requiring registration and public disclosure of lobbying activities to balance access to policymakers. The right to petition government has a long history in the United States, dating back to English common law. Congress has implemented rules to prevent undue influence from lobbyists and restrict post-congressional activities. This right is fundamental in the citizen-government dynamic, even though it is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. The right to petition government, rooted in American life, was immediately included in the Bill of Rights. Benjamin Franklin's petition against the African slave trade sparked a debate in 1790. Alexis de Tocqueville noted the importance of political associations in the 1830s. Today, lobbying is a common way for organized groups to present their positions to decisionmakers. Lobbying involves hiring lobbyists to advocate for policy preferences to governmental decisionmakers. The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 defines lobbying as communication to covered officials regarding legislation, regulations, government programs, and nominations. Lobbyists are individuals who engage in this advocacy. Lobbyists are individuals who are employed or retained by a client for financial compensation to engage in lobbying activities. To be considered a lobbyist, an individual must make more than one lobbying contact in a quarterly period, spend at least 20% of their time lobbying, and receive compensation for their services. If these criteria are not met, the individual is not considered a lobbyist under the law. Lobbyists perform various tasks for their clients, representing corporations, individual citizens, or other entities. Lobbyists engage in a variety of tasks to influence the policy process and secure desired outcomes for clients. They may lobby to provide information, persuade, or signal policy preferences. Lobbyists can contact the legislative branch to push for new laws or amendments and the executive branch to advocate for specific actions. Lobbyists provide information to government decisionmakers, including political, career-related, and policy-analytic information. Information is a lobbyist's key commodity, as stated by Senator Robert Byrd during a lecture on lobbying. Senator Byrd highlighted the historical role of lobbyists in assisting Senators with information and policy options, dating back to the nineteenth century. Lobbyists were described as providing hints and advice to Members of Congress outside of Congress Hall. Byrd emphasized that lobbyists offer a holistic view of the policy sphere and use factual information, constituency views, and electoral self-interest to persuade legislators. Lobbyists can signal group-friendly positions to legislators through advertisements or grassroots campaigns, influencing policy. Studies show a correlation between money spent on lobbying activities and policy influence. Changes in lobbying practices have led to attempts to regulate interest group influence. Regulation of lobbying has been used as a political tool, with shifts in societal norms affecting lobbyists' practices. Historical figures like Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson leveraged public perception of lobbyists for reform legislation. President Wilson criticized lobbyists for misleading public opinion to gain support for lower tariff rates. Senator Byrd summarized the historic reasons for lobbying. Senator Byrd's summary of historic lobbying reform focuses on registration and disclosure of lobbying activities, rather than radical changes. Change occurs when a crisis allows decision-makers to seize the opportunity for reform. The Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA) and the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act (HLOGA) were enacted in response to concerns about lobbying influence. Congress has made various attempts to bring transparency to lobbying since 1876. Four key laws have been enacted since the 1930s to regulate lobbyist contact with the federal government. Each law was precipitated by a need for change. The Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA) of 1938 was enacted to control subversive activities by Nazi and Communist agents in the United States. It was a response to concerns about lobbying influence and was one of four primary lobbying laws aimed at regulating lobbyist contact with the government. Congress is investigating un-American activities in the US, focusing on organizations influencing political policies with foreign support, violating international law and democratic principles. FARA mandates registration of individuals acting on behalf of foreign entities. The Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) mandates registration of individuals acting on behalf of foreign entities, specifying registration and reporting requirements, exemptions, filing and labeling rules for political propaganda, record-keeping, public examination of documents, and penalties for noncompliance. FARA was enacted in response to concerns about foreign influence in the US during a time of global unrest. The Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) was passed in response to concerns about foreign influence in the US during global unrest. In 1946, Congress enacted the Regulation of Lobbying Act (RLA) as part of the Legislative Reorganization Act, requiring individuals attempting to influence legislation to register and disclose their activities. This marked the creation of the first general registration and disclosure regime for lobbying. The RLA Congress responded to concerns about lobbying by requiring lobbyists to register their activities. Modern lobbyists act openly and rely on public opinion to influence legislative action. The Senate Special Committee on the Organization of Congress provided a rationale for this registration requirement, emphasizing Congress's central role in government. The Senate Special Committee on the Organization of Congress emphasized the importance of lobbyists registering their activities to reflect the true popular will and avoid distortion by special-interest groups. The registration would not restrict lobbying but ensure transparency through recordkeeping and reporting requirements. The RLA aimed to increase transparency in lobbying by requiring registration and disclosure of financial interests. However, studies showed that the number of registered lobbyists did not reflect the actual number of individuals and organizations influencing legislation. This weakness was partly due to a Supreme Court decision that narrowly defined the legislation's scope. The RLA, enacted to increase transparency in lobbying, was found to be ineffective as it did not apply to groups or individuals lobbying with their own funds. Various attempts were made to amend the law, but lobbyists argued against stricter requirements, leading to limited effectiveness post-Harriss era. The Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) of 1995 was created to address the shortcomings of the previous Registration of Lobbyists Act (RLA) and to improve transparency in lobbying. The LDA tightened registration and disclosure requirements for Washington-based lobbyists while preserving the rights of ordinary citizens to petition the government. It aimed to change the perception of Congress being influenced by special interests and streamline the registration process. The Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) of 1995 replaced the Registration of Lobbyists Act (RLA) to enhance transparency in lobbying. It streamlined disclosure requirements for professional lobbyists, requiring registration and regular reports on clients, lobbying issues, and compensation. The LDA aimed to strengthen public confidence in government and was signed into law by President Clinton in December 1995. The Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) of 1995, signed by President Clinton, replaced the Registration of Lobbyists Act (RLA) to increase transparency in lobbying. It defined lobbyists, lobbying activities, and contacts, requiring registration with the Clerk of the House and Secretary of the Senate. The LDA also included executive branch officers as \"covered officials\" for lobbying registration and disclosure. The Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) of 1995 increased transparency in lobbying by defining lobbyists and lobbying activities, requiring registration with the Clerk of the House and Secretary of the Senate. The inclusion of executive branch officials in lobbying registration acknowledged the influence on policymaking beyond Congress. The Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 (HLOGA) further refined disclosure requirements for lobbyists in response to the Jack Abramoff scandal. HLOGA amended the Lobbying Disclosure Act by changing reporting frequency, adding disclosures, creating new reports on campaign contributions, and requiring disclosure by coalitions and associations. It did not significantly alter the definition of who is considered a \"lobbyist\" but adjusted the frequency of information disclosure and monetary thresholds for reporting lobbying expenses. The Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) was amended by HLOGA to change reporting periods, deadlines, and thresholds for filing reports. It also introduced a new requirement for lobbyists to report campaign and presidential library contributions. HLOGA was a response to changes in lobbying practices, including the impact of social media on communication with officials. HLOGA aimed to increase transparency in lobbying by banning gifts from lobbyists to Members of Congress, requiring greater disclosure of lobbyists' activities, and tightening financial disclosure rules for government employees. The law also addressed the appearance of scandal by placing restrictions on seeking employment outside of government. The key theme of the major lobbying laws is that more information on lobbying contacts and activities increases transparency while maintaining individuals' first amendment rights to petition. The enactment of FARA, RLA, LDA, and HLOGA aimed to increase transparency in lobbying by requiring disclosure of lobbyists' activities and addressing concerns about undue influence on governmental decision making. FARA was a response to anti-German sentiment, RLA to lobbyists' perceived influence, LDA to recurring disclosure requirements, and HLOGA to the Abramoff scandal. These laws reflect a shift towards more stringent regulations to ensure transparency in lobbying practices. The LDA and HLOGA require public availability of registration and disclosure statements for lobbyists since 1999. The data offers insight into lobbying trends, but doesn't capture the full scope of lobbying activity. Analysis of pre-2007 LDA data and post-2008 HLOGA data shows changes in registration and disclosure patterns. The number of registered lobbyists has changed over time, with an upward trend in new registrations between 1999 and 2007 under the LDA. Data from 1967 under the RLA also shows fluctuations in the number of organizations reporting lobbying expenses. The number of disclosure reports filed by lobbyists steadily increased between 2001 and 2007, peaking at almost 20,000 filings in 2007. This trend coincides with shifts in party control of Congress or the executive branch and changes in the issue agenda due to elections. The trends in lobbyist registration under the LDA show an increase in disclosures, with a comparison to limited data from the RLA era. The enactment of HLOGA in 2007 led to a rise in new lobbyist registrations, peaking in 2009 with 6,509 new lobbyists registered. In 2009, a record 6,509 new lobbyists were registered, possibly influenced by changes in party control of the White House and Congress. The increase in registrations could be linked to the unified control of the White House and Congress under a single political party. Media reports suggested a connection between the decline in lobbyists and the earmark ban in the 112th Congress, but academic studies have not confirmed this. The decrease in lobbyists started in 2009, before the earmark ban in 2011, indicating other potential causes. The decline in registered lobbyists since 2009, before the 2011 earmark ban, may be due to factors other than the ban. HLOGA allows for quarterly evaluation of disclosure trends, showing a decrease in filings since 2008. This decline in disclosure reports does not necessarily mean fewer active lobbyists, as firms must file reports even if no lobbying activities occurred in a quarter. An examination of contemporary lobbying reveals that scholars, think tanks, and legislators are still considering registration and disclosure within the context of three current trends: shadow lobbying, grassroots lobbying, and the revolving door. In June 2014, the Office of Congressional Ethics referred an entity to the U.S. Attorney's Office for failure to register under the Lobbying Disclosure Act. The Office of Congressional Ethics referred an entity to the U.S. Attorney's Office for failure to register under the Lobbying Disclosure Act. This was the first time a referral for violation of the LDA's registration provisions has occurred, highlighting the issue of individuals who engage in lobbying activities but do not register. These individuals, known as \"shadow lobbyists,\" do not disclose their activities to the Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate. A \"shadow lobbyist\" engages in lobbying activities but does not meet all requirements for registration. They challenge or defend policy, provide information to policymakers, and monitor policy developments without registering as lobbyists. Individuals may choose not to register for various reasons, such as not meeting all parts of the statutory definition of lobbying. Former high-ranking government officials and senior staff are prohibited from engaging in certain lobbying activities for a period of time after leaving office. This \"cooling off\" period prevents them from making advocacy contacts to influence current federal officials. Identifying shadow lobbyists is challenging due to some registered lobbyists not reporting their activities, potentially to avoid disclosure requirements. Some individuals who work as consultants engage in lobbying activities without registering. Studies suggest that these individuals should be considered lobbyists under the LDA, while others disagree. Some individuals engage in lobbying activities without registering, leading to challenges in identifying shadow lobbyists. Estimating their numbers is difficult, with varying opinions on whether they should be considered lobbyists under the LDA. The self-reporting requirement for lobbying activities under the LDA may result in some individuals not needing to register, while others may preemptively register to avoid penalties. The number of shadow lobbyists may be increasing as some individuals engage in lobbying activities without registering under the LDA. The decline in registered lobbyists since 2007 could be attributed to this trend, as shown in Figure 5. The decrease in registered lobbyists may be due to an increase in shadow lobbyists, possibly incentivized by HLOGA's disclosure requirements. Other factors include a policy shift by President Obama, changes in administration, and the economic impact of the 2008-2009 recession. The decrease in registered lobbyists may be due to an increase in shadow lobbyists, possibly incentivized by HLOGA's disclosure requirements. This has led to a change in practice and perception regarding who registers as a lobbyist, with individuals who might have previously registered under the LDA now choosing not to. The perception of who should be classified as a lobbyist is evolving to include individuals or activities that were not previously considered advocacy or lobbying, such as those working with grassroots organizations. Additionally, what was once considered lobbying may no longer fit that definition today. Grassroots lobbying, which aims to persuade policymakers by influencing public opinion and motivating citizens to take action, is becoming more prominent. Grassroots lobbying involves various actors like citizens, corporations, and advocacy groups who mobilize constituents to contact Representatives and Senators through methods like calls, letters, visits, protests, and emails. This form of lobbying demonstrates constituents' willingness to inform legislators about their preferences on significant issues. Grassroots lobbying involves citizens, corporations, and advocacy groups mobilizing constituents to contact legislators about their preferences on an issue. Some grassroots strategies are low-cost (e.g., email), while others require significant time and money (e.g., traveling to Capitol Hill). Grassroots lobbying is largely unregulated, with past attempts to regulate it, such as a provision in the Senate version of HLOGA (S. 1, 110th Congress) that would have required registration and disclosure of grassroots lobbying activities under the LDA. Grassroots lobbying under LDA provisions would require registration within 45 days of being retained for paid efforts. Section 220 aimed to address \"astroturf\" lobbying, where hired lobbyists create fake grassroots support for legislation. Concerns over consequences led to hesitance in enforcing registration and disclosure requirements. The introduction of an amendment to delete Section 220 from the bill was prompted by concerns over requiring grassroots lobbyists to register and disclose under the LDA. A Senator argued that such requirements equated to banning constituent contact with Congress, emphasizing the right to communicate with lawmakers without being forced to register and report connections. The amendment highlighted the constitutional protection of lobbying, even if done for a fee, and raised issues with filing forms on time. The bill currently stands to impose a $200,000 penalty for errors in filing forms or late submissions. Section 220 requires disclosure of money spent on grassroots lobbying by professional organizations to understand funding sources for campaigns. Opponents argue it hinders free speech, but supporters emphasize the need for transparency in lobbying efforts. The Senate agreed to remove Section 220 from HLOGA, which required disclosure of money spent on grassroots lobbying by professional organizations. The debate over regulating grassroots lobbying highlights the challenge of balancing disclosure and First Amendment rights. Studies show the significant impact of grassroots tactics on legislative behavior. Sociologist Edward Walker argues that corporations are using grassroots tools to influence policy because politicians listen to constituents differently than corporate lobbyists. New technologies and professional practices have made it easier for elites to recruit citizen activists. The increased use of new platforms and technologies for constituent communication with Members of Congress could lead to a shift in practice and perception. This may result in a higher volume of incoming letters, emails, and social media interactions, potentially straining the limited resources of Representatives and Senators. Additionally, the influence of grassroots organizations on constituent communications could alter Member-constituent interaction. Requiring grassroots lobbying firms to register and disclose activities could impact the volume of grassroots lobbying. If groups refuse to comply, they may choose to stop using grassroots strategies or modify their activities. This could potentially marginalize certain constituent voices traditionally activated by interest groups. Amendments to current lobbying disclosure laws may be necessary for grassroots organizations to disclose income, expenses, and clients. This could mirror requirements for foreign agents under FARA. However, these changes could make grassroots efforts more challenging. The \"revolving door\" practice of federal employees moving between government and private sector jobs is common. The \"revolving door\" practice involves individuals in various professions moving between government and private sector jobs, leveraging personal networks and knowledge of the system. Revolving door provisions were initially enacted to prevent the misuse of proprietary information and limit potential influence on federal employees. Several laws govern the movement of federal employees from government to the private sector, including post-employment restrictions on representational activities. This includes lifetime bans on switching sides on specific matters worked on while in government, as well as cooling-off periods for certain senior officials. Post-employment restrictions for federal employees include cooling-off periods for senior officials, bans on lobbying activities, and limitations on representational activities for foreign governments or political parties. In Congress, Members and senior staff face similar restrictions, with a one-year cooling-off period in the House and a two-year ban on lobbying in the Senate. The revolving door restrictions for federal employees and Congress members include bans on lobbying contacts with Congress and legislative branch employees. President Obama's ethics pledge prohibits registered lobbyists from serving in his Administration without a waiver. Debate surrounds whether the revolving door creates conflicts of interest for former government employees switching jobs. The revolving door between government and the private sector has potential benefits, such as improving the quality of candidates for government jobs and increasing the knowledge base of both sectors. Studies show that regulators may take aggressive actions against industry, rather than favoring industry interests. Critics debate whether the movement of personnel creates conflicts of interest. Critics of the revolving door between government and the private sector advocate for longer \"cooling off\" periods and stronger conflict of interest restrictions. They believe the movement of employees can lead to bias, transparency issues, and inefficiency in government. Research shows that revenue generated by private lobbying firms is often directly linked to employees with previous government experience. The movement of employees between government and the private sector can lead to bias, transparency issues, and inefficiency in government. Research shows that lobbying revenues are driven by \"who you know\" rather than \"what you know,\" with lobbyists who have experience in a U.S. Senator's office experiencing a significant drop in revenue when the Senator leaves office. Questions about conflicts of interest arise when former government employees work on issues they previously handled in government, leading to a change in perception about the roles of Members of Congress and senior staff. The movement of employees between government and the private sector raises concerns about bias, transparency, and inefficiency. Lobbying revenues are influenced by personal connections rather than expertise, leading to questions about conflicts of interest. Changes in perception about the roles of Members of Congress and senior staff are prompted by the potential for impropriety by former officials. Adjustments to the revolving door may impact restrictions on the flow of personnel between sectors, acknowledging the benefits of employees moving between the public and private sectors. Lobbying practices are evolving with new technologies providing lobbyists with alternative ways to contact decision-makers. The current lobbying laws focus on registration, disclosure, and regulating the revolving door. Congress may consider amending these laws to address issues like shadow lobbying and grassroots lobbying, with options such as changing disclosure thresholds and resources. The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 focuses on changing disclosure thresholds for registered lobbyists, addressing the revolving door and shadow lobbying, and maintaining current lobbying standards. Individuals must meet specific criteria to be considered lobbyists, including making lobbying contacts, being compensated, and spending a significant amount of time on lobbying activities. Self-reporting by individuals may lead to some individuals avoiding registration and reporting activities if they do not meet all criteria. Adjustments to the statutory definition of lobbying may be necessary to ensure individuals engaged in lobbying activities register properly. This could involve changing the 20% time threshold for lobbying activities, potentially requiring more individuals to register or exempting some from registration. If the threshold for lobbying activities is raised or eliminated, the definition of a lobbyist could change, potentially leading to more registrations. This could provide a clearer picture of individuals involved in lobbying government, but additional registration requirements may be burdensome for some. Congress could consider eliminating monetary requirements to include individuals who lobby on a pro bono basis. Requiring pro bono registration under the Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) may increase transparency but limit options for representation in Washington. Changing the registration requirement from the first lobbying contact to the second could decrease the number of registrations. The Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) requires registration of lobbying activities and disclosure of lobbying income/expenditures. Lobbyists can choose to disclose information using LDA's expense definitions or the Internal Revenue Code's definitions for certain groups. This includes nonprofit entities and for-profit organizations. Under the Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA), organizations must disclose lobbying expenses, including nontaxable amounts and grassroots lobbying expenses. The variation in disclosure processes between the LDA and Internal Revenue Code (IRC) allows some organizations to avoid reporting grassroots lobbying activities. Combining LDA and IRC criteria could create a uniform reporting system for lobbying income and expenditures, increasing transparency. Combining LDA and IRC criteria for lobbying income and expenditures could streamline reporting requirements, potentially reducing the disclosure burden on lobbyists and providing more transparency into how money is spent. This could require individuals, groups, and firms to report additional financial details to the IRC, leading to a more comprehensive picture of lobbying activities. The LDA may require more detailed disclosure of income and expenses by eliminating the rounding provision, which could face resistance from lobbyists and lobbying firms. More data would necessitate increased oversight and review. Enforcement of the LDA has been historically limited, with 2,308 referrals for non-compliance with reporting requirements from 2009 to 2014. Enforcement of the LDA has been historically limited, with 2,308 referrals for non-compliance with reporting requirements from 2009 to 2014. About 52 percent of referrals are now compliant, while 48 percent are pending further action. Lawsuits related to HLOGA and FARA violations have increased since 2010. Congress may consider providing additional resources for LDA enforcement. Congress could provide additional resources for the enforcement of the LDA by allocating more funding for the Clerk of the House, Secretary of the Senate, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia. This could involve combining the administration of FARA and the LDA, implementing a filing fee for LDA registration, and hiring more staff to ensure compliance with registration and disclosure requirements. Additional funding for the DOJ could also help in investigating and prosecuting noncompliance referrals. In a 2014 study, about 48% of LDA noncompliance referrals are pending action. The USAO believes it has sufficient resources for LD-2 and LD-203 enforcement. Lobbying laws differ for foreign (FARA) and domestic (LDA) lobbyists, administered by different entities. Congress could consider transferring FARA enforcement to the Clerk of the House and Secretary of the Senate or LDA enforcement to the DOJ for streamlined administration. The Clerk of the House and Secretary of the Senate or LDA enforcement could be transferred to the Department of Justice. Congress could create a new agency to administer both the LDA and FARA, potentially providing a holistic view of lobbying registration and disclosure. This change would require additional resources for personnel and realignment of registration and disclosure processes. Combining lobbying administration into a new agency could incur significant costs for transferring data and hiring personnel. If Congress merges LDA and FARA enforcement, DOJ would likely retain the right to investigate noncompliance. Additional resources for LDA implementation could be funded through user fees paid by lobbyists or lobbying firms at the time of registration or disclosure. User fees, defined by GAO as charges collected from recipients of government goods or services, can generate revenue to finance enforcement activities. Implementing user fees for the LDA could provide additional resources for enforcement without increasing appropriations. This would align the LDA administration more closely with FARA, which already requires a fee for registration. The administration of the LDA may consider implementing user fees to finance enforcement activities, similar to FARA. User fees for document filing, database searches, and reports may not cover all expenses, leading to the need for additional appropriations or other user fees. Constitutional scholars debate the use of user fees versus appropriations in funding enforcement activities. Scholars debate the use of user fees versus appropriations for funding enforcement activities, especially when a fundamental right is involved. Options to alter revolving door restrictions include extending or reducing the \"cooling off\" period, implementing bans on certain positions or types of non-governmental roles. Currently, \"cooling off\" periods vary between the House and Senate. One option for altering revolving door restrictions is to equalize the \"cooling off\" period for House and Senate members, possibly extending it to two years. This could be perceived as restrictive for House members who serve shorter terms. Alternatively, Congress could reduce the \"cooling off\" period to increase the talent pool inside and outside the government. Another approach could be implementing a blanket restriction on outside employment for the duration of a member's elected term. Placing post-employment restrictions on Members for the length of the term to which they were elected could encourage them to finish their terms before seeking outside employment. This could discourage Members from resigning to take private positions. However, prohibiting only private compensation may not prevent Members from accepting government jobs. There are potential disadvantages to creating such restrictions. Prohibiting private compensation for Members may not consider situations where resignation is necessary for personal reasons, like tending to family businesses or personal matters. This could be seen as overly burdensome and could discourage Members from completing their terms before seeking outside employment. One way to equalize the burden across the House and Senate would be to require an intervening election before compensated employment could be accepted, forcing Senators to wait up to two years before restrictions were lifted. Congress could also ban Members from taking certain positions related to advocacy that could influence former colleagues or employees during their elected terms. Prohibiting Members from resigning to take lobbying or foreign agent positions could make such positions less attractive until after their term in office. Current \"cooling off\" periods restrict Members from certain activities, but they could still leave Congress for non-lobbying roles. Congress may decide that current lobbying laws are effective and opt not to amend them, using existing laws for lobbyist registration and disclosure instead. Changes to lobbying laws could be considered as needed. The Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) and Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) regulate lobbying activities, requiring registration and disclosure. Changes to these laws can be made through guidance documents or enforcement cases. The LDA, celebrating its 20th anniversary, has evolved to include more disclosure and reporting requirements. Together with FARA, these laws aim to ensure transparent lobbying practices. Analysis of lobbying laws highlights potential shifts in regulations. In 1946, scholarly work on lobbying identified issues like shadow lobbying, grassroots lobbying, and the revolving door. Congress could address these by changing lobbying definitions, altering LDA administration, or instituting user fees. Changes to the LDA may result from shifts in lobbying practices or perception, but the likelihood of future amendments is uncertain. In 2009, President Obama signed an ethics pledge for appointees, including a ban on gifts from lobbyists and a revolving door ban. The future of lobbying registration and disclosure may be reevaluated by Congress. The ethics pledge for appointees includes a revolving door ban, prohibiting participation in matters related to former employers or clients for 2 years after appointment. Lobbyists entering government face additional restrictions, such as not participating in matters they lobbied on or seeking employment with agencies they lobbied within 2 years. The appointee agrees to abide by post-employment restrictions for 2 years after leaving government, including not lobbying any covered executive branch official. Employment decisions will be based on qualifications, competence, and experience."
