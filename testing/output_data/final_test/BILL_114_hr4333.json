    "content": "The Act titled \"Zero Tolerance for Terror Act\" establishes policies regarding Iranian entities involved in ballistic missile proliferation or terrorism. The policy of the United States regarding the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) states that Iran cannot use sanctions as a reason to violate the agreement. Congress retains the right to impose additional sanctions on Iran for terrorism, human rights abuses, and ballistic missile activities. The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control should be fully funded for strict enforcement of sanctions against Iranian actors in ballistic missile proliferation and terrorism. Iran should be prohibited from engaging in any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, and UN member states should prevent the transfer of technology to Iran for such activities. SEC. 3. EXPEDITED CONSIDERATION OF NEW TERRORISM AND MISSILE-RELATED SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAN. The President can determine that a person or entity commits acts of international terrorism linked to Iran, provides support to such acts or to a terrorist organization funded by Iran, or violates UN Security Council Resolutions. After violating UN Security Council Resolution 2231 regarding ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, the President must notify Congress. Qualifying legislation refers to a bill authorizing sanctions on entities notified by the President. Within 60 days of the President's notification, qualifying legislation can be introduced in the House of Representatives by the Majority or Minority Leader. In the House, if a committee fails to report qualifying legislation within 10 days, it will be discharged. After committee action, consideration of the legislation can proceed in the House. The House rules allow for expedited consideration of qualifying legislation, with points of order waived and limited debate time. The motion to proceed on the legislation is non-debatable, and a motion to reconsider is not allowed after it is disposed of. The legislation is considered as read, with the previous question ordered on its final passage after two hours of debate. The Senate rules require qualifying legislation to be referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations. If the committee does not report the legislation within 10 session days, it will be discharged for further consideration and placed on the calendar for debate. Proceeding to consideration of qualifying legislation is allowed after the committee reports it to the Senate or is discharged from consideration. Points of order are waived, the motion is not debatable, requires a 60-vote threshold, and cannot be postponed or reconsidered. The qualifying legislation remains unfinished business after a motion to proceed is agreed to. Debate is limited to 10 hours, divided equally between Majority and Minority Leaders. Further debate limitation motions are allowed. Amendments, postponements, consideration of other business, or recommittal of the legislation are not allowed. The vote on passage occurs immediately after debate and a quorum call. The Senate rules allow for a single quorum call at the end of the debate on qualifying legislation. Appeals on procedural rulings by the Chair are decided without debate. Debate on veto messages related to qualifying legislation is limited to 10 hours, divided between the Majority and Minority Leaders. Before the passage of qualifying legislation by one House, if that House receives similar legislation from the other House, certain procedures apply. The receiving House does not refer the other House's legislation to a committee, and the vote on passage will be on the other House's legislation. If one House fails to introduce qualifying legislation, certain treatments apply. Under this section, if one House receives qualifying legislation from the other House, expedited floor procedures apply. Companion measures from the House of Representatives are not debatable after Senate passage. Revenue measures are exempt from these procedures. Definitions include \"foreign terrorist organization\" as designated under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The term \"knowingly\" in the Immigration and Nationality Act is defined in the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines the \"Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action\" (JCPOA) as the agreement signed in Vienna on July 14, 2015, by Iran and several other countries, and \"Implementation Day\" as defined in the JCPOA."
