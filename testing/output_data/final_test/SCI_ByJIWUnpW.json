Existing works often assume equal reliability of data sources, leading to biases and unreliable predictions, especially in black-box models like neural networks. A novel solution is proposed in this paper to infer data quality levels without explicit labels, integrating this information with graph convolutional networks for more efficient predictions. Recent advances in sensor and satellite technology have enabled the collection of large spatiotemporal datasets, which can be represented as time-varying graph signals in various domains. While existing work has focused on spatial structures and temporal signals, the assumption of equal reliability of data sources over time can lead to inaccuracies due to varying levels of noise from heterogeneous sensors. This problem is addressed by proposing a method that integrates data quality levels with graph convolutional networks for forecasting temperatures in Los Angeles. In this paper, the importance of considering data quality when designing machine learning models is highlighted. High-quality data is crucial for accurate operations, decision making, and planning. The definition of data quality is narrowed down to penalizing high local variations in spatiotemporal signals represented by time-varying graph signals. The learning problem involves observations on a graph with varying data qualities. The concept of data quality levels at each vertex is defined as latent variables connected through a graph using a local variation. Data quality is incorporated into machine learning models through a regularizer. Data quality long short-term memory (DQ-LSTM) neural networks are developed for spatiotemporal forecasting, utilizing spatial structures and temporal dependencies. Data quality is shown to be crucial for predictive accuracy. The importance of data quality for improving neural network predictive performance is demonstrated through experiments on urban heat island prediction in Los Angeles. Previous work has addressed issues of data quality and heterogeneous data sources, with BID23 proposing a mixture model for capturing high-quality labels from domain experts and error-prone crowdsourcing labels. BID27 developed an active learning algorithm to minimize label requests from strong and weak labelers, while BID22 focused on data-related issues. The authors propose an active learning algorithm to minimize label requests for data of variable quality from heterogeneous sources. They develop a method to adjust the learning rate based on data heterogeneity, differentiating sources based on neighborhood signals without explicit labels. Previous works have focused on learning and processing graph signals, with models utilizing convolutional neural networks to extract patterns from regular grids like images. The text discusses the use of graph convolutional networks to map spatiotemporal features into a data quality level. It also explores how data quality levels are utilized with recurrent neural networks to differentiate the reliability of observations on vertices, leading to the development of a forecasting model called DQ-LSTM. The text introduces the forecasting model DQ-LSTM, which utilizes graph signals on a weighted graph to determine data quality levels. It explains how the connectivity of vertices is defined and how variational features are used to assess data reliability. The model focuses on an undirected, weighted graph with random-walk normalized adjacency matrix for proximity between vertices. The text discusses the local variation of a graph signal x on vertices, defined by the edge derivative and graph gradient. The local variation at a vertex is determined by the norm of the graph gradient, indicating the fluctuation of signals around the vertex. The local variation of a graph signal x on vertices is determined by the norm of the graph gradient, indicating less fluctuated signals around the vertex. This concept can be extended to multivariate graph signals of M different measures by computing over all measures. The local variation is represented in matrix form for use with graph convolutional networks.

The local variation is represented in matrix form for use with graph convolutional networks. The term data quality refers to the fitness of use for intended purposes in the context of multivariate graph signals on vertices. The data quality level is defined based on the signal values at vertices and their dependencies on neighboring vertices' features. The data quality level at a vertex is defined based on local variations of the vertex features. A method proposed uses graph convolutional networks to learn parameters for graph-based features. Graph convolutional networks (GCN) utilize arbitrary activation functions to represent the latent node features on a graph. By stacking multiple layers of GCN with activation functions, larger receptive fields can be achieved. The data quality level of each vertex can be determined by the number of GCN layers and the data quality level of each vertex. The proposed model combines data quality levels of vertices with GCN layers and activation functions to ensure stability. It uses positive constraints on \u03a6 and an inversely proportional activation function to relate data quality to local variations. The model integrates a penalty assignment for each vertex loss function based on the obtained data quality. Additionally, it combines a data quality network with LSTM for handling time-varying signals in practical tasks. The model integrates a data quality network with LSTM to handle time-varying signals. It uses neural networks to represent data quality levels at each vertex based on local variations, with parameters learned through a dataset. The local variations are transferred using a single layer neural network followed by an activation function. The data quality network integrates LSTM to handle time-varying signals by using neural networks to represent data quality levels at each vertex. LSTM is used to extract latent patterns in time series with inherent dependencies between data points, and parameters are updated via backpropagation through time. The data quality network integrates LSTM to handle time-varying signals on vertices. Time-varying graph signals are segmentized and fed into LSTM, followed by GCN and DQN. Data quality level is considered by analyzing local variations, assigning weights based on estimated quality levels, and using mean squared error loss function. DQ-LSTM reads inputs, predicts outputs, and updates parameters for each vertex. In this section, DQ-LSTM is evaluated on real-world climate datasets from Weather Underground and WeatherBug. The mean absolute error of predictions and data quality levels estimated by DQ-LSTM are analyzed using meteorological measurements from personal weather stations in Los Angeles County. Geographical characteristics of each station are also provided. The geographical characteristics of each weather station, such as Latitude, Longitude, Elevation, and various environmental factors, are used as input features to build a graph structure. Meteorological signals are observed through instruments measuring Temperature, Pressure, Relative humidity, Solar radiation, Precipitation, Wind speed, and Wind direction. Observations are aggregated on an hourly basis to ensure model verification within one meteorological regime before applying it to the entire year. The geographical characteristics of weather stations, including Latitude, Longitude, and Elevation, are used to construct a graph structure. Meteorological signals like Temperature, Pressure, and Wind speed are observed hourly. To predict temperatures in Los Angeles, data from July/August 2015 is used due to large temperature fluctuations. Distance between stations is computed using geolocation features, but other factors may also be considered. The geographical characteristics of weather stations, such as Latitude and Longitude, are used to create a graph structure. Physical distance between stations may not accurately reflect meteorological similarity due to different territorial characteristics. To address this, all spatial features are normalized, assuming equal importance. Gaussian kernel is used in the experiment with specific parameters for WU and WB. In this experiment, the Gaussian kernel is used with specific parameters for WU and WB. We compare our approach to baselines for time-series forecasting, including autoregressive (AR) and LSTM models. Additionally, we test graph convolutional networks BID12 with different layers. The models are dependent on previous observations with a common lag length of k = 10. For deep recurrent models, the k-steps previous observations are used to predict next values with 50 hidden units and one fully connected layer. GCN-LSTM and DQ-LSTM are evaluated with different numbers of GCN layers (K), with dimensions set based on cross-validation. The final layer provides scalars for each vertex with L2 regularization. Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and mean squared error objective are used. Datasets are split into training, validation, and testing sets with specific percentages allocated for each. Experimental results show that models incorporating graph structures outperform AR and LSTM models. The GCN layers help in predicting the next value of a node by considering neighboring signals. The DQ-LSTM model demonstrates lower mean absolute error in temperature forecasting compared to standard deviations. GCN and DQ-LSTM models are compared in their ability to infer data quality levels from signals. DQ-LSTM, with its explicit handling of local variations, outperforms GCN in terms of mean absolute error. Combining DQ-LSTM with GCN results in the lowest MAE among all models, showcasing the effectiveness of incorporating local variations for measuring data quality. The combination of DQ-LSTM with GCN allows nodes to be represented as embeddings, capturing distances between them. These low-dimensional embeddings can be used for tasks like classification and clustering, and visualized using methods like t-SNE. Temporal signals and spatial structure influence the embeddings, showing how connected nodes share similar signals. The embedding distribution of connected nodes in a structure is influenced by the similarity of observed signals. Nodes with different values compared to their neighbors will have embeddings far apart. Nodes connected to a subset of nodes and an additional node will be affected by both simultaneously. This intuition can help identify low-quality nodes. For example, node v25 is influenced by neighboring green nodes and v4 not in the cluster. At t = 0, the nodes form a cluster, but v 25 is distant from other green nodes and the red node at t = 4. This could be due to v 25 having different observations or v 4, which is only connected to v 25, providing noisy data. This suggests that the observations of v 25 at t = 4 may be unreliable. The observations of v 25 at t = 4 may be noisy, indicating low-quality data. The data quality inferred from DQ-LSTM can be verified by studying high and low-quality examples from embedding distributions and associated meteorological observations. v 25 acts as a bridge node between v 4 and the cluster of v 22, with v 4 showing different geological features compared to other nodes. In this work, the problem of data quality for spatiotemporal data analysis is studied. Different sources have varying data quality levels, and a novel formulation, DQ-LSTM, is proposed to automatically infer these levels. The bridge node v 25 at t = 4 may have low-quality data, which can be verified through high and low-quality examples. The study introduces DQ-LSTM, a formulation based on graph convolution for spatiotemporal forecasting, to infer data quality and enhance prediction accuracy on a climate dataset. Real-world meteorological data from Weather Underground and WeatherBug are used for evaluation, with a focus on refining data quality definitions and evaluation metrics for future research."
