    "content": "The Act titled \"Veteran Excellence Through Education Act of 2013\" grants funds to minority serving institutions to address social and academic issues faced by veterans. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs may provide grants to minority serving institutions to establish delivery systems addressing social and academic issues for enrolled veterans. Grant funds can be used for education services and workforce access activities for veterans. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of a center for veteran student success on campus to provide comprehensive support services for enrolled veterans. This includes a veteran support team from various offices responsible for admissions, financial aid, academic advising, and other support services for veteran students. The curr_chunk outlines key responsibilities for supporting veteran students on campus, including coordinating activities, monitoring enrollment rates, developing sustainability plans, providing outreach, and offering supportive services like counseling and tutoring. The institution supports veteran students by providing tutoring, academic skill-building assistance, help with admissions and transferring credits, student financial aid assistance, housing support, transition programs, and support for veteran organizations on campus. The institution supports veteran students by providing student support groups, academic advising, admissions counseling, and other necessary support services to ensure their success in achieving educational and career goals. Eligibility for a grant requires a program plan with a strategy to meet the needs of veterans enrolled in the institution, including identifying the population to be served and their education and employment needs. The curr_chunk describes the activities proposed to be provided using grant funds at minority serving institutions, including how these activities will strengthen individuals' ability to achieve higher education goals, how they will be integrated with other institution activities, and the performance measures to assess the institution's performance. The curr_chunk defines terms related to minority-serving institutions, including historically Black colleges, Hispanic-serving institutions, Tribal Colleges or Universities, and Predominantly Black Institutions. These definitions are important for understanding grant eligibility criteria. The Secretary may only make a grant under this section during fiscal years 2014 through 2019."
