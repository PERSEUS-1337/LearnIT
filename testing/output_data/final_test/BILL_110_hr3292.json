The Act of 1965 is amended to include exceptions in section 1119(a). SEC. 3. ADEQUATE YEARLY PROGRESS. Amendment to Section 1111(b)(2)(I)(i) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 requires a 10 percent decrease in the percentage of students who did not meet or exceed proficiency levels on State assessments from the previous year for a group to show progress on academic indicators. The amendments made by subsection (a) shall take effect and apply beginning with the first academic year after the enactment of this Act. The Secretary of Education must submit a report to Congress within 180 days with recommendations to increase the percentage of limited English proficient students. Limited English proficient students and children with disabilities who meet or exceed the State's proficient level on assessments may be tested at their instructional level as determined by their individualized education program. The student's individualized education program should determine academic assessments, with increasing difficulty each year to meet State standards. Parental approval is needed for assessment to determine yearly progress. Testing at the same level each year is not allowed. In meeting the definition of adequate yearly progress, a State may count students in multiple groups as fractions. Nuanced sanctions apply when a school struggles due to a very small group of students, with redirection as the initial step. During the 2007-2008 school year, the Secretary of Education will study growth models and allow more states and local agencies to use them for achieving adequate yearly progress. Congress believes these models should help schools show student achievement and promote innovative ideas. The Secretary of Education will study growth models to allow states and local agencies to use them for achieving adequate yearly progress, promoting innovative ideas for high schools to demonstrate academic proficiency and graduation."
