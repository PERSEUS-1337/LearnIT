    "content": "The Act is titled \"Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Firefighters Act of 2003\". It amends the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 by adding a new section for the Office of Grant Management. A new office will be established within the United States Fire Administration to administer the SAFER Firefighter grant program. The Administrator has the authority to make grants directly to career, voluntary, and combination fire departments to increase the number of firefighters for adequate protection from terrorism and hazards. Grants will be for 4 years and used to hire new career firefighters, with a requirement to retain them for at least 1 year beyond the grant period. The Administrator may give preferential consideration to applications for hiring additional career firefighters with non-Federal contributions exceeding specified minimums. Technical assistance may be provided to various public entities. The grant costs may not exceed certain percentages each year unless waived by the Administrator. The Administrator may waive the requirement for a non-Federal contribution to grants for hiring career firefighters. The grant authority for hiring firefighters will expire after 10 years, with a report to Congress required before expiration. Applications for grants must be approved by the Administrator. Each application for a grant under this section must include a long-term strategy, detailed implementation plan, explanation of need for Federal assistance, demonstration of community support, and plans for sustaining the proposed program. The applicant must continue the proposed program, project, or activity after Federal support ends and make efforts to recruit and hire minority groups and women in firefighting. The Administrator can waive requirements for small jurisdictions to expedite application processing. Funds under this section are limited for salaries and specific uses by States or local governments. The section allocates funds for hiring new career firefighters, ensuring that the money is not used to replace existing state or local funds. Additionally, funds can be used by Indian tribal governments for firefighting programs. Total funding for hiring firefighters over 4 years is capped at $100,000. The hiring of career firefighters is capped at $100,000, with the possibility of a waiver from the Administrator. The cap is adjusted annually for inflation. Programs funded under this section must include a monitoring component for data collection and evaluation, following guidelines set by the Administrator. Grant recipients may undergo local or national evaluations, including assessments of program implementations. The Administrator may require grant recipients to submit monitoring and evaluation results, along with other necessary data. Funding may be revoked or suspended if a recipient is not in compliance with grant terms. The Administrator has access to relevant documents. The Administrator has access to pertinent books, documents, and records of grant recipients, as well as state and local governments, for audit purposes. The term 'firefighter' and 'Indian tribe' are defined in this section. The term 'Indian tribe' refers to a recognized group eligible for special programs and services for Indians. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2004 to 2010 for carrying out this section."
