    "content": "SECTION 1. REMEDIATION WASTE MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT. Definitions related to remediation waste management are provided in this section, including terms like compliance authority, nonprogram state, originating state, program state, and remedial action plan. A 'plan' is a document approved by the Administrator or a program State for managing remediation waste, ensuring protection of human health and the environment through specified waste management, remediation methods, and implementation schedule, with public notice and comment. Remediation waste is solid waste or any medium generated during the implementation of a remedial action plan, managed in accordance with specific guidelines and with concurrence from relevant entities exercising compliance authority. Remediation waste is solid waste generated during the implementation of a remedial action plan, managed according to specific guidelines and compliance authority. The Administrator exercises compliance authority over a remedial action plan for managing remediation waste in nonprogram states. If remediation waste management occurs in a state other than the originating state, the program state where the management takes place will have compliance authority. The Administrator has compliance authority over remediation waste management in nonprogram states. Remediation waste managed under a remedial action plan is not considered hazardous waste. Authorized State Hazardous Waste Remediation Programs may include State Remediation Waste Management Programs. Authorized State Remediation Waste Management Programs require states with authorized hazardous waste programs to certify their statutory and regulatory authority to control the management of remediation waste in a protective manner. The State may enforce remediation waste management programs after submitting a certification to the Administrator, allowing for public notice and comment. The State can proceed with its program until the Administrator issues a final determination within 18 months. After public notice and comment, the Administrator will issue a determination to the State regarding the certification of its remediation waste management program. The determination will state if the certification meets all criteria or if it fails to meet one or more criteria, with specific details provided. The Administrator will issue a determination to the State regarding the certification of its remediation waste management program, highlighting any deficiencies that could impact human health and the environment if not remedied within 18 months. The State's certification for its remediation waste management program must meet all criteria stated, granting final authorization to the State. If the Administrator withdraws authorization, ongoing remedial action plans must be completed. The Administrator may issue a preliminary determination if it is likely that a certification fails to meet criteria and interim implementation could result in harm to human health or the environment. The Administrator may issue a preliminary determination to a State without authorized hazardous waste programs, requiring certification demonstrating statutory and regulatory authority over remediation waste management. The Administrator may issue a preliminary determination to a State without authorized hazardous waste programs, requiring certification demonstrating statutory and regulatory authority over remediation waste management. The State must have resources to administer and enforce authorities, along with procedures for public notice and comment on remedial action plans. After certification, the State can implement its waste management program until the Administrator makes a final determination within two years. The Administrator will issue a determination to a State within 2 years of receiving certification, either granting final authorization for the remediation waste management program or stating that the certification fails to meet criteria. If the Administrator does not issue a determination within 2 years of a State submitting a certification, the certification will be considered deficient. The certification will be considered to meet all criteria, giving the State final authorization for its waste management program. If the Administrator withdraws authorization, they must ensure completion of ongoing remedial actions. Enforcement under the Solid Waste Disposal Act is amended. The Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6928(a)) is amended to include provisions regarding remedial action plans and compliance authority. The Administrator can issue notices of violation for remediation waste. If a person violates a requirement in a remedial action plan for managing remediation waste under a State program, the Administrator must notify the State before taking action. If the State does not act within 30 days of the violation notice, the Administrator can issue an order for compliance. The Administrator can enforce remediation waste management requirements by issuing an order or taking action. Petroleum-contaminated media and debris failing toxicity tests are not considered hazardous waste under certain conditions."
