    "content": "The \"Bosnia Force Realignment Act\" may be cited as the short title for this legislation. The findings section of the Act is also included. The \"Bosnia Force Realignment Act\" acknowledges the successful completion of the military mission in Bosnia by US forces and asserts Congress's oversight authority over the continued presence of troops. It allows Congress to limit funds for withdrawal and notes the President's plan to end US participation in the multinational force within a year. The President set the expiration date for the Implementation Force mandate as December 20, 1996. The Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff expressed confidence in completing the mission within a year and emphasized the importance of establishing a firm deadline to prevent mission expansion. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff announced a delay in the removal of US Armed Forces personnel from Bosnia and Herzegovina until March 1997. The President announced the extension of US Armed Forces deployment in Bosnia and Herzegovina until June 1998, despite previous deadlines and the importance of having a deadline as a hedge against an expanded mission. On December 17, 1997, the President admitted that establishing a deadline had been a mistake. NATO forces have increased participation in law enforcement activities in Bosnia, with US commanders stating that the responsibility lies with the Bosnian parties themselves according to the Dayton Peace Accords.

The President must submit a report to Congress by December 1, 1998, detailing progress towards meeting the drawdown limit and steps taken to transfer the US portion of the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia to European allies."
