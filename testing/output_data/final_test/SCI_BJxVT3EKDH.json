Building sentiment lexicons manually is time-consuming and costly, so we attempted to create Amharic Sentiment Lexicons using a corpus-based approach. Algorithms were developed to construct these lexicons automatically from an Amharic news corpus, focusing on word co-occurrence distributional embedding. Using distributional embedding, specifically Positive Point-wise Mutual Information (PPMI), Amharic Sentiment Lexicons were automatically generated from an Amharic news corpus. The process involved building a word-context unigram frequency count matrix, transforming it into a PPMI matrix, and computing cosine distances to identify top closest words to seed lists. By expanding 519 seeds, lexicons of sizes 1811 and 3794 were obtained using PPMI thresholds of 100 and 200 respectively. The generated lexicons were evaluated for effectiveness. Most sentiment mining research focuses on English, but resources for languages like Amharic are limited. With the growth of Amharic opinionated texts online, predicting sentiment towards objects or services is crucial for various intelligence purposes. Two Amharic sentiment lexicons exist, one manually generated and the other dictionary-based, but the latter struggles to capture cultural nuances and language-specific features. The dictionary-based sentiment lexicons for Amharic struggle to capture cultural nuances and language-specific features, such as the positive connotation of words like \u1309\u122d\u123b. This highlights the limitations of relying on dictionary meanings alone for sentiment analysis in languages like Amharic. This work focuses on building a corpus-based algorithm to handle language and culture-specific words in Amharic. While it may be challenging to cover all words due to limited resources, sentiment lexicons can be built in specific domains with ample Amharic corpus. The approach aims to generate Amharic Sentiment Lexicon automatically from corpora and evaluate its validity and quality. The curr_chunk discusses the generation of a sentiment lexicon from Amharic corpora collected from various sources. It highlights a method to develop a large polarity lexicon semi-automatically using a graph propagation approach. The method assigns positive or negative values to seed phrases based on the presence of positive seed words. The polarity of a seed phrase is determined by a factor \u03b2 that preserves semantic orientations. This process aims to expand the lexicon by analyzing positive and negative sentiments in the corpus. The authors developed sentiment lexicons from historical and online community data using word embedding and label propagation algorithm. The lexicons outperformed manually annotated resources like WordNet, showing sentiment changes of words over time. A lexical graph was constructed using word embedding and cosine similarity, with sentiment propagation through a random walk algorithm. The random walk algorithm is used to propagate sentiment from seeds in a lexical graph. The generated sentiment lexicon outperforms baseline and other variants, differentiating from emotion lexicons. The approach involves cosine similarity and threshold selection, varying based on language and part of speech. The threshold selection and seed words' part of speech vary between languages. For example, Amharic lacks adverb classes unlike Italian. The proposed count-based approach generates an Amharic Sentiment lexicon from a corpus, utilizing corpus-based strategies like PPMI and word embedding. The framework includes Corpus Collections, Preprocessing Module, PPMI Matrix of Word-Context, and Algorithm to generate the Amharic Sentiment Lexicon. The algorithm involves four major steps: preparing seed lists, using a random walk algorithm to propagate sentiment in a lexical graph, and generating a sentiment lexicon that outperforms baseline and other variants. The process involves preparing seed lists of polarized words for different parts of speech, following guidelines for seed selection, and updating the original seed words. This is crucial for the performance of the bootstrapping algorithm. The next step is to build a semantic space word-context matrix. The process involves building a semantic space word-context matrix using the frequency of target words with their context words. Weighting functions are applied to select semantic similarity features, with Point-wise Mutual Information (PMI) being a popular choice. Positive PMI is used in this case, with a new PMI-based matrix X being generated. The process involves building a semantic space word-context matrix using the frequency of target words with their context words. Positive PMI is applied to generate a new PMI-based matrix X. The cosine distance between the target term and centroid of seed lists is then computed. The process involves building a semantic space word-context matrix using the frequency of target words with their context words. Positive PMI is applied to generate a new PMI-based matrix X. To find the cosine distance of a new word from seed list, centroids of seed lists for respective POS classes are computed. The cosine distances of target word from positive and negative adjective seeds of centroids are then calculated. The similarity measure can be found using either similarity score for each target word, which is mapped and scaled to an appropriate real number. Target words with sentiment scores below or above a particular threshold can be identified. The algorithm generates an Amharic sentiment lexicon from PPMI by adding target words to a sentiment dictionary based on positive PMI with cosine measure. The process involves expanding the lexicon dictionary through iterations defined by a threshold acquired from experimental testing. The algorithm reads seed words, generates expanded seed words using PPMI, and loads necessary lexical resources such as the PPMI matrix. The algorithm iterates through seed words to generate an Amharic sentiment lexicon from PPMI. It initializes the threshold and computes the mean of the seed lexicon. The algorithm then calculates the similarity between the mean vector and the PPMI word-word co-occurrence matrix to expand the lexicon dictionary. The algorithm generates an Amharic sentiment lexicon using PPMI by removing top closest items with different part-of-speech to the seed words. It updates the seed lexicon and combines lexicons from dictionary and corpus-based approaches to improve coverage of polarity words in Amharic language. The quality of the lexicon will be evaluated using techniques similar to dictionary-based approaches. In this section, new approaches to bootstrapping Amharic sentiment lexicons are developed using word-context semantic space representation of large Amharic corpora. Manual preparation of Amharic opinion words with high sentimental strength from Adjectives, Nouns, and Verbs categories is done. The corpus used in this research is a 20 million tokens Amharic Corpus from Addis Ababa University, used to build a PPMI matrix. The Amharic sentiment lexicons, including manual, Amharic SentiWordNet, and Amharic Semantic Orientation Calculator, are used as benchmarks to compare the performance of PPMI based lexicons. The data sets from Addis Ababa University and Facebook users' comments are used to build PPMI matrix and evaluate subjectivity detection and sentiment classification. The corpus consists of Amharic News Corpus with 11433 documents and 2800 Facebook News posts and users' comments. The Amharic sentiment lexicons were generated using a PPMI matrix based on a corpus of Amharic News with 11433 documents and 2800 Facebook News posts and users' comments. The matrix size was reduced to (231270, 231270) after data cleaning, tokenization, and stemming. Point-wise mutual information (PMI) was computed for word-word pairs, which served as input for lexicon expansion algorithm 1. Amharic sentiment lexicons were then generated by expanding seeds based on the PPMI matrix using this algorithm at two threshold iteration values. The algorithm was used to generate Amharic sentiment lexicons from the PPMI matrix of the corpus at iteration values of 100 and 200, resulting in lexicons of sizes 1811 and 3794 respectively. The discussion is based on the lexicon generated at 200 iterations, containing stemmed words, part of speech, polarity strength, and polarity sign. A sample of the lexicon is provided in Table 2. The evaluation of the Amharic sentiment lexicons includes external and internal assessments. External evaluation tests the usefulness and correctness of the lexicons in determining sentiment scores of Amharic comments. Internal evaluation compares the generated lexicons with manual and existing sentiment lexicons. The accuracy of subjectivity detection in the lexicon is tested on 2800 Facebook comments. Sentiment scores are aggregated by summing positive and negative values of opinion words in the comments. If the sum of positive scores is greater or less than negative scores, the comment is classified as subjective. The subjectivity detection rate of the PPMI lexicon outperforms the baseline manual lexicon, while the SWN lexicon performs better than the PPMI lexicon with 2% accuracy. The coverage of the PPMI based Amharic sentiment lexicon on Facebook comments and a general Amharic corpus is evaluated by counting the occurrence tokens in the lexicons, showing better coverage in Table 4. Table 4 shows that the PPMI-based Amharic sentiment lexicon has better coverage than the manual lexicon and SOCAL, but less coverage than SWN. The positive and negative counts in all lexicons have a balanced distribution of sentiment terms. An evaluation in Table 5 compares the overlap of the PPMI-based lexicon with other lexicons. The PPMI based lexicon shows the highest agreement with SWN lexicon compared to other lexicons. Table 6 displays the sentiment classification performance of the PPMI based Amharic lexicon on 2821 annotated Facebook comments. The accuracy of the PPMI based lexicon for sentiment classification surpasses the manual benchmark lexicon. Using stemming and negation handling significantly improves the lexicon-based classification performance. In this work, it is shown that creating a sentiment lexicon for low-resourced languages like Amharic from corpus data is possible. This approach captures language-specific features and cultural connotations that cannot be handled by dictionary-based methods. The PPMI based approach to generate an Amharic sentiment lexicon from corpus data is performed for the first time, with minimal costs and time. These generated lexicons can be combined with other sentiment lexicons to enhance sentiment classification performance in Amharic. The PPMI based Amharic sentiment lexicon outperforms manual lexicons, but a prediction-based approach is recommended for generating sentiment lexicons in Amharic to handle context-sensitive terms. This generic approach can be adapted to other resource-limited languages to reduce the cost and time of annotating sentiment lexicons."
