    "content": "Recent flood disasters have increased interest in improving flood resilience and reducing flood risks. Congress has established federal programs to assist state, local, and tribal entities in these efforts. Key programs include infrastructure improvements and incentives provided by the National Flood Insurance Program. This report outlines federal assistance programs for flood risk reduction and resilience. In the United States, flood-related responsibilities are shared between states and local governments, who have discretion in land use decisions affecting vulnerability to hurricanes, storms, and floods. Concerns about financial exposure and impacts on individuals and communities have prompted policy questions on federal flood programs and federalism. Federal programs aim to assist state and local entities in reducing flood risks and improving resilience. The report questions the effectiveness of current programs in incentivizing flood preparedness and managing risks. While the report provides an overview of existing federal programs, it acknowledges that not all aspects of flood policy are covered. The evolution of U.S. flood policy has shifted from flood control to comprehensive flood risk management, including measures like buyouts, easements, and elevation of structures. The concept of flood resilience has become more prominent in recent years, addressing different components that contribute to flood risk. The management of flood risks involves addressing hazards, vulnerabilities, and consequences. Stakeholders may focus on reducing hazards through climate change mitigation or reducing vulnerability by constructing levees and shore-protection measures. Some also support policies to minimize consequences such as loss of life and property damage. The federal government's role in flood management has expanded over the years in response to catastrophic events, with early involvement in constructing flood control works like levees and floodways. Local, state, and tribal entities also play a significant role in flood resilience efforts, which include measures such as development restrictions, building codes, and improved evacuation routes. The federal government has been involved in constructing dams, levees, and other water projects since the early 1900s to reduce flood damages. In the mid-1950s, they also participated in coastal flood risk reduction projects. Local governments and nonfederal entities also invest in flood control infrastructure, with some preferring structural measures despite concerns about environmental impacts. The federal government, through agencies like USACE and NRCS, constructs flood control measures like levees and dams. Local and state entities also own flood control infrastructure supported by FEMA and HUD programs. Congress shifted federal involvement in flood control in 1968. In 1968, Congress established the NFIP under HUD to manage flood risks and offer flood insurance in flood-prone areas. The program includes flood risk assessment, mapping, insurance purchase requirements, and minimum local building codes for vulnerable areas. NFIP allows construction in floodplains with building-code regulations to reduce flood damage. Local governments enforce building codes, with limited federal involvement discussed in the late 1960s. E.O. 11988 signed in 1977 requires avoiding development in the 100-year floodplain. President Obama signed E.O. 13690 in 2015, establishing a Federal Flood Risk Management Standard for federally funded projects. President Trump later revoked this order with E.O. 13807 in 2017, returning federal floodplain policy to the original text of E.O. 11988. Nonstructural mitigation is now commonly used in flood management to reduce damage and prevent loss of life. Some agencies support nature-based approaches, like oyster beds to reduce erosion. Development that degrades wetlands and ecosystems can reduce natural flood resilience. Interior agencies, NOAA, USACE, and the EPA are involved in ecosystem restoration and protection activities, including stormwater management. Local governments are shifting towards green infrastructure to manage stormwater and reduce pollutants in surface waters. The federal government has historically focused on pollution prevention in stormwater management through EPA regulations. However, communities are now adopting green infrastructure to manage stormwater, reduce flood losses, and prevent pollution. This includes using natural processes to infiltrate, encourage evapotranspiration, and reuse stormwater runoff on-site. Other areas are also looking to recharge groundwater with urban stormwater and floodwater. Activities managing stormwater for pollution prevention are now eligible for financial support due to changes by EPA and states. Flood resilience and risk reduction improvements, including structural and nonstructural measures, are available for coastal and river communities. Levees can be set back to create a larger floodplain, and a hybrid of grey and green components can be used for comprehensive flood risk management. The federal government, along with nonfederal and private entities, is involved in monitoring and modeling flood risk. Federal agencies such as FEMA, USGS, NOAA, and USACE conduct research on flood hazards, coastal processes, and weather-related hazards. Advancements in technology have improved understanding of weather, climate, hydrology, and mapping. Elevation data is crucial for accurate flood risk estimates and mapping. Federal agencies, state, local, and private entities use advanced sensing technologies to collect elevation data for maps and flood risk management. Congress has federal programs to assist with flood risk reduction and resilience improvements. Each program in Table 1 has specific purposes and limitations, with some triggered by declarations or part of regular agency operations. Geographic eligibility for these programs is discussed further in the report. The discussions focus on geographic eligibility for federal programs related to flood risk reduction and resilience improvements. Table 1 outlines funding details for FY2018 and supplemental appropriations in FY2017 and FY2018. The programs in Table 1 are categorized into assistance for flood-related improvements, hazard mitigation, and broader activities including flood-risk reduction and stormwater management. Additional details on each program, including the Trump Administration's budget request for FY2019, are provided. The State Hazard Mitigation Officer helps compile state mitigation plans and administers funding. Some federal programs allow funds to be used for nonfederal cost-sharing. Programs supporting flood resilience are discussed by FEMA, USACE, USDA, NOAA, EPA, and HUD. FEMA administers three mitigation grant programs. FEMA administers three mitigation grant programs for flood resilience and risk reduction: Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM), Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), and Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA). HMGP is triggered by a major disaster declaration, PDM makes annual awards, and FMA is funded through NFIP policyholders' insurance premiums. These programs are collectively known as Hazard Mitigation Assistance Grant Programs. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is the primary federal agency for flood damage reduction projects, which require cost-sharing with nonfederal sponsors. Federal involvement is limited to projects with national benefits or public safety concerns. Annual federal appropriations for USACE projects have not kept pace with project authorizations. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) faces competition for annual construction funds due to a lack of funding matching project authorizations. Tables 5 and 6 detail flood risk reduction projects, including those requiring specific congressional authorization and those covered under continuing authorities programs (CAPs). Four flood-related CAPs are discussed: Section 205 for flood damage reduction, Section 103 for beach erosion and storm damage reduction, Section 14 for public protection. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has various programs to address flood risks, including CAPs like Section 103 for beach erosion and storm damage reduction. USACE projects involve placing sand to widen beaches and raise dunes to mitigate flood risk. Additionally, USACE can fund repairs for nonfederal flood control works and federally constructed hurricane or shore protection projects damaged by storms. Eligibility for assistance requires active participation in the agency's Rehabilitation and Inspection Program (RIP). The Rehabilitation and Inspection Program (RIP) has 1,100 active nonfederal flood risk management systems participating. RIP does not fund repairs for regular operations and maintenance. Congress provided $135 million for studies and $15.055 billion for construction projects in P.L. 115-123, representing 87% of the total supplemental appropriations for USACE. $10.425 billion was designated for expedited construction of flood and storm damage reduction projects. $4.575 billion was allocated for USACE flood and storm damage reduction construction activities in states and territories affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. As of July 5, 2018, most of the funds for construction and studies had been assigned, with $1.131 billion in construction funds and $23 million for studies remaining unassigned. Projects in five states and two territories are eligible for the allocated funds. $4.575 billion in P.L. 115-123 funds are available for USACE construction projects in 33 states and 3 territories affected by flood-related disasters in CY2014-2017. $135 million from the Investigation account is allocated for high-priority studies in these areas. USDA's role in flood control differs from USACE in project size, scope, and authorization. USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service administers flood damage reduction programs at the local level without requiring congressional approval. Annual appropriations vary, leading to authorized but unfunded projects. P.L. 115-123 authorized supplemental appropriations for crop and livestock losses from 2017 disasters. The FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act provided additional funding for the EWP program for expenses related to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, wildfires in CY2017, and other natural disasters. The act also included amendments to the WFPO program, increasing the project cost threshold for congressional approval to over $25 million for construction projects. The FY2018 appropriation temporarily waives the 250,000 acre limitation for all authorized activities in FY2018 where the primary purpose is not flood prevention. NOAA conducts various activities to support coastal resilience, including scientific research, data collection, habitat conservation, outreach, and education. NOAA's efforts focus on management, planning, and technical assistance, leading to improved coastal flood resilience. NOAA supports coastal resilience through various programs such as Smart Growth, Habitat Blueprint living shorelines, and Sea Grant programs. They also fund flood resilience activities, including coastal resilience assessment projects with NFWF and USACE. Congress appropriated funding for the NOAA Regional Coastal Resilience Grant program in FY2017. In FY2018, Congress shifted funding from NOAA's Coastal Management Grants budget line to the Title IX Fund, managed by NFWF. The Title IX Fund aims to better understand and utilize ocean and coastal resources, with a focus on coastal resilience. NOAA and NFWF established the National Coastal Resilience Fund to protect coastal communities and enhance natural coastal systems. The National Coastal Resilience Fund supports projects to protect coastal communities, enhance fish and wildlife habitats, and enable rapid community recovery. Projects include planning, design, and implementation. An example project funded by NOAA involved monitoring and evaluating nature-based shoreline protection using \"reef balls\" to reduce erosion. NOAA received supplemental appropriations in FY2018 through P.L. 115-123 for these efforts. In FY2018, additional funding was allocated through P.L. 115-123, but not for coastal flood risk reduction. EPA's role in stormwater management is regulatory, focusing on discharge permits. EPA has expanded its financial role in flood risk reduction, particularly through green infrastructure approaches. EPA supports stormwater projects that reduce contaminants and erosion, mainly through the clean water State Revolving Fund program. Each state implements its own SRF program, leading to variations in program implementation. Historically, the State Revolving Fund (SRF) has primarily supported wastewater infrastructure projects, with some involving stormwater infrastructure. Changes in 2014 expanded SRF eligibility to include stormwater management activities. The Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 2014 (WIFIA) also offers financial assistance for water infrastructure, including stormwater-related projects. EPA's role in stormwater management is regulatory, focusing on pollution prevention objectives of the Clean Water Act. WIFIA offers financial assistance for water infrastructure projects, including green infrastructure practices at various scales. Green infrastructure includes managing wet weather, preserving natural landscape features, and implementing site-specific practices like bioretention and green roofs. EPA issued its first WIFIA loan in 2018, with loan assistance generally limited to 49% of eligible costs for projects costing $20 million or more. The HUD-administered Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) program supports flood resilience improvements, including public works, buyouts of damaged properties, and relocating residents to safer areas. Local and state officials have discretion in choosing eligible activities. The CDBG-Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) program offers a loan guarantee program for disaster recovery projects. The CDBG-DR program, unlike the CDBG, is not annually funded and is tied to specific disasters. It helps communities with limited resources recover after disasters. Over $84.7 billion has been appropriated since 1999 for CDBG-DR to support disaster relief and recovery. Grantees include states, local governments, and Indian tribes, with at least 70% of funds used for activities benefiting the community. The CDBG-DR program provides funds for disaster recovery, with at least 70% benefiting low- and moderate-income individuals or areas. Congress approved $35.8 billion in supplemental funds for major disasters from CY2014 to CY2017. These funds help states, communities, and tribes address unmet needs and undertake mitigation efforts in impacted areas. The $35.8 billion in supplemental funds were approved by Congress for major disasters from CY2014 to CY2017. This funding includes appropriations from various acts to address unmet needs resulting from disasters in those years. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 allocated $28 billion to address unmet needs for assistance in states impacted by major disasters from 2014 to 2017. At least $12 billion was designated for mitigation and resilience activities among CDBG-DR grantees, with $12 billion specifically for states and communities affected by disasters in 2017. HUD was required to allocate at least 33% of the funds within 60 days of the act's enactment. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 allocated $12 billion for unmet needs of states impacted by 2017 disasters, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and $15.9 billion for mitigation and resilience activities. HUD was required to allocate the remaining 67% of funds by December 1, 2018. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) provides flood insurance coverage for residential properties in the U.S. with goals of providing access to flood insurance and reducing flood risk through floodplain management standards. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) aims to reduce federal expenditure on disaster assistance by providing flood insurance in flood-prone areas. As of March 2018, NFIP had 5.025 million policies covering $1.28 trillion, benefiting over 22,000 communities. NFIP engages in noninsurance activities like mapping flood hazards and promoting community resilience. The NFIP contributes to community resilience by funding rebuilding after floods and offering grants for flood risk reduction. It requires communities to collaborate with FEMA to develop flood maps and enact floodplain standards. Structures built to FEMA standards experience 73% less damage, saving the nation $1.87 billion annually in flood losses. FEMA has developed minimum floodplain management standards to guide construction away from flood hazards, reduce flood damage, and improve land management in flood-prone areas. These standards are required for participation in the NFIP. FEMA's Risk Mapping, Assessment, and Planning (Risk MAP) program is crucial for flood risk reduction by providing information on flood hazards and risks. FEMA conducts Flood Insurance Studies (FISs) to create FIRMs that show a community's flood risk and floodplain boundaries using specified models and conditions at the time of the studies. FIRMs and FISs are snapshots of flood risk at their creation, becoming outdated as conditions change. Flood maps need updating with new developments, changes to protection systems, or better data. Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) indicate zones at risk of flooding during a 100-year event. Properties in SFHAs have a 1% annual flood risk, but 20% of NFIP claims are outside SFHAs. 80% of U.S. counties have had 10+ floods in the past two decades. The NFIP offers programs to reduce flood risk, funded by policyholders' premiums. The Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) grant program provides funds for various mitigation activities. In FY2014, $100 million was authorized for FMA, increasing to $175 million in FY2016. The NFIP receives millions in revenue annually, with funding authorized for various fiscal years. FEMA's FMA grant program has approved nearly $906 million in projects since 1997. The Community Rating System incentivizes communities to improve floodplain management standards and reduce flood risk. The Community Rating System incentivizes communities to improve floodplain management standards and reduce flood risk by offering discounts on flood insurance premiums. As of June 2017, 1,444 communities participated in the program, representing about 5% of eligible NFIP communities. Over 69% of all flood policies are written in communities participating in the Community Rating System program. The Community Rating System offers discounts on flood insurance premiums to communities that implement measures to reduce flood risk. The average discount is 11.4% for participating communities, which is offset by a 13.4% increase in premiums for non-participating communities. Credits are based on the reduction in flood and erosion risks from community measures such as floodplain management, public education, and flood response. The NFIP requires policyholders to purchase ICC coverage, a separate insurance policy to offset the cost of meeting rigorous building code standards. ICC coverage is capped at $75 annually and provides up to $30,000 in payments for eligible expenses. ICC coverage provides up to $30,000 in payments for eligible expenses, in addition to standard flood insurance building coverage. The total payment on the building claim and ICC claim cannot exceed $250,000 for residential structures or $500,000 for nonresidential structures. If a building needs to be rebuilt to meet current floodplain management requirements, an ICC claim can be submitted to offset the cost of compliance. ICC coverage provides up to $30,000 in payments for eligible expenses, in addition to standard flood insurance building coverage. Payments may be used for elevating, demolishing, relocating, or floodproofing nonresidential buildings. Elevation is the most common form of mitigation, with an average cost estimated at $33,239 to $91,732 for existing properties. FEMA has not implemented ICC coverage for two authorized conditions. Since its introduction in 1997, the Increased Cost of Compliance (ICC) program has paid over $700 million in claims for properties with flood damage, with remaining claims of $100-200 million. Despite receiving $1.4 billion in premiums, the program has incurred underwriting losses of $171 million from 2007 to 2015. The ICC aims to incentivize risk-reducing behavior through flood insurance pricing. Insurance has the potential to incentivize policyholders and communities to address flood risk by rewarding mitigation activities. However, NFIP coverage of properties with multiple flood losses is a topic of debate due to the high cost and risk involved. Repetitive loss properties account for a significant portion of NFIP claims, totaling approximately $17 billion. Repetitive loss and severe repetitive loss properties have accounted for approximately $9 billion in claims, representing about 16% of total NFIP claims. A study from January 1978 to December 2012 showed higher claims for RL structures compared to non-RL properties. An increased number of properties are expected to be at risk of future flooding, with a 2013 report predicting impacts through 2100. The study predicts a 45% growth in the 1% annual chance fluvial floodplain area by 2100, with 30% attributed to increased runoff from impermeable land surfaces due to population growth and 70% to climate change. In coastal areas, the projected increase in the SFHA is about 55% by 2100, with sea-level rise already causing nuisance flooding in some areas. The duration of minor tidal flooding has increased along U.S. coastal areas, causing disruptions to commerce and activity. The NFIP faces the risk of catastrophic losses from events like hurricanes, with over $10.6 billion paid out since 2017. Recent flood events have raised concerns about financial exposure and impacts on individuals and communities. Congress and policymakers face challenges in reducing flood risks. The distribution of responsibilities among local, state, tribal, and federal entities is a challenge for policymakers in reducing flood risks and improving resilience. Local and state governments have the primary responsibility for managing flood risk through land use guidance, building codes enforcement, and public works construction. The federal government has chosen to be involved in some aspects of flood resilience and risk reduction, such as the NFIP and disaster response. The federal government is involved in flood resilience and risk reduction through programs like NFIP. However, there is no national estimate of financial consequences of flooding or overall level of investments in flood risk reduction. This makes it difficult to compare government spending on resilience to the damage caused by flooding. The 115th Congress and policymakers are urged to evaluate federal programs for flood resilience and risk reduction. Questions include whether federal actions are cost-effective and if changes to funding and implementation could lead to long-term benefits. Policymakers may need to prioritize federal roles, redistribute funding, reorient existing programs, or establish new ones to address the nation's flood risk and resilience. CRS reports on various agricultural conservation, emergency assistance, water infrastructure financing, FEMA's mitigation program, community development block grants, public assistance grant program, National Flood Insurance Program, and sea-level rise policy considerations. The CRS reports cover topics such as sea-level rise, wastewater infrastructure, Army Corps of Engineers water projects, and federally supported water programs."
