Amendments in the Act refer to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. TITLE I focuses on modifications to welfare benefit plans, including changes to the definition of ten-or-more employer plans. Amendments to section 419A(f) include additional requirements for employer plans, such as meeting section 505(b)(1) requirements, obtaining a favorable determination from the Secretary, and not providing severance pay benefits. Clarifications are made regarding experience rating in paragraph (6)(A) of the same section. Amendments to section 419A(f) clarify that the exception for 10 or more employer plans does not apply to experience-rated plans, which determine contributions based on actual gain or loss experience. The term 'experience-rated plan' excludes guaranteed benefit plans, which are funded with insurance contracts or have determinable benefits not limited by employer contributions. The term 'single plan' refers to a written plan or series of related plans where all assets are pooled, and benefits may be limited if an employer fails to pay required premiums. The curr_chunk states that all assets of a plan must be available to pay benefits to participants regardless of the contributing employer, and the accounting method cannot limit benefits before the employer's withdrawal or benefit arrangement termination. The curr_chunk clarifies deduction limits for collectively bargained plans and standards for Section 501(C)(9) approval. It specifies that certain plans must be determined as bona fide collective bargaining agreements for deductions to apply. The curr_chunk clarifies standards for exemption under Section 501(c)(9) regarding membership and funding criteria for organizations. The curr_chunk specifies that benefits can be provided through various methods as long as the plan meets certain requirements. SEC. 104. Tax shelter provisions not to apply. Amends Section 419 regarding funded welfare benefit plans, stating that such plans meeting requirements shall not be treated as tax shelters. Effective dates apply to contributions made after enactment. SEC. 4976 imposes taxes on funded welfare benefit plans. Imposition of Tax: If an employer maintains a welfare benefit fund and there is a disqualified benefit provided or funded during any taxable year, a tax is imposed on the employer. The amount of the tax is determined based on the amount of the disqualified benefit provided or funded. The term 'disqualified benefit' refers to post-retirement medical or life insurance benefits provided to key employees or individuals in violation of discrimination rules, triggering a tax on the employer. The term 'disqualified benefit' refers to post-retirement medical or life insurance benefits provided to key employees in violation of discrimination rules, triggering a tax on the employer. Unless a plan meets section 505(b) requirements for such benefits, and any portion of a welfare benefit fund reverting to the employer is exempt. Collective bargaining plans are exceptions if benefits were subject to good faith bargaining. Nondeductible contributions are also exempt. The term 'premature termination' in subsection (a) refers to a termination event occurring within 6 years of the first contribution to a welfare benefit fund. Contributions not deductible under section 419 are not subject to certain rules, and existing reserves for post-retirement benefits are exempt from specific charges. The subsection defines a termination event as the end of a welfare benefit fund, an employer withdrawing from a fund with multiple contributors, or any other relevant action. Insolvency or other specified reasons exempt certain termination events from the rules. The subsection outlines actions that may lead to the distribution of assets from a welfare benefit fund to highly compensated employees. However, bona fide benefits available to all employees on a nondiscriminatory basis are exempt from this rule. Definitions for terms used in this section are provided, including post-retirement benefits. The term 'post-retirement benefit' refers to any distribution provided to a participant after normal retirement age, as defined in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The date for normal retirement age cannot exceed the latest defined in any qualified retirement plan of the employer. In the case of a welfare benefit fund providing life insurance benefits, excess contributions for permanent whole life insurance beyond projected costs until normal retirement age fund post-retirement benefits. The amendments made by this title shall apply to benefits provided and terminations occurring after the date of the enactment of this Act."
