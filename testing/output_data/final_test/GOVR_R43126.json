    "content": "The Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012 has sparked congressional interest in enhancing school security. Various proposals at the federal level include funding for mental health services, training for school staff, improving school climate, more counselors, and armed security personnel. Wayne LaPierre of the NRA has suggested additional security measures. LaPierre proposes armed police in every school to prevent mass shootings. Obama suggests incentives for hiring more SROs and school psychologists. A new grant program aims to increase SROs in schools. The report focuses on federal funding for SROs to prevent school shootings and its impact on students and academic settings. The report discusses the impact of School Resource Officers (SROs) on students and school safety, including research on reducing school violence. It addresses questions about the role of SROs in schools, the reasons for implementing SRO programs, and the number of SROs nationwide. Subsequent sections cover the federal promotion of SROs, their effectiveness, Administration proposals, and key issues. The practice of assigning police officers to schools on a full-time basis has become more widespread in the past 20 years, in response to school shootings and rising juvenile crime rates. School Resource Officers (SROs) are seen as a hybrid of educational, correctional, and law enforcement officers, with varying responsibilities across communities. SROs have three main responsibilities: safety expert and law enforcer, problem solver and liaison to community resources, and educator. They handle calls for service, make arrests, address unauthorized persons on school property, respond to off-campus criminal activities involving students, and act as first responders during critical incidents. SROs also address non-criminal issues like bullying, develop crime prevention efforts, and present courses on policing topics. School resource officers (SROs) have various responsibilities, including addressing crime and disorder problems in or around schools, developing crime prevention efforts for students, educating students on crime prevention and safety, and collaborating with schools and community-based organizations. The Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities Act defines a school resource officer as a law enforcement officer deployed in community policing to work with schools and community organizations. Their responsibilities include educating students on crime prevention and safety, developing community justice initiatives, and training students in conflict resolution and crime awareness. They also assist in identifying environmental changes to reduce crime and help develop school policies addressing crime. The definition of a school resource officer (SRO) includes engaging in community-oriented policing activities, collaborating with schools and community organizations, educating students on crime prevention and safety, developing community justice initiatives, and training students in conflict resolution and crime awareness. Both definitions of an SRO focus on similar responsibilities, with one emphasizing crime prevention and safety education and the other addressing school crime problems through community-oriented policing. The COPS program focuses on addressing crime and disorder problems, gangs, and drug activities in and around schools. A national survey found that school principals and law enforcement officials have different views on why schools have SROs, with violence in the school being a key reason in only about 4% of cases. Approximately 4% of schools and law enforcement agencies cited violence in schools as the reason for starting the SRO program. One-quarter of schools mentioned national media attention on school violence, while law enforcement agencies cited school disorder problems as the primary reason for assigning an SRO. The most common response for both groups was \"other,\" with reasons such as receiving a grant, community policing efforts, drug awareness programs, or improving school safety. 22% of schools reported not having an SRO due to inadequate funds, while 43% of law enforcement agencies mentioned this as a reason. The primary reasons schools did not have a School Resource Officer (SRO) were inadequate funds and lack of need, according to a survey. While 55% of schools did not see a benefit in having an SRO, 71% of law enforcement agencies believed schools would benefit from having one. This highlights a divide in opinions between educators and law enforcement officers on the benefits of SRO programs. Educators and law enforcement officers have different philosophies regarding School Resource Officer (SRO) programs. Schools prioritize education and may oppose SROs due to concerns about disrupting the learning environment and student safety. In contrast, law enforcement focuses on public safety and may see SROs as a way to deter criminal behavior in schools. The number of SROs in schools has increased in the past 20 years, but opinions on their benefits vary between educators and law enforcement. The data on School Resource Officers (SROs) is not regularly collected and reported. The most recent available data is from the 2007 survey, showing an increase in the number of full-time law enforcement officers working as SROs. The survey does not collect information on the type of schools SROs serve. The School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSCS) collects data on the distribution of SROs, with the most recent data available from the 2007-2008 school year survey. The number of police officers or sheriff's deputies working as School Resource Officers (SROs) increased between 1997 and 2003, then slightly decreased in 2007. In 2007, there were approximately 6,700 more SROs compared to 1997, but 800 fewer than the peak in 2003. The proportion of police departments and sheriff's offices assigning officers or deputies as SROs decreased between 2000 and 2007, with different trends observed in police departments and sheriff's offices. In 2007, 38% of local law enforcement agencies reported using School Resource Officers (SROs), down from 44% in 2000. However, sheriff's offices saw a slight increase in SRO usage from 48% in 2000 to 50% in 2007. Data for the 2007-2008 school year showed that high schools, city schools, and schools with 1,000+ students had a higher presence of SROs. Additionally, 37% of high schools, 45% of middle schools, and 76% of elementary schools did not have an SRO present at least once a week in 2007-2008. In 2007, 38% of local law enforcement agencies used School Resource Officers (SROs), with a slight increase in sheriff's offices. Data for the 2007-2008 school year showed higher SRO presence in high schools, city schools, and schools with 1,000+ students. 26% of schools with 1,000+ students did not have an SRO present at least once a week. Limitation of the data includes not capturing less-frequent SRO presence. Federal grants have encouraged SRO programs. The COPS in Schools (CIS) program and State Formula Grants funded the hiring of law enforcement officers in schools until FY2005 and FY2009. The CIS program provided grants for school resource officers after the Columbine shooting in 1999. Funding peaked between FY2000 and FY2002 at $180 million annually. Nearly 7,200 SROs were funded through this program. The COPS Office reports that nearly 7,200 SRO positions were funded through CIS grants, which provided funding for school resource officers after the Columbine shooting. The SDFSCA program, enacted in 1994, aims to prevent drug abuse and violence in schools. Funding for the State Formula Grant Program ended in FY2009, but law enforcement agencies can still use grants from the CHP to hire SROs. The State Formula Grant Program, which provided formula grants to states and local educational agencies, ended in FY2009. Schools with school resource officers (SROs) had higher levels of law enforcement involvement, including patrolling, conducting safety inspections, investigating crimes, making arrests, and responding to crime reports. Schools with SROs have higher levels of law enforcement involvement, including patrolling, safety inspections, investigating crimes, making arrests, and responding to crime reports. SROs also work with law enforcement to create emergency plans, conduct risk assessments, mentor students, and advise school staff. However, the effectiveness of SRO programs in reducing school violence is still uncertain due to limited studies evaluating their impact. Data on reliable outcome measures during treatment and control periods should be collected to evaluate the effectiveness of SRO programs in schools. Studies on SRO effectiveness have shown mixed results in improving safety outcomes. Studies on the effectiveness of School Resource Officer (SRO) programs have shown mixed results, with some indicating improved safety and reduced crime while others show no change. Positive results are often based on participants' perceptions rather than objective evidence, and many studies fail to isolate incidents to determine the true impact of SROs. Recent research attempts to address previous limitations but still have some constraints. Studies on the effectiveness of School Resource Officer (SRO) programs have shown mixed results. Recent research attempts to address previous limitations but still have some constraints. For example, a study by Tillyer, Fisher, and Wilcox found that students in schools with police involvement were no less likely to report being victims of violent offenses. Another study by Jennings et al. found a negative effect of SROs on reported serious violent crimes but not on reported violent crimes. The study by Na and Gottfredson analyzed the impact of adding School Resource Officers (SROs) on reported crimes in schools. Results showed that schools with SROs did not have lower numbers of serious violent, non-serious violent, or property crimes, but had higher numbers of weapon and drug offenses. Limitations included potential influence of SRO presence on reported crimes and a non-representative sample of schools. The research on the effectiveness of School Resource Officer (SRO) programs is limited and conflicting. It is unclear if SRO programs reduce school violence or deter school shootings. There are reasons to believe that SROs could help prevent school shootings by providing on-site security and fostering relationships with students for threat reporting. The effectiveness of School Resource Officer (SRO) programs is uncertain due to limited research. While SROs could aid in threat reporting and quick law enforcement response during school shootings, there is a lack of conclusive evidence on their overall impact. Promising practices for successful SRO programs include developing comprehensive school safety plans and utilizing SROs as part of a broader safety strategy. The report emphasizes that School Resource Officer (SRO) programs should have clear goals, engage in problem-solving policing, and collect data to measure effectiveness. Operational obstacles like lack of resources or turnover can be addressed through discussions between school administrators and law enforcement agencies. The report highlights the importance of establishing clear roles and responsibilities in School Resource Officer (SRO) programs through an operating protocol or memorandum of understanding (MOU) between school administrators and law enforcement agencies. Failure to define these roles can lead to problems lasting for months or even years. According to the report, selecting officers who can effectively work with students, parents, and school administrators, have an understanding of child development and psychology, and who have public speaking and teaching skills, and properly training those officers are important components of a successful SRO program. Providing training for officers to hone existing skills or develop new ones is crucial. Delays in training can be a serious problem, so it is recommended for SROs to receive training before or shortly after starting their assignment. The Administration requested $150 million for a Comprehensive School Safety Program in FY2014. Congress appropriated $75 million for a School Safety Initiative under the State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance account. The National Institute of Justice (NIJ) was tasked with developing the initiative in collaboration with key partners. $50 million is allocated for pilot programs to improve school safety. The NIJ published a school safety model. Pilot program grants can be used to test technologies and strategies, update school safety assessments, provide training, and support programs for school safety. Congress allocated $25 million for research on root causes of school violence. This funding can be used to examine new approaches and technologies for school safety improvement. The Comprehensive School Safety Initiative focuses on developing school safety assessments, training modules, surveillance cameras, and school design for mass shooting survivability. Congress allocated $151 million for hiring SROs under the COPS hiring program. Policymakers could debate funding for SRO programs considering issues like trends in school violence, sustainability of program expansion, and impact on the educational setting. An issue being debated is whether the current level of school violence justifies expanding School Resource Officer (SRO) programs nationwide. Despite heightened concerns after the Newtown shooting, data shows that schools are generally safe. Out of 78 public mass shootings from 1983 to 2012, 12 occurred in academic settings, with 8 at primary or secondary schools. Homicides of children at school are rare, with 31 school-associated violent deaths in the 2010-2011 school year. In the 2010-2011 school year, there were 31 school-associated violent deaths, including 11 homicides of children ages 5-18 at school. This number was below the average since 1992-1993. School violence extends beyond shootings to include sexual assaults, robberies, and assaults. School violence encompasses various forms of violence against children at school, including sexual assaults, robberies, assaults, and threats. The rate of serious violent crime against youth on school grounds decreased significantly between 1994 and 2010. While most schools are generally safe, some have higher levels of violence and disorder. Approximately 74% of public schools reported violent incidents during the 2009-2010 school year. During the 2009-2010 school year, 16% of schools reported serious violent incidents, totaling 52,500 incidents. Certain schools, such as middle schools and those with a higher proportion of low-income students, had higher rates of violence. The presence of School Resource Officers (SROs) has been linked to a decrease in school violence according to the National Association of School Resource Officers (NASRO). In the past two decades, America's public schools have seen a decrease in school crime, including school-associated deaths, violence, victimizations, and theft. This decline aligns with the overall decrease in juvenile arrests. The expansion of School Resource Officer programs has been part of the strategy to address safety challenges on campuses. Data suggests that the decrease in violent victimizations at school may be due to a general decline in crime against juveniles, rather than just the presence of SROs. Data from the BJS and OJJDP show significant decreases in serious violent victimizations and juvenile homicides between 1994 and 2010. There have been proposals to increase School Resource Officers (SROs) in schools to prevent school shootings, with federal funding contributing to the expansion of SRO programs. The expansion of School Resource Officer (SRO) programs has been supported by federal funding, with approximately 19,900 reported SROs in 2003, up from 12,300 in 1997. The COPS Office funded nearly 6,300 SRO positions between FY1999 and FY2002, with 45% of SRO positions being supported by a CIS grant according to a survey by NASRO. This funding likely contributed to a significant increase in SRO programs nationwide. The data suggests that local law enforcement agencies have funded a majority of School Resource Officer (SRO) positions across the country, even after grants through the CIS program expired. It could cost billions of dollars to place an SRO in each school in the United States, based on 2007 data assumptions. There were 19,088 SROs in 2007, and if each SRO is assigned to one school, an additional 79,729 SROs would be needed to cover all public schools in the country. In 2007, it was estimated that it would cost around $2.6 billion to hire the additional 79,729 School Resource Officers (SROs) needed to place one in each school in the United States. However, budget constraints and potential salary changes for entry-level law enforcement officers could increase this cost. The estimated cost of hiring additional School Resource Officers (SROs) in 2007 was $2.6 billion. If Congress expands the number of SROs, many officers may go to smaller law enforcement agencies. Data shows that smaller agencies serving populations under 25,000 have smaller budgets and fewer officers. Policymakers may need to consider providing federal funding for SROs in every school or expanding the number of SROs. Smaller law enforcement agencies with limited budgets may struggle to retain additional officers hired through grants, leading to temporary expansions of SRO programs. The requirement for law enforcement agencies receiving hiring grants to retain officers hired with federal funds for at least one year may limit grant applications. Concerns about the \"school-to-prison pipeline\" arise with the potential expansion of School Resource Officer (SRO) programs. The Senate Judiciary Subcommittee discussed the negative impact of zero tolerance policies in schools, leading to the school-to-prison pipeline. School Resource Officers (SROs) are more than just armed guards; they are sworn law enforcement officers who patrol schools and handle criminal complaints. Assigning School Resource Officers (SROs) to schools can serve as a deterrent to potential school shooters and provide quicker law enforcement response. However, it also establishes a regular law enforcement presence in schools, raising concerns about the monetary and social costs associated with expanding SRO programs. Studies show that schools with SROs have more arrests per 100 students, potentially leading to the criminalization of student misconduct. The presence of School Resource Officers (SROs) in middle and high schools may lead to more arrests per 100 students, particularly for disorderly conduct. However, when considering school-level poverty, this relationship becomes less significant. Schools with SROs have lower arrest rates for assault and possessing weapons on school grounds, suggesting a potential deterrent effect. Critics argue that more data is needed to fully assess the impact of SROs. The study analyzed the impact of adding School Resource Officers (SROs) to schools, finding that schools with SROs were more likely to report non-serious violent crimes to the police. Other crime types and overall crime reporting were not affected by the presence of SROs. The addition of School Resource Officers (SROs) in schools was found to facilitate the formal processing of minor offenses, according to Na and Gottfredson's analysis. However, students at schools with SROs were not more likely to face harsh discipline for reported offenses. The use of SROs coincided with increasing security concerns in schools, leading to more security measures and stricter discipline policies. Research on the effectiveness of security measures in reducing school violence is limited, but schools have been adopting more security measures over time. During the school years 1999-2000 and 2009-2010, there was an increase in schools adopting security measures like restricting building access, using security cameras, and requiring faculty IDs. The presence of security guards and police officers also increased. Some schools implemented \"zero tolerance\" policies after the Gun Free Schools Act, with strict disciplinary consequences for rule violations. Zero tolerance policies were implemented in schools as disciplinary procedures for rule violations to improve security. However, data shows a rise in out-of-school suspensions, disproportionately affecting minority students and students with disabilities. The U.S. Department of Education's Civil Rights Data Collection survey revealed that African American students were over 3\u00bd times more likely to be suspended or expelled than white students, and students with disabilities were more than twice as likely to receive disciplinary actions. Students with disabilities were more than twice as likely as non-disabled students to receive suspensions. African American students represented 18% of the CRDC survey but accounted for 46% of multiple suspensions. In zero tolerance districts, Hispanic and African American students made up 56% of expulsions, despite comprising 45% of the total student population. Over 70% of students arrested or referred to law enforcement were African American or Hispanic. The effectiveness of zero tolerance policies in deterring school violence remains inconclusive. The research on zero tolerance policies in schools is insufficient to evaluate their impact on student behavior or school climate. Concerns about the effectiveness of school suspensions have led to a focus on improving school climate, defined by the CDC as characterized by caring relationships, participation in activities, and shared values. Research suggests that school connectedness is crucial for a positive school climate. The National School Climate Center reports that a positive school climate improves student motivation, academic success, and reduces aggression. Social emotional learning and positive behavior management are effective strategies. SWPBIS is a program supported by the U.S. Department to enhance school climate. Behavioral Interventions and Supports (SWPBIS) is supported by the U.S. Department of Education to improve schoolwide disciplinary practices. SWPBIS is used in over 9,000 schools across 40 states and has led to reductions in student suspensions and office discipline referrals. The \"Safe Schools/Healthy Students\" (SS/HS) initiative focuses on a comprehensive approach to school violence and is funded jointly by ED, HHS, and SAMHSA. The program provides schools and communities with federal support. The initiative is a grant program that provides federal funding to schools for activities focusing on healthy childhood development and preventing violence, alcohol, and drug abuse. Grantees must partner with law enforcement, mental health, and juvenile justice agencies. The number of School Resource Officers (SROs) in schools has increased since 1997, with police departments sustaining SRO programs despite a decrease in federal grants. This expansion coincided with a decrease in reported violent victimizations of students at school. The effectiveness of School Resource Officer (SRO) programs in reducing school violence is uncertain, despite an increase in the number of SROs in schools. While there has been a decrease in reported violent incidents at schools, especially serious ones, the impact of SRO programs on this trend is unclear. Policymakers are considering expanding SRO programs to address the threat of mass shootings, but research on their effectiveness is limited and conflicting. Some schools, particularly in urban areas and with low-income students, still experience higher rates of violence. The presence of School Resource Officers (SROs) in schools may help deter potential school shooters and provide a quick response to incidents. However, research suggests that SROs could lead to more students being involved in the criminal justice system for minor offenses, resulting in negative consequences such as higher suspension rates and increased likelihood of dropping out. Policymakers are considering ways to address these concerns following the school shooting in Newtown, CT. The Newtown, CT school shooting has prompted policymakers to consider funding for School Resource Officer (SRO) programs in schools. However, the cost of placing an SRO in every school nationwide may be too expensive. Policymakers are also debating whether grants should be solely for hiring SROs or for a more comprehensive approach to school safety. Should federal grants for school safety programs prioritize a comprehensive approach or solely focus on hiring School Resource Officers (SROs)? Should there be requirements for SRO training, signed memorandums of understanding, and limitations on SRO roles to address concerns about increased arrests of children for minor offenses? If Congress adopts the Administration's proposal for the Comprehensive School Safety Program, funding distribution to schools with higher rates of violent incidents or law enforcement agencies will be debated. Requiring jurisdictions to submit a safety plan may limit funding applicants but could identify those best suited for the program. Applicants may need to show how they will sustain the program after federal funding ends, with priority given to those able to continue operations post-grant. Considerations for hiring School Resource Officers (SROs) and their training, roles, and limitations are also important. If grants are awarded for hiring School Resource Officers (SROs), should recipients be required to submit data on the effectiveness of SRO programs and their impact on the educational environment? This includes data on reported crimes and student arrests before and after an SRO is assigned to the school. The appendix provides tables with referenced data. The appendix includes tables with data on police departments and sheriff's offices using School Resource Officers (SROs), including the number of officers assigned and the average number of SROs by jurisdiction size."
