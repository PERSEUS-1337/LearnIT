    "content": "The \"Bear Protection Act\" is the short title of this legislation. Congress finds that there are 8 extant species of bear, with Asian black bear populations being decimated by illegal trade for medicines and cosmetics. Immediate action is needed to end US involvement in the black market trade to prevent devastating losses in American bear populations. Poachers are establishing smuggling networks to commercialize American bears. The United States, as a party to CITES and a leader in wildlife conservation, must take urgent action to stop the illegal trade in bear viscera. State prohibitions and inadequate Federal regulations make enforcement challenging, and individual States have the authority to regulate legal hunting quotas for black bears. The United States, as a leader in wildlife conservation, needs to address the illegal trade in bear viscera. State regulations on hunting quotas for black bears will be supported by a new Federal law banning the import, export, and interstate commerce of bear viscera. The purpose of this Act is to ensure the long-term viability of the world's 8 bear species, specifically American bears, by prohibiting the lucrative trade in bear viscera. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines \"bear viscera\" as the body fluids or internal organs of a bear, \"CITES\" as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, and other terms like \"import\" and \"transport\" as per the Lacey Act Amendments. SEC. 6. PROHIBITED ACTS. Prohibits importing, exporting, selling, or possessing bear viscera or products containing bear viscera. Offenders subject to penalties under section 7(a). SEC. 7. PENALTIES AND ENFORCEMENT. SEC. 7. PENALTIES AND ENFORCEMENT. A person engaging in prohibited conduct faces penalties under the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981. Enforcement follows guidelines outlined in the Act, with penalty amounts used for rewards and expenses. The Secretary of the Interior and the United States Trade Representative will discuss trade issues related to bear viscera with key countries and aim to collaborate on bear protection efforts. A report on progress in ending illegal bear viscera trade must be submitted to Congress within 5 years of the Act's enactment."
