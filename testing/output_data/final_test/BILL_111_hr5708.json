    "content": "The \"Urban Jobs Act of 2010\" is the short title of this Act. The purpose and findings are outlined in the following section. Congress finds that one-third of minority youth are unemployed, the labor force participation rate is lower for persons without a high school diploma, African-American and Hispanic students have a lower graduation rate, high school dropouts cost the nation billions, and only 52 percent of students in large cities graduate from high school. The national high school graduation rate is 70 percent, below the 60 percent average for urban districts. High school dropouts earn significantly less over their lifetime compared to graduates. A high school completion increase of 1 percent for men aged 20 to 60 could save $1.4 billion annually in crime costs. A 10 percent rise in male high school graduation rate could reduce arrest rates for various crimes. The National Urban League, a civil rights organization founded in 1910, aims to empower economically underserved urban communities through programs and advocacy. With over 100 local affiliates in 36 states and DC, they impact the lives of over 2 million people through education, job training, housing, and business development initiatives. The National Urban League and its local affiliates have a history of success in implementing programs to support at-risk young adults by providing job skills training, community service opportunities, and employment. The purpose of this Act is to provide resources to reduce the disproportionate incarceration of minority youth and prepare eligible young adults for entry into the workforce through job training, education, and support services. The Urban Jobs Program is being amended under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 to provide resources for job skills training and support services to reduce incarceration rates of minority youth and prepare them for the workforce. The Secretary of Labor may grant funds to the National Urban League for the Urban Jobs Program, which aims to provide services for eligible young adults through local affiliates. Services include case management and educational offerings for skill development. The Urban Jobs Program funded by the Secretary of Labor offers services for eligible young adults through the National Urban League and its local affiliates. These services include assessment, remediation, educational enrichment, GED preparation, post-secondary education, job readiness activities, support services like health and nutrition referral, housing assistance, and transportation. A report is required by May 1 each fiscal year for the funds allocated. The Secretary must report annually to Congress on the progress and effectiveness of the Urban Jobs Program in improving GED attainment and job placement. The program is exempt from evaluations required under section 172. The Secretary will establish the National Jobs Council Advisory Committee comprised of 11 members from the private sector to advise on program design, strategic priorities, and guidelines. The National Jobs Council Advisory Committee will consist of 11 members from the private sector, including representatives from employers in high-growth industries, the National Urban League Workforce Development staff, and the Department of Labor. It is recommended that local National Urban League affiliates establish a local jobs council advisory committee with representatives from at least 5 employers in high-growth industries to provide support. Funding for the program is authorized with increasing amounts from $20 million in 2011 to $60 million in 2015. Not more than 2% of funds can be used for expenses. Eligible young adults are defined as individuals aged 18 to 24. The Urban Jobs Program defines \"adults\" as individuals aged 18 to 24 not in school or involved in the criminal justice system. The term \"unsubsidized job\" refers to employment without public funding. Amendments were made to the table of contents in the Act. The Urban Jobs Program defines \"adults\" as individuals aged 18 to 24 not in school or involved in the criminal justice system.
