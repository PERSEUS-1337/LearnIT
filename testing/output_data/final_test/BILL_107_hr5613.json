    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Children's Mental Health Screening and Prevention Act of 2002\". The Congress acknowledges advances in scientific research showing that mental disorders in children can persist into adulthood and that early identification and treatment greatly improve prognosis. Surgeon General's Report in January 2001 highlighted the prevalence of mental disorders in children and adolescents in the United States. 1 in 10 children and adolescents in the US have mental illness, but only 1 in 5 receive necessary treatment. The World Health Organization predicts a 50% increase in youth neuropsychiatric disorders by 2020, making it a top cause of disability and mortality. Studies show that a high percentage of youths in the juvenile justice system have emotional disturbances and co-occurring disabilities. Research shows that a significant percentage of youths who die by suicide have depression or another mental or substance abuse disorder. Recognizing and treating these conditions is crucial for suicide prevention efforts, as they are the greatest risk factors for suicidal behavior. Failure to address mental disabilities in children and youth can lead to serious consequences, including school failure, involvement with the justice system, and an increase in teen suicides or suicide attempts. In 2000, suicide was the 3rd leading cause of death among youth aged 15 to 24. In 1999, almost 3,000,000 youth were at risk for suicide, with only 36 percent receiving mental health treatment. In 2001, 19 percent of high school students had seriously considered suicide, almost 15 percent had made a specific plan, almost 9 percent had attempted suicide, and almost 3 percent required medical attention for a suicide attempt. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that each year in the United States, almost as many adolescents and young adults commit suicide as die from all natural causes combined. The Surgeon General issued a goal in January 2001 to improve the assessment of mental health needs in children by encouraging early identification in various systems. Federal efforts should support evidence-based preventive-screening methods to detect mental illness and suicidal tendencies in school-age youth. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. MENTAL HEALTH SCREENING DEMONSTRATION PROJECT.\" is a section related to a mental health screening project mentioned in the previous paragraphs about the importance of early identification of mental health needs in children to prevent suicide. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Education, and the Attorney General will grant funds to 1 facility in each of the 10 designated demonstration areas to implement preventive-screening methods for mental illness and suicidal tendencies in school-age youth. The Secretaries will designate these areas within 6 months of the Act's enactment, ensuring inclusion of specific types of areas. The grant program aims to fund facilities in designated areas with specific criteria such as urban health professional shortage areas, mental health professional shortages, non-metropolitan counties, metropolitan counties, and Indian reservations. Grants are for a 3-year period and require a detailed application process. Facilities seeking grants must submit an application demonstrating formation of a project committee, specifying a preventive-screening method, showing ability to obtain necessary resources, and having existing or new staff or partnerships with licensed professionals. The facility must have licensed mental health professionals with a master's degree to conduct evidence-based screening. They need to identify the location for screening, obtain approval, select the sample of youth, and have a method for obtaining consent. The facility must identify licensed individuals or entities within 10 and 40 miles for mental health evaluation and treatment referrals for participating youth. The Secretaries may require information collection for grant applicants, including demographics of youth participating in the project and outcomes of evidence-based preventive-screening methods. The Secretaries may require information collection for grant applicants, including demographics of youth participating in the project and outcomes of evidence-based preventive-screening methods such as screening refusals, positive outcomes for mental illnesses and suicidal ideation, and referrals for further evaluation or treatment. Information on treatment based on referrals includes the number of referred youth who accepted a referral but did not show up for the first evaluation or treatment appointment, the number of referred youth who attended 1 appointment, and the number of referred youth who attended 2 to 5 appointments. The Secretaries require information on suicide attempts, rates, and access to mental health programs for school-age youth in the 3 years before the project. Additional information may be requested. Applicants must agree to report collected information to the Secretaries. Information collected under subsection (e) must be reported at specific intervals, with different deadlines for different types of information. Any data collected under a specific paragraph must be reported within a set timeframe. The Secretaries cannot discriminate against applicants who find it impractical to collect information on preceding years when making grants. The Secretaries cannot discriminate against applicants who find it impractical to collect information under subsection (e)(5). An advisory panel must be established within 14 months after the first grant is made under subsection (a) to assist in reviewing and evaluating collected information and to submit recommendations on evidence-based preventive-screening methods for detecting mental illness and suicidal tendencies in school-age youth. The advisory panel, with up to 20 members, represents various organizations in mental health care, including for-profit and nonprofit facilities, professionals, consumers, school-based professionals, school health care, and administrators. The advisory panel consists of up to 20 members from organizations in mental health care, including school boards, juvenile justice professionals, foster care professionals, child welfare organizations, accredited psychiatric programs, and other entities deemed appropriate by the Secretaries. A report is due within 6 months after the end of the 3-year period. The advisory panel, consisting of up to 20 members from mental health care organizations, including school boards and juvenile justice professionals, will submit a report to Congress within 6 months after the 3-year grant period. The report will include evaluations and recommendations based on collected information. The term \"Directors\" refers to key officials from various health and mental health agencies. \"Elementary school\" and \"secondary school\" are defined as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. An \"evidence-based preventive-screening method\" is a validated approach for early intervention. The term \"school-age youth\" refers to individuals aged 6 to 18 or enrolled in elementary or secondary school. \"Secretaries\" include the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Education, and the Attorney General. $3,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2004 through 2006 for implementing evidence-based preventive-screening methods. Funding is authorized for fiscal years 2004 through 2006 and beyond, to be available until expended."
