    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 65850.7 is added to the Government Code, stating that the implementation of consistent statewide standards for electric vehicle charging stations is a matter of statewide concern. The Legislature intends to prevent local agencies from creating unreasonable barriers to installation and promote the use of electric vehicle charging stations. The Legislature aims to encourage the installation of electric vehicle charging stations by minimizing permitting obstacles and costs for local agencies, while ensuring building officials can address higher priority life-safety situations. A city, county, or city and county must approve applications for electric vehicle charging stations through a building permit or similar permit, focusing on health and safety requirements. If there is evidence of potential adverse impact, a use permit may be required. A city, county, or city and county must approve applications for electric vehicle charging stations through a building permit or similar permit, focusing on health and safety requirements. The decision can be appealed to the planning commission. Conditions imposed should mitigate adverse impacts at the lowest cost possible. An electric vehicle charging station must adhere to health and safety standards set by state and local authorities, as well as safety and performance standards established by various organizations and testing laboratories. Every city, county, or city and county with a population over 200,000 residents must adopt an ordinance by September 30, 2016, for an expedited permitting process for electric vehicle charging stations. Those with less than 200,000 residents have until September 30, 2017. The process includes creating a checklist of requirements for expedited review of applications. Upon confirmation of a complete application by the city, county, or city and county, permits will be issued in accordance with the ordinance. Prioritization of applications for expedited permits may be established. Incomplete applications will receive a correction notice outlining deficiencies and required information. Applications to a city, county, or city and county with an electric utility must comply with the utility's interconnection policies before approval. The city, county, or city and county must publish permitting documentation online for electronic submission and allow electronic signatures. They can refer to the \"Plug-In Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Permitting Checklist\" for guidance but may modify it based on local conditions. The city, county, or city and county must allow electronic submission of permitting documentation and electronic signatures, unless unable to do so due to specific conditions. A city, county, or city and county cannot require approval from an association for an electric vehicle charging station permit. Definitions for terms like \"feasible method\" and \"electronic submittal\" are provided. The curr_chunk defines \"electric vehicle charging station\" and \"specific, adverse impact\" in compliance with California Electrical Code. No reimbursement required by this act as local agencies or school districts can levy charges to cover mandated services."
