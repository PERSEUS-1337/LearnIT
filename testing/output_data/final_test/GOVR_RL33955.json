    "content": "This CRS report summarizes three studies submitted to Congress in 2005 on potential future Navy ship force structures. Two studies were conducted by the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) and the Office of Force Transformation (OFT) in response to a congressional requirement. The CNA and OFT studies on Navy ship force structures were submitted to congressional defense committees in 2005. OFT was disestablished in 2006, and its activities were transferred. The CNA report recommended a Navy force structure range of 256 to 380 ships, compared to the Navy's 375-ship fleet proposal. The OFT report used eight new ship designs different from the Navy's. The OFT report presents eight new ship designs for Congress, including four large surface ships built from a common hull design. One design is an aircraft carrier with a reduced air wing of 30 Joint Strike Fighters, 6 MV-22 Osprey aircraft, and 15 UAVs. This carrier would also accommodate unmanned underwater and surface vehicles. The curr_chunk describes various support spaces on different types of ships, including a missile-and-rocket ship with vertical launch system, an amphibious assault ship with an air wing and Marine Corps equipment, and a \"mother ship\" for small combatants. These spaces can also support unmanned vehicles and mission modules for surface combatants. The curr_chunk describes new ship designs in the OFT architecture, including a 13,500-ton aircraft carrier with a notional air wing, a 1,000-ton surface combatant with modular mission packages, and a 100-ton surface combatant. These ships would self-deploy to the theater and be supported by larger ships. The curr_chunk discusses the addition of non-nuclear-powered submarines with air-independent propulsion systems to the Navy's fleet, which would be transported to the theater of operations by transport ships. These submarines would serve as lower-cost supplements to the Navy's nuclear-powered submarines. Additionally, the chunk mentions the construction of 1,000- and 100-ton surface combatants as relatively inexpensive sea frames, similar to the Littoral Combat Ship. The OFT report proposes alternative force structures for the Navy's fleet, including a larger number of ships, carrier-based aircraft, and unmanned systems. These alternatives, labeled A, B, and C, would be cost-equivalent to the Navy's 375-ship proposal and organized into carrier strike groups, expeditionary strike groups, and surface strike groups. The report does not include SSNs, SSGNs, and ballistic missile submarines in the totals. The table excludes SSNs, SSGNs, and SSBNs operating independently of the proposed fleet structures. It also does not include certain combat logistics and fleet support ships. The differences between Alternatives A, B, and C lie in the types and sizes of surface combatants and aircraft carriers used. The CSBA report suggests similar ship designs to the Navy's plans but introduces some new designs and proposed different ship formations. The CSBA report proposes new ship designs and formations different from the Navy's plans. Specific recommendations include retiring conventional carriers, converting the Enterprise into an AFSB, and replacing Nimitz class carriers. The CSBA report recommends retiring conventional carriers, converting the Enterprise into an AFSB, and replacing Nimitz class carriers with CVN-21-class carriers procured every five years. Additionally, it suggests redesignating the LHA(R) as a medium-sized carrier, maintaining Virginia-class SSN procurement at one per year, and designing a new \"undersea superiority system\" with a lower procurement cost. Options are also being studied to extend the service lives of Seawolf SSNs and final Los Angeles-class SSNs to address projected force level drops in the 2020s. The SSBN force is proposed to be reduced from 14 ships to 12 ships. Reduce SSBN force from 14 ships to 12 ships and convert 2 SSBNs into SSGNs, totaling 6 SSGNs. Study reducing SSBN force to 10 ships, allowing for 2 more to be converted into SSGNs, totaling 8 SSGNs. Procure a single DDG-1000 in FY2007 as the first of 3 surface combatant technology demonstrators. Start a design competition for a next-generation, modular surface combatant with capabilities equal to or greater than DDG-1000/CG(X) but with lower procurement cost. Build 2 additional surface combatant technology demonstrators to compete against DDG-1000 design. Use results to inform design of new surface combatant, SCX, with procurement cost one-third to one-half of DDG-1000. Begin procuring SCX in FY2015 as replacement. Begin procuring a new design in FY2015 as a replacement for the DDG-1000/CG(X) program. Consider modifying the LPD-17 design into a low-cost naval surface fire support ship carrying the Advanced Gun System (AGS). Procure two additional DDG-51s to support the surface combatant industrial base. Procure 84 LCSs per year, divided into 42 divisions with Lockheed and General Dynamics designs. Ensure compatibility between LCS mission packages and Coast Guard's Deepwater cutters. Include Deepwater cutters in the total fleet battle network count. The Navy plans to build stealth surface combatant technology demonstrators for operations in contested waters, increase LPD-17 procurement rate to two ships per year, retire existing LSD-41/49 class ships, and form eight distributed expeditionary strike bases. They also aim to retain MPF squadrons and reconfigure two for irregular warfare. The Navy plans to reconfigure two MPF squadrons for irregular warfare and use the third squadron as a swing asset for amphibious landing forces. They aim to develop high-speed surface connectors, procure a new attack cargo ship, and replace existing hospital ships with new ones based on the LPD-17 design. Additionally, they plan to initiate a joint experimental program for future sea-basing platforms and technologies. The CSBA report raises questions about the Navy's sea-basing concept for expeditionary operations ashore. The report questions the maturity of sea basing technologies and advises against making major decisions like canceling LPD-17 procurement or removing well decks from amphibious assault platforms. Further exploration and experimentation with sea basing concepts and platforms are recommended before any significant moves are made. The CNA report discusses crew rotation's impact on force-level requirements for forward deployments. The OFT report, led by Admiral Cebrowski, emphasizes network-centric warfare and distributed force architectures. The CSBA report is also considered in the analysis. The CSBA report, led by Robert Work, promotes network-centric warfare and distributed force architectures. CSBA is an independent research institute focused on defense planning and investment strategies for the 21st century. Dr. Andrew F. Krepinevich, Jr., CSBA's Executive Director, is known for his work in defense transformation. The CNA report, on the other hand, analyzes traditional DOD force-planning considerations and campaign modeling. The CNA report analyzes traditional DOD force-planning considerations and campaign modeling, while the OFT report questions the viability of naval force building logic and proposes new force-design principles to address future challenges and opportunities. The CSBA report analyzes the structure of the U.S. Navy in response to technological opportunities and strategic challenges. It suggests a new Navy force structure for the \"Joint Expeditionary Era\" based on historical analysis. The CNA report focuses on future missions and force requirements by analyzing historical data from the U.S. Navy and other navies to design a cost-effective fleet. It mentions cost estimates for homeporting attack submarines at Guam but does not emphasize ship-procurement funding levels. In contrast, the OFT report highlights the importance of ship-procurement funding levels in force planning and discusses the Navy's budget situation, questioning its ability to afford a 375-ship proposal. The report analyzes Navy ship-procurement funding for a 375-ship proposal, estimating a potential 40% shortfall. This could result in a fleet of 270 to 315 ships, including inexpensive LCSs. Alternative scenarios could range from 402 to 711 ships, excluding certain types like SSNs. Funding for future ship procurement is a key concern. The CSBA report analyzes Navy ship-procurement funding levels, estimating an average of $10 billion per year for future ship acquisitions. The proposed fleet sizes range from 256 to 380 ships, with variations in composition compared to the Navy's planned fleet. The OFT-recommended fleet would have a larger total number of ships and a higher proportion of small combatants. The OFT-recommended fleet would have a larger total number of ships with a higher proportion of small combatants, accounting for about 75-79% in Alternative A and B, and 72% in Alternative C. This architecture is similar to a previous proposal by the Naval Surface Warfare Center, utilizing a common hull design for various missions. The CSBA proposal includes scout fighters, medium-sized aircraft carriers, afloat forward staging base, SCXs in the cruiser-destroyer force, additional LPD-17s in the amphibious fleet, and changes in the maritime prepositioning force composition compared to other fleet proposals. The CNA report recommends a maritime force composition similar to the Navy's plans, with some differences in ship types and formations. The OFT report proposes building ships that are substantially different from the Navy's plans and combines them into formations that may be viewed as different in composition. The OFT-recommended force proposes alternative fleet platform architecture with ships different from the Navy's plans, including a 57,000-ton aircraft carrier. This force is less dramatic than the CSBA-recommended force, which also suggests alternative fleet platform architecture. The CNA report aligns with the Navy's plans without proposing new ship designs. The 13,500-ton aircraft carrier in the OFT report is larger than Thailand's carrier and smaller than Spain's carrier, featuring a high-speed SES/catamaran hull design with a potentially larger flight deck. The OFT report discusses various naval vessels, including surface combatants, AIP submarines, afloat forward staging bases (AFSBs), and medium-sized carriers like the CVE. These vessels are compared to existing ships and concepts, such as the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) and the Streetfighter concept. The AFSB proposal in the CSBA report is similar to other recent proposals, but with variations in the type of ships used as the basis. The CVE is described as a medium-sized carrier with a full load displacement of around 40,000 tons. The CVE, a medium-sized carrier with a full load displacement of around 40,000 tons, would be based on the LHA(R) amphibious ship design, incorporating more survivability features than a 57,000-ton carrier. The CNA report recommends a force range similar in capability to the Navy's planned architecture, while the OFT architecture emphasizes fleet survivability. The OFT report emphasizes fleet survivability over individual-ship survivability, advocating for a complex task for the enemy to detect, track, and target large numbers of ships. It also highlights the importance of a fleet's capability to adapt to strategic demands and funding levels. Readers may find the OFT-recommended architecture more capable than the Navy's planned architecture based on these propositions. The OFT report suggests that alternative fleet formations of small, fast, and flexible craft may be more effective than the programmed fleet for non-traditional warfare. These alternative fleets can complicate enemy surveillance and reduce their options, making it difficult for them to anticipate and defeat the fleet. The OFT report suggests that alternative fleet formations of small, fast, and flexible craft may be more effective than the programmed fleet for non-traditional warfare. These fleets provide a stronger intelligence base and more platforms for strikes and interceptions, even if individually less capable. Fleet survivability, not individual ship survivability, is crucial in achieving success. The need for CTOL aircraft on big-deck CVNs is emphasized, but alternatives like VSTOL aircraft with airborne tanking can meet deep strike and loiter demands. Advances in EMALS and modifications to the JSF can reduce range-payload penalties. Unmanned aircraft are gaining capabilities for longer loiter times and better sensors. The CSBA report proposes a cost-effective architecture with new ship designs for enhanced capabilities. The Navy is considering new ship designs with advanced technologies to achieve greater capabilities at a reduced cost compared to current designs like the Virginia-class SSN and DDG-1000 destroyer. The use of newer technologies could make these new designs more capable than previous ones, especially in the case of a new SSN design. However, achieving equal capability with more expensive current designs may be more challenging for a new large surface combatant design. The CSBA report suggests that developing a new large surface combatant design with advanced technologies could be challenging due to limited new technologies since the DDG-1000 design. The report recommends reducing near-term procurement of destroyers and MPF(F) ships, increasing amphibious ships procurement, and changing the investment mix for aircraft carriers to better fit future strategic demands. CSBA's recommended investment changes respond to future strategic demands, potentially offering a better optimized architecture than the Navy's planned one. Implementation risks include developing new ship types and ensuring adequate funding. The OFT report lacks a detailed transition plan for fleet architecture changes. The plan for transitioning to the proposed fleet architecture involves replacing existing ship designs with new ones recommended by OFT. Implementation risks include developing new ship types such as large ships, aircraft carriers, submarines, and surface combatants, each requiring new technologies. The CSBA report provides a detailed transition roadmap for shifting to a recommended fleet structure, including developing reduced-cost SSN and SCX surface combatant designs equal in capability to current designs. Implementation risks include new naval formations and doctrines. The OFT report recommends a fleet structure with similar numbers of ships as the Navy's current plans, aiming to reduce unit shipbuilding costs by shifting towards less complex designs. This shift would increase shipbuilding options by allowing a broader array of shipyards to build the ships, making modernization easier and less expensive. The OFT report proposes reducing unit shipbuilding costs by shifting to less complex designs, allowing more shipyards to build ships and making modernization easier and cheaper. This poses a potential challenge to the six shipyards that have built the Navy's major warships. Smaller shipyards could compete to build smaller ships, broadening the capabilities available to the Navy and opening up overseas markets. The report suggests reducing shipbuilding costs by using less complex designs and allowing more shipyards to build ships, which could lead to an expansion of the U.S. shipbuilding industry. It also highlights the risks of shielding the industry from global competition, which could result in high costs and limited innovation. The report raises concerns about the defense industrial base and emphasizes the importance of rationalizing it for the Navy's future. The report emphasizes the need to rationalize the defense industrial base for the Navy's maritime competition strategy. It highlights excess capacities at Tier I yards, leading to high costs of warships due to cabotage laws and fluctuating acquisition policies. The Department of the Navy's optimistic ship production projections exacerbate the issue of excess capacities. The report recommends minimizing production costs for warships by consolidating production in single shipyards, pursuing learning curve efficiencies, and using multiyear procurement. It also suggests maintaining production of aircraft carriers at NGNN, consolidating production of large surface combatants and amphibious ships at NG/Ingalls, and consolidating submarine building at GD/EB. The report recommends consolidating submarine production at GD/EB or creating a new single submarine production company. This decision is guided by factors such as building sequence, capacity, cost savings, and past experience in building submarines. Yard consolidation would maintain two shipyards capable of designing and building nuclear-powered combatants. The report suggests consolidating construction of aircraft carriers, surface combatants, and submarines in one yard for each type to increase efficiency and reduce risks. However, it notes that competition can be maintained for auxiliaries and smaller combatants by building them at a variety of Tier I and Tier II yards. Building multiple classes of a single ship type and maintaining competition between yards can help keep costs down. The DoN can shift production to different companies/classes to enforce cost targets. Retaining excess shipbuilding capacity may require paying an \"insurance premium.\" The US shipbuilding infrastructure should be rationalized for future austere budgets, retaining excess capacity as an \"insurance premium\" until production rates are clear for new designs like the undersea superiority system and SCX. Congress could authorize additional Aegis destroyers to keep shipyards active until the transition plan is finalized."
