    "title": "AB 939",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 10722.4 of the Water Code is amended to categorize basins into high, medium, low, or very low priority levels. The department will establish the initial priority for each basin by January 31, 2015, and reassess it whenever Bulletin 118 boundaries are updated. Any changes in basin priorities under Section 10933 require local agencies to establish a groundwater sustainability agency within two years and adopt a sustainability plan within five years. The Water Code categorizes basins as high, medium, low, or very low priority levels. The department establishes basin priorities as high, medium, low, or very low. If priorities change after January 31, 2015, agencies have two years to establish a groundwater sustainability agency or meet requirements. A groundwater sustainability agency must meet requirements within five years of reprioritization, or by January 31, 2022 if reprioritization occurs before January 31, 2017. A groundwater sustainability agency can impose fees to fund a groundwater sustainability program, including permit fees and fees on groundwater extraction. Before imposing or increasing a fee, the agency must hold a public meeting. The groundwater sustainability agency must provide notice of meetings with an explanation of matters to be discussed, make data available to the public 20 days before the meeting, and impose or increase fees through an ordinance or resolution. Groundwater sustainability agencies can collect fees like municipal taxes by adopting a resolution. The resolution must be submitted by August 1 each year with a list of parcels and amounts to be collected. This power is in addition to any other powers the agency may have under different laws. Section 1.5 of the bill includes amendments to the Water Code, contingent on the enactment of Senate Bill 13 before this bill, and both bills amending Section 10722.4 of the Water Code by January 1, 2016."
