    "content": "The \"FHA Bailout Protection Act of 2011\" is also known as the FHA Bailout Protection Act. It aims to provide taxpayer protection at the FHA. The FHA Bailout Protection Act of 2011, also known as the FHA Bailout Protection Act, aims to protect taxpayers by ensuring the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund attains and maintains the required capital ratio within 2 years of enactment. This includes the authority to increase insurance premiums. The FHA Bailout Protection Act of 2011 grants the Secretary authority to increase insurance premiums, establish stricter underwriting standards, and raise the required cash amount for mortgages under the Fund. If the Fund fails to achieve a 2 percent capital ratio, the Secretary must take necessary actions to prevent a bailout. The FHA Bailout Protection Act of 2011 grants the Secretary authority to increase insurance premiums and establish stricter underwriting standards for mortgages under the Fund. If the Fund fails to achieve a 2 percent capital ratio, the Secretary must take necessary actions to prevent a bailout, including increasing premiums and charging additional fees until the capital ratio is met. The FHA Bailout Protection Act of 2011 allows the Secretary to raise insurance premiums and impose stricter standards for mortgages in the Fund. If the Fund's capital ratio falls below 2 percent, the Secretary can increase premiums and charge extra fees to avoid a bailout. Additionally, mortgagees approved by the Secretary may be indemnified under certain circumstances. If a mortgage insured by a mortgagee approved by the Secretary under the direct endorsement program is not originated or underwritten correctly, and the Secretary pays an insurance claim, the mortgagee must indemnify the Secretary for the loss. If fraud or misrepresentation is involved, the mortgagee must also indemnify the Secretary. The Secretary requires mortgagees approved under the direct endorsement program to indemnify for losses due to incorrectly originated or underwritten loans, fraud, or misrepresentation. Regulations will be issued for this indemnification process, including public reporting on non-compliant loans. The Secretary mandates indemnification for early term delinquencies on mortgages not in compliance with regulations, ensuring financial impact on the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund is addressed. The program established by the Secretary reviews early term delinquencies on mortgages, requires indemnification for non-compliant delinquencies, and publicly reports the results and financial impact on the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund. The term 'early term delinquency' refers to loans that become delinquent or default within 24 months of origination. SEC. 3. ANNUAL ACTUARIAL STUDY AND QUARTERLY REPORTS ON MUTUAL MORTGAGE INSURANCE FUND. Section 202(a)(4) of the National Housing Act is amended to require quarterly reports instead of annual ones, including calculations of claims rates for past and future quarters. SEC. 4. PROHIBITION ON TAXPAYER BAILOUT OF FHA. The amendment prohibits the Secretary of the Treasury from borrowing for the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund under certain conditions."
