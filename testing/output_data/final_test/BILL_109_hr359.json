    "content": "The \"Liquefied Natural Gas Act of 2005\" is cited as the short title. Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act is amended regarding the exportation or importation of natural gas. The \"Liquefied Natural Gas Act of 2005\" requires authorization from the Secretary of Energy for the export or import of natural gas. The Secretary may grant the application with modifications and conditions deemed necessary. The \"Liquefied Natural Gas Act of 2005\" mandates that imported natural gas under a free trade agreement be treated as a 'first sale' and prohibits discriminatory treatment based on national origin. The approval process for importation or exportation of natural gas to nations with free trade agreements is outlined. The \"Liquefied Natural Gas Act of 2005\" requires that natural gas trade under free trade agreements be treated equally, with applications for importation or exportation being approved promptly. Authorization from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is necessary for constructing or operating liquefied natural gas import terminals to ensure consistency with the public interest. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission may issue orders for liquefied natural gas import terminals with necessary modifications and conditions. These orders cannot require offering services to others, regulate rates, or mandate filing schedules with the Commission. States or local governments cannot impose additional permits or authorizations for siting, except as provided by Federal law. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can issue orders for liquefied natural gas import terminals, ensuring consistency with any authorization provided by the Commission. Federal or State agencies cannot prohibit or unreasonably delay the siting, construction, or operation of these terminals. This subsection does not affect the authority to authorize natural gas import/export or facilities other than liquefied natural gas import. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must approve or deny applications for liquefied natural gas import terminals within 1 year of completion. A schedule for all necessary administrative proceedings must be established to ensure timely progress towards terminal operation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must establish a schedule for administrative proceedings related to natural gas pipelines and liquefied natural gas facilities. Failure to meet the schedule will result in automatic approval for siting, construction, and operation of the terminal. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must compile a single administrative record for liquefied natural gas import terminal proceedings. Any federal administrative appeal or review must use this record exclusively. Judicial review is limited, except for Supreme Court review. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over civil actions for review of decisions made by Federal administrative agencies regarding liquefied natural gas import terminals. The action must be filed within 60 days, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must submit the administrative record to the court. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is the lead agency for liquefied natural gas import terminals under the National Environmental Policy Act. A liquefied natural gas import terminal includes onshore facilities for receiving, storing, and processing LNG from foreign countries. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission oversees liquefied natural gas import terminals, which include onshore facilities for receiving LNG from foreign countries, excluding tankers used for delivery."
