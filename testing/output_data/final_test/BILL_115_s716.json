The \"Dollar-for-Dollar Deficit Reduction Act\" amends Title 31 to include a new section on debt limit control, allowing the Secretary of the Treasury to issue a warning to Congress in case of a near breach of the public debt limit. This warning would outline when extraordinary measures may be needed to fund the government. The Secretary of the Treasury can take action in the event of a debt limit breach to keep the government functioning. A \"near breach\" is when the debt limit will be reached within 60 days despite extraordinary measures. The President must submit a request for a debt limit increase along with proposed legislation. The proposed legislation accompanying a debt limit increase must include spending reductions over the current and following 10 years, excluding net interest savings. The savings calculation should align with the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL REQUIREMENT TO RESTRAIN SPENDING WHILE RAISING THE DEBT LIMIT.
