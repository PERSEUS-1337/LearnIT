This new title includes the role of the Privacy Advocate General. The \"Privacy Advocate General Act of 2013\" establishes an independent office in the Executive branch known as the Office of the Privacy Advocate General. The Privacy Advocate General is appointed jointly by the Chief Justice of the United States and the most senior associate justice of the Supreme Court. They serve a 7-year term and have specific duties outlined in the Act. The Privacy Advocate General serves as opposing counsel for government applications and reviews under the Act, arguing against orders and certifications before the court. The Privacy Advocate General can challenge the constitutionality of laws and request court decisions to be made public. They have the authority to appeal court decisions and appoint staff as needed. The Privacy Advocate General and their staff must have appropriate security clearances to carry out their duties. Amendments to the table of contents in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 are made to accommodate this. Sec. 901 establishes the Privacy Advocate General. Amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 include changes to the appeals process. Amendment to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act allows judges to temporarily authorize electronic surveillance in cases where an application is denied and the government plans to appeal, under specific conditions. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act allows for the destruction of information gathered from electronic surveillance if the government's application is denied on appeal. Additionally, no information acquired from such surveillance can be used in any legal proceedings without the consent of the individual involved. In cases where a judge denies an application for physical search under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the Government plans to appeal, the judge can temporarily allow the search if there is a reasonable argument for it and exceptional circumstances require immediate action. If the search is denied on appeal, any information gathered must be destroyed and cannot be used in any legal proceedings. In any legal proceeding, information acquired from a physical search cannot be used or disclosed without the person's consent. Additionally, in cases where a judge denies a search application under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the Government plans to appeal, the judge may temporarily authorize the search on an emergency basis if there are exceptional circumstances. In cases of denied search applications under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a judge may authorize the use of a pen register or trap and trace device on an emergency basis pending appeal if certain conditions are met. If the application is denied on appeal, any information gathered must be destroyed and cannot be used. The use of a pen register or trap and trace device in cases of denied search applications under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act allows for temporary authorization on an emergency basis pending appeal. If the application is ultimately denied, any information obtained must be destroyed and cannot be used in any legal proceedings without the individual's consent."
