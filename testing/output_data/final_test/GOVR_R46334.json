    "content": "The global pandemic of COVID-19 is impacting communities worldwide and in the United States, with efforts to slow transmission and support the healthcare system. The CARES Act, enacted on March 27, 2020, provides health provisions and economic stimulus measures to address the pandemic. The Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020 and the Families First Coronavirus Response Act provide funding and support for health care services during the COVID-19 pandemic. The first act allocates $7.8 billion to various departments and waives telehealth restrictions, while the second act covers COVID-19 testing and services for federal programs, private insurance plans, and the uninsured. The CARES Act addresses medical supply shortages caused by the COVID-19 pandemic by expanding reporting requirements for firms experiencing interruptions in drug and device manufacturing. It includes provisions to address shortages of medical countermeasures (MCMs) such as vaccines, antivirals, diagnostic tests, and personal protective equipment (PPE). The CARES Act addresses medical supply shortages by requiring the Strategic National Stockpile to contain PPE and extending liability protections for respiratory protective devices. It also mandates a study on U.S. dependence on critical drugs and medical devices. Vaccine access for COVID-19 will be provided without cost-sharing to patients and beneficiaries of federal health programs and most private health insurance enrollees. The CARES Act includes provisions to support the medical workforce, such as extending services for underserved populations and providing liability protection for health professionals volunteering during the emergency period. It also reauthorizes health workforce programs and addresses the marketing of over-the-counter drugs. The CARES Act establishes a new process for marketing certain over-the-counter drugs, including hand sanitizer and sunscreen. It replaces the current OTC drug monograph rulemaking process with an administrative order process and provides an expedited process for removing OTC drugs that pose a public health hazard. The Act also offers marketing exclusivity incentives and creates a user fee program to fund FDA's OTC monograph drug activities. The report describes provisions related to medical countermeasures, product regulation by the FDA, the strategic national stockpile, health workforce including telehealth programs, rural health care system, and workforce provisions for existing HHS programs. Medicare, Medicaid, and private health insurance plans are also addressed for telehealth services. The report discusses provisions for telehealth services and specified services related to COVID-19 testing, diagnosis, or treatment. It also mentions a newly established FDA authority for OTC drug review and excludes education or labor provisions in Subtitle B or C in Part IV of Title III. Additionally, it does not cover emergency supplemental appropriations for the COVID-19 response in Division B of the act. The report discusses deadlines, effective dates, and reporting requirements for provisions in the CARES Act. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the act will increase federal deficits by $1.8 trillion over the 2020-2030 period, with breakdowns in mandatory outlays, revenues, and discretionary outlays. Health programs in Title III are not covered in the report. JCT estimates Section 3702 expands eligible products. JCT estimates that Section 3702 expands eligible products for tax-advantaged distributions from HSAs, FSAs, and similar savings arrangements, reducing revenues by $9 billion over 2020-2030. CBO also projects increased Medicare spending from 2020-2030 due to payment changes in CARES Sections 3701-3715, including higher reimbursements for services. Some provisions, like covering COVID-19 vaccine costs, cannot be estimated yet. The report reflects the CARES Act at enactment and does not track its implementation or funding. It includes provisions related to the Public Health Emergency declaration under Section 319 of the Public Health Service Act, allowing expedited actions during public health emergencies. The declaration for COVID-19 was made on January 31, 2020, retroactive to January 27, 2020, and is in effect for 90 days. Section 1135 allows the HHS Secretary to waive requirements during emergencies to ensure health care services are available. The COVID-19 outbreak was declared a public health emergency on January 31, 2020, and is in effect for 90 days. Section 1135 allows the HHS Secretary to waive requirements during emergencies to ensure health care services are available. Section 1135(g) specifically refers to the COVID-19 public health emergency declaration and any renewals. The pandemic has exposed limitations in the U.S. medical product supply chain. The impact of COVID-19 on the availability of PPE and ventilators has highlighted the reliance on foreign countries for medical products. FDA and other agencies have taken steps to prevent shortages by waiving regulatory requirements and enabling access to critical medical devices. The United States heavily relies on other countries for medical products, with 72% of facilities manufacturing active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and 53% manufacturing finished drugs located outside the US. China is identified as the world's largest producer of APIs, and the FDA's ability to oversee foreign drug manufacturing facilities has been limited, with inspections decreasing since 2016. The COVID-19 pandemic has further hindered FDA's oversight capabilities. The COVID-19 pandemic has restricted FDA's ability to oversee the global medical product supply chain, leading to postponed foreign facility inspections. Section 3101 requires a report on the security of the U.S. medical product supply chain, assessing dependence on critical drugs from other countries and providing recommendations to improve supply chain resiliency. The Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) is a federal supply of medicine and medical supplies for public health emergencies. It includes antibiotics, vaccines, and treatments worth $8 billion. Management transferred from CDC to ASPR in FY2018. The Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act) authorizes the federal government to waive liability for manufacturers, distributors, and providers of medical countermeasures (MCMs) needed for public health emergencies. This act amends PHSA Section 319F-2(a)(1) to require the Secretary to maintain a stockpile of drugs, vaccines, biological products, medical devices, and supplies including PPE. The PREP Act authorizes the federal government to waive liability for manufacturers, distributors, and providers of medical countermeasures needed for public health emergencies. Section 6005 of FFCRA added personal respiratory protective devices for COVID-19 to the list of covered countermeasures. Drug shortages have been a concern. Drug shortages are a persistent public health concern despite efforts to prevent them. Causes include manufacturing issues, lack of supply chain transparency, and business decisions. The FDA requires manufacturers to report drug shortages and can take action to prevent them. The FDA requires manufacturers to notify the Secretary of any permanent discontinuance or interruption in drug manufacturing that may disrupt the U.S. supply. This notification allows the FDA to expedite facility inspections and review drug applications to prevent shortages. Additionally, the FDA is required to maintain a public list of drugs in shortage, including the name of the drug, manufacturer, estimated duration, and reason for the shortage. Facilities manufacturing drugs must register with FDA and provide a list of all drugs being processed for commercial distribution. Inspections are conducted by FDA after registration, with reports detailing any observations of potential adulteration. The CARES Act amends FDA regulations to prioritize and expedite facility inspections. Section 3112(a) of the CARES Act amends FDA regulations to extend notification requirements to manufacturers of critical drugs during public health emergencies. Manufacturers must notify FDA of any permanent discontinuance or interruption in the manufacture of an API that could lead to a supply disruption. The notification must include reasons for the discontinuance, information about the API source, and any device contributions to the shortage. Section 3112(b) of the CARES Act requires manufacturers to develop a redundancy risk management plan for drugs, APIs, and associated medical devices to address supply disruptions. The plan must identify and evaluate risks at each manufacturing facility and is subject to inspection by the Secretary. Additionally, Section 3112(c) mandates the Secretary to report on drugs in shortage every 90 days to CMS, while Section 3112(d) amends FDA regulations to require notification of discontinuance or interruption in API manufacture. Section 3112(d) of the CARES Act requires inspection reports of facilities manufacturing drugs at risk of shortage to be promptly sent to FDA offices with expertise in drug shortages. This applies to facilities manufacturing drugs on the shortage list in the past five years or with limited competition. Additionally, Section 3112(e) mandates drug manufacturers to report annually to the Secretary the amount of each listed drug. The FDA requires drug manufacturers to report annually to the Secretary the amount of each listed drug manufactured for commercial distribution. This information may need to be submitted electronically and during public health emergencies. Certain biologics may be exempt from reporting requirements if deemed unnecessary for public health protection. FDA regulates medical device safety and effectiveness, requiring manufacturers to register establishments and undergo inspections. Most medical devices must undergo premarket review before marketing. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, concerns arose about potential medical device shortages due to the closure of ethylene oxide sterilization facilities not in compliance with EPA standards. FDA lacked authority to compel manufacturers to report interruptions in device production before the CARES Act, relying on voluntary reporting. FDA requested additional authority in FY2021 to require firms to notify of supply interruptions for essential devices. Legislation introduced in the 116th Congress aims to provide the FDA with additional authority to address potential medical device shortages. This includes requiring manufacturers to report on manufacturing capacity, allowing for expedited premarket review and inspections during shortages, and authorizing temporary importation of essential devices when necessary. Some bills propose giving the FDA more authority, such as allowing for the importation of unapproved devices in shortage situations. Provision Section 3121 creates a new FFDCA Section 506J, mandating reporting on medical device supply interruptions. Provision Section 3121 of the legislation mandates medical device manufacturers to report any production discontinuance or interruption likely to cause supply disruptions during a public health emergency. The FDA must make this information public unless it poses a risk to public health. Failure to report will result in a letter from the FDA, requiring the manufacturer to provide reasons for noncompliance. The FDA requires medical device manufacturers to report production interruptions or discontinuances that could lead to supply shortages during a public health emergency. Manufacturers must respond with reasons for noncompliance within 30 days. The FDA will make this information public within 45 days, excluding confidential or trade secret details. Additionally, the FDA is mandated to maintain a device shortage list, disclosing reasons for shortages and expected durations, unless the information is deemed confidential, a trade secret, or harmful to public health. The FDA must expedite premarket reviews and facility inspections for medical devices in shortage situations. The FDA will expedite premarket review and facility inspections of medical devices in shortage situations, defining terms like \"meaningful disruption\" and \"shortage.\" Provisions address coverage of COVID-19 tests and potential vaccines, focusing on private health insurance coverage and insurer payments to providers. The FFCRA expands the definition of testing that must be covered without cost-sharing by most private health insurance plans. The FFCRA defines COVID-19 testing to include FDA-approved tests for SARS-CoV-2 virus. Provisions in the FFCRA require coverage and payment for COVID-19 testing in various healthcare programs. The FFCRA mandates coverage and payment for COVID-19 testing in healthcare programs, including the Indian Health Service. FDA updated guidance on COVID-19 diagnostic tests, allowing laboratories and manufacturers to distribute tests before receiving EUA, as long as they submit an application within 15 days. The FDA updated guidance allows for the distribution of COVID-19 tests before receiving EUA, potentially leading to tests being used without proper authorization. This could impact the coverage and payment requirements outlined in the FFCRA. The FFCRA Section 6001 requires private health insurance plans to cover specified COVID-19 testing without consumer cost-sharing during the public health emergency. This includes tests authorized by the FDA through various pathways and those determined appropriate by the Secretary. The reimbursement amount for COVID-19 testing by a provider from a health plan is determined by whether they are in-network or out-of-network. In-network providers have negotiated rates specified in their contract with the health plan, while out-of-network providers do not have a negotiated rate. The amount a provider receives from a health plan for COVID-19 testing depends on whether the plan covers out-of-network services. If covered, the plan uses its own methodology to determine payment. Section 3202 establishes reimbursement methodology for testing and related services. If a plan had a negotiated rate with a provider before the COVID-19 public health emergency, it applies. During the COVID-19 public health emergency, health plans must apply negotiated rates for COVID-19 testing. Providers must disclose the cash price for the test on their website, and non-compliant providers may face penalties. The civil monetary penalty for non-compliance with COVID-19 testing price disclosure requirements under PHSA Section 2713 may not exceed $300 per day. Private health insurance plans must cover specified preventive services without cost-sharing, including those recommended by USPSTF or ACIP. These requirements apply to individual and group health insurance plans, excluding grandfathered plans. Section 3203 requires certain health insurance plans to cover COVID-19 vaccines and preventive services recommended by ACIP or USPSTF without cost-sharing, with an expedited effective date of 15 business days after recommendations are published. This provision mirrors existing requirements under PHSA Section 2713. The subpart under PHSA Section 2713 aims to extend services during and beyond the COVID-19 period, especially for underserved populations. It includes additional appropriations for health centers serving underserved areas and provisions for health care providers, such as medical malpractice liability for volunteers, NHSC program rule amendments for volunteering, and clarifications on the USPHS Ready Reserve Corps program. The federal health center program, authorized by PHSA Section 330, provides grants to organizations to operate outpatient health centers in underserved areas. Grant funding supports care for all patients, regardless of ability to pay. These centers are part of the health care safety net and have been used during prior disasters to fund safety net providers. The federal health center program, authorized by PHSA Section 330, provides grants to organizations to operate outpatient health centers in underserved areas. In FY2020, health centers received over $5.6 billion in funding, including $100 million from the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act. An additional $1.32 billion in supplemental funding was appropriated for health centers in FY2020 for COVID-19 detection, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. These funds were awarded via formula to supplement existing health center funding. The section applies limits on using funds for abortion as per the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020. PHSA Section 333(I) authorizes two telehealth programs funded by HRSA. The Telehealth Network Grant Program aims to demonstrate telehealth technologies for underserved populations in rural areas. Nonprofit entities were initially eligible for TNGP grants. The Telehealth Network Grant Program (TNGP) and Telehealth Resource Centers (TRC) Program receive funding from HRSA to support telehealth networks for rural and underserved communities. Amendments to PHSA Section 330I include changes to grant awards for demonstrating telehealth technologies. The Telehealth Network Grant Program (TNGP) has been updated to improve access to healthcare services for the patient population. Changes include extending the grant period to five years and removing requirements for grantees to be nonprofit entities and for telehealth networks to be composed in a certain manner. Grant applicants must now describe how they will utilize telehealth technologies in their applications. The CARES Act now requires grant applicants for the Telehealth Network Grant Program to explain how their projects will enhance healthcare access and quality. Section 3212 eliminates the Secretary's obligation to set terms, conditions, and maximum funding amounts for TNGP recipients. Additionally, the Secretary must prioritize entities that establish telehealth networks for mental health, public health, long-term care, home care, preventive care, and case management services. The Telehealth Network Grant Program now prioritizes projects that promote local and regional connectivity within communities served. The HRSA Administrator no longer needs to ensure a specific distribution of funds or give preference to applicants integrating health care information into projects. Grantees are now prohibited from using funds to purchase certain equipment like computer hardware and software. The Telehealth Network Grant Program prohibits grantees from purchasing certain equipment and limits the use of grant funds for equipment purchases to 20%. The Secretary is required to submit a report on TNGP activities and outcomes every five years. The CARES Act amends the Telehealth Resource Centers (TRC) Program by allowing grants to support initiatives using telehealth technologies, making current TRCs permanent recipients of federal funds, and extending the program's performance period to five years. Grantees are no longer required to be nonprofit entities. The CARES Act amends the TRC program by removing the requirement for grantees to be nonprofit entities. Section 3212 eliminates the Secretary's obligation to establish terms, conditions, and maximum funding amounts for the program. Preferences are given to entities with successful records in delivering healthcare to rural areas, MUAs, and underserved populations. Grantees are restricted from using funds for certain telehealth activities. The TRC program under the CARES Act promotes the use of telehealth technologies for healthcare information. Grantees are no longer required to be nonprofit entities, and the Secretary is no longer obligated to establish funding amounts. A report on program activities is due every five years, with an authorization of $29 million for FY2021 through FY2025. The Rural Health Network Development program, outreach grants, and small health care provider quality improvement grants are administered by HRSA's Federal Office of Rural Health Policy. Grants are available for nonprofit or governmental health entities for three years, with additional planning grants for the Rural Health Network Development program. Despite lapsed authorizations, these programs have been funded, receiving $79.5 million in FY2020. Technical corrections to PHSA Section 330A are made, replacing language related to essential health services with basic health services and extending the duration of Rural Health programs. The section extends the duration of Rural Health Care Service Outreach grants and Rural Health Network Development grants, expands eligibility to any rural health entity, eliminates planning grants, and requires a report to Congress every five years. $79.5 million is authorized for each fiscal year from 2020 to 2025. The USPHS Commissioned Corps, a branch of the U.S. uniformed services under HHS, consists of various public health professionals. ACA authorized a Ready Reserve Corps for public health emergency missions, but HHS had not received funding or established it. Legislation may be needed to fully authorize this action. Legislation (S. 2629, the United States Public Health Service Modernization Act of 2019) was introduced to address the lack of full authorization for the ACA authority regarding the Ready Reserve Corps. Provision Section 3214 enacts the language of S. 2629, making technical and substantive amendments to clarify provisions regarding deployment readiness, retirement, compensation, and other matters affecting the Corps. The law limits medical malpractice liability for health professionals volunteering during the COVID-19 emergency, as long as certain conditions are met. It applies to all types of volunteers, not just health professionals, and specifies exceptions where liability protections do not apply. The law limits medical malpractice liability for health professionals volunteering during the COVID-19 emergency, as long as certain conditions are met. Health professionals are protected from liability for harm caused by acts or omissions within the scope of their license, except in cases of gross negligence or misconduct. The law preempts inconsistent state or local laws and provides additional liability protections beyond those under the VPA. The law provides liability protections for health professionals volunteering during the COVID-19 emergency, with conditions to meet. It preempts state laws and offers additional protections beyond the VPA. The NHSC program offers scholarships and loan repayment for service in health professional shortage areas. During the COVID-19 emergency, NHSC members can volunteer to provide health services in HPSAs. The Secretary can waive requirements to assign NHSC members for this purpose. Privacy of health information is governed by the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The HIPAA Privacy Rule establishes requirements for covered entities' use and disclosure of protected health information. The Part 2 rule applies stricter federal privacy requirements to patient information in substance use disorder programs. The Part 2 rule applies stricter federal privacy requirements to patient information in substance use disorder programs, regulating the disclosure and redisclosure of patient identifying information with written consent or exceptions for medical emergencies or research. The Part 2 rule imposes strict federal privacy requirements on patient information in substance use disorder programs, allowing disclosure with written consent or exceptions for emergencies or research. Violations can result in fines under PHSA Section 543(f). Section 3221 amends PHSA Section 543 to permit the use or disclosure of covered records for treatment, payment, and health care operations with written consent. Section 3221 of PHSA allows the use or disclosure of covered records for treatment, payment, and health care operations as permitted by the HIPAA Privacy Rule. It also applies penalties for violations and prohibits discrimination based on disclosed information. The section further requires compliance with HIPAA breach notification requirements in case of a breach of records. Section 3221 of PHSA requires the Secretary to update regulations for uses and disclosures of covered records. It mandates updating the notice of privacy practices in the HIPAA Privacy Rule to ensure covered entities provide clear privacy practice information. Individual rights for record restrictions under PHSA Section 543 are preserved. The Older Americans Act Nutrition Services Program provides grants to states and territories to support congregate and home-delivered nutrition services for individuals aged 60 and older. Administered by the Administration for Community Living under HHS, the program aims to address food insecurity and promote the health and well-being of older persons through nutrition services. The Older Americans Act Nutrition Services Program, administered by ACL under HHS, provides funding to states and territories for congregate and home-delivered nutrition services for individuals aged 60 and older. States can transfer funding between programs and must offer meals that meet dietary guidelines and recommended daily intake amounts. The Older Americans Act Nutrition Services Program, administered by ACL under HHS, provides funding to states and territories for congregate and home-delivered nutrition services for individuals aged 60 and older. Services prioritize individuals aged 60 or older who are frail, homebound, or isolated. Eligibility is determined by states and local Area Agencies on Aging, with flexibility during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Older Americans Act allows transfer of funds between nutrition programs, clarifies participant requirements for home-delivered meals, and grants authority to waive certain dietary restrictions. States can transfer funds between congregate and home-delivered nutrition programs without prior approval to meet service needs. Individuals unable to obtain nutrition due to social distancing are included in service eligibility. The Older Americans Act allows transfer of funds between nutrition programs during the COVID-19 pandemic. It clarifies participant requirements for home-delivered meals and grants authority to waive dietary restrictions. The Act also establishes the Community Service Employment for Older Americans program, promoting part-time employment opportunities for low-income individuals aged 55 and older. The Title V program, administered by the Department of Labor, provides part-time community service jobs for low-income individuals. Participants earn minimum wage or the typical wage for the job. Due to COVID-19, the Secretary of Labor has additional flexibility in program administration. The CSEOA program allows individuals in OAA Title V projects to extend participation beyond 48 months, increase participation cap, and raise administrative cost limit to 20% if needed. The HIPAA Privacy Rule regulates PHI use by covered entities. The HIPAA Privacy Rule regulates the use and disclosure of PHI by covered entities and their business associates. It establishes individual rights of access to PHI and allows for certain permissible uses and disclosures without written authorization. Covered entities can share PHI for treatment, payment, or healthcare operations without the individual's authorization. The HIPAA Privacy Rule allows for the disclosure of PHI without authorization for national priority purposes, such as public health activities and health oversight. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the OCR/HHS has provided guidance on disclosing PHI to first responders and law enforcement, as well as on telemedicine and enforcement discretion. During the COVID-19 public health emergency, the Secretary has waived sanctions and penalties for certain HIPAA Privacy Rule violations. This includes waiving requirements such as distributing a notice of privacy practices and honoring requests for privacy restrictions and confidential communications. During the COVID-19 public health emergency, the Secretary has waived certain HIPAA Privacy Rule requirements, including distributing a notice of privacy practices, honoring privacy restriction requests, and obtaining agreement to share patient information with family and friends. These waivers apply in the emergency area identified in the public health emergency declaration, to hospitals with a disaster plan, and for the first 72 hours after the plan is initiated. Section 3224 requires the Secretary to issue guidance on sharing patients' PHI during emergency declarations, specifically for COVID-19. The Healthy Start Program (Healthy Start) is a competitive grant program authorized in PHSA Section 330H and administered by HRSA. It aims to decrease U.S. infant mortality rates, improve perinatal and maternal health outcomes, and reduce ethnic and racial health disparities. Infant mortality refers to the death of an infant before their first birthday, and the program allows eligible entities to propose innovative ways to achieve these goals. The Healthy Start Program aims to reduce infant mortality rates and improve perinatal and maternal health outcomes. Participants include women, men, infants, children, and family members residing in communities with high infant mortality rates. The program's authorization expired in 2013, and grants are now available to areas with increasing infant mortality rates above the U.S. average. The Healthy Start Program requires applicants to include state substance abuse agencies, participants, and former participants in community-based consortiums. Factors considered for grant awards include infant mortality contributors like poor birth outcomes and social determinants of health. Coordination changes are made in Section 3225 to enhance program effectiveness. The Healthy Start Program coordination is enhanced by requiring collaboration with similar programs to reduce infant mortality rates and improve health outcomes. Funding of $125.5 million for FY2021-FY2025 is authorized, with 1% reserved for project evaluation. Section 3225 expands the Secretary's use of reserved funds for evaluating program metrics and health outcomes. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is mandated to conduct an independent evaluation. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is required to conduct an independent evaluation of Healthy Start to determine its effectiveness in reducing health disparities. The evaluation must include a review of HRSA's funding allocation and progress towards program goals. The nation's blood supply is managed by independent blood centers and the American Red Cross, with oversight from HHS. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused blood drive cancellations and a critical shortage. A national campaign is required to raise awareness about the importance and safety of blood donation. The section mandates a national campaign to promote blood donation safety and address supply shortages. The Secretary must collaborate with federal agencies, accrediting bodies, and organizations, and can contract with nonprofit entities. A report evaluating campaign impact must be submitted to Congress within two years. This initiative complements existing laws incentivizing medical product research and development. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) supports the development and procurement of medical countermeasures for public health emergencies. BARDA can use \"other transactions\" to expedite partnerships with private companies for COVID-19 countermeasures. Section 3301 of the Public Health Service Act amends provisions to facilitate this process. The provision in Section 3302 of the FFDCA waives the requirement for a written determination for transactions above $100 million during a public health emergency. Transactions under this provision won't be terminated solely due to the end of the emergency. The Secretary must report the use of this provision to specified congressional committees after the public health emergency. Zoonotic diseases are infectious diseases transmissible between humans and animals, with many outbreaks believed to originate from animal-to-human transmission. The origin of the COVID-19 virus is likely but unproven. Section 512A of the FFDCA introduces Priority Zoonotic Animal Drugs evaluation by the FDA. Section 3302 of the FFDCA introduces a new provision for expedited review of animal drugs for zoonotic diseases with serious health consequences for humans. Requests for expedited review must be acted upon within 60 days, with options for streamlined consultations and guidance to make clinical trials more efficient. Title VII and Title VIII of the PHSA authorize programs to support the health workforce, including scholarships, loans, and academic programs. These programs aim to diversify the workforce, train primary care providers, and increase the number of geriatric health care providers. While authorizations of appropriations have lapsed, some programs continue to receive funding through HRSA's Bureau of the Health Care Workforce. Reauthorization of these programs is being considered in the 116th Congress. In the 116th Congress, bills were proposed to reauthorize Title VII and Title VIII programs for five years with funding levels from FY2019. Sections of these bills were included in the CARES Act with funding reflecting FY2020 appropriations and a five-year authorization starting in FY2021. Title VII programs support health workforce with FY2020 appropriations. Centers of Excellence received $23.711 million in FY2020 for minority recruitment. Health Professions Training for Diversity authorizes scholarships for disadvantaged students. In FY2020, appropriations were made for scholarships for disadvantaged students, loan repayment and fellowships for minority health professional faculty, and the Health Careers Opportunity Program. Additionally, funding was allocated for the Primary Care Training and Enhancement program to support primary care medicine and physician assistant training. In FY2020, the program received appropriations totaling $48.925 million for training in General, Pediatric, and Public Health Dentistry, as well as grants for dentists and dental hygienist training. The Advisory Committee on Training in Primary Care Medicine and Dentistry oversees programs under PHSA Sections 747 and 748. Area Health Education Centers received $41.25 million for training students from underserved backgrounds. The Quentin N. Burdick Program for Rural Interdisciplinary Training also received funding. The Quentin N. Burdick Program for Rural Interdisciplinary Training (Section 754) and Allied Health and Other Disciplines (Section 755) have not been funded in recent years. Health Workforce Information and Analysis (Section 761) received $5.663 million in FY2020 for workforce analysis. The Council on Graduate Medical Education (COGME; Section 762) analyzes physician workforce issues. The committee authorized in Section 762 oversees training and financing, with a sunset date waived by appropriations laws. Public Health Training Centers (Section 766) provide grants for training public health professionals. Authorization of Appropriations (Section 770) allocates funds for public health workforce programs, including a $17 million appropriation in FY2020. The Pediatric Subspecialty Loan Repayment Program (Section 775) offers loan repayment for specific pediatric subspecialists. The ACA created a Pediatric Subspecialty Loan Repayment Program for underserved areas, but it has never been funded. The section extends authorizations of appropriations for health workforce diversity programs until FY2025, allocating specific amounts for different sections. It also amends the date for a report on diversity in health professions to be due by September 30, 2025, and every five years thereafter. The section also extends authorizations of appropriations for primary care medical and dental training programs, with changes including preferences for training residents in rural areas and an annual appropriation of $48.294 million for FY2021-FY2025. The section authorizes appropriations for various healthcare training programs, including primary care medical and dental training, with a total of $28.531 million for FY2021-FY2025. It also amends references in different sections of the Public Health Service Act to update committee names and funding language. Section 755 authorizes grants for training in Allied Health and Other Disciplines for geriatric populations or maternal and child health. It also amends PHSA Section 761 to allocate $5.663 million annually for FY2021-FY2025. Additionally, it updates references in PHSA Section 762 (COGME) and adds new reporting requirements. The section amends various sections of the PHSA to authorize appropriations for Public Health Workforce Programs, including training centers, rural areas, and loan repayment for pediatric subspecialists. HRSA administers these programs through its Bureau of Health Workforce, with advisory committees providing oversight and guidance to HRSA and Congress. The Secretary, in consultation with advisory groups, is required to develop a comprehensive plan coordinating health care workforce development programs to focus federal investments effectively. This plan includes performance measures, gap analyses, and addressing barriers. The Secretary is mandated to develop a comprehensive plan for health care workforce development programs, including performance measures, gap analyses, and addressing barriers. Coordination with other federal agencies is required to evaluate program effectiveness and improve information collection. A report on the plan's implementation must be submitted to congressional committees within two years. HRSA consolidated geriatric workforce programs in FY2015, supporting GWEP and GACA. GWEP focuses on training inter-professional teams to enhance geriatric competence among healthcare providers. GACA awards support junior faculty in academic geriatrics to become leaders in the field. PHSA Section 753 was reauthorized in the ACA, adding new subsections. The ACA reauthorized geriatric training programs, including GWEP and GACA, with funding allocated despite lapsed authorization. The new PHSA Section 753 codifies these programs and requires grants to specified health professional schools. The ACA reauthorized geriatric training programs, including GWEP and GACA, with funding allocated despite lapsed authorization. The new PHSA Section 753 codifies these programs and requires grants to specified health professional schools, emphasizing patient and family engagement, primary care integration, and Alzheimer's disease education. GWEP grants may not exceed five years, with specific application requirements and reporting obligations for grantees. The Secretary must report to congressional committees within four years of Title VII Health Care Workforce enactment. The new PHSA Section 753(b) establishes the GACA grant program for eligible entities to support geriatric careers. Eligible entities include nursing schools and health professionals, with specific application requirements and service assurances. The Secretary must ensure geographical distribution among award recipients, including rural MUAs. The new PHSA Section 753(b) establishes the GACA grant program for eligible entities to support geriatric careers, with specific application requirements and service assurances. Grants must be a minimum of $75,000 in FY2021, increasing annually by the CPI, with award periods not exceeding five years. The section waives certain awarding preferences for Title VII grants and authorizes $40.737 million for each of FY2021-FY2025. Part C and Part D of the PHSA authorize grant programs to increase nursing workforce diversity and strengthen nursing practice. These programs include initiatives to advance individuals from lower skilled health professions to higher nursing roles. Part E establishes the nursing student loan program, with recent funding of $260 million in FY2020. Despite lapsed authorization, these programs have been funded in recent years. Subsection (a) reauthorizes programs in PHSA Title VIII, while subsection (b) requires a GAO report on nursing loan programs. Subsection (b) requires a GAO report on nursing loan programs, adding new language to applications, use of funds, and provisions applicable to Title VIII. It specifies grants should address national nursing needs, requires new information from grantees, and mandates a biennial report to be delivered by September 30, 2020. Changes are made to grants for advance education nursing grants to replace master's level nurses with graduate level nurses. The subsection amends Section 831 to rename it \"Nurse Education, Quality, and Retention Grants,\" specifying grants for individuals entering the nursing career ladder and developing nursing specialties. It also removes subsection (e) regarding grant awards. The subsection amends Section 831 to rename it \"Nurse Education, Quality, and Retention Grants,\" specifying grants for individuals entering the nursing career ladder and developing nursing specialties. It deletes subsection (e) regarding grant awards preferences in prior years and (h) authorizing appropriations from FY2010-FY2014. The reporting requirements in Section 831 are amended to require the Secretary to submit a report on the grants as part of a larger report under Section 806. Eligibility for grants is expanded to include nursing schools, health care facilities, Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), nurse-managed health clinics, and partnerships. Nurse Retention Grants under PHSA Section 831A are deleted as they are now included in the amended PHSA Section 831. PHSA Section 846 is amended to allow individuals to fulfill their service commitment in for-profit health. The subsection makes changes to various sections of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) to update language, remove authorization of appropriations, and amend committees. It also deletes sections related to public service announcements and makes appropriation changes. The subsection amends Section 871 to authorize appropriations for Parts B, C, and D of Title VIII and Student Loan Funds. It also requires a GAO report on nurse loan repayment programs and makes changes to Medicare and Medicaid programs in response to the COVID-19 public health emergency. The provisions aim to relax program requirements for Medicare patients and address cost-sharing for Medicaid services. Health savings accounts (HSAs) are tax-advantaged accounts for medical expenses, requiring coverage under a high-deductible health plan meeting specific criteria. The provision allows HSA-qualified HDHPs to offer telehealth and remote care services before the deductible is met, starting from plan years before December 31, 2021. Section 3701 allows telehealth and remote care to be considered non-disqualifying coverage for HSA eligibility before December 31, 2021. This provision was effective as of March 27, 2020. There are four categories of health-related tax-advantaged accounts: HSAs, Archer MSAs, FSAs, and HRAs, all with different qualified medical expenses. The recent provision allows OTC medicines, drugs, and menstrual care products to be considered qualified medical expenses for HSAs, Archer MSAs, FSAs, and HRAs without a prescription. This change applies to expenses incurred after December 31, 2019. Recent legislation (P.L. 116-123) has modified Medicare telehealth restrictions, allowing for temporary waivers or modifications during the COVID-19 emergency. A qualified telehealth provider must have had a prior relationship with the patient within the past three years under Medicare. FFCRA Division F, Section 6010 expanded the definition of a qualified provider to include those with prior provider-patient relationships outside of Medicare within the past three years. Provision Section 3703 removes telehealth restrictions that the Secretary could waive under P.L. 116-123 and broadens the authority to waive any telehealth requirements. The provision also eliminates the definition of a \"qualified provider\" for telehealth services during the COVID-19 emergency period. Section 3704 allows FQHCs and RHCs to serve as distant sites for telehealth services during the COVID-19 emergency period, expanding their role beyond just originating sites. This change removes the requirement of a prior relationship between the patient and provider for telehealth services to be covered under the emergency declaration. Provision Section 3704 allows FQHCs and RHCs to serve as distant sites for telehealth services to eligible individuals during the emergency period. Payment methods will be developed for these services, with costs not included in current payment calculations. Medicare is a primary source of coverage for individuals with end-stage renal disease. Individuals with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) require dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive. Medicare covers ESRD patients aged 65 and older, as well as qualified individuals under 65. Benefits include dialysis treatment and kidney transplant coverage. Physicians are paid a monthly rate for dialysis services, with additional support for home-based dialysis. Telehealth services for ESRD were expanded under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. In 2018, Congress expanded telehealth services for ESRD patients on home dialysis. ESRD beneficiaries can now receive monthly clinical assessments via telehealth, with certain face-to-face assessment requirements. Section 3705 allows the Secretary to waive the face-to-face assessment requirement during the COVID-19 emergency. The Medicare hospice benefit covers services for beneficiaries with a life expectancy of six months or less, provided by Medicare-certified hospices. The benefit is structured in periods, with initial certification required for coverage. Waivers for certain requirements may be granted during the COVID-19 emergency. The Medicare hospice benefit covers services for beneficiaries with a life expectancy of six months or less, provided by Medicare-certified hospices. Recertification of terminal illness is required by the hospice physician for continued eligibility, including a face-to-face encounter. During the COVID-19 emergency, telehealth may be used for these encounters as determined appropriate by the Secretary. Home health agencies provide skilled nursing care, physical therapy, and speech language therapy to homebound individuals under the SSA Section 1895. Payment is based on 30-day episodes of care with adjustments for case-mix and local wages. Telemedicine can be used but not as a substitute for in-person visits. Telemedicine services are not accounted for in home health PPS, and providers do not receive direct payment for telemedicine services. However, remote patient monitoring can be reported as an allowable administrative cost, as defined in regulations. CMS allows home health agencies to include the costs of remote patient monitoring. Section 3707 requires the Secretary to consider encouraging the use of telemedicine by home health agencies for services provided. During the COVID-19 emergency, home health agencies are encouraged to use telemedicine for Medicare beneficiaries. This includes remote patient monitoring and other communication services, consistent with the beneficiary's care plan. Medicare covers home health services under Parts A and B, with special eligibility requirements and benefit limits. Part A pays for post-institutional services for up to 100 visits during a spell of illness. Medicare covers home health services under Parts A and B, with special eligibility requirements and benefit limits. Part A pays for up to 100 visits during a spell of illness, which extends 14 days after discharge from a skilled nursing facility or hospital following a minimum 3-day stay. Part B covers medically necessary home health services exceeding the visit limit or not qualifying as \"postinstitutional.\" Whether enrolled in Part A, Part B, or both, the scope of the Medicare home health benefit is the same, with no cost-sharing for beneficiaries. Medicare home health services have specific eligibility requirements certified by a physician, including a face-to-face encounter. Beneficiaries must be confined to the home and in need of skilled nursing care, physical therapy, or speech language therapy. The eligibility period may continue for homebound beneficiaries with a certified need for occupational therapy services. The BBA 2018 amended SSA Sections 1814 and 1835 to expand documentation for Medicare home health services eligibility. Physicians cannot certify if they have financial ties to the agency. The Secretary can now use a home health agency's medical record for eligibility. Section 3708 of the BBA 2018 allows nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, or physician assistants to certify Medicare home health services eligibility and conduct face-to-face encounters. Professionals with financial ties to a home health agency are prohibited from certifying eligibility, except for sole community home health agencies. The Secretary can use a home health agency's medical record for eligibility. Section 3708 of the BBA 2018 allows the Secretary to use a home health agency's medical record to document eligibility for Medicare home health services. Amendments ensure that definitions and payment systems align with current statutory language. Regulations must be implemented within six months of enactment. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25) established procedures to reduce the federal budget deficit, including sequestration of mandatory spending. Medicare benefits are subject to reductions under sequestration. The Secretary may produce an interim final rule to comply with required effective dates. Section 256(d) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA; P.L. 99-177) outlines special rules for Medicare during sequestration. Sequestration for Medicare began on April 1, 2013, and was scheduled to continue until March 31, 2030, with a maximum 2% reduction in benefit payments. The provision waives sequestration for Medicare from May 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020, and extends mandatory spending sequestration through FY2030. Medicare pays hospitals under the IPPS, with adjustments based on factors like geographic location and patient complexity. In FY2020, there are 759 MS-DRGs with weights recalibrated annually. Section 3710 increases MS-DRG weight by 20% for COVID-19 Medicare discharges during the emergency period, not subject to budget neutrality. Notice and comment not required for implementation. Medicare pays for intensive inpatient rehabilitation services under the Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility (IRF) prospective payment system (IRF PPS). The IRF PPS payment is a predetermined amount per discharge, and providers must meet specific requirements to receive payment. Medicare covers IRF services for patients who meet certain criteria. The Secretary is not required to use notice and comment for implementation, and states with waivers can still implement payment adjustments. Medicare covers intensive inpatient rehabilitation services under the Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility (IRF) prospective payment system (IRF PPS). Patients must actively participate in and benefit from intensive rehabilitation therapy, which is defined as 3 hours a day at least five days per week or 15 hours within a consecutive seven-day period. Medicare also pays for extended inpatient hospital care for chronic critical illness under the long-term care hospital inpatient prospective payment system (LTCH PPS). The LTCH PPS payment is a predetermined amount per discharge and is generally higher than the IPPS amount. LTCH discharges in FY2020 and subsequent years meeting specific criteria receive LTCH PPS payment, while others get a site-neutral payment rate. During the COVID-19 emergency period, waivers are in place for LTCH therapy hours and site-neutral payment requirements. Medicare Part B covers durable medical equipment (DME) and prosthetics/orthotics if medically necessary. Examples include hospital beds, glucose monitors, and ventilators. Medicare pays 80% of the fee schedule amount for DMEPOS, with beneficiaries responsible for the remaining 20%. Fee schedule amounts are updated annually. Since 2016, Medicare fee schedule rates for certain DMEPOS outside competitive bidding areas have been reduced based on price information from the bidding program. The reductions were phased in during 2016, with 50% of the payment rate based on the unadjusted fee schedule amount and 50% on the adjusted rate from competitive bidding. By January 2017, fee schedules were entirely based on the adjusted rates. In June 2018, concerns about low rates led to the Secretary applying a phase-in methodology again. In June 2018, the Secretary applied a phase-in methodology for rural and noncontiguous areas, resulting in a 50/50 blend of fee schedules based on unadjusted rates and rates adjusted by competitive bidding data. This created two different fee schedules for DMEPOS products outside competitive bidding areas, depending on rural/urban designation and location within the contiguous United States. The CARES Act extends the 50/50 blended DMEPOS payment rate for rural or noncontiguous areas during the COVID-19 emergency period. It also increases the payment rate for items in other areas, starting from April 26, 2020, with a 75/25 blend of fee schedules based on competitive bidding rates. Medicare Part B covers specific vaccines, with 75% of the fee schedule adjusted by competitive bidding rates and 25% based on higher fee schedule amounts. There is no cost-sharing for flu, HBV, or pneumonia vaccines if provided by a Medicare-participating practitioner. Cost-sharing applies for vaccines administered to treat an injury or direct exposure to a disease. Medicare Part C plans are generally required to cover the same services. Medicare Part B covers specific vaccines with a cost-sharing structure. Medicare Part C plans are required to cover the same services, including flu, HBV, and pneumonia vaccines without cost-sharing. Section 3713 of the provision amended SSA to require coverage of COVID-19 vaccines without cost-sharing, effective upon enactment. The Secretary is authorized to implement Section 3713 for a COVID-19 vaccine upon FDA licensing. Medicare Part D is a voluntary outpatient prescription drug benefit where enrollees purchase plans from private insurers. Plan sponsors must meet requirements including providing a formulary and network of pharmacies. Federal law mandates adequate emergency access to needed drugs for Part D enrollees. Plan sponsors have flexibility in complying with emergency access provisions, but CMS expects limits on pharmacy edits. CMS expects plan sponsors to limit pharmacy edits that prevent enrollees from seeking early prescription refills during federally declared disasters or public health emergencies. In response to COVID-19, CMS outlined options for Part D sponsors to relax refill-too-soon edits and allow enrollees to obtain extended-day supplies if needed. Sponsors must ensure adequate access to covered drugs at out-of-network pharmacies for enrollees unable to obtain them at a network pharmacy. Enrollees are responsible for cost-sharing and additional charges. Plan-imposed policies may be relaxed for prescription delivery during disasters or emergencies. Prior authorization requirements for COVID-19 drugs may be waived. Part D plan sponsors must provide extended dispensing of up to a 90-day fill or refill of drugs during the COVID-19 emergency period. Controls may be placed on pharmacy dispensing for at-risk enrollees, with waivers provided uniformly to enrollees. Access to prescriptions must be ensured for at-risk enrollees during natural disasters or similar situations. Part D sponsors must allow enrollees access to a 90-day fill or refill of prescriptions, except for restrictions based on drug safety. Medicaid HCBS include specific benefits like case management and personal care, authorized under the Medicaid state plan subject to CMS approval. The Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) are authorized through various options including the Section 1915(i), 1915(k), and 1915(j) State Plan Options, as well as waiver programs like the 1915(c) and 1915(d) waivers. Section 3715 amends Section 1902(h) to specify limits on payment under a Medicaid state plan for home and community care. Section 3715 amends Section 1902(h) to specify limits on payment under a Medicaid state plan for home and community care, applying to various statutory authorities for providing Medicaid HCBS. It includes waiver authorities under different sections and ensures that care or services specified in an individual's plan can be received in an acute care hospital if certain conditions are met. FFCRA Section 6004 allows state Medicaid programs to offer COVID-19 testing to uninsured individuals without cost-sharing. Uninsured individuals are defined as those not eligible for Medicaid or enrolled in federal health programs or certain private insurance plans. FFCRA Section 6004 allows state Medicaid programs to provide COVID-19 testing to uninsured individuals without cost-sharing. The CARES Act expands the definition of uninsured individuals to include those eligible for Medicaid under the ACA expansion pathway in non-expansion states. FFCRA Section 6004 added FDA-approved tests and testing-related state plan services for the COVID-19 virus without cost-sharing to Medicaid mandatory services. This benefit is required to be offered by states and territories from March 18, 2020. The FFCRA Section 6004 mandates Medicaid programs to provide FDA-approved COVID-19 testing without cost-sharing during the public health emergency. This includes coverage for uninsured individuals and CHIP enrollees. The CARES Act modifies the requirements for testing eligibility. The CARES Act modifies Medicaid and CHIP coverage for COVID-19 tests during the public health emergency, removing the requirement for FDA approval. Tests are now defined as in vitro diagnostic devices that detect SARS-CoV-2 or diagnose COVID-19. The Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA) established a new method for determining clinical laboratory payments under the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (CLFS) starting in 2018. Payment rates are now based on reported private insurance payment amounts, with a phased-in approach from 2017 to 2022. During this period, payment reductions are limited to 10% annually. The CLFS payment reduction limit was set to be 10% annually from 2017 to 2020, and 15% for each year from 2020 to 2022. CMS established CLFS rates based on private payer rates, with national rates not varying by geography. The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 modified the implementation schedule and reporting requirements, with a reporting exemption for diagnostic laboratories from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020. Reporting would begin on January 1, 2021, with subsequent reporting required every three years. The CLFS payment reduction limit was initially set at 10% annually from 2017 to 2020 and 15% from 2021 to 2023. Provision Section 3718 delays reporting requirements and revises payment reduction limits. No reporting is required from January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2021, with reporting starting on January 1, 2022. Payment reduction limit is 0% for 2021, 15% for 2022 to 2024 when private payer rates are fully implemented. SSA Section 1815 allows accelerated payments to IPPS hospitals facing cash flow issues due to delayed Medicare payments or exceptional circumstances. The payment cannot exceed 70% of estimated charges and must be repaid within 90 days. CMS can withhold Medicare payments if the accelerated payment is not repaid. Requests for accelerated payments are reviewed and approved by the CMS regional office. Section 3719 of the Provision amends SSA Section 1815 to expand accelerated payment eligibility to certain hospitals during the COVID-19 emergency period. The expansion includes Critical Access Hospitals, pediatric hospitals, and IPPS-exempt cancer hospitals in the 50 states or the District of Columbia. Safeguards against fraud are in place, and the Secretary may implement amendments such as periodic or lump sum payments, up to 100% of estimated charges, and coverage for up to a six-month period. The Provision amends SSA Section 1815 to expand accelerated payment eligibility to certain hospitals during the COVID-19 emergency period, including Critical Access Hospitals, pediatric hospitals, and IPPS-exempt cancer hospitals in the 50 states or the District of Columbia. Safeguards against fraud are in place, and the Secretary may extend the recoupment period up to 120 days upon request of the hospital. Hospitals are allowed at least 12 months from the date of the first accelerated payment to pay any outstanding balance in full. Medicaid is jointly financed by the federal government and states, with the federal government's share determined by the FMAP rate, which varies by state based on per capita income. Exceptions to the regular FMAP rate have been made for certain states, situations, populations, providers. The FMAP rate exceptions for states, populations, and providers have been provided through temporary increases in the past. Two exceptions were available during recessions, with requirements for states to maintain Medicaid standards. The FFCRA now provides a 6.2 percentage point increase in the FMAP rate for all states, the District of Columbia, and territories. The FFCRA provides a 6.2 percentage point increase in the FMAP rate for states, the District of Columbia, and territories during the public health emergency period. States must not have more restrictive Medicaid standards, higher premiums than January 1, 2020, or fail to maintain eligibility for Medicaid enrollees. Section 6008 of FFCRA modifies SSA Section 1905(cc) to add conditions for the FMAP rate increase, including restrictions on state funding requirements for Medicaid expenditures. Section 3720 of the CARES Act further amends FFCRA to delay the application of increased FMAP rates based on state-imposed premiums. The FFCRA FMAP rate increase is subject to restrictions on state funding requirements for Medicaid expenditures. The application of the premium requirement is delayed for 30 days after March 18, 2020. States can receive the FMAP increase through April 17, 2020, if their premiums exceed the amount imposed as of January 1, 2020. Compliance with all other FFCRA requirements is still necessary to receive the FMAP increase. Prior to the CARES Act, companies could choose between submitting an NDA to FDA for approval or using the OTC drug monograph process. The monograph establishes conditions for OTC drugs to be considered safe and effective without FDA approval. Compliance with the monograph is assessed by FDA during inspections. The OTC drug monograph program, established in 1972, aimed to streamline the marketing of OTC drugs without individual FDA evaluation and approval. The OTC drug monograph program, established in 1972, aimed to streamline the marketing of OTC drugs without individual FDA evaluation and approval. However, challenges include unfinalized monographs leading to OTC drugs on the market without final safety determinations. FDA has limited resources for OTC monograph activities. The new FFDCA Section 505G replaces the current OTC drug monograph rulemaking process with an administrative order process, allowing FDA to determine if a drug is GRASE or not GRASE. The new FFDCA Section 505G replaces the current OTC drug monograph rulemaking process with an administrative order process, allowing FDA to determine if a drug is GRASE or not GRASE. It also introduces various requirements such as marketing OTC drugs only with FDA approval, expedited processes for certain circumstances, and mandates for FDA to publish information on orders and conduct studies on marketing exclusivity. Section 3852 of the FFDCA deems OTC drugs misbranded if they do not comply with new requirements. Section 3853 excludes certain OTC drugs from the regulations. The Sunscreen Innovation Act was enacted to address delays in consumer access to new sunscreens. The Sunscreen Innovation Act (SIA; P.L. 113-195) created a new pathway for determining the GRASE status of certain OTC sunscreen active ingredients. FDA is required to make GRASE determinations through administrative orders under the SIA process, rather than through rulemaking. FDA has not yet approved any submissions for new sunscreen under the SIA process, requesting additional safety and effectiveness data from sponsors. Provision Section 3854 allows sponsors to transition into the review process under new FFDCA Section 505G for OTC sunscreen active ingredients subject to proposed sunscreen orders under the SIA. The Sunscreen Innovation Act (SIA) created a new pathway for determining the GRASE status of certain OTC sunscreen active ingredients. Final sunscreen orders issued under the SIA are considered final administrative orders under FFDCA Section 505G. Certain orders are eligible for marketing exclusivity. Section 3854(b)(4) adds new FFDCA Section 586H, which sunsets FFDCA Chapter V Subchapter I at the end of FY2022. In 2004-2005, over 1,500 children under two years were treated for adverse events from cough and cold medications. FDA convened a meeting in 2007 to discuss safety and efficacy of OTC cough and cold products for pediatric use. The FDA committees found that OTC cough and cold products marketed for pediatric use were not proven effective in children. Additional studies and labeling changes were recommended, but the FDA has not updated the monograph to reflect these recommendations. Manufacturers voluntarily removed infant cough and cold products for children under two years old and updated labeling to include a warning for children under four years old. FDA has issued consumer updates warning of potential harms associated with certain cough and cold products in children. The FDA is required to amend the cough and cold monograph for pediatric use, with updates on progress to be submitted annually to congressional committees. OTC drug monograph activities have historically been funded by discretionary appropriations, unlike prescription drug activities which are funded by a combination of appropriations and industry-paid user fees. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) allows FDA to collect fees from the pharmaceutical industry to support the review of human drug applications. User fees are linked to performance goals negotiated between FDA and industry, with fee authorities extended to medical devices, animal drugs, tobacco products, and other FDA-regulated products. These fees, outlined in FFDCA Chapter VII, Subchapter C, enable the FDA Commissioner to assess, collect, and spend user fees for specified FDA activities. Section 3862 of FFDCA Chapter VII introduces a new Part 10 for \"Fees Relating to Over-The-Counter Drugs.\" New FFDCA Section 744M establishes a framework for assessing and collecting fees to support FDA's OTC monograph drug activities. Fees can only be used as specified and the program is authorized through FY2025. Section 744N requires annual reports on user fee collection and spending. The FDA is required to submit annual performance and fiscal reports on user fee collection and spending to specific committees. The reports must be publicly available on the FDA's website. The reauthorization process for the user fee program includes consulting with stakeholders on future monograph activities and transmitting recommendations to Congress by January 15, 2025. The table lists relevant provisions with effective dates, required reports, or sunset dates. This report reflects the CARES Act at enactment and will not track actions thereafter. This CRS report reflects the CARES Act at enactment and will not track actions thereafter."
