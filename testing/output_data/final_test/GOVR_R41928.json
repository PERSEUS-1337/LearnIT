    "content": "The annual Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill, known as Division E of the Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 112-74), funds agencies and programs in three federal departments, including the controversial Fish and Wildlife Service. House and Senate considered these appropriations within the context of a larger bill originally focused on military construction. The legislative history of Interior and Environment appropriations for FWS in FY2012 saw Congress approving $1.48 billion, lower than the President's request of $1.69 billion. Most accounts were reduced compared to FY2011 levels, with changes ranging from a 20.4% reduction for the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund to a 10.8% increase for Construction. Floor action on appropriations began on July 25, 2011, with consideration continuing until July 28, 2011. During consideration of H.R. 2584 in 2011, the House adopted two amendments increasing funding for FWS and removing restrictions on endangered species protection. The bill was left unfinished when the House rose on July 28, 2011. In FY2012, Congress approved $1.23 billion for the FWS Resource Management account, down 1.5% from FY2011. Funding cuts were made for adding new species to the Endangered Species Act list, critical habitat designation, and fish hatcheries. In FY2012, Congress approved $176.0 million for the endangered species program, a slight increase from the previous year. The Administration had requested $182.6 million, while the House Committee approved $138.7 million. Funding cuts were made for critical habitat designation and fish hatcheries. The House Committee approved $138.7 million for the endangered species program in FY2012. The committee report highlighted the low rate of species recovery as evidence of the Endangered Species Act's failure. Over half of the funding reduction came from eliminating new species listings and critical habitat designations. The bill language directed that funds not be used for certain ESA implementation activities. The House Committee approved $138.7 million for the endangered species program in FY2012, with limits on spending for listing species in response to petitions. On July 27, 2011, the House passed an amendment to strike language that would have restricted actions under the Endangered Species Act. P.L. 112-74 imposed limits on spending for listing species in response to petitions, listing foreign species, and critical habitat designation. It also reduced funding for consultation under Section 7 of the ESA by 1.5% from FY2011, which could potentially delay federal actions. The Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund receives reduced funding of $47.7 million under P.L. 112-74, impacting states' ability to prepare Habitat Conservation Plans for listed species. This reduction leaves states with the option to fund these efforts alone or rely on individual actors for development. The final bill projects a 5.0% savings in endangered species funding compared to FY2011 levels. The expiration of the provision authorizing ESA appropriations in FY1992 does not mean agencies lack authority to take actions or enforce prohibitions within the act. The statutory obligations created by the law continue even without appropriated funds. Section 1713 of P.L. 112-10 removed most wolves in the Northern Rockies from the protections of ESA, allowing for their delisting. This action occurred during the FY2011 appropriation process, showing that agency funding does not affect statutory obligations under the law. Additionally, citizens can still bring civil suits under Section 11(g) (16 U.S.C. \u00a71540(g)) regardless of agency funding. The gray wolves were delisted from the ESA's protected species list, making them the 49th species to be delisted. In April 2009, FWS issued a regulation to remove wolves in Montana, Idaho, and parts of Washington, Oregon, and Utah from ESA protections. Wyoming's wolves remained protected due to concerns about the state's management plan. In August 2010, a federal court overturned the delisting rule, and in November 2010, FWS was ordered to reconsider Wyoming's wolf management plan. The FWS reissued the April 2009 rule to delist gray wolves, insulating it from judicial review. The provision allows for a potential re-listing of the species in the future. This delisting differed from past efforts due to meeting recovery goals but facing some disputes. H.R. 2584 addressed concerns about potential legal challenges to delisting rules for wolves in Wyoming. The final bill, P.L. 112-74, omitted a provision from the House regarding wolves. The bill instructed FWS to allocate $1 million for a livestock loss program due to wolf predation. Additionally, $485.7 million was allocated for the National Wildlife Refuge System, a decrease from the previous year. The final bill, P.L. 112-74, allocated $485.7 million for the National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS), a 1.3% decrease from the previous year. Costs have increased due to various factors, leading to cuts in funding for programs aiding endangered species, invasive species control, habitat restoration, and staffing at less popular refuges. Funding has not kept pace with demands, leading to refuge consolidation as a response to reduced funding. One response to reduced funding has been the consolidation of refuges under a single manager and staff to share resources. This has faced resistance from supporters concerned about losing resources and supervision. The Law Enforcement program covers wildlife inspections, investigations of violations, and received $62.1 million in funding, down 1.2% from the previous year. The overall account received $135.3 million, down 2.6% from the previous year. In FY2012, Congress funded the hatchery program at $46.1 million, a 5.7% decrease from the previous year. The Administration proposed reimbursable agreements for mitigation activities at National Fish Hatcheries, leading to concerns about potential cuts in activities at certain hatcheries. FWS manages hatcheries under the National Fish Hatchery System, with some hatcheries providing mitigation for other agencies. In FY2012, Congress funded the hatchery program at $46.1 million, a 5.7% decrease from the previous year. FWS projected annual expenditures to mitigate projects of four agencies: Army Corps of Engineers, Tennessee Valley Authority, Bonneville Power Authority, and the Bureau of Reclamation. Nine hatcheries met or exceeded the Administration's 40% mitigation threshold and were targeted for reduction or elimination of FWS support. The conferees resolved the proposed shortfall in the budget for mitigation hatchery operations and critical supplies. An additional $3,800,000 is appropriated for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to reimburse the Service. The consolidated Act provides funding for mitigation hatcheries operated by the Service for various federal partners. Future budget requests must ensure sufficient funding is available before proposing to eliminate funding for hatcheries to avoid disruptions. P.L. 112-74 allocated $32.2 million for the program, supporting work with federal, state, tribal, and other partners. The consolidated Act allocated $31.0 million to support climate change strategies for wildlife impacts at local and regional levels. Funding also goes towards cooperative scientific research on climate change and habitat, working through Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs) to address climate change effects. The bill directed FWS to integrate LCCs with Joint Ventures, Fish Habitat Partnerships, and other agencies for a total of $54.6 million for land acquisition. The consolidated bill allocated $54.6 million for land acquisition from the Land and Water Conservation Fund, slightly lower than the FY2011 level. The Administration had requested $140.0 million. $5,000,000 was specified for land conservation partnerships authorized by the Highlands Conservation Act of 2004. The top five acquisition priorities included Alaska Maritime NWR, Silvio Conte NWR, Laguna Atascosa NWR, St. Marks NWR, and Cache River NWR. The Migratory Bird Conservation Account provides mandatory spending for FWS land acquisition. The Migratory Bird Conservation Account (MBCA) does not rely on annual appropriations but is funded by the sale of duck stamps and import duties. For FY2011, estimated funds are $58.0 million, with $44.0 million available for FWS land acquisition. The National Wildlife Refuge Fund compensates counties for federal lands under FWS jurisdiction. The Administration requested no funding for NWRF in FY2012, arguing that savings were justified based on low costs of refuges to county infrastructure and economic benefits to local economies from increased tourism. P.L. 112-74 provided $14.0 million for NWRF, down 3.5% from FY2011, which combined with receipts, will be sufficient for counties to receive 30.8% of the authorized level. The Multinational Species Conservation Fund benefits various species like elephants, tigers, and marine turtles. Funding for the program was $9.5 million in P.L. 112-74, slightly lower than the Administration's request of $9.8 million. The Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Fund received $3.8 million, with 75% of funds allocated for projects outside the U.S. State and Tribal Wildlife Grants support conservation efforts for various species. State and Tribal Wildlife Grants were established in the FY2001 Interior appropriations law to fund conservation efforts for species of concern to states, territories, and tribes. The program provides funding for state conservation plans and practical conservation projects, with a portion allocated for competitive grants to tribal governments. Congress allocated $61.3 million for these grants in FY2011, with $51.3 million for formula grants to states and $5.7 million for competitive grants. Tribes received $4.3 million in funding. In FY2011, State and Tribal Wildlife Grants received $61.3 million in funding, with $51.3 million for formula grants to states and $5.7 million for competitive grants. Tribes received $4.3 million in funding. Congress specified matching fund requirements for planning and implementation grants. The Administration's FY2012 request was $95.0 million."
