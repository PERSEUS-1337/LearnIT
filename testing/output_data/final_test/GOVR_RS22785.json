    "content": "States seeking to cover pregnant women under the \u00a71115 waiver authority or extend SCHIP coverage to unborn children must submit proposals to CMS for approval. Approved programs define available pregnancy-related services, with SCHIP covering services related to pregnancy or conditions that could complicate it. Postpartum care for the mother is generally not covered under the SCHIP SPA option. The focus is on care for the unborn child, allowing states to provide prenatal services effectively. The SCHIP unborn child SPA option allows states to provide prenatal care to pregnant women with incomes at or above Medicaid thresholds. 17 states offered pregnancy-related services using SCHIP funds, with 12 states extending coverage through unborn child SCHIP SPAs and 6 states using the \u00a71115 waiver authority. The highest income eligibility threshold for pregnant women and unborn children under SCHIP was 300% FPL. In California, the eligibility threshold for pregnant women and unborn children under SCHIP was 300% FPL. Seven states set upper-income limits at 200% FPL, while four states exceeded this limit and six states set maximum income levels below 200% FPL. Most states offering pregnancy-related services under SCHIP extended coverage to unborn children of undocumented aliens and incarcerated women. Covered services included prenatal care, labor and delivery services, and postpartum coverage. Some states offer coverage from conception through 60 days postpartum care, financed with different funding streams. Program specialists noted that despite administrative complexities, pregnancy-related care is seamless for mothers. Three states provide comprehensive coverage beyond pregnancy-related services. Some states offer comprehensive coverage for unborn children, including pregnancy-related care and associated health services like dental or mental health benefits. Postpartum care varies among states extending pregnancy coverage, with 15 states providing 60 days of postpartum care. Financing for postpartum care is done through state-only funds or SCHIP funds. CMS permits 60 days of postpartum care using SCHIP funds, despite federal regulations stating that SCHIP-financed care ends at birth. Some states provide postpartum care through the end of the month the child is born, while others only offer emergency Medicaid services. Two states offer extended family planning services as part of postnatal care. Extended family planning services and supplies are provided as part of postnatal care benefits."
