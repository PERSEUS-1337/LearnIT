    "content": "The Act titled \"National Parks Capital Improvements Act of 2001\" includes sections on short title, definitions, fundraising organization, memorandum of agreement, national park surcharge, use of bond proceeds, and administration. In this Act, key definitions include fundraising organization, memorandum of agreement, National Park Foundation, and national park, which encompasses specific parks with significant capital needs. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior and is defined in this Act. SEC. 3. FUNDRAISING ORGANIZATION. The Secretary may enter into a memorandum of agreement with an entity to act as an authorized fundraising organization for a national park. The organization shall issue taxable bonds in return for the surcharge collected for the park, abide by professional standards, be audited by the Secretary, and the United States shall not be liable for the security of the bonds issued. If the surcharge or set-aside for a national park is not imposed or reduced, the US pledges full faith and credit for payment of bonds issued by a fundraising organization and the accruing interest. The fundraising organization must enter into a memorandum of agreement detailing the bond issue amount, maturity not exceeding 20 years, per capita amount for bond repayment and administration costs, project funding at the national park, and procedures for agreement modifications. The Secretary may authorize a national park superintendent to charge a surcharge of up to $2 per individual in addition to entrance fees. This surcharge is separate from fees collected under specific acts like the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act. The Secretary may authorize a national park superintendent to charge a surcharge of up to $2 per individual in addition to entrance fees for specific programs like the national park passport program. The total amount charged or set aside may not exceed $2 per individual, and the funds collected are used to amortize bond issues, cover administration costs, and maintain a reserve. Excess funds are remitted back. Funds collected beyond what is necessary for specific programs are remitted to the National Park Foundation for the benefit of all units in the National Park System. SEC. 6. USE OF BOND PROCEEDS. Bond proceeds under this Act can be used for projects in national parks, subject to certain limitations. Projects must comply with laws governing the National Park System, the specific national park, and the general management plan. Administrative expenses cannot be covered by bond proceeds, except for interest. Interest earned on bond proceeds can be used by the fundraising organization to meet reserve requirements and cover administrative expenses related to bond management. Any excess interest not used for these purposes must be remitted to the National Park Foundation for the benefit of all units of the National Park System. The Secretary, with input from the Secretary of Treasury, will create regulations to implement the Act."
