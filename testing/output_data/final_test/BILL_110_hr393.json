When military service induction is authorized, the President determines the number of individuals based on service end strengths and recruitment feasibility. Random selection is used for military service induction. Persons subject to military service induction may also opt for civilian service if they do not volunteer for military duty. They can also volunteer for national service instead of being inducted, or request a different induction time. SEC. 104. TWO-YEAR PERIOD OF NATIONAL SERVICE.

CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION. (a) Claims as Conscientious Objector.--This section allows individuals to be exempt from combatant training and service in the uniformed services if they have sincerely held moral, ethical, or religious beliefs against participation in war.

Additionally, favorable treatment of combat pay under the Earned Income Tax Credit is made permanent. The amendment allows taxpayers to treat excluded amounts as earned income for tax purposes, effective for taxable years ending after December 31, 2006."
