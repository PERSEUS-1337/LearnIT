    "content": "The number of foreign-born people in the U.S. is at a record high, with an estimated 40 million residents, making up 12.9% of the population. The actual number of unauthorized aliens is unknown, but they fall into three main categories: visa overstays, illegal border crossings, and fraudulent document entry. Unauthorized aliens are in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act and can be subject to removal. The last major legalization program for unauthorized aliens was the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. The Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) provided LPR status to illegal aliens in the U.S. through a time-limited legalization program. Nearly 2.7 million aliens gained legal status under IRCA. The debate on comprehensive immigration reform revolves around addressing the estimated 11.7 million unauthorized aliens in the U.S., with disagreement on how to reduce this population. Some proponents advocate for large-scale legalization proposals. Some proponents of Comprehensive Immigration Reform (CIR) support large-scale legalization proposals for unauthorized residents to become Legal Permanent Residents (LPRs) under specified conditions and pay penalty fees. Others argue that immigration relief or legalization should not be considered until current laws are more reliably enforced, as it may incentivize future unauthorized migration. The CRS report presents data estimating the number of unauthorized aliens living in the United States since 1986, with varying results. The report analyzes the Current Population Survey (CPS) and the American Community Survey (ACS) to provide basic standards of comparison over time. The data do not identify immigration status but distinguish between naturalized and non-naturalized foreign-born individuals. The report analyzes data estimating the number of unauthorized aliens in the US since 1986. The most recent estimate in 2013 was 11.7 million unauthorized residents. In 1986, there were 3.2 million unauthorized aliens, dropping to 1.9 million in 1988 after IRCA. Researchers projected a net growth of 500,000 to 800,000 unauthorized aliens annually in the early 2000s. The estimated number of unauthorized alien residents in the US grew at an average of 700,000 to 800,000 annually, reaching 9.3 million by 2002. In 2007, the number peaked at 12.4 million, with an average annual growth of over 500,000. Researchers from the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Immigration Statistics published these estimates. The unauthorized resident alien population in the US increased from 8.5 million in 2000 to 11.8 million in 2007. The annual average increase was 470,000. In 2007, 35% of unauthorized residents entered in 2000 or later, with 59% from Mexico. By January 2008, the estimated unauthorized alien residents decreased to 11.6 million, marking the first decrease since 2005. The unauthorized alien population in the US increased by 37% between 2000 and 2008, with estimates varying between different studies. Steven Camarota and Karen Jensenius estimated a decrease to 10.8 million in 2009, using different data and methodology. Despite differences, conclusions were comparable to other studies. The unauthorized alien population in the US increased by 37% between 2000 and 2008. Camarota estimated 10.5 million unauthorized resident aliens in 2010, with potential undercount adjustments suggesting a true population of 11.5 million. Estimates showed a decline in unauthorized residents in 2008 and 2009, leveling off in 2010. The population of unauthorized immigrants in the US decreased from its peak in 2007, mainly due to a decrease in the number from Mexico. In 2010, the number from Mexico went down to 6.5 million from 7 million in 2007. In 2012, OIS updated their initial 2010 unauthorized estimates to 11.6 million, indicating changes in the total unauthorized population. Additionally, improvements were made in the estimates of the legally resident foreign-born population. The DHS unauthorized estimates for 2005-2009 may underestimate the unauthorized immigrant population. Despite revisions in estimates, it is unlikely that the unauthorized immigrant population increased thereafter due to various factors. Passel, Cohn, and Gonzalez-Barrera revised their estimates in 2013, showing a smaller decrease in unauthorized immigrants from 2007 to 2009. The decline in authorized resident aliens after 2007 has stalled in 2012, with suggestions that the trend may be reversing. Appendix A provides a table detailing their revised estimates. The annual March CPS provides detailed socioeconomic data not available in the monthly CPS, shedding light on traits and trends in authorized migration. Passel and Cohn's analysis for 2010 shows a similar distribution of unauthorized population by region of origin compared to 1986 data. Latin American countries (excluding Mexico) accounted for 23% of unauthorized residents in 2010, while Asia's share grew from 6% to 11% during this period. Unauthorized residents from Asia increased from 0.2 million in 1986 to 1.3 million in 2010. The unauthorized Mexican population in the United States peaked at almost 7 million in 2007 but decreased to 6.1 million in 2011. The net migration from Mexico has been decreasing for the past five years, leading to the first significant decrease in the unauthorized Mexican population in at least two decades. About one-third of the estimated 11.2 million unauthorized aliens resided in California and Texas, with other states like Florida, New York, New Jersey, and Illinois also having significant populations exceeding half a million. Passel and Cohn observed declines in unauthorized alien populations in several states from 2007 to 2010. The combined unauthorized immigrant population in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah decreased from 850,000 to 700,000 during this period. They also estimated that 16.6 million persons lived in families with unauthorized aliens in 2008. In 2008, an estimated 16.6 million people lived in families with unauthorized aliens. Additionally, there were 1.5 million unauthorized children and 4.0 million citizen children in these families. The American Community Survey (ACS) is a national survey with a larger sample size than the CPS, making it the preferred source for demographic estimates. The ACS is a primary source for data on the foreign-born population. California remained the top state for unauthorized residents in 2011 with 2.8 million, but its share decreased. Texas had 1.8 million unauthorized residents, while Florida had 740,000 with a decrease in numbers. The estimated number of unauthorized alien residents declined by 8% from 0.8 million to 0.74 million. States with the greatest percentage increases in unauthorized aliens from 2000 to 2011 were Georgia (95%), Texas (64%), North Carolina (53%), and Washington (51%). Migrants from Mexico continued to dominate the unauthorized alien population, with an increase from 4.7 million in 2000 to 6.8 million in 2011. The top 10 countries of origin represented over 80% of the unauthorized alien population in 2011. In 2011, the top source countries for unauthorized resident aliens were El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, the Philippines, India, Ecuador, Vietnam, Korea, and China. Asian nations accounted for five of the top 10 source countries. Honduras had the highest percentage increase among the top 10 countries at 132%, followed by India at 94%, Ecuador at 83%, and Guatemala at 82%. Females have been a significant minority in the unauthorized alien population for years, with over 5.3 million estimated in 2011. In 2011, unauthorized resident males outnumbered females, with males comprising 53% of the population. Unauthorized males clustered in peak working age groups, while females were more likely to be younger or older. The portion of unauthorized residents arriving from 2005 to 2010 was estimated at 14%, the lowest in decades. Mexico was a significant source, with an average of 500,000 unauthorized aliens arriving annually. The unauthorized resident alien population in the United States saw a decrease from 12.5 million in 2007 to 10.8 million in 2009. Data shows that around 500,000 unauthorized aliens from Mexico arrived annually during the period, with a total of 1.6 million coming to the US from 2005 to 2010. The rate of unauthorized migration slowed in recent years, according to the analysis by Steven Camarota and Karen Jensenius. Since 2007, the unauthorized resident alien population in the US decreased from 12.5 million to 10.8 million in 2009. Data indicates around 500,000 unauthorized Mexican aliens arrived annually, totaling 1.6 million from 2005 to 2010. The rate of unauthorized migration slowed in recent years, with a 13.4% decline in the likely illegal Mexican population since July 2007. On average, the likely illegal population decreased by 7% each month compared to the prior year, totaling a 10.9% decline from the first quarter of 2007 to 2009. The unauthorized resident alien population in the US decreased from 12.5 million to 10.8 million in 2009, with a 10.9% decline in the likely illegal population from the first quarter of 2007 to 2009. Factors contributing to unauthorized migration include job opportunities in the United States. The economic recession in the US starting in 2007 may have reduced unauthorized migration due to job opportunities being limited. Increased worksite enforcement and removals coincided with the housing downturn and recession, impacting the flow of unauthorized aliens. Political instability in sending countries is another factor affecting migration. Asylum seekers entering the US illegally have declined since FY1997, dropping by 53% through FY2009 and rising slightly since 2010. They now make up a smaller share of the unauthorized resident alien population and do not drive overall trends in unauthorized migration. Tighter border enforcement is assumed to reduce unauthorized migration, but some researchers suggest that strengthening immigration enforcement may not have the intended effect. The enactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) may have inadvertently increased the population of unauthorized resident aliens, known as the caging effect. This was due to increased penalties for illegal entry and heightened border enforcement after 9/11, which made crossing the border more difficult and incentivized those who succeeded to stay. Strengthened border security measures and increased U.S. Border Patrol agents have also had an impact on reducing illegal migrant recidivism. The increase in U.S. Border Patrol agents from 12,349 in FY2006 to 21,444 in FY2012 coincided with a leveling off of unauthorized migration. While the link between border enforcement and reduced illegal migration is not proven, it is considered a factor. Legal immigration system limitations contribute to the growth of unauthorized alien residents. Some individuals risk staying in the U.S. on expired visas. Family members often stay in the United States on expired visas or enter illegally to be with their loved ones while waiting for visas. The increase in deportations and shifts in immigration enforcement priorities may have deterred some from staying illegally. It is challenging to measure the impact of increased legal migration on reducing unauthorized residents. The Pew Research Center's 2013 estimates revised unauthorized immigrant levels, peaking at 12.2 million in 2007. The revisions smoothed out recent trends in unauthorized resident alien population estimates. According to demographers Robert Warren and Jeffrey Passel, the unauthorized resident alien population in the US grew significantly in the 1990s and early 2000s. Warren estimated 3.4 million in 1992, 5.0 million in 1996, and 7.0 million in 2000. Passel estimated 8.5 million in 2000, including those with pending petitions. Warren later revised his estimates to 3.5 million in 1990 and 5.8 million in 1996, excluding \"quasi-legal\" aliens. Warren estimated 5.0 million unauthorized resident aliens in 1996, excluding \"quasi-legal\" aliens."
