    "content": "Medicaid is a state-administered program jointly financed by states and the federal government. The state and federal shares of program costs vary based on each state's per capita income compared to the national average. States with lower per capita income pay a lower state share. Some states use intergovernmental transfers (IGTs) to finance the non-federal share of Medicaid costs, with counties able to contribute. Some states require counties to fund part of the state share of Medicaid. Financing arrangements involve hospitals or nursing homes paying the state share, which effectively increases federal Medicaid spending. These \"intergovernmental transfers\" aim to draw additional federal funds for healthcare services. The Department of Health and Human Services issued a regulation in May 2007 to tighten administrative procedures and clarify definitions related to intergovernmental transfers in Medicaid financing. This regulation aims to prevent states from effectively raising federal matching rates beyond specified levels through various financing mechanisms. The rule clarifies which units of government can participate in Medicaid payments, including state or local governmental entities with taxing authority or operated health care providers. Special purpose districts or other local governmental entities must show they are operated by a unit of government. The regulation clarifies that entities seeking Medicaid payments must demonstrate they are operated by a unit of government with taxing authority or have access to funding as an integral part of a governmental unit. Simply being reimbursed by a government entity for services is not enough to qualify as a unit of government. The rule clarifies that entities receiving Medicaid payments must be operated by a government unit with taxing authority or have access to government funding. It removes the term \"public agency\" and replaces it with \"other units of government (including Indian tribes)\" as per statutory language. Governmental entities using a Certified Public Expenditure (CPE) for Medicaid funding must submit a certification statement and have auditable documentation approved by the Secretary of HHS. The documentation for Medicaid spending must identify the spending category, explain exemptions from current law limits, show actual costs incurred, and prove funds are not from federal sources. Reports from HHS OIG and GAO have highlighted questionable Medicaid financing practices, such as upper payment limit arrangements. Medicaid payments to public hospitals and other long-term care providers are set at inflated rates, generating federal matching funds. Excess payments violate rules on efficiency and economy, leading to proposed limits on reimbursements to government-operated providers. Indian Health Service and tribal facilities are exempt from these limits. The Secretary must determine allowable Medicaid costs and ensure they are reasonable. The regulation proposes limits on Medicaid payments to government-operated providers to prevent overpayments. It requires auditable documentation for costs, annual cost reports, and eliminates excessive payments. Public providers are prohibited from receiving Medicaid payments and transferring them back to state agencies. The rule aims to ensure providers retain full Medicaid payments and prohibits transferring payments back to state agencies. HHS estimated a $3.87 billion reduction in federal outlays over five years, while states projected a loss of over $21 billion in federal funds for the same period. Some states, providers, and advocacy groups oppose a rule that would significantly reduce Medicaid payments, leading to concerns about filling the funding gap and implications for beneficiaries and providers. Critics view the rule as CMS overstepping its authority by limiting intergovernmental transfers, despite Congress allowing such transfers. Governors have expressed concerns in a letter to Congress, urging a delay in implementing the rule. In 2008, governors urged Congress to delay implementing new Medicaid rules, fearing cost shifts to states during fiscal challenges. A lawsuit was filed against CMS for overstepping authority in limiting intergovernmental transfers. The court was asked to reject a rule by CMS on three grounds: overstepping authority in limiting intergovernmental transfers, Congress barring cost limits on Medicaid payments to governmental providers, and improper issuance of the rule. Litigants claim the rule restricts states' financing options for Medicaid, limits governmental entities that can make transfers, and unfairly limits payments to public providers compared to private providers. The court rejected a rule by CMS that imposed cost limits on Medicaid payments to governmental providers, stating it went against Congressional intent and established Medicaid payment policies. A moratorium prevented CMS from implementing the rule, and a ruling in 2008 found the claim compelling, leading to the rule being vacated. The court rejected a CMS rule imposing cost limits on Medicaid payments to governmental providers. A moratorium prevented rule implementation, and Congress supported this by enacting legislation. The moratoria on various Medicaid rules would increase federal spending by $105 million in FY2009. Cost estimates for each individual regulation were not provided."
