    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Alaska Wetlands Conservation Act\". The Congress finds that Alaska has lost less than one-tenth of 1 percent of its wetlands since the 1780s, with more wetlands in Alaska than all other states combined. 88 percent of Alaska's wetlands are publicly owned. Approximately 98 percent of Alaskan communities are located in or near wetlands, with a significant portion of federally designated wilderness, park, and refuge lands in Alaska. The state was granted 104,000,000 acres for economic development at statehood, and Alaska Natives received around 43,000,000 acres for their use. Approximately 75 percent of nonmountainous areas in Alaska are wetlands, causing delays in infrastructure development. The 1899 Rivers and Harbors Act regulated dredge spoils in navigable waters, excluding wetlands. The 1972 Clean Water Act expanded Federal jurisdiction over wetlands by redefining \"navigable waters.\" The wetlands regulatory program was expanded through regulatory action to include isolated wetlands, leading to property rights intrusions in Alaska beyond what Congress intended. The wetlands regulatory program in Alaska has placed unnecessary burdens on various stakeholders and inhibited reasonable community growth and resource development. This has led to frustration among local governments and organizations due to interference with community development. The wetlands regulatory program in Alaska has caused significant property value loss for individual landowners and a decrease in tax revenue for Alaskan communities. This is due to regulations that do not consider the large percentage of conserved wetlands in Alaska. Amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act are being proposed. Amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act include establishing national policies on wetlands conservation, balancing economic impacts, and preventing regulatory taking of private property. The policy also encourages localized wetlands planning and provides flexibility for wetlands permits issuance. The amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act provide greater flexibility for wetlands permits issuance in states with conserved wetlands. Compensatory mitigation for wetlands development in these states shall not be required. Additionally, guidelines for disposal sites in these states may include reasonable requirements but not mitigation for wetlands loss. The amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act allow for greater flexibility in wetlands permits issuance in states with conserved wetlands. General permits can be issued on a statewide basis for certain activities in these states without the need for compensatory mitigation. Reasonable requirements for disposal sites may be included, but not mitigation for wetlands loss. The amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act provide flexibility in wetlands permits issuance in states with conserved wetlands. Guidelines for disposal sites must be at least 10 acres in size and not more stringent than state guidelines. Nonprohibited discharges include wetlands associated with airport safety and log transfer facilities. The amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act allow for flexibility in wetlands permits issuance in states with conserved wetlands. Definitions for terms like \"conserved wetlands\" are provided for clarity within the Act. The term 'conserved wetlands' refers to wetlands in federal conservation systems or similar state/local systems. 'Economic base lands' are those owned by Alaska Native entities or the State of Alaska. A 'State with substantial conserved wetlands' is defined as a state with significant conserved wetlands. The term 'State with substantial conserved wetlands' refers to a state that has significant conserved wetlands, either based on a ratio of conserved wetlands to converted wetlands or as determined by the Secretary of the Army. Alaska Native and State of Alaska lands have exceptions to wetlands conservation regulations. The Secretary shall issue a permit for discharge of dredged or fill material into navigable waters on economic base lands if it complies with guidelines no more stringent than those for disposal sites in states with conserved wetlands. The guidelines must consider the requirements of subparagraph (B) and balance standards and policies. The Secretary shall issue general permits for activities on economic base lands in Alaska, prioritizing the needs of Alaska Natives and considering the value of conserved wetlands in the state. These activities relate to developing rural Alaska community infrastructure. The Secretary shall issue general permits for activities on economic base lands in Alaska, prioritizing the needs of Alaska Natives and considering the value of conserved wetlands in the state. This includes infrastructure development for rural Alaska communities such as roads, communication sites, fuel storage sites, landfills, housing, hospitals, medical clinics, and schools. The Secretary must consult with and assist Alaska Natives and the State of Alaska in the promulgation and administration of policies and regulations."
