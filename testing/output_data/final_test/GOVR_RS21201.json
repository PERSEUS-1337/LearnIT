    "content": "In the 1980s, EPA found that many of the 2.2 million underground storage tanks in the US, mainly storing petroleum, were leaking or at risk of leaking. This posed a significant threat to groundwater contamination, as 50% of the US population relies on groundwater for drinking water. In response, Congress established a program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act to prevent, detect, and clean up leaks from underground storage tanks. EPA was directed to set standards for tank design, installation, leak detection, and spill prevention. The EPA phased in tank regulations over a 10-year period (1988-1998) to address the large and diverse universe of regulated tanks, including small businesses. Strict standards for new tanks were implemented in 1988, with all tanks required to comply with leak detection regulations by late 1993. Tanks installed before 1988 had to be upgraded, replaced, or closed by December 22, 1998. Congress established a response program for leaking petroleum USTs in 1986 through the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act, authorizing EPA and states to respond to spills and leaks. The 1986 amendment to the Internal Revenue Code created the Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Trust Fund to assist EPA and states in responding to leaking USTs when owners/operators do not clean up. Funds are used for oversight, enforcement, corrective actions, emergencies, and cost recovery. Responsible parties are usually successful in performing cleanups, with costs covered by state funds, the party, or private insurance. EPA was directed to establish financial responsibility requirements for USTs. The 1986 law directed EPA to establish financial responsibility requirements for UST owners and operators to cover costs of corrective action and compensating third parties for damages. Tank owners had to demonstrate $1 million financial responsibility or rely on state assurance funds. State funds reimburse financially solvent owners for cleanup costs, funded by tank and petroleum fees. State funds, funded by tank fees and petroleum fees, have provided more cleanup funds than the federal LUST Trust Fund. A 2009 survey showed that states had contributed over $17 billion for leaking tank site cleanups. In 2009, state funds collected $1.38 billion in revenues, paid out $875 million, and had outstanding claims of $2.69 billion. The average cost to clean up a leaking tank site was $127,000, with the number of sites with claims increasing annually. Some states have transitioned to private insurance, while others have extended their funds' sunset date to address the backlog of leaking tanks. The LUST Trust Fund, funded by a motor fuels tax, earned $107 million in interest and $169 million in tax receipts in FY2009. The fund had an unobligated balance of $3.0 billion at the start of FY2010. Congress appropriated $72 million annually to support the LUST response program. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorized new uses of the trust fund for leak prevention and detection activities. In the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, Congress allocated $105.8 million from the LUST Trust Fund for cleanup and leak prevention programs. EPA typically gives 81% of the fund to states through cooperative agreements, with 4% for Indian lands and 15% for agency responsibilities. States use grants to hire staff for overseeing corrective actions by responsible parties. EPA must allot at least 80% of the fund to states under EPAct. In FY2009, EPA allocated $63 million through state cooperative agreements and tribes for cleanup programs, with $11 million for its responsibilities. An additional $34.4 million from the trust fund was provided for state and tribal grants for UST leak prevention. EPA's priorities in the LUST program include reducing confirmed releases, promoting cost-effective cleanups, assisting Indian tribes, and tackling complex sites. Since the federal underground storage tank program began, over 1.7 million substandard tanks have been closed, reducing leaks significantly. As of September 2009, 611,449 tanks remained in service, with 488,496 releases confirmed and 463,060 cleanups initiated. About 79.5% of reported releases have been cleaned up. EPA's recent work includes evaluating tank compatibility with alternative fuels and studying ethanol and biodiesel blends. During FY2009, 7,168 releases were confirmed, and 12,944 cleanups were completed. Despite progress in cleaning up releases, there is still a significant backlog of 100,165 sites requiring remedial action. States estimated in 2007 that $12 billion was needed to remediate 54,000 tank sites without viable owners. Additionally, about 29% of underground storage tanks were not being operated or maintained properly, increasing the risk of leaks. EPA had estimated that by FY2001, 89% of tanks had upgraded equipment to meet federal requirements. The GAO reported that USTs were not properly operated or maintained, leading to an increased risk of leaks and groundwater contamination. Only 19 states conducted physical inspections of all tanks every three years, hindering the evaluation of the tank program's effectiveness. EPA revised compliance definitions to focus on proper operation and maintenance. By the end of FY2009, 79.3% of UST facilities were compliant with release prevention regulations, 76.3% with leak detection regulations, and 66.4% with combined requirements. EPA aimed to address program weaknesses and improve compliance. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 added new requirements to the UST regulatory program for EPA, states, and UST owners and operators to improve leak prevention. Gasoline additive MTBE became a new problem as it was detected at LUST sites and in drinking water supplies. MTBE moves through soil and water rapidly, posing environmental risks. MTBE is a gasoline component that moves quickly through soil and water, making it likely to contaminate drinking water supplies. It is costly to remediate and can render water undrinkable even in small amounts due to its strong taste and odor. EPA classifies MTBE as a possible human carcinogen, and many states have set drinking water standards, cleanup guidelines, and bans on its use in gasoline. At least 25 states require testing for MTBE in ground water. The use of MTBE in gasoline has led to contamination issues in ground water at LUST sites across many states. The 109th Congress addressed this issue in EPAct by revising UST leak prevention programs and extending the motor fuels tax. There was a provision to protect manufacturers and distributors of fuels containing MTBE, which was opposed by water utilities and local government associations. The 109th Congress addressed MTBE contamination issues in ground water by revising UST leak prevention programs and extending the motor fuels tax. A provision to protect manufacturers and distributors of fuels containing MTBE was opposed, leading to the repeal of the Clean Air Act oxygenated fuel requirement and the imposition of a renewable fuels mandate. The 109th Congress addressed MTBE contamination by revising UST leak prevention programs and extending the motor fuels tax. The CAA amendment eliminated the oxygen requirement in gasoline, reducing MTBE use significantly. Title XV, Subtitle B, of EPAct included the Underground Storage Tank Compliance Act (USTCA), which added leak prevention and enforcement provisions to the UST regulatory program. Compliance inspections of tanks are now required every three years, along with other new requirements for states, EPA, and tank owners. The USTCA authorized funding for tank maintenance, spill response, and compliance reports on government-owned tanks. It also allocated funds for leak prevention requirements, state programs, and cleanup efforts for MTBE and other fuel leaks. Congress provided new funding authorities under EPAct to address MTBE and other fuel leaks, allowing the use of the LUST Trust Fund for prevention activities. Funding requests for FY2008 included $72.4 million for cleanup activities from the trust fund and $22.3 million for prevention activities from general revenues. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended similar funding allocations, while the House report noted that prevention grants could be funded from the LUST Trust Fund. The House approved $117.9 million from the LUST Trust Fund for cleanup and leak prevention activities, including tank inspections. This amount included additional funding for LUST cooperative agreements and state UST grants authorized by EPAct. The House rejected EPA's request to revise state inspection requirements. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, provided $105.8 million from the Trust Fund for UST and LUST programs. EPA requested $72.3 million from the trust fund for the LUST cleanup program in FY2009. EPA requested $72.3 million from the trust fund for the LUST cleanup program in FY2009. Funds were also requested under the STAG account ($22.8 million) to help states meet new EPAct responsibilities. The 110th Congress deferred final action on FY2009 appropriations to the 111th Congress, extending funding for EPA programs at FY2008 levels through March 6, 2009. The 111th Congress finalized appropriations to support agency programs for FY2009. In FY2009, Congress provided $112.6 million from the trust fund for EPA programs, including $72.3 million for the LUST cleanup program and $20.3 million for grants to states. An additional $200 million was allocated for the LUST cleanup program through the ARRA. These funds are used for overseeing the cleanup of releases from underground storage tanks containing petroleum products. The stimulus act waived the usual 10% state match requirement for the LUST program and specified that EPA may use no more than 1.5% of the funds for program management and oversight. For FY2010, $113.1 million was approved from the LUST Trust Fund, with $78.67 million for cleanup activities and $34.43 million for leak prevention and detection provisions. Congress also provided $2.5 million from general revenues for state grants to cover remaining responsibilities not supported by trust fund revenues. Stable funding in recent years has allowed states to plan effectively. The LUST Program has been supported by stable funding in recent years, allowing states to plan and administer their programs. The appropriations from the LUST Trust Fund have increased since the enactment of EPAct, but still remain below the amount of interest earned annually on the fund. The funding now supports a broader range of activities, including both the LUST cleanup program and UST leak prevention program. The LUST cleanup program funding has not significantly increased in recent years, with states potentially seeking more funding from Congress. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act provided a $200 million boost to the program. An emerging issue is the impact of ethanol and biofuels on storage tank infrastructure, as ethanol is more corrosive than gasoline. Renewable fuel mandates present new technical challenges for underground storage tanks and fuel infrastructure. The House passed H.R. 547 to address concerns about underground storage tanks not designed for higher ethanol blends. The bill required EPA to establish a research program on materials for biofuels compatibility with existing infrastructure. The Senate did not act on the bill, but EISA included an amendment allowing EPA to regulate fuels and additives for water and air quality protection. The EPA is authorized to regulate fuels and additives to protect water and air quality. Legislation has been introduced to address compatibility issues with higher ethanol blends in fuel storage and vehicle engines. Priority research areas for EPA include evaluating fuel storage tank compatibility with alternative fuels. The EPA's UST program focuses on evaluating fuel storage tank compatibility with alternative fuels like ethanol and biodiesel blends."
