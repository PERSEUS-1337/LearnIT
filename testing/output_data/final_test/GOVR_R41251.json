    "content": "Russia has concerns about U.S. ballistic missile defense programs potentially undermining its strategic nuclear forces and stability. The United States argues that its BMD programs are not capable of intercepting Russia's ballistic missiles. The New START Treaty, signed in 2010, aims to further reduce and limit strategic offensive arms. The New START Treaty, signed in 2010, awaits Senate consideration and would expire 10 years after entering into force. It addresses the interrelationship between strategic offensive and defensive arms, recognizing the importance as nuclear arms are reduced. The New START Treaty, signed in 2010, addresses the interrelationship between strategic offensive and defensive arms. Russia and the United States issued unilateral statements clarifying their positions on missile defense. Russia stated that the Treaty can only be viable if the US refrains from developing its missile defense capabilities in a way that threatens Russia's strategic nuclear forces. The US stated that its missile defense systems are not intended to affect the strategic balance with Russia. The United States missile defense systems are used to defend against limited missile launches and regional threats. Russia's Foreign Minister stated that the Treaty preamble is legally binding, and each side reserves the right to make decisions on strategic offensive arms cuts. Some in the US question the implications of this statement. Some in the United States question if the New START Treaty could be terminated due to disagreements over U.S. ballistic missile defenses. The Obama Administration views the treaty preamble as legally binding but asserts it imposes no limits on missile defense or obligations on the U.S. Russia's unilateral statement on missile defenses is a point of contention. Secretary of State Ellen Tauscher clarified that Russia's statement on missile defenses is not legally binding and will not restrict U.S. missile defense programs. However, concerns have been raised about Russia's threat to withdraw from New START impacting U.S. missile defense decisions. Senator Jeff Sessions expressed worries about the potential negative impact on U.S. missile defense choices. This issue is likely to be debated in the Senate regarding the differing views between the U.S. and Russia on the relationship between New START and U.S. ballistic missile defense programs. During the debate on the New START Treaty, the Soviet Union sought to link limits on offensive nuclear weapons with limits on ballistic missile defenses. The United States did not agree to the Soviet proposals, leading to unsuccessful negotiations on modifications to the ABM Treaty in the 1990s. Russia continued to object to U.S. ballistic missile defense plans. The report provides a historical review of the relationship between ballistic missile defenses and offensive arms control treaties, focusing on the negotiations between the United States and Soviet Union during the START Treaty in the 1980s and 1990s. It also summarizes U.S. missile defense policy and spending over the decades. The recent record on how the New START negotiations addressed ballistic missile defense issues is reviewed, with observations on the historical context. Russia's concerns about U.S. missile defense programs stem from the fear that increasing U.S. missile defense interceptors while Russia reduces its offensive weapons could lead to a situation where the U.S. could launch a first strike against Russia while protecting itself from retaliation. This could prompt Russia to increase its offensive forces to ensure its ability to penetrate U.S. defenses. Russia is concerned about U.S. missile defense programs potentially leading to a first strike scenario. This could prompt Russia to increase its offensive forces to penetrate U.S. defenses, potentially requiring withdrawal from the New START Treaty. The U.S. has shifted its nuclear posture away from viewing Russia as a major threat, focusing instead on emerging threats and adversaries. This Cold War offense-defense scenario is not relevant in the current strategic environment. The United States is pursuing missile defenses to defend allies and forces against regional threats, not to counter hundreds of Russian missiles. This strategic stability model was relevant during the Cold War but is not applicable in the current strategic environment. Strategic stability during the Cold War influenced arms control agreements by emphasizing the importance of both sides having enough surviving forces to launch a devastating retaliatory attack. This concept aimed to deter conflict by ensuring that neither side would gain an advantage from initiating a conflict. During the Cold War, strategic stability emphasized the need for both sides to have enough forces for a devastating retaliatory attack, deterring conflict. This model relies on the balance between offensive and defensive forces, assuming each side can retaliate after a first strike and lacks the ability to impede the other's retaliatory capabilities. Missile defense systems could enhance stability by protecting against first strikes and ensuring both sides have enough weapons for retaliation. During the Cold War, strategic stability relied on the balance between offensive and defensive forces to deter conflict. Missile defense systems could enhance stability by protecting against first strikes and ensuring both sides have enough weapons for retaliation. The model of strategic stability linked reductions in offensive weapons with limits on ballistic missile defenses in the arms control process of the 1970s. During the Cold War, strategic stability relied on the balance between offensive and defensive forces to deter conflict. The arms control process of the 1970s limited the deployment of ballistic missile defenses to protect against first strikes. The 1972 ABM Treaty restricted the deployment of defenses to only one limited system, while subsequent agreements aimed to freeze numbers of offensive missiles. Efforts to limit offensive forces were undermined by the development of ballistic missiles with multiple warheads. During the Cold War, strategic stability relied on the balance between offensive and defensive forces to deter conflict. The ABM and SALT Treaties limited ballistic missile defenses and offensive forces, but analysts debated whether reductions in offensive forces and limits on defenses could enhance stability. Some believed robust missile defenses could lead to further reductions in offensive weapons, promoting strategic stability by preventing surprise first strikes. President Ronald Reagan proposed the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) in 1983 to enhance strategic stability by reducing the need for offensive forces and promoting a balance between offense and defense. Reagan envisioned a global missile defense system to protect against Soviet missile attacks and offered to share it with the Soviet Union to prevent destabilization from unilateral defenses. The United States and the Soviet Union began negotiations in Geneva in 1985, known as the Nuclear and Space Talks (NST), to address defense systems, intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF), and strategic nuclear weapons. The negotiations reflected competing views on strategic stability and the offense/defense relationship, influencing the proposals and structure of arms control talks. The United States and Soviet Union had different views on the transition to a world without nuclear weapons, particularly regarding the role of missile defenses. President Reagan's \"New Strategic Concept\" outlined three phases for arms reduction, including a radical reduction in nuclear weapons and a transition away from reliance on them. President Gorbachev also proposed a three-phase plan for nuclear disarmament, including reducing strategic nuclear weapons by half by the early 1990s, dismantling all nuclear weapons, and joining in a nuclear test ban, with the ultimate goal of dismantling all nuclear weapons by the year 2000. This plan hinged on the commitment to the ABM Treaty by the United States and Soviet Union. The Reagan and Gorbachev visions for nuclear disarmament differed in their approach, with Reagan's plan dependent on developing SDI for strategic defenses, while Gorbachev argued halting SDI was necessary for disarmament. These differences were evident in their negotiating positions during the Defense and Space Talks. President Reagan proposed a 10-year commitment to the ABM Treaty, delaying SDI deployment while reducing offensive weapons by 50%. Gorbachev agreed to reduce nuclear weapons by 50% in five years and eliminate them within 10 years, with some differences in details. President Gorbachev insisted on linking offensive reductions to resolving differences over the SDI program. He proposed restricting SDI research to the laboratory for 10 years, unlike President Reagan's unilateral withdrawal plan. No agreement was reached on offensive reductions or SDI deployment at Reykjav\u00edk. At Reykjav\u00edk, Presidents Reagan and Gorbachev failed to reach an agreement on offensive reductions or missile defense. Gorbachev wanted to limit SDI research to the lab for 10 years, but Reagan refused strict limits. Talks on offensive reductions and SDI were seen as separate by the US. In 1987, the Soviet Union agreed to pursue INF Treaty negotiations separately but linked progress on strategic offensive forces with defense and space talks. In January 1988, Soviet negotiators submitted a draft protocol on Defense and Space to the draft START Treaty, proposing a 10-year ban on SDI deployment and a mutual agreement for the treaty's continuation. The START Treaty would cease if either party violated the ABM Treaty or Protocol. The US submitted separate documents for negotiations on defense and space weapons and strategic arms reductions, rejecting any link between them. The Soviet Union insisted on linking progress in offensive arms reductions to missile defenses. The Soviet Union insisted on a 50% reduction in offensive forces only if a Defense and Space agreement was reached. They dropped the link between START and Defense and Space Weapons during a meeting in 1989. The US refused to include a statement recognizing the Soviet Union's right to withdraw from START if the ABM Treaty was violated. The Soviet Union eventually withdrew this insistence and issued a unilateral statement in 1991. The Soviet Union threatened to withdraw from START if the US withdrew from the ABM Treaty, citing the need for compliance with both treaties. The US disagreed with this stance and issued its own unilateral statement. The US disagreed with the Soviet Union's threat to withdraw from START if the US withdrew from the ABM Treaty. The US stated that exercising its legal rights under the ABM Treaty would not justify withdrawal from START. The US emphasized that withdrawal from START could only be justified by extraordinary events jeopardizing a Party's supreme interest, and Soviet claims lacked legal or military foundation. The ABM Treaty has been amended and clarified by subsequent agreements, and future negotiations will continue. The ABM Treaty could undergo significant changes through current and future negotiations between the Parties, without affecting the effectiveness of the START Treaty. The United States rejected the Soviet Union's threat to withdraw from START if the US deployed missile defenses, emphasizing ongoing negotiations for changes to the ABM Treaty. During Senate hearings on the START Treaty in 1992, concerns were raised about the impact of U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty on negotiations for deeper reductions in offensive weapons. Secretary of State James Baker and START negotiators believed that such a withdrawal could derail these negotiations. During the 1980s, the Soviet Union expressed objections to U.S. missile defense goals and the SDI program but backed away from these demands to preserve progress in limiting offensive weapons. They initially wanted a missile defense agreement as a Protocol to the treaty on offensive nuclear weapons, but the United States refused. The Soviet Union initially wanted a missile defense agreement as a Protocol to the treaty on offensive nuclear weapons, but the United States refused. The Soviet Union settled for a unilateral statement expressing its view on the relationship between START and the ABM Treaty, prioritizing a treaty limiting strategic offensive arms over legally binding limits on U.S. missile defenses. The United States prioritized protecting its missile defense programs over completing a treaty limiting offensive weapons. During the 1990s, the United States focused more on expanding its missile defense programs rather than completing a treaty limiting offensive weapons, resisting Soviet efforts to link the two. Russia objected to US missile defense plans, insisting on the importance of the ABM Treaty for strategic stability. However, when the US withdrew from the ABM Treaty in 2002, Russia did not withdraw from START or mention the linkage between the two treaties. Russia continued to participate in negotiations with the United States on the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty, agreeing to further reduce its strategic offensive weapons despite US plans for missile defense. This pattern of priorities persisted in the New START Treaty talks, with Russia insisting on addressing missile defense concerns before accepting further reductions in offensive forces. Putin expressed concerns about the U.S. missile defense system disrupting the balance of power, leading to potential aggressiveness. Russia insisted on deploying more offensive weapons to counter this threat. Missile defense remained a key issue in negotiations, with Russia fearing interceptors near its territory could undermine its nuclear deterrent. The United States maintained that the interceptors were not capable of intercepting long-range missiles. During negotiations, the United States and Russia debated the issue of missile defenses. The U.S. insisted that reductions in offensive weapons and missile defenses were separate matters. President Obama even considered walking away from the talks due to Russian attempts to link the two issues. Ultimately, the treaty did not include limits on missile defenses, with Russia settling for a unilateral statement outlining its concerns. This decision came after Russian political leaders rejected the military's push for binding limits on missile defenses. The United States prioritized protecting its ballistic missile defense programs over reaching an agreement on offensive nuclear weapons limits during negotiations with Russia. Russia, on the other hand, prioritized completing the treaty limiting offensive nuclear weapons over imposing limits on U.S. missile defense systems. The Reagan Administration increased funding for ballistic missile defenses in 1983 to protect against a potential Soviet nuclear strike. The Reagan Administration prioritized ballistic missile defense programs to protect against a Soviet nuclear strike. The Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) aimed to develop a global BMD capability with land-, sea-, air-, and space-based sensors and interceptors. Despite scaling back objectives due to cost and technical challenges, a \"Phase 1\" deployment was announced in 1987 to disrupt rather than fully protect against a Soviet nuclear attack. The Reagan Administration sought to enhance nuclear deterrence with Phase 1 of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), despite opposition from Congress to significant BMD deployments that could impact strategic stability with the Soviet Union. Congress supported BMD research and development but not tactical or theater BMD efforts. The administration aimed to test space-based and exotic BMD technologies, such as lasers, under a new interpretation of the ABM Treaty. The Reagan Administration sought to enhance nuclear deterrence with Phase 1 of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), testing space-based and exotic BMD technologies like lasers under a new interpretation of the ABM Treaty. Despite objections from Congress, President George H.W. Bush later responded to the high costs and technical challenges of Phase I by opening negotiations with the Soviets to modify or replace the ABM Treaty. After the fall of the Soviet empire, the United States shifted its focus on missile defense to Global Protection Against Limited Strikes (GPALS), aiming to defend against small accidental or unauthorized attacks. The George H.W. Bush Administration envisioned a system with up to 1,000 land-based interceptors and possibly 1,000 space-based interceptors and sensors to protect the US, allies, and troops deployed abroad. The George H.W. Bush Administration planned a missile defense system with 1,000 space-based interceptors and sensors. Negotiations were held with Russia to replace the ABM Treaty. Congress approved the deployment of a modest ABM Treaty compliant BMD system after Desert Storm. The Clinton Administration suspended negotiations to discuss changes to the ABM Treaty and scaled back efforts to develop a national missile defense system. The 1993 Bottom-up Review concluded that there was no military requirement for such a system, leading to a focus on theater missile defenses instead. The Clinton Administration shifted focus from national missile defense to theater missile defenses, cutting national missile defense budget and increasing theater BMD funding. All BMD programs were to comply with the ABM Treaty. The Missile Defense Act of 1995 declared the policy to develop affordable and effective theater missile defenses. The Clinton Administration shifted focus from national missile defense to theater missile defenses, cutting national missile defense budget and increasing theater BMD funding. The Missile Defense Act of 1995 declared the policy to develop affordable and effective theater missile defenses, including a multiple-site national missile defense system that can be augmented over time. Considerations were made for negotiations with Russia and the possibility of withdrawing from the ABM Treaty if necessary. Intelligence estimates suggested no long-range ballistic threat to the US for the next 10-15 years. The Clinton Administration adjusted its BMD efforts and adopted a new 3+3 strategy for long-range missile defense. The strategy involved developing an NMD system to defend against attacks from hostile nations or accidental missile launches. Development and potential deployment were planned within a six-year timeframe, with consideration for the ABM Treaty. The Clinton Administration adjusted its BMD efforts with a new 3+3 strategy for long-range missile defense, aiming to develop an NMD system within a six-year timeframe while considering the ABM Treaty. Congress increased funding for TMD and NMD in response to concerns about long-range threats from rogue states, supported by the 1998 Rumsfeld Commission Report highlighting the evolving ballistic missile threat. In 1998, a North Korean ballistic missile test prompted the need for a National Missile Defense (NMD) system against countries like North Korea, Iraq, and Iran. The National Missile Defense Act of 1999 was passed by Congress to deploy an NMD system capable of defending against limited ballistic missile attacks. The Minority in the Senate Armed Services Committee opposed the act, arguing it was premature and could undermine current defense efforts. The National Missile Defense Act of 1999 was opposed by the Minority in the Senate Armed Services Committee, who argued that deploying an NMD system before negotiating changes to the ABM Treaty could harm U.S.-Russian relations and nuclear proliferation efforts. In September 2000, President Clinton decided not to deploy a national missile defense system due to concerns about technology and operational effectiveness. President George W. Bush later increased funding for BMD programs and withdrew from the ABM Treaty in June 2002, citing a different strategic environment from when the Treaty was signed in 1972. The ABM Treaty was signed in 1972 when Soviet forces posed a threat to the US. By 2002, the focus shifted to the proliferation of ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction from other countries, especially rogue states and terrorism post-9/11. The Russian government did not oppose the US decision to withdraw from the Treaty. In 2002, President Bush announced plans to deploy a limited NMD system against long-range missiles by 2004, with initial deployment in Alaska. Critics raised concerns about testing and technology issues with the system. The Bush Administration emphasized land- and sea-based BMD against short-range ballistic missile threats and sought to deploy long-range BMD capability in Europe, which stalled due to delays in agreements. The decision to abrogate the ABM Treaty allowed integration of multiple systems into a global U.S. BMD capability, limited by funding and technology advancements in the 2000s. The U.S. military has a diverse assortment of BMD interceptor systems deployed globally, which are now integrated to increase BMD potential. This capability is a critical element of U.S. military strategy, evolving under the Obama Administration to counter ballistic missile threats from countries like Iran and North Korea. In 2009, the Obama Administration canceled the Bush plan for long-range interceptors in Poland and a radar facility in the Czech Republic, prioritizing the expansion of existing BMD elements in response to new assessments of Iranian capabilities. Defense Secretary Gates announced regional BMD enhancements. The Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) for regional ballistic missile defense (BMD) capabilities, announced by Defense Secretary Gates, utilizes existing BMD sensors and interceptors like Patriot, THAAD, and Aegis. The PAA aims to be more responsive to Iranian short- and medium-range ballistic missile proliferation, with plans to evolve over the next decade to include BMD against intermediate- and long-range Iranian missiles. Future BMD capabilities against Iranian ICBMs may be developed and deployed in Europe post-2020, potentially impacting U.S.-Russian strategic relations. The Pentagon's BMD Review in February 2010 outlined key priorities for shaping BMD policy and programs, demonstrating strong commitment to BMD. These priorities include defending the homeland against limited ballistic missile attacks, protecting allies and partners from regional missile threats, ensuring new capabilities undergo realistic testing before deployment, maintaining long-term fiscal sustainability, adapting to changing threats, and leading international missile defense efforts. The U.S. will lead international efforts for missile defense, balancing strategic priorities and seeking to deploy global BMD capabilities. In the 1980s, the Reagan Administration envisioned reducing reliance on nuclear weapons through BMD, while the Soviet Union believed in reducing offensive nuclear weapons first. Congress limited BMD expansion beyond the ABM Treaty. The role of dampening efforts to expand BMD beyond the ABM Treaty was significant. Funding for TMD increased after Desert Storm, with support from Congress and the Pentagon. TMD was initially focused on countering Soviet short-range ballistic missiles but later expanded to address global proliferation of short-range missiles. Funding for NMD efforts was constrained during this time. Funding support for NMD efforts was influenced by the ABM Treaty, with administrations seeking compliance while also pursuing changes. Program reductions after START were due to a \"peace dividend\" mindset and the Bottom-up Review. After the fall of the Soviet Empire, the Bottom-up Review led to reduced NMD efforts due to long-range missile threat assessments. Secretary Aspin's proposal did not mention START or offensive arms control issues. However, Congress disagreed with the threat assessment from rogue states and increased NMD budgets, which rose steadily during the START 1 era. BMD funding support has evolved since President Reagan, stabilizing under George H.W. Bush, declining under Clinton, and rising steadily since the mid-1990s. Cuts to the President's Budget for BMD in the 1980s and early 1990s were partly due to Congress's actions. Budget cuts for BMD in the 1980s and early 1990s were influenced by Congress to avoid destabilizing the U.S.-Soviet nuclear relationship and comply with the ABM Treaty. Funding changes in the early 1990s under Clinton may have reflected a desire to adhere to the treaty. Shifts in program goals were also impacted by the end of the Cold War. The focus on ballistic missile proliferation outside Russia shaped BMD direction from the mid-1990s onwards. Congressional funding for NMD increased in the late 1990s, aligning executive and congressional interests in BMD, especially after 9/11 and withdrawal from the ABM Treaty. The funding for Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) has had broad support regardless of political party control, especially since the decision to withdraw from the ABM Treaty. All U.S. BMD capabilities have become integrated into a global system, essential for national security interests. The Obama Administration's plan to counter Iranian ICBMs in the future may pose challenges. The Obama administration plans to deploy regional ICBM interceptors in Europe after 2020 in response to a potential Iranian threat. This move may provoke opposition from Russia, known for its critical stance on U.S. missile defense plans. Despite historical trends showing increased U.S. spending on missile defense programs, the New START Treaty would be nearing its end by the time these capabilities are fully developed. The U.S. political commitment to missile defenses increased during the 1990s, leading to the withdrawal from the ABM Treaty in 2002. Despite threats to withdraw from START, Russia remained a party and negotiated further reductions in strategic offensive weapons. The future of U.S. and Russian relations may be influenced by the New START Treaty and potential missile defense programs. Some critics of START have raised concerns about the treaty's 10-year duration potentially conflicting with future administrations' preferences on arms control and missile defense. The U.S. commitment to missile defense evolved during the 1990s, with shifts in focus from strategic to theater missile defenses. President Reagan and President George H.W. Bush supported missile defenses, but Congress was less enthusiastic. The Clinton Administration initially prioritized theater missile defenses due to Desert Storm and short-range ballistic missile threats. The Clinton Administration promoted an NMD research and development program for short-range ballistic missile proliferation, requiring modification of the ABM Treaty. The U.S. commitment to missile defense has broadened politically since the 1990s, with the Obama Administration and Congress supporting ballistic missile defense programs. The Obama Administration supported ballistic missile defense programs without accepting Russian proposals for limits. The U.S. commitment to missile defense is expected to continue, while Russia is unlikely to abandon New START in the near future due to aging missile forces. Russia's missile forces are aging, and they struggle to replace or maintain the numbers of missiles allowed by the New START Treaty. The treaty is crucial for Russia to maintain parity with the United States in strategic offensive forces. The U.S. prioritizes ballistic missile defense programs, while Russia focuses on equal limits on offensive forces. The New START Treaty focuses more on limiting U.S. and Russian offensive forces rather than reducing U.S. ballistic missile defense programs."
