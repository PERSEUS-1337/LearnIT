This report examines past instances of government aid to troubled industries, detailing the assistance structure, Congress's role, and eventual costs. Assistance for distressed industries, or \"government bailouts,\" has taken various forms and occurred under different circumstances. The report examines past government aid to troubled industries, detailing assistance structures, Congress's role, and costs. Assistance for distressed industries has varied in form and occurred under different circumstances, sometimes driven by external shocks or long-term trends. Examples include loan guarantees, asset purchases, and regulatory changes, with assistance widely available to industry firms and motivated primarily by extraordinary circumstances. The report details government assistance to troubled industries, with data on costs and income. Some cases saw government recouping assistance through fees, interest, and repayments, while others had no repayment arrangements. Repayment doesn't guarantee government profit as interest payments were incurred. Government assistance provided under the assumption of repayment exposes the government to credit loss risk. Economists compare government terms to private investor requirements to determine if full compensation was received. Adjustments may show taxpayers were not fully compensated, especially during financial crises. This standard is more demanding than the government's usual cost measurement for federal assistance. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has assessed the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) for borrowing costs and market risk, but not for other government assistance. The final disposition of assets and liabilities from assistance can take years, with uncertainty in cost estimates due to unclear timing of payments and necessary assumptions for inflation adjustments. The potential impacts of government assistance include avoiding disruptions to consumers, workers, and the economy, averting losses to retirement funds, and maintaining tax revenues. Drawbacks include reduced competition, market distortion, moral hazard, and delaying industry adjustments to structural problems. Federal assistance to industries raises questions about fairness and is detailed in reports from the Government Accountability Office, Congressional Research Service, and executive branch agencies. Reporting on programs varies, with Congress sometimes requiring specific reporting or oversight mechanisms. Historical vote totals can be found on http://www.congress.gov and Congressional Quarterly. Throughout the 1950s, the rail industry faced decline due to competition from highways and the airline industry. The New York, Ontario and Western railroad was liquidated in 1957. Industry leaders sought solutions such as shutting down unprofitable routes, subsidies, and mergers. Congress responded with legislative measures. The Transportation Act of 1958 facilitated large-scale mergers in the railroad industry, leading to a consolidation of Class I railroads from 110 in 1957 to 71 in 1970. The 1968 merger of Pennsylvania Railroad and New York Central Railroad into Penn Central, the world's largest railroad at the time, marked the peak of this trend. Bankruptcies were prevalent, with railroads like New York, New Haven and Hartford going bankrupt in 1961 and Central Railroad of New Jersey failing in 1967. The Penn Central Railroad declared bankruptcy in June 1970 due to declining financial condition caused by falling revenues, badly rundown infrastructure, high property taxes, incompatible systems, and high labor costs. Other railroads in the Northeast and Midwest also went bankrupt, including the Ann Arbor Railroad, Reading Railroad, Lehigh Valley Railroad, Boston and Maine Railroad, and Erie Lackawanna Railroad. This industry distress exposed major banks and financial institutions to potential losses. The Penn Central Railroad bankruptcy in 1970 led to disruptions in the commercial paper market, raising concerns about the financial stability of other industries. Federal agencies were unable to provide assistance to troubled railroads, leading to bankruptcies. Congress enacted measures in the 1970s to prevent the collapse of the rail industry, including financial assistance, deregulation, and the creation of new quasi-governmental private companies. The Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 created Amtrak to operate passenger trains with federal support, relieving railroad companies of the obligation to provide intercity passenger service. The Emergency Rail Services Act of 1970 provided loan guarantees to preserve essential service. In March 1973, the Penn Central Railroad filed for bankruptcy. In December 1973, the Regional Rail Reorganization Act (P.L. 93-236) created the United States Railway Association (USRA) to provide emergency funding and restructure bankrupt railroads. The act passed the Senate 45-16 and the House 284-59, leading to the creation of Conrail as a for-profit corporation to take over operations in the Northeast and Midwest. USRA developed a \"Final System Plan\" to transfer lines to Conrail. The Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform (4R) Act of 1976 approved the USRA's \"Final System Plan\" and led to the creation of Conrail on April 1, 1976. Conrail took over operations from bankrupt railroads like the Penn Central and received federal funding for operating losses and infrastructure rehabilitation. The Act also facilitated the transfer of the Penn Central's Northeast Corridor line to Amtrak. The 4R Act provided approximately $7 billion in assistance to Conrail, including operating losses, capital rehabilitation, and payments to employees. It also implemented reforms to ease ICC regulation of the railroad industry, allowing for greater flexibility in setting shipping rates and creating the RRIF loan program. The RRIF loan program, codified at 45 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7821-838, offers long-term, low-cost loans to assist \"short line\" railroads in financing infrastructure improvements and equipment investments. In the Midwest, the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad and the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad faced bankruptcy in the 1970s, leading to separate federal legislation for their restructuring. Congress passed the Milwaukee Railroad Restructuring Act (P.L. 96-101) in 1979 and the Rock Island Railroad Transition and Employee Assistance Act (P.L. 96-254) in 1980. The Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad abandoned two-thirds of its network, acquired by Canadian Pacific Railroad in 1985. The Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad ceased operations in 1980, with its property acquired by multiple buyers. Congress passed the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 to address railroad restructuring. The Staggers Rail Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-448) expanded deregulation in the railroad industry, preventing the ICC from setting maximum shipping rates and allowing railroads to keep rate agreements secret. Despite some opposition, the law helped restore profitability to the freight rail sector and led to increased capital investment. Conrail was required to submit proposals for its future, while intercity passenger rail duties were transferred to Amtrak. The Northeast Rail Services Act of 1981 (NERSA) relieved Conrail of commuter rail service obligations starting in 1983 to improve profitability. State or local commuter authorities took over operations, with a new Amtrak subsidiary as backup. NERSA also mandated Conrail's eventual privatization. Following the reforms in the 3R and 4R Acts, the Staggers Act, and NERSA, Conrail reported profits in 1981 and subsequent years. The government's 85% stake in the company was sold through an IPO in 1987, recouping approximately $2 billion. Railroad profitability increased after the Staggers Act, leading to the company's privatization. Since the implementation of the Staggers Act, railroad companies focused on freight traffic, leading to consolidation and abandonment of 70,000 miles of railroad since 1980. Currently, there are seven Class I railroads in the United States. Conrail was privatized and later acquired by Norfolk Southern Corporation and CSX Corporation in a $10.3 billion joint stock purchase. Amtrak has never made an operating profit and relies on federal support. The federal government has a history of providing assistance to farmers with loans due to asymmetric information and lack of competition. The presence of asymmetric information between lenders and farmers, lack of competition in rural areas, and targeted assistance policies affect agricultural lending. The main federal agricultural lenders are the Farm Service Agency (FSA) and the Farm Credit System (FCS). FSA, part of the USDA, provides direct loans and guarantees to farmers who don't qualify for commercial credit. FCS, a privately funded cooperative, serves only agriculture-related borrowers and is regulated by the Farm Credit Administration. The agricultural economy downturn in the early 1980s led to a financial crisis among lenders and farmers. The Farm Credit System (FCS) faced a financial crisis in the 1980s due to low farm income, high interest rates, and declining land prices, leading to operating losses of $2.7 billion in 1985 and $1.9 billion in 1986. Despite not being a government obligation, FCS's government-sponsored enterprise status raised investor expectations that the Treasury would prevent default. The Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 was enacted to address the crisis. The Credit Act of 1987 (P.L. 100-233) was enacted to stabilize the Farm Credit System (FCS) by providing a $4 billion financial assistance package. It created the FCS Financial Assistance Corporation, utilized $1.26 billion in loans from the U.S. Treasury, mandated organizational changes, protected FCS borrowers' stock investments, and specified requirements for restructuring problem farm loans. Notable changes included FCS banks becoming jointly liable for each other's debts and the creation of an FCS Insurance Corporation. The 1987 Credit Act aimed to stabilize the Farm Credit System by providing financial assistance and creating the FCS Insurance Corporation. It also established borrower rights unique to agriculture, including options to restructure delinquent farm loans and rights of first refusal to avoid foreclosure. The FCS Financial Assistance Corporation borrowed $1.26 billion from the U.S. Treasury during the farm financial crisis of the 1980s. The Farm Credit System (FCS) borrowed $1.26 billion from the U.S. Treasury during the 1980s farm financial crisis. Repayment was made through assessments on system banks and associations, with the last of the bonds and interest repaid in June 2005. The FCS Financial Assistance Corporation was dissolved in December 2006, and the Farm Credit System's financial performance improved steadily into the present day. The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation is fully funded, providing protection to farmers facing financial challenges. The borrowers' rights provisions offer protection to farmers during financial crises, such as the one in 2007-2009 and the current period of lower farm income. Savings and loan institutions (S&Ls) provided mainly residential mortgages and faced a solvency crisis in the 1980s due to mismatched interest rates on liabilities and assets. In the 1980s, savings and loan institutions (S&Ls) faced a solvency crisis due to mismatched interest rates on fixed-rate assets like mortgages. Government deposit insurance discouraged depositors from withdrawing funds, allowing insolvent S&Ls to continue operating. By 1982, the S&L industry's tangible net worth had fallen to virtually zero. Policymakers were slow to address the crisis, fearing it would disrupt mortgage lending and homeownership. The S&L crisis was exacerbated by regulatory forbearance, allowing insolvent firms to continue operating, leading to increased risks and losses. Deregulation also played a role in the crisis. The S&L crisis was worsened by regulatory forbearance and deregulation in the early 1980s, leading to increased risks and losses. Legislation was enacted in two phases to address the crisis, with the government facing additional costs due to inadequate deposit insurance. Legislation enacted from 1987 aimed to resolve insolvent S&Ls by providing financial resources and new regulatory powers. The Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 created the Financing Corporation (FICO) to fund FSLIC with $10.8 billion in bonds. Despite being insufficient, FSLIC resolved 222 institutions under new leadership. The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (P.L. 101-73) abolished FSLIC and FHLBB, transferring their assets and authority to new entities to resolve insolvent S&Ls. Despite resolutions in 1988, there were still 250 insolvent S&Ls with $80.8 billion in assets. The Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) was established to resolve failed thrifts, funded by the Resolution Funding Corporation (REFCORP) issuing debt. The RTC received $30 billion in 1991 and up to $25 billion in 1992 to address savings and loan institution failures. The RTC was restructured and FICO was terminated. The Resolution Trust Corporation Completion Act of 1993 provided $18.3 billion to complete the savings and loan resolution process. The Resolution Trust Corporation Completion Act of 1993 passed the Senate with a vote of 54-45, providing $18.3 billion to finish the savings and loan cleanup. It terminated the RTC on December 31, 1995, and authorized $8.5 billion for the Saving Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) to be used if the industry couldn't cover future failures. The S&L cleanup costs were shared among the federal government, government-sponsored enterprises, and the industry through deposit insurance premiums. FICO and REFCORP were created to provide financing for the resolution of failing thrifts. The S&L crisis posed unique challenges due to ongoing thrift failures and the need for the insurance fund to repay depositors. During the S&L crisis, the Resolution Trust Corporation Completion Act of 1993 provided $18.3 billion to finish the cleanup. The total cost varied, with estimates ranging from $150 billion to $160.1 billion. The FDIC Banking Review estimated expenses at $152.7 billion, with direct appropriations covering $99.4 billion. The government recouped $30.1 billion through industry assessments and bond proceeds. The S&L crisis cleanup cost $129.9 billion, with $122.6 billion in direct costs. 1,043 insolvent firms with $519 billion in assets were resolved between 1986 and 1995. The RTC ceased operations in 1995, and some cleanup bonds remain outstanding until 2030. S&Ls were renamed savings associations or thrifts. The S&L crisis cleanup cost $129.9 billion, with $122.6 billion in direct costs. 1,043 insolvent firms with $519 billion in assets were resolved between 1986 and 1995. The RTC ceased operations in 1995, and some cleanup bonds remain outstanding until 2030. The regulation of the thrift industry was reformed by FIRREA. The Office of Thrift Supervision was eliminated after problems in the 2007-2009 financial crisis. The airline industry was already struggling financially before the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, which led to a temporary grounding of all commercial flights in the US. After the 9/11 attacks, Congress passed the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act to provide the airline industry with up to $15 billion in financial support, including emergency assistance and guaranteed loans to compensate for losses and ensure stability. The Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act provided financial support to the airline industry after 9/11 attacks, including premium war risk insurance and direct compensation to air carriers for operating losses. The distribution of loan guarantees was overseen by an air transportation stabilization board. The Air Transportation Stabilization Board (ATSB) provided financial support to airlines after 9/11, with payments totaling $4.6 billion out of $5 billion available. Congress rescinded unobligated balances, and the ATSB approved six loan guarantee applications totaling $1.56 billion, with five loans fully repaid. The ATSB provided financial support to airlines after 9/11, with six guaranteed loans, five of which were fully repaid. The ATA Airlines loan guarantee had to be exercised when ATA Airlines filed for bankruptcy. The ATSB paid $125 million for the ATA loan but recouped $97.2 million. The government recovered a net of $338.8 million from the carriers through fees and stock warrants. Between September 2001 and December 2014, $1.8 billion in premiums were collected for the War Risk Insurance program, with $10,107,874 paid out for claims. The Aviation Insurance Revolving Fund supports over $20 billion in non-premium aviation insurance for national security. The uncommitted balance of the ATSB loan guarantee authority was $8,441,400,000 in 2002. The program funds were rescinded by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008. The War Risk Insurance program expansion ended in 2014, with the government recouping more than it paid out. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 stemmed from a housing boom turning into a bust, leading to firms facing insolvency due to capital losses from illiquid asset-backed securities. Lack of trust in financial markets hindered firms from accessing credit markets. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 was caused by a housing boom turning into a bust, leading to firms facing insolvency from capital losses on illiquid asset-backed securities. The banking industry was heavily impacted as holders of mortgage-backed securities and lenders making mortgage loans. The Federal Reserve, created in 1913 as a lender of last resort, took steps to inject liquidity into the financial system during the crisis. However, its authority was limited to lending funds and could not assist firms with solvency problems. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 was introduced to address the crisis. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA) was introduced to address the financial crisis caused by the housing boom turning into a bust. It was brought to the House as an amendment to H.R. 3997 but failed, then a revised version was passed by the Senate as an amendment to H.R. 1424. This amended version, signed into law as P.L. 110-343, gave the Treasury Department authority to use up to $700 billion under the Troubled Asset Relief Program to address the crises by purchasing \"toxic\" assets from firms. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA) allowed the Treasury to replace \"toxic\" assets with safer ones and guarantee assets or augment firms' capital. The Capital Purchase Program (CPP) purchased $205 billion in preferred shares from over 700 banks. Additionally, the Community Development Financial Institution program bought preferred shares on less stringent terms. The Targeted Investment Program (TIP) provided $20 billion in preferred share purchases and asset guarantees for troubled banks like Bank of America and Citigroup. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA) allowed the Treasury to replace toxic assets with safer ones and guarantee assets or augment firms' capital. The Capital Purchase Program (CPP) purchased $205 billion in preferred shares from over 700 banks. The guarantee for Bank of America on $118 billion in assets was offered, but never officially closed. The Citibank guarantee was on $301 billion in assets, but funds were never paid out on any losses. EESA was amended in early 2009, allowing earlier repayment of assistance and adding executive compensation requirements. P.L. 111-5 passed the House and Senate. The Treasury recouped money from sales of preferred shares, dividends, warrants, and fees for asset guarantees. Citigroup preferred shares were converted into common equity and sold on the open market. By the end of 2011, $255.4 billion had been recouped from the general TARP bank assistance, with $17.35 billion still outstanding. By 2020, $271.4 billion had been recouped, with only $0.04 billion of preferred shares remaining. Special assistance for Bank of America and Citigroup was completed by the end of 2009, resulting in $22.7 billion and $21.8 billion in recoupment, respectively. Despite the default risk, the government recouped $30.5 billion more than it disbursed on the bank programs. The financial crisis passed quickly for the banking industry, with banks repurchasing CPP preferred shares by March 2009. Overall profitability levels in the banking system returned relatively quickly. The market for motor vehicles in the US and other industrial countries was severely impacted in 2008 and 2009. Ford had secured a line of credit in 2007, but GM and Chrysler faced challenges accessing long-term financing during the crisis. During the financial crisis in 2009, GM and Chrysler's production dropped significantly, leading to concerns about supplier failures and potential bankruptcies. The George W. Bush Administration and Congress disagreed on how to assist the automakers, with no specific legislation passed. The Administration recommended reprogramming a Department of Energy motor vehicle loan program to provide bridge loans to GM and Chrysler. The House passed a bill authorizing funds from the DOE ATVM program as bridge loans, but the Senate did not vote on it. The Bush Administration used TARP to provide initial loans of $24.8 billion to GM, Chrysler, and two auto financing companies in December 2008 and January 2009. When the Obama Administration took office in January 2009, it continued the loan program for the auto industry, totaling $79.7 billion. An Auto Task Force was established to work on restructuring plans with GM and Chrysler, leading to bankruptcy filings in April and June 2009. The U.S. Treasury became a major owner of both companies, along with the Canadian government, bondholders, and the United Auto Workers. The U.S. Treasury, along with the Canadian government, bondholders, and the United Auto Workers, provided assistance to GM and Chrysler. The assistance was repaid through various means starting in 2009, including public offerings and private sales of stock. The Treasury sold its last holdings in Chrysler in June 2011 and GM in December 2013, with proceeds not covering the original loans. GM and Chrysler restructured after bankruptcy, with GM becoming independent and Chrysler part of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) is a corporation based in Great Britain. Money market mutual funds invest in high-quality, short-term assets and are similar to bank deposits but not guaranteed by the FDIC. In 2008, the Reserve Fund \"broke the buck\" due to losses from Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy. In September 2008, the Reserve Fund \"broke the buck\" due to losses from Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy, leading to a run on money market mutual funds. The Treasury announced a program to guarantee deposits in participating funds to stop the run, financed by the Exchange Stabilization Fund. This program expired in September 2009. The Stabilization Act of 2008 directed the Treasury Secretary to reimburse the Exchange Stabilization Fund for funds used in the money market guarantee program. Fees of 0.015% to 0.022% were paid for the guarantee, totaling $1.2 billion in collected fees. Over $3 trillion in deposits were guaranteed, covering 98% of U.S. money market mutual funds. In 2018, the Trump Administration imposed increased tariffs on steel and aluminum citing national security and unfair trade practices. The Trump Administration imposed increased tariffs on steel and aluminum from various countries, including China, leading to retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products. This resulted in a sharp decline in market prices and exports of affected agricultural products, particularly to China, which saw a 53% decrease in U.S. agricultural exports in 2018. The imposition of retaliatory tariffs in 2018 led to a 53% decline in the value of U.S. agricultural exports to $9 billion from $19 billion in 2017. The tariffs affected producers of various commodities, including soybeans, sorghum, milk, pork, fruits, nuts, and specialty crops. Negotiations with trade partners to resolve disputes were prolonged, particularly with China. The Secretary of Agriculture initiated two ad hoc trade assistance programs in 2018 and 2019 to provide short-term aid. The Administration provided short-term assistance to farmers in response to foreign trade retaliation targeting U.S. agricultural products. Two trade-aid packages were announced in 2018 and 2019, totaling up to $28 billion. The packages included the Market Facilitation Program (MFP) which provided direct payments to producers of specified commodities. The USDA administered three programs in response to foreign trade retaliation targeting U.S. agricultural products in 2018 and 2019. These programs included the Market Facilitation Program (MFP) for direct payments to producers, the Food Purchase and Distribution Program (FPDP) for surplus commodity purchases for redistribution, and the Agricultural Trade Promotion (ATP) program for boosting exports through cost-share assistance to U.S. organizations. The USDA administered trade assistance programs in 2018 and 2019, including the Market Facilitation Program (MFP) for direct payments to producers. The 2019 MFP included an expanded list of eligible commodities compared to 2018. The Secretary had discretionary authority to determine aid distribution. The 2019 Market Facilitation Program (MFP) had 41 eligible commodities, compared to nine in 2018. Payments were based on harvested acres for specialty crops and planted acres for non-specialty crops to account for lower yields due to weather conditions. A single payment rate per county was calculated to avoid influencing crop choices and payment discrepancies. Dairy producers received payments based on historical data under both the 2018 and 2019 MFP programs. Under the 2018 and 2019 MFP programs, payments to dairy producers were based on historical production, while hog producers used mid-year inventory data. Payments were made in three tranches with annual limits and AGI eligibility requirements. The 2018 MFP had payment caps of $125,000 per person for eligible crops and animal products, while the 2019 package increased limits to $250,000 per commodity group and $500,000 across groups. Recipients had an AGI threshold of $900,000, with exemptions for farms with 75% of AGI from farming. The 2018 and 2019 MFP programs provided payments to farmers based on historical production for dairy producers and mid-year inventory data for hog producers. Payments were made in three tranches with annual limits and AGI eligibility requirements. The payments offered a substantial income boost to the U.S. agricultural sector during a period of low commodity prices and low net farm income. However, the distribution of payments across commodities and regions was uneven, leading to concerns raised by Senator Debbie Stabenow about the methodology used. She requested a comprehensive investigation by GAO into the integrity of the program. Senator Stabenow requested a GAO investigation into USDA's trade aid to farmers affected by Trump's policies. There is no provision for repayment of funds disbursed under the trade-aid packages. Trump claimed tariffs on imported goods increased U.S. revenue, but studies show costs are borne by U.S. firms and consumers. USDA's use of CCC authority for agricultural support programs without congressional involvement is not unprecedented, but the scale of its use for the trade-aid packages, costing up to $28 billion, is concerning. The USDA Inspector General is investigating the Administration's trade assistance programs, specifically looking into the legality of direct payments to farmers. Other countries may challenge the Market Facilitation Program payments as a violation of U.S. trade commitments to the World Trade Organization."
