    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"One Percent Spending Reduction Act of 2016\". Congressional findings and purpose are outlined in the Act. Congress finds that the fiscal crisis faced by the Federal Government demands immediate action due to the dramatic growth in spending and debt in recent years, which threatens the economic and national security of the United States. Federal spending has increased from 18% to nearly 21% of GDP from 2001 to 2015, with total Federal debt exceeding $19 trillion and projected to rise to $29 trillion by 2026. Interest payments on this debt are also expected to increase. The purpose of the Act is to address the fiscal crisis by quickly balancing the Federal budget, reducing spending annually until it matches projected revenues, and reforming entitlement programs for long-term fiscal stability. Interest payments on the growing debt are projected to rise, making it difficult for Congress to balance the budget. Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and health-related spending are expected to overwhelm all other Federal programs and consume all tax revenues if not reformed. SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF SPENDING CAPS. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to include section 253A for establishing outlay caps. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to include section 253A for establishing outlay caps. The term 'outlay cap' defines the total outlays (less net interest payments) for fiscal years 2017 to 2021, with a 1 percent reduction each year. For fiscal year 2022 and beyond, total outlays must not exceed 18 percent of the gross domestic product, as estimated by the Office of Management and Budget. Total projected outlays for each fiscal year cannot be less than the previous year. The Office of Management and Budget must prepare a sequestration to eliminate excess spending within 45 days of the fiscal year's start. Excess outlay amount is defined as the difference between total projected Federal outlays and the outlay cap for fiscal years 2017 through 2021. For fiscal year 2022 onwards, the term 'excess outlay amount' refers to the difference between total projected Federal outlays and the outlay cap. The Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget issue sequestration preview reports in August, with a final report due on October 31 each year. The Office of Management and Budget issues a final sequestration report on October 31 each year, accompanied by a Presidential order detailing spending reductions. Congressional committees may report a resolution directing changes to existing law if a sequestration is projected in the August 20 report. The House committees are directed to change laws to achieve spending reductions outlined in a report. Certain programs are not exempt from these reductions, except for net interest payments. If a bill causes excess outlays, the next fiscal year's excess outlay amount will be increased. Conforming amendments are made to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The amendment to (2 U.S.C. 904(c)(4)) requires preview reports to include estimates for total projected outlays, reductions required under section 253A, and the sequestration percentage necessary to achieve the reduction. Final sequestration reports under section 254(f)(3) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 are also mandated. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to include additional information in final sequestration reports, such as estimates of baseline budgetary resources, outlays, and reductions for sequestered accounts. Enforcement measures are also added to the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to include additional information in final sequestration reports, such as estimates of baseline budgetary resources, outlays, and reductions for sequestered accounts. Enforcement procedures are added to the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 prohibits breaching or increasing outlay caps in any legislative bill. Waivers or suspensions require a two-thirds vote in the Senate or House of Representatives. In the House, a two-thirds vote is required to waive the application of certain rules. The Speaker cannot entertain a motion to suspend this rule. SEC. 4. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.
