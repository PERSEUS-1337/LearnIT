    "content": "In August 2018, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed the \"Affordable Clean Energy\" (ACE) rule to replace the Clean Power Plan (CPP) and modify provisions for existing power plants under the Clean Air Act. This proposal was in response to Executive Order 13783, which directed federal agencies to review regulations that could burden the development of domestically produced energy resources. EPA's ACE rule also aimed to modify the New Source Review (NSR) program to ensure new and modified stationary sources of air pollution do not significantly degrade air quality. The EPA reviewed the CPP, a key action to reduce GHG emissions. They also convened an \"NSR Reform Task Force\" to simplify the NSR application process. Congress has debated NSR, with divergent views on its benefits and drawbacks. Two bills were introduced in Congress to amend the CAA definition of modification. The EPA's review of the CPP and efforts to simplify the NSR application process have sparked debate on the potential impacts on the economy and the environment. Stakeholders have expressed concerns about the effects of GHG emissions controls on the economy, while scientific assessments warn of severe and irreversible impacts of climate change. The EPA received a record number of public comments on the CPP, leading to numerous changes before its finalization in 2015. Congressional and public interest in the CPP continues, highlighting the ongoing discussion on GHG emissions and the Clean Air Act. The report provides background information on the Clean Air Act (CAA) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the power sector, focusing on EPA's ACE proposal. It does not cover all elements of the proposal but refers to other reports for more comprehensive analysis. Legal issues are not addressed in this report. For legal analysis, refer to CRS Legal Sidebar reports LSB10198 and LSB10199. The curr_chunk provides background information on sources of U.S. GHGs emissions, particularly CO2, CAA Section 111, the Clean Power Plan (CPP), and NSR. Anthropogenic GHG emissions come from various sources in the U.S., with CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion being the largest percentage. The electricity sector historically accounted for the largest percentage of U.S. CO2 emissions from fossil fuel. In 2017, the transportation sector surpassed the electricity sector in U.S. CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion, accounting for 37% compared to electricity's 34%. Despite electricity generation remaining flat from 2010-2017, CO2 emissions have decreased by 23% below 2010 levels. Multiple factors, including the electricity generation portfolio, impact CO2 emission levels in the sector. Shifting the U.S. electricity generation portfolio to lower emissions sources could significantly reduce CO2 emissions from the electricity sector, ultimately decreasing total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Recent changes in the U.S. electricity generation portfolio between 2005 and 2017 have played a key role in electric power emission levels. Recent changes in the U.S. electricity generation portfolio from 2005 to 2017 show a decrease in coal's contribution to electricity generation from 50% to 30%, an increase in natural gas from 19% to 32%, and growth in non-hydro renewable energy from 2% to 10%. The shift towards lower emissions sources has led to a 19% decrease in coal-fired power plant capacity, a 45% increase in natural gas capacity, and a significant 445% increase in renewable sources. These changes could lead to a continued decline in U.S. CO2 emissions, provided other sectors like transportation do not offset the reductions. Recent analyses project further declines in CO2 emissions in the near term under baseline scenarios. CAA Section 111 establishes technology-based standards for industrial facilities to control pollution and ensure clean air for future growth. NSPS set maximum emission levels for new and modified major stationary sources like power plants and steel mills. Section 111 of the Clean Air Act establishes technology-based standards for industrial facilities to control pollution. It requires the EPA to determine the best system of emission reduction (BSER) for new and existing stationary sources, such as power plants and steel mills. States must develop plans to regulate existing sources based on EPA's emission guidelines, which set performance standards reflecting the BSER. In 1975, EPA established state plan procedures under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act to reduce GHGs from existing fossil-fuel-fired power plants by setting national CO2 emission standards based on BSER. The standards apply to electric steam generating units (mostly coal) and stationary combustion turbines like natural gas combined cycle units. EPA determined BSER using three building blocks to improve heat rate. The EPA established state plan procedures in 1975 under the Clean Air Act to reduce GHGs from existing fossil-fuel-fired power plants by setting national CO2 emission standards based on BSER. The CPP rule set individual state targets for emissions from existing power plants, with interim targets for 2022-2029 and final targets for 2030. The rule is subject to ongoing litigation and has not gone into effect. The EPA proposed to repeal the CPP due to a change in legal interpretation, citing that it exceeds statutory authority. They also requested information on a potential replacement. The NSR program requires modern pollution controls for new or modified facilities to maintain air quality standards. The NSR program mandates obtaining a permit for new or modified facilities that substantially increase emissions. Applicants must show compliance with NAAQS and PSD regulations, using the best available control technology. Existing facilities before 1977 are exempt from immediate BACT installation. The 1977 Clean Air Act amendments exempted existing facilities from immediately installing Best Available Control Technology (BACT). Instead, facilities were required to install BACT when making major modifications. NSR applicability determinations have been contentious and litigated, with the definition of modification broadly interpreted by EPA and state agencies. EPA's interpretation of modification under the NSR program has faced legal challenges since 1974. The agency has historically excluded \"routine maintenance, repair, and replacement\" from the definition of modification, despite the Clean Air Act's broader definition. EPA proposed replacing the CPP with new emission guidelines for existing coal-fired units, focusing on heat rate improvement measures. EPA proposed new emission guidelines for existing coal-fired units, focusing on heat rate improvement measures for generating units. The proposal does not include a BSER for other types of EGUs, such as stationary combustion turbines. States would establish unit-specific performance standards based on candidate technologies identified by EPA and other factors. EPA's proposal is based on the finding that the BSER set in the CPP exceeded its statutory authority. EPA stated that BSER should be determined by evaluating technologies applicable to the facility for an affected source under Section 111(d). EPA proposed revisions to emission guidelines for existing coal-fired units, focusing on heat rate improvement measures. The ACE proposal would shift the responsibility of establishing emission standards to states, with EPA determining nationally applicable BSER. The proposal applies a narrower interpretation of BSER compared to the CPP, defining it as on-site HRI for existing fossil fuel steam EGUs. EPA allows states to consider source-specific factors when developing performance standards. The ACE proposal limits CO2 emissions from existing coal-fired units by defining BSER as on-site HRI. The proposal's applicability to other fossil-fuel-fired steam EGUs like natural gas and fuel oil units is unclear. EPA excludes certain units like integrated gasification combined cycle units from the affected source definition. EPA lacks information to establish BSER for these sources. The EPA's ACE proposal limits CO2 emissions from existing coal-fired units by focusing on on-site HRI. However, it lacks sufficient information on emission reduction strategies for natural gas-fired stationary combustion turbines. The CPP established national CO2 emission performance standards based on three building blocks, allowing states to choose options to meet emission targets. The \"heat rate\" measures a power plant's energy efficiency in generating electricity. The \"heat rate\" measures a power plant's energy efficiency in generating electricity, with lower rates resulting in less fuel usage and lower emissions. Efficiency gains may lead to increased electricity generation by fossil-fuel-fired plants, potentially offsetting emission reductions. EPA's ACE analysis suggests that emission decreases from reduced heat rate are likely to outweigh any increases from increased operation. EPA raised concerns about the rebound effect when using an HRI approach in isolation, stating that applying building block 1 in isolation can result in a \"rebound effect\" that undermines emissions reductions achieved by heat rate improvements. The quantity of emission reductions achieved by building block 1 measures alone would be insufficient in the context of this pollutant and industry, potentially exacerbating the insufficiency of emission reductions. Under ACE, EPA is not proposing specific performance standards for the BSER. Instead, EPA proposed a list of \"candidate technologies\" of HRI measures that constitute the BSER. States could use this list to establish standards of performance for existing steam-fired units under Section 111(d). States would need to evaluate each HRI measure on the candidate technology list. States would need to evaluate each HRI measure on the candidate technology list to determine which ones are appropriate for each power plant and establish the source-specific \"standard of performance that reflects the degree of emission reduction\" from application of the technology. The candidate technologies list includes steam turbine blade upgrades, seal improvements, and use of computer models to optimize combustion conditions. EPA considered the cost and estimated range of HRI potential for each listed candidate technology. EPA proposes allowing affected sources to use BSER technologies or other non-BSER technology to comply with standards. Examples of non-BSER technologies include carbon capture and storage and fuel co-firing. States have flexibility in establishing performance standards and may consider factors like remaining useful life of the source. EPA does not take a position on other methods to meet standards. EPA proposes allowing states to consider source-specific factors, such as remaining useful life, when setting performance standards. Factors like plant age, location, and control equipment feasibility will be included in regulations. States can implement emissions averaging within affected units at a single facility but not between affected and non-affected units or different facilities. EPA has concerns about averaging between affected and non-affected units at the same facility. EPA's proposed ACE rule allows states to consider source-specific factors when setting performance standards. While emissions averaging within affected units at a single facility is permitted, trading between existing sources at different facilities may not be included due to legal and practical concerns. EPA acknowledges that averaging and trading could offer flexibility to states but seeks ways to prevent generation shifting. Compliance deadlines for affected units will be determined by states based on performance standards established in the state plan process. EPA's proposed ACE rule allows states to set custom compliance schedules for affected EGUs as part of their state plan. States must establish legally enforceable increments of progress for sources with compliance schedules extending beyond 24 months. The CPP required states to establish interim targets measured between 2022 and 2029, with glide paths for reductions in three time periods. EPA also proposed revisions to the general implementing regulations for state plans. EPA proposed changes to regulations in 1975 for state plans, aiming to codify states' discretion in setting emissions standards. The revisions include modifying definitions, extending time for plan development, adding EPA review step, and altering variance provision. The proposed regulations would be codified in a new subpart, 40 C.F.R. Part 60, Subpart Ba, applying to ACE emission guidelines for affected EGUs and future guidelines. EPA proposed redefining emission guidelines as \"final guideline documents\" to eliminate the requirement for a presumptive standard. This change aims to give states more flexibility in setting emission standards under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act. EPA proposed replacing \"emission standards\" with performance standards and extending the time periods for state plan development and review. EPA has not updated regulations to reflect the terminology changes from the CAA amendments of 1977. EPA proposed extending the time periods for state plan development and review under Section 111(d) to align with timelines for state implementation plans under Section 110. States would have three years after the final emission guideline is available to adopt and submit a state plan to EPA. EPA proposed extending the time periods for state plan development and review under Section 111(d) to align with timelines for state implementation plans under Section 110. States would have three years after the final emission guideline is available to adopt and submit a state plan to EPA. The proposed changes include giving EPA six months to determine completeness of state plans, with 12 months for review. EPA would use 14 criteria to assess completeness, and if states fail to submit an approvable plan, EPA would promulgate a federal plan within two years. EPA proposed extending the time periods for state plan development and review under Section 111(d) to align with timelines for state implementation plans under Section 110. States would have three years after the final emission guideline is available to adopt and submit a state plan to EPA. The current implementing regulations specify that state plans for health-based pollutants must be as stringent as the emission guideline established by EPA unless the state demonstrates, on a case-by-case basis, that a source meets certain factors. This variance provision would allow a state to apply less stringent standards for health-based pollutants under ACE. EPA proposed a new variance provision that includes factors such as unreasonable cost of control, physical impossibility of installing necessary equipment, or other specific facility factors. Under ACE, EPA proposed a new variance provision for NSR that considers factors like remaining useful life of the source. States can choose to adopt a revised test for determining major modifications at EGUs. The proposed NSR revision aims to facilitate efficiency projects at EGUs by considering emissions increases on an hourly basis. Under ACE, modifications at existing EGUs that increase emissions on an hourly basis would not trigger NSR. This means additional pollution controls would not be required, even if annual emissions increase. EPA recognized that adopting HRI measures could raise annual emissions by allowing more efficient operation, potentially lowering costs. However, under ACE, annual emissions would not be a factor in states that adopt the revised NSR test. This means facilities in those states would not be obligated to follow the NSR process based on annual emissions. The EPA proposed a revision to the NSR rules to facilitate the implementation of a revised standard for EGUs. Some stakeholders believe the revision could discourage energy efficiency projects, while others argue it could have broader implications for energy and air quality programs. One state agency described the revision as a significant overhaul that could allow poorly controlled sources to operate without cost-effective controls. The EPA proposed a revision to the NSR rules to facilitate the implementation of a revised standard for EGUs. Some stakeholders believe the revision could discourage energy efficiency projects, while others argue it could have broader implications for energy and air quality programs. One state agency described the revision as a significant overhaul that could allow poorly controlled sources to operate without cost-effective controls. Moreover, the impact of the proposed NSR revision on each state's air quality objectives is uncertain, and the incremental effect of the proposed change is unclear. EPA's air quality modeling projected that ACE would increase ambient concentrations of particulate matter and ozone in some areas compared to the CPP, but did not account for potential state-level implementation decisions. The ACE proposal may result in higher emissions than estimated if coal-fired power plants continue operating beyond planned retirement dates. The proposal does not change CO2 performance standards for new and modified power plants. EPA is required to establish NSPS for new and modified sources once a source category is listed. EPA must establish NSPS for new and modified fossil-fuel-fired EGUs. Under CAA Section 111(b), EPA sets standards for new sources, and under 111(d), states must submit plans for existing sources. EPA issued performance standards for new power plants in 2015 and is considering revising them. EPA also made findings in 2009 that GHGs endanger public health and welfare. The EPA's endangerment finding states that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere pose a threat to public health and welfare, leading to the need for emission standards for new motor vehicles. In the 2015 NSPS rule for power plants, the EPA determined that a separate endangerment finding was not necessary for stationary sources like EGUs, as they had already been listed under Section 111. The EPA's ACE proposal does not revisit the GHG endangerment finding but acknowledges the need to limit CO2 emissions from power plants. EPA estimated emission changes and costs under different scenarios, comparing them to a baseline assuming implementation of the CPP. The agency argued that EGUs would still meet endangerment requirements due to significant CO2 emissions. The EPA projected that under the ACE proposal, power sector emissions of CO2, SO2, and NOx would increase compared to the CPP. For example, in 2030, CO2 emissions would increase by 3%, SO2 emissions by 5.0-5.9%, and NOx emissions by 4.1-5.0% in each ACE scenario. EPA also estimated that ACE would decrease CO2 emissions in most scenarios. EPA projected that under the ACE proposal, emissions of CO2, SO2, and NOx would decrease compared to a baseline without the CPP in 2030. Compared to a CPP implementation scenario, ACE would result in lower reductions in emissions. The ACE proposal projects lower emissions reductions compared to the CPP due to uncertainty in technology measures. EPA's scenarios include No CPP, CPP repeal without replacement, and CPP baseline with intrastate trading. The ACE scenarios model different levels of heat rate improvements at coal-fired EGUs, with options for adoption or retirement based on economic factors. The scenarios include modest improvements in heat rate, implementation of proposed NSR revisions, and compliance options under the CPP framework. The ACE scenarios model a 4.5% HRI at $100/kilowatt, allowing sources to adopt the improvement or retire based on economics. Compared to a world without the CPP, ACE would generally reduce CO2 emissions, but to a lesser extent than the CPP. EPA's CO2 projections show lower emissions under ACE scenarios, with uncertainty in the emission estimates. The ACE scenarios for emission estimates may have more uncertainty compared to the CPP. Unlike the CPP, ACE does not set a specific performance standard for coal-fired EGUs, allowing states to determine standards based on technology options and other factors. EPA acknowledges uncertainty in outcomes due to various reasons, including existing technology adoption. This uncertainty contributes to the uncertainty in emissions projections. The uncertainty of emissions projections in the ACE scenarios is influenced by the \"rebound effect.\" EPA has raised concerns about this effect, but their analysis indicates that emission decreases from reduced heat rate may outweigh any increases from increased operation. A study by Resources for the Future found that implementing a 4% average fleet-wide HRI at coal-fired power plants could reduce CO2 emissions by 2.6% in 2030. Coal-fired power plants could reduce CO2 emissions by 2.6% in 2030 compared to a no-policy baseline scenario. Eight states may see emission increases and co-pollutants in 2030. A recent analysis noted that federal energy initiatives could extend the life of coal-fired power plants, potentially leading to higher emissions than estimated. Other organizations have not modeled the ACE proposal and its rebound effects. The 2018 proposed rule and other organizations have prepared CO2 emissions projections for the electricity sector in 2030, comparing scenarios with and without the CPP. EPA's ACE proposed rule shows a narrower range of emissions projections across policy scenarios compared to other studies. The estimated percentage emission reductions between ACE proposed HRI scenarios and CPP scenarios range between 0% and 1%. The ACE proposed HRI scenarios and CPP and non-CPP scenarios show emission reduction differences ranging from 0% to 1%. The gap between CPP and non-CPP scenarios has decreased over the years, reflecting changes already seen in the electric power sector due to market forces. Recent studies project lower emissions in 2030 compared to earlier ones, with a significant reduction in emissions by 32% below 2005 levels in 2030 according to the 2018 EPA analysis. The 2018 EPA analysis projects a 32% emission reduction below 2005 levels in 2030. Comparisons between emission projections and actual CO2 emissions highlight uncertainties in projections due to changing conditions and assumptions. The EPA's analysis shows that actual U.S. CO2 emissions have consistently been below past projections. The proposed ACE regulation would reduce compliance costs but result in lower emission reductions, leading to increased climate-related and human health damages. Replacing the CPP with ACE is estimated to yield net costs ranging from $12.8 billion to $72.0 billion over a 15-year period. The EPA's analysis estimates that repealing and not replacing the CPP would result in net costs ranging from $14.8 billion to $76.2 billion over a 15-year period (2023-2037), accounting for forgone domestic climate benefits and human health co-benefits. Consideration of co-benefits and indirect impacts is consistent with federal guidance, directing agencies to quantify and monetize these aspects in rulemaking. EPA's economic analysis includes intended effects, costs, and co-benefits. The exclusion of human health co-benefits in benefit-cost comparisons results in lower net impacts, ranging from net costs to net benefits. Compliance costs remain the same regardless of including co-benefits. The EPA's economic analysis compares the costs and benefits of repealing the CPP, with estimates ranging from a net cost of $5.4 billion to a net benefit of $3.4 billion over a 15-year period. Repealing the CPP without replacement could result in a net benefit of $1.2 billion to $2.7 billion over the same period. Comparisons to an alternative baseline show estimates ranging from a net cost of $6.6 billion to a net benefit of $2.0 billion over 15 years. The net cost and net benefit figures of the ACE proposal compared to the CPP show that estimated compliance cost savings may outweigh the forgone domestic climate benefits. The scenario design makes it challenging to determine the incremental effect of key components of the ACE proposal, such as the proposed revisions to NSR and the level of HRI improvements."
