Medical spending accounted for a significant portion of the increase, with 55 cents of every dollar spent on individuals with limited income going towards medical benefits. Adjusted for inflation, spending on individuals with limited income in 2004 increased by $21.5 billion from the previous year, mainly driven by medical assistance. In FY2004, over 80 benefit programs costing $583 billion were directed towards individuals with limited income, with federal funds covering 73.2% of the total. Medical spending dominated the increase, with 55 cents of every dollar spent on individuals with limited income going towards medical benefits. Adjusted for inflation, spending on individuals with limited income in 2004 increased by $21.5 billion from the previous year, mainly driven by medical assistance. Other increases were in food benefits, cash aid, and housing, while spending in real terms dropped in education benefits, jobs and training, services, and energy aid. The D.C. School Choice Incentive Program is a new addition to the benefit programs, while General Assistance (Medical Component) and General Assistance (Nonmedical Component) have been removed due to data reliability issues. Most programs determine eligibility based on income, with some offering assistance based on need. Income transfers in the form of cash, goods, or services are provided to recipients, with some programs requiring work or study in exchange for benefits. The TANF block grant program mandates work for adults. The TANF block grant program requires adults to work after enrollment, the Food Stamp program imposes work and training requirements, and public housing programs require self-sufficiency activities or community service. The Earned Income Tax Credit is available only to workers. Excludes non-income tested programs like Social Security cash benefits and Medicare. The report includes tax-transfer programs like the EITC for low-income workers and the child tax credit, which provide direct payments to eligible individuals. Other tax benefits that do not offer direct payments are excluded from the report. The report discusses tax-transfer programs like the EITC and child tax credit, which provide direct payments to low-income individuals. Other tax benefits, such as deductibility of mortgage interest and property taxes, also increase families' disposable income. Total expenditures on cash and noncash programs for low-income persons significantly increased between 1968 and 2004, even after adjusting for inflation. Total per capita spending for low-income programs grew from $422 in FY1968 to $1,986 in FY2004, with uneven growth patterns over the years. Federal expenditures accounted for over 70% of the total, peaking at 76% in 1978-1980 before declining. In the 1995-2004 decade, the federal share averaged 71.9%, reaching a peak of 73.7% in FY2003. Total per capita spending for low-income programs increased from $422 in FY1968 to $1,986 in FY2004. Federal spending for income-tested benefits rose from $63 billion in FY1968 to $427 billion in FY2004, while state-local spending increased from $26 billion to $156 billion during the same period. Total spending on means-tested programs grew from $89 billion to $583 billion in constant 2004 dollars. Cash aid was the primary form of federal means-tested assistance until 1980, when it was surpassed by medical benefits. Since 1979, federal spending for low-income programs increased steadily before declining in FY1996 and FY1997, then set new record highs from FY1998-FY2004. State-local spending rose consistently, with medical spending accounting for over 50% of every dollar spent. Medical benefits have been the largest share of state-local spending since 2002, while federal expenditures on medical assistance have also increased over the years. Federal spending on means-tested programs for persons with limited income has increased steadily since 1979, reaching nearly 46% in 2004. The earned income tax credit has become the largest program of income-tested cash benefits for families with children, with $34 billion paid out in FY2004. This amount exceeded federal SSI payments and TANF cash assistance significantly. Since 1979, federal spending on means-tested programs for individuals with limited income has steadily increased, reaching nearly 46% in 2004. The composition of total spending for income-tested benefits has shifted significantly since 1978, with medical benefits surpassing cash aid in funding. Noncitizen eligibility for federal means-tested benefit programs varies based on factors such as immigration status, work history, and length of legal residence, with rules established by the 1996 welfare reform law. The 1996 welfare reform law (P.L. 104-193) imposed restrictions on welfare eligibility for noncitizens, with some limits being eased in subsequent years. Nonimmigrants and unauthorized aliens are generally ineligible for major benefits, while legal permanent residents with a substantial work history or military connection are eligible. Legal permanent residents without a substantial work history may be eligible for food stamps after five years of lawful residence, with exceptions for certain groups. For SSI benefits, eligibility is limited to those receiving benefits before August 22, 1996, or those who were lawfully resident and are now disabled. TANF eligibility for legal permanent residents without a substantial work history is determined at the state level. Legal permanent residents without a substantial work history are eligible for various benefits, such as food stamps after five years of lawful residence, with exceptions for certain groups. Medicaid and TANF eligibility rules are similar for this group, with coverage required for SSI recipients. In terms of Section 8 housing assistance, legal permanent residents and noncitizens receiving benefits before August 22, 1996, are eligible. Humanitarian cases also qualify for benefits, including individuals such as asylees, refugees, and victims of abuse or trafficking. Legal permanent residents and certain individuals with similar status are eligible for various benefits, including food stamps, SSI, TANF, Medicaid, and Section 8 housing assistance. The Census Bureau reported that in 2003, 7.6 million families, including 5.8 million with children, had income below the poverty threshold, despite receiving assistance from programs like TANF, SSI, and GA. The poverty rate among related children in families was 17.2%. In 2003, the Census Bureau found that 17.2% of related children in families were in poverty, the highest rate since 1998. 35.9 million people were classified as poor based on pre-tax income, with 68.0% receiving aid from at least one of eight programs. By race, 55.2% of non-Hispanic whites, 80.9% of blacks, and 80.3% of Hispanics in poverty received aid. 6.1 million families with children were poor before receiving cash aid from programs like TANF, GA, or EITC. In 2003, 6.1 million families with children were poor before receiving cash aid from programs like TANF, GA, or the EITC. Among these families, 67.8% of male-present families and 43.8% of female-headed families received the EITC as the dominant form of aid. In 2003, 6.1 million families with children were poor before receiving cash aid from programs like TANF, GA, or the EITC. Among these families, 67.8% of male-present families and 43.8% of female-headed families received the EITC as the dominant form of aid. The EITC was the only aid for 10.4% of recipients, with various combinations of cash and noncash assistance going to others. More than 90% of programs have an explicit income test, based on different criteria such as poverty measures, median income, or need levels. The federal government shares in the cost of Medicaid services through a variable matching formula based on a state's per capita income. The federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) is higher for states with lower incomes and lower for states with higher incomes, with a national average FMAP of 55%. The FMAP for Medicaid is determined by a formula based on state per capita income, with a minimum of 50% and a maximum of 83%. Federal matching rates for territories are set at 50%, with exceptions for family planning services matched at 90%. The law aims to provide fiscal relief to states by adjusting federal matching rates. The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act temporarily changed federal matching rates for Medicaid to provide fiscal relief to states. For five quarters, the rates were held harmless for declines from the prior fiscal year and then increased by 2.95 percentage points. Federal Medicaid outlays totaled $146.6 billion in FY2002 and $161.0 billion in FY2003, with the federal government financing about 57% and 58% of costs respectively. In FY2004, federal outlays for Medicaid were $175.1 billion, with the federal government financing about 58% of costs. Medicaid eligibility is determined by federal law and state decisions, with mandatory and optional coverage categories. Traditionally, eligibility included low-income families, persons with disabilities, and the elderly. Additional coverage for medically needy individuals was introduced in the 1980s. Medicaid eligibility expanded in the 1980s to include higher-income children, pregnant women, and other specific groups like women with breast or cervical cancer. The program is means-tested, with income and resource limits set by states within federal guidelines, leading to varying standards across different states and population groups. Medicaid eligibility varies among states and population groups. Different standards apply, with some automatically eligible in one state, required to pay medical expenses in another, and ineligible in a third. Eligibility for Medicaid-eligible families, pregnant women, and children falls into two groups: those meeting AFDC standards pre-1996 and those under targeted expansions. Changes in eligibility were influenced by PRWORA and BBA 97. Under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Medicaid must cover members of families meeting old AFDC program eligibility requirements. States can adjust income and resource standards for these groups within certain limits. Medicaid assistance is also required for recipients of adoption assistance and foster care under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. Transitional or extended benefits are available. Under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, transitional or extended benefits are available for families who lose Medicaid eligibility due to increased employment hours, earnings, loss of earned income disregard, or higher child/spousal support payments. Coverage can be extended for six to 12 months with possible limitations or premium imposition. Children and pregnant women are exempt from TANF work requirements and retain Medicaid eligibility. States have the option to cover additional AFDC-related groups, including former foster care recipients aged 18-20. Medicaid coverage can be extended to former foster care recipients aged 18-20 and children under 21 in certain families. States may limit coverage to specific subgroups and deny benefits to nonpregnant adults who refuse to work. Congress has gradually expanded Medicaid to pregnant women and children based on income criteria. States must cover pregnant women and children under 6 with family incomes below 133% of the federal poverty guidelines. Medicaid coverage for pregnant women is limited to services related to pregnancy or complications through 60 days postpartum. Children receive full Medicaid coverage, with states required to cover all children under 19 below the federal poverty level. Optional coverage includes pregnant women and infants under 1 with family incomes up to 185% of the federal poverty level. States can also cover additional pregnant women and children with incomes above mandatory minimum levels through waivers and more liberal income calculation methods. Under the Social Security Act, Medicaid eligibility has been expanded through various methods, including Medicaid expansions under SCHIP. States can cover children up to age 19 with family incomes at or above 200% of the federal poverty level. Medicaid coverage can be extended for current child beneficiaries for up to 12 months without reevaluation. Pregnant women and children under 19 can receive Medicaid coverage based on \"presumptive\" eligibility. The SSI program, established in 1972, provides cash assistance to individuals who meet income and resource standards set by federal law. In 2005, the income limit for individuals was $579 per month, with a resource limit of $2,000. States have the option to supplement SSI payments for aged individuals. States may use more restrictive income standards for Medicaid eligibility than those for SSI recipients, with 11 states authorized to do so in 2005. Applicants can \"spend down\" by deducting medical expenses from their income to qualify for Medicaid. States must continue Medicaid coverage for individuals who lose SSI or SSP eligibility due to earnings but still have the disability that originally rendered them disabled. This includes those who need ongoing medical assistance to continue working and do not earn enough to replace SSI, Medicaid, and attendant care benefits. Additionally, Medicaid coverage must be continued for those who lose SSI due to a cost-of-living adjustment in their Social Security benefits. Medicaid continuations are provided for certain individuals who lose SSI due to eligibility for Social Security or veterans' benefits. States must also continue Medicaid for certain SSI-related groups, including \"essential persons\" who care for a person with a disability. States have the option to provide Medicaid to individuals not receiving SSI but receiving state-only cash payments. States can make Medicaid available to SSI beneficiaries with disabilities who have income up to 250% of the FPL, allowing them to \"buy into\" Medicaid by paying a premium. The Ticket to Work legislation allows states to cover employed persons with disabilities at higher income levels. States have the option to extend Medicaid coverage to financially eligible working individuals whose medical condition has improved, certain elderly persons, and persons with disabilities. This includes those with income below 100% of the FPL and limited resources. Medicaid can also help low-income individuals aged or with disabilities by covering some Medicare cost-sharing expenses. Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries (QMB) and Specified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiaries (SLMB) are eligible for Medicaid assistance with Medicare cost-sharing expenses. QMBs must meet income and asset criteria, while SLMBs must meet QMB criteria. States are required to cover Medicare premiums, deductibles, and coinsurance for these individuals, but other Medicaid services are not covered unless they qualify through other pathways. Medicare Beneficiaries (SLMB) have income between 100% and 120% of the FPL and states cover only the Medicare Part B premium. Qualifying Individuals (QI-1) have income between 120% and 135% of the FPL, with states paying the Medicare Part B premium until federal funds are depleted. Qualified Disabled and Working Individuals (QDWIs) have their Medicare Part A premiums covered by states. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA 2003, P.L. 108-173) affects Medicaid coverage for Medicare eligibles, providing outpatient prescription drug coverage through Medicare instead of Medicaid starting in 2006. State Medicaid programs will no longer cover drugs provided through Medicare under this act. Eligibility criteria include income below 200% of the FPL and resources below 200% of the SSI limit. Medicaid programs will no longer cover drugs provided through Medicare starting in 2006. States may provide Medicaid to certain groups in nursing facilities or institutions, with a special income standard not exceeding 300% of the maximum SSI benefit. Both the medically needy and those eligible under the \"300% rule\" must contribute their available income to the costs of their care. Medicaid has post-eligibility rules for beneficiaries to contribute income to care costs. Special spousal impoverishment protections exist for married couples. States can obtain waivers to provide home and community-based services to eligible individuals. In 2003, 35 states and the District of Columbia provided Medicaid to medically needy persons who do not meet income or resource requirements. Individuals can spend down to the medically needy standard by incurring medical expenses. States may set income standards for medically needy programs up to 133\u2153% of the standard used for the most closely related cash assistance program. Maximum income standards for families with children could be one-third more than the former AFDC program, and for individuals with disabilities or elderly, it could be one-third more than the SSI income standard. States have the option to limit the groups eligible for medically needy coverage, but must include all children under 18 and pregnant women who qualify under welfare-related groups. The Section 1115 waivers allow states to experiment with new approaches for providing health care coverage to pregnant women with lower income or resources. The Health Insurance Flexibility and Accountability Initiative encourages states to seek waivers to extend Medicaid and SCHIP to the uninsured, focusing on populations with incomes below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level. Some states use Section 1115 waivers to enact health reforms, extending coverage to low-income families. Legal immigrants are ineligible for Medicaid for the first five years in the US, with coverage being a state option after that period. Medicaid is required for legal immigrants who were receiving benefits before August 22, 1996, and for refugees and asylees for the first seven years after entry into the US. Legal immigrants in the US are eligible for Medicaid after five years, with coverage being a state option. Refugees, asylees, and certain other groups are eligible for Medicaid for the first seven years after entry into the US. Additionally, emergency Medicaid services are provided to all legal and undocumented non-citizens who meet the eligibility requirements, regardless of time in the country. COBRA allows employees or dependents leaving a group health insurance plan in a firm with 20+ employees to continue coverage for 18-36 months. Premiums can be no more than 102% of the average plan cost. State Medicaid may pay premiums for former employees if certain conditions are met. The Medicaid program offers various services to eligible individuals, including inpatient and outpatient hospital care, laboratory and X-ray services, physicians' services, family planning, and home health services. Eligibility is based on income and resources not exceeding twice the SSI limit. The Medicaid program provides a range of services, including inpatient and outpatient hospital care, laboratory and X-ray services, physicians' services, family planning, and home health services. States must ensure transportation for Medicaid-eligible individuals to medical care providers. Federal law mandates coverage for ambulatory services for children under 18, prenatal and delivery services for pregnant women, and home health services for those entitled to nursing facility services. The Medicaid program offers a range of services including hospital care, physician services, and home health services. States must provide mandatory services to all groups covered in the medically needy program, with the option to offer additional services like prescription drugs and inpatient psychiatric care. States can limit the amount and scope of care provided, and may impose nominal cost-sharing charges on some beneficiaries and services. In FY2002, Medicaid covered 51.5 million people, with the elderly and disabled making up a small percentage of enrollees but accounting for the majority of program spending. Total Medicaid spending increased by 16% between FY2002 and FY2004, reaching $300.3 billion. In FY2005, Congress provided approximately $29.7 billion for veterans health care programs, with VA funded by the federal government. VA also uses the Medical Care Collections Fund (MCCF) to provide care, with an estimated $1.98 billion in collections. Per diem payments are provided to states for care of eligible veterans in veterans' nursing homes, and medical care is also extended to certain spouses and children of veterans. VA provides medical care to certain spouses and children of service-connected disabled veterans under CHAMPVA. Eligibility for VA medical benefits is based on veterans' status determined by military experience. No veteran is automatically entitled to VA health care, as eligibility depends on funding availability. VA categorizes applicants based on veterans' status and service-connected status. Based on the Veterans Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996, VA categorizes veterans into priority groups based on service-connected disabilities or income levels. Priority Groups 1-6 are high priority veterans, while Priority Groups 7-8 are for veterans with nonservice-connected conditions and higher incomes. In 2003, VA temporarily suspended enrollment for Priority Group 8 veterans, but those already enrolled were not affected. The VA cannot provide timely medical services to all enrolled veterans due to the increase in veterans seeking care. Most veterans need to enroll to receive health care from VA, but non-enrolled veterans may receive care in certain cases. This includes veterans with service-connected disabilities, 50% or more disabled veterans, and recently discharged veterans with disabilities incurred in the line of duty. VA also provides free medical care to veterans who meet income and net worth criteria. The VA offers medical benefits to veterans based on income eligibility criteria, with income subject to verification. Once eligible, veterans remain eligible until reevaluation. VA provides a standardized medical benefits package including outpatient and inpatient services emphasizing preventive and primary care. The VA provides medical benefits to veterans based on income eligibility criteria, offering a standardized package that includes preventive and primary care services. In FY2004, 4.7 million unique veteran patients received care from VA, with services ranging from immunizations to long-term care options like nursing home care. In FY2004, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) provided medical care to 4.7 million unique veteran patients through various facilities including hospitals, nursing homes, outpatient clinics, and residential rehabilitation centers. The VHA's outpatient clinics recorded over 49 million visits by veterans. Medical care appropriations for veterans were $26.8 billion in FY2004 and $29.7 billion in FY2005. Additionally, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 established the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) to provide health insurance to low-income children. The State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) was established to provide health insurance to low-income children. Congress appropriated $39.7 billion in SCHIP federal matching grants for 10 years, with annual allotments varying from $3.2 billion to $5.0 billion. Funds are allocated to states based on the number of low-income children and uninsured children, as well as average health service industry wages. All states have submitted SCHIP program plans to CMS. Under SCHIP law, states have three fiscal years to spend their allotted funding. Any unspent funds will be redistributed to states that have fully spent their original allotments. The rules for reallocation vary by fiscal year, with excess funds available to redistribution states. After a set-aside for territories, unspent funds will expire at the end of the fiscal year in which they are reallocated. The remaining unspent funds for territories that exhausted their original allotments were divided among retention and redistribution states based on their contributions. Different rules were applied for reallocation in FY2000 and FY2001 under P.L. 108-74. A set-aside was made for territories, retention states kept half of their unused funds, and the rest was distributed among redistribution states. The final rule for reallocation of unspent FY2002 funds followed BBA 97 requirements. The reallocation of unspent FY2002 funds followed BBA 97 requirements, with redistribution among states that fully expended their allotments by the three-year deadline. Five \"shortfall states\" received access to FY2002 redistribution money, while the remaining balance was divided among 28 redistribution states based on excess spending above the FY2002 allotments. Access to reallocated funds in SCHIP financing during FY2005 allowed states to access funds from multiple years, with expenditures typically applied in chronological order. However, CMS regulations gave redistribution states the flexibility to define the order of applying expenditures against available accounts for optimal fund utilization. States were given flexibility to decide the order of using redistributed funds in SCHIP financing, with expenditures typically applied chronologically. The state's share of program spending is determined by the enhanced FMAP, which is based on the state's Medicaid FMAP and the percentage points difference from 100%. No more than 10% of federal funds for SCHIP can be used by a state. Under SCHIP, states have flexibility in determining eligibility for targeted low-income children, considering factors like geography, age, income, and disability status. Funds cannot be used for children eligible for Medicaid or other insurance. States can cover children with family incomes above Medicaid standards but below 200% of the federal poverty level. No more than 10% of federal funds can be used for administrative expenses. The SCHIP program allows states to determine eligibility for low-income children based on factors like income and age. States can cover children with family incomes above Medicaid standards but below 200% of the federal poverty level. States can also make changes to their SCHIP programs through Section 1115 waivers. The Health Insurance Flexibility and Accountability Demonstration Initiative was announced by the Bush Administration on August 4, 2001. The Health Insurance Flexibility and Accountability (HIFA) Demonstration Initiative, using Section 1115 waiver authority, aims to expand Medicaid and SCHIP to the uninsured, focusing on maximizing private health insurance coverage options for those below 200% FPL. 15 states had approved SCHIP Section 1115 waivers by May 2005, with additional proposals under review. Eight states have approved HIFA demonstrations, expanding SCHIP coverage to include adults with children in nine states. Some states use Section 1115 waivers to expand Medicaid and SCHIP coverage to adults with children, caretaker relatives, legal guardians, pregnant women, and childless adults. States have also used waivers for purposes such as requiring periods of no insurance prior to enrollment, modifying cost-sharing rules, offering premium assistance programs, and providing temporary disaster relief. Ohio implemented an annual enrollment fee and 12 months of continuous eligibility for targeted low-income children in its Medicaid program. States have options for designing their SCHIP programs, including expanding Medicaid, creating separate state insurance programs, or a combination of both. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five territories have SCHIP programs. States must provide full Medicaid benefits for targeted low-income children if they choose to expand Medicaid. Separate SCHIP programs can offer three benefit options. Benchmark equivalent coverage for uninsured children under SCHIP includes three plan options: the standard Blue Cross/Blue Shield plan, state employee health coverage, or the HMO with the largest commercial enrollment in the state. States must cover basic benefits like hospital services and physician care in their chosen plan. Benchmark equivalent coverage for uninsured children under SCHIP includes basic benefits such as inpatient and outpatient hospital services, physicians' surgical and medical services, lab and X-ray services, well-baby and well-child care, and age-appropriate immunizations. Additional services like prescription drugs, mental health services, vision services, and hearing services must also be covered, totaling at least 75% of the actuarial value of coverage under the benchmark plan. States have the flexibility to determine the amount, duration, and scope of services covered, with the option to provide a benchmark plan. Abortions are only covered in cases of rape, incest, or to save the mother's life. Benchmark equivalent plans under SCHIP can limit benefit packages as long as they are actuarially equivalent. Cost sharing is generally not allowed for medical services, except for nominal amounts for program participation. States covering low-income children must follow Medicaid's cost-sharing rules. Premiums or enrollment fees may be imposed for separate state SCHIP programs, but they are subject to limits. Under separate state programs, income-related charges for families under 150% FPL must not exceed federal Medicaid regulations. Service-related cost sharing for children at or below 100% FPL is limited to nominal amounts, while those between 101% and 150% FPL must meet adjusted nominal amounts. Cost-sharing maximums for each 12-month period cannot exceed 5% of the family's annual income. Higher-income families may face service-related cost sharing without specific limits. The State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) imposes cost-sharing for children based on family income, with a maximum annual aggregate cost sharing of 5% of total family income. States must inform families of these limits, provide a way to stop payments once limits are reached, and give notice before disenrollment. Enrollment in SCHIP reached nearly 6.2 million children, with 1 million enrolled in 1998 and nearly 2 million in 1999 under various state programs. The latest official numbers show that SCHIP enrollment reached nearly 6.2 million children in FY2004, with almost 4.4 million covered in separate state programs and 1.8 million targeted low-income children under Medicaid. Total SCHIP enrollment for adults was 513,569 in FY2004. Expenditures under SCHIP have been a subject of debate since its inception, with slow initial participation rates leading to delayed spending ramp-up. In FY2005, over half of the states qualified for unused funds from FY2002. $26.4 billion of the $40 billion federal SCHIP appropriation from FY1998 to FY2004 was available, with $18.3 billion spent by FY2004. $1.3 billion expired in FY2004, and 33 states forfeited funds. For more information on SCHIP, refer to CRS Report RL30473 and CRS Report RL32807. Funding Projections and State Redistribution Issues: Indian Health Service (IHS) appropriations are allocated among its 12 service areas through a \"historical\" basis. Using a Resource Allocation Methodology (RAM), the Service distributes funds based on health deficiencies. Tribes can administer health services with about 52% of IHS funds. IHS collects reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid. In FY2002, IHS collected $534.8 million in reimbursements. In FY2002, IHS collected $534.8 million in reimbursements; in FY2003, this increased to $591.7 million; and in FY2004, to $634.4 million. Total program appropriations were $3.392 billion in FY2002, $3.541 billion in FY2003, $3.706 billion in FY2004, and $3.773 billion in FY2005. Eligible individuals are of American Indian or Alaskan Native descent and can receive health services without an income test. The program serves Indians living on federal reservations and in Indian communities. The Indian Health Service (IHS) program provides health services to American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) living on federal reservations, in Indian communities, and in urban areas. The IHS contracts with urban Indian organizations to make health services more accessible to urban Indians. Services include hospital, medical, dental care, environmental health, outpatient services, mobile clinics, public health nurses, and preventive care. All services are provided free of charge to beneficiaries. The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides health services to American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) free of charge. Services are reimbursed if the eligible AI/AN has private insurance. The program includes various service units, hospitals, health centers, clinics, and contractual arrangements with non-federal healthcare providers. The Health Care Safety Net Amendments of 2002 reauthorized the health centers grant program. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) provides grants under Section 330 of the PHS Act for health centers serving medically underserved groups. Centers must contribute to project costs and seek reimbursement from sources like Medicare and Medicaid. Grants are awarded for planning, operating, and infant mortality purposes. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) provides grants under Section 330 of the PHS Act for health centers serving medically underserved groups. These grants assist with operation costs of a center and infant mortality reduction efforts. The FY2005 appropriations were $1.7 billion, serving an estimated 13.1 million persons. Health centers provide primary health services to medically underserved populations, including migratory and seasonal agricultural workers, the homeless, and residents of public housing. Health centers funded by HRSA under Section 330 of the PHS Act provide primary care services to underserved populations based on factors like physician ratio, infant mortality rate, and poverty levels. Profit-making organizations are ineligible for grants, and services are available to all residents in the area. Free services are limited to those below the federal poverty income guidelines, with nominal fees for others based on ability to pay. Health centers funded by HRSA under Section 330 of the PHS Act provide primary care services to underserved populations based on factors like physician ratio, infant mortality rate, and poverty levels. Full payment is required from those with income exceeding twice the poverty level. Services include diagnostic, treatment, preventive, emergency, transportation, and dental services. Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant supports activities to improve health status of mothers and children, with funds distributed to state governments for services and special projects. The Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant program (CISS) allocates funds to states based on FY1981 funding levels and the number of low-income children. States must match federal funds at a ratio of $3 to $4. A minimum of 30% of funds must be used for preventive and primary care for children, and another 30% for children with special needs. The remaining 40% can be used for maternal and child health services, including care for pregnant women and infants. Up to 10% of funds can be used for administrative costs, and 15% must be set aside for SPRANS activities. In FY2004, $600 million was allocated for SPRANS activities in various categories such as research, training, genetic disease programs, and maternal and child health improvement. When the block grant appropriation exceeds $600 million, 12.75% of the excess amount is set aside for CISS projects. The funds from this set-aside are used for initiatives like case management, increasing participation of healthcare providers, integrated delivery systems, and community-based programs. FY2004 appropriations were $730 million with non-federal matching funds estimated at $547 million, while FY2005 appropriation was $724 million. States determine eligibility criteria for the MCH block grant. In FY2005, the MCH block grant appropriation was $724 million. States set eligibility criteria for services targeting low-income mothers and children, offering prenatal care, dental care, immunization, and other health services. States determine the level of services provided under the block grant, including inpatient care for children with special health needs and counseling services for parents of sudden infant death syndrome victims. Title V provides services to pregnant women, infants, children with special health care needs, and women of child-bearing age. Charges for services are based on a sliding scale reflecting income and family size. Grants are also provided for voluntary family planning services through Title X. Title X funds support family planning clinics, with grants given to various public and nonprofit agencies. Priority is given to low-income individuals, particularly women aged 15-44 at risk of unplanned pregnancy. Services must be provided free of charge to those below 100% of the federal poverty income guidelines. Congress has continued to fund the program since FY1985, with appropriations of $286 million in FY2005. Title X funds support family planning clinics, offering services to low-income individuals, particularly women aged 15-44 at risk of unplanned pregnancy. Clinics must provide free services to those below 100% of the federal poverty income guidelines, with a sliding scale for incomes between 100% and 250%. Required services include a range of family planning methods, counseling, exams, infertility services, and more. Abortion cannot be funded with Title X money. In FY2004, 4.8 million people received services through 4,500 clinic sites. Title X funds support family planning clinics through 4,500 clinic sites. Clinics provided millions of screenings and tests, serving adolescents and low-income individuals. INA authorizes federally funded medical assistance for refugees and asylees for up to three years. Funding has been appropriated since FY1992 for medical care for the first eight months after entry, administered by ORR. The Department of Health and Human Service's Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) administers refugee medical assistance (RMA) with expenditures of $92 million in FY2004. Eligibility criteria include being admitted to the US as a refugee or asylee, Cuban/Haitian entrant, asylum applicant, or Vietnam-born Amerasian immigrant fathered by a US citizen. The Department of Health and Human Service's Office of Refugee Resettlement administers refugee medical assistance (RMA) for eligible individuals who do not qualify for Medicaid due to categorical requirements. RMA provides medical benefits to needy refugees for seven years after entry, with continued participation at state discretion. States determine the scope of services and reimbursement rates, except for hospital care. Refugee Admissions and Resettlement Policy includes Supplemental Security Income (SSI) providing a minimum income floor funded by U.S. general revenues. States can choose to give additional payments to SSI recipients. A grandfather clause mandates states to provide supplements to individuals previously enrolled in pre-SSI programs. States can either have the federal government administer supplements for all federal SSI recipients or administer their own supplements. As of January 2005, the federal government administered supplements for 15 jurisdictions, with total SSI benefit outlays in CY2004 at $39.3 billion. The federal share of total state SSI benefits ranged from 48% to 100% in different jurisdictions. Title XVI of the Social Security Act entitles aged 65 and over, blind or disabled individuals to SSI payments if they meet income and resource limits and live in specific locations. To be eligible for SSI on grounds of disability, an adult must be unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity due to a medically determined impairment. A child under 18 may qualify as disabled if they have marked and severe functional limitations. Additionally, to qualify for SSI, a person must be a citizen of the United States or an immigrant enrolled in SSI before August 22, 1996. To qualify for SSI benefits, a person must be a citizen of the United States or meet specific criteria as an immigrant. This includes being enrolled in SSI before August 22, 1996, being a refugee or asylee for fewer than seven years, having enough work credits for Social Security, or being a veteran or active duty member of the armed forces. Income limits for federal benefits in 2005 are $579 monthly per individual and $869 per couple, with higher limits in states with supplementary SSI benefits. SSI benefits have higher countable income limits, up to $926 monthly per individual in Alaska in 2004. The countable resource limit has been $2,000 per individual and $3,000 per couple since 1989. Excluded assets include a home, household goods, personal effects, an auto if needed for employment or medical treatment, a life insurance policy not exceeding $1,500, and burial plots and funds. P.L. 98-21 requires SSA to inform Social Security beneficiaries aged 64 about SSI when notifying them about Medicare eligibility. The Social Security Act establishes benefit levels and requires COLA adjustments for Social Security benefits. Social Security benefits are increased through a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), with SSI benefits also increasing by the same percentage. In 1983, Congress delayed the COLA to January 1984 and increased SSI benefits by $20 monthly. States supplementing SSI benefits must pass through federal increases. In 2004, state supplements for aged persons living have higher income limits and resource exclusions. In January 2004, state supplements for aged persons living independently ranged from $1.70 in Oregon to $362 in Alaska. SSI disregards a portion of recipients' earnings to ensure some gain from work. Aged SSI recipients without other income can still receive a declining SSI payment until their gross earnings double their basic benefit plus $85 monthly. The gross income limit for an aged SSI recipient with only wage income in 2005 was $1,243 monthly in states without supplement benefits. SSI recipients are automatically eligible for Medicaid in all but 12 states. In 12 states with stricter rules, medical expenses of SSI recipients are deducted from their countable income. Disabled SSI recipients can receive special cash benefits if their monthly earnings exceed the substantial gainful activity test, preserving Medicaid eligibility. In 1996, Congress ended benefits for individuals disabled due to drug or alcohol addiction. In July 2005, over 7 million people received federally administered SSI benefits, with average payments ranging from $359 to $523. In December 2003, about 35% of SSI recipients also received Social Security benefits. Earnings of SSI recipients averaged $310 monthly, with dual recipients receiving an average of $422 in Social Security benefits. The EITC benefit is 100% federally funded and totaled $39.1 billion in tax year 2003. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) totaled $39.1 billion in tax year 2003, with $3.7 billion used to offset taxes and $34.4 billion issued as refunds. The EITC is a refundable credit that does not require owing or paying income tax to receive. Eligible workers must apply for the credit by filing an income tax return, and married couples generally must file jointly. The credit is based on earnings and the number of children, up to a maximum amount, with a phase-out income level where it is reduced for higher earnings. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is available to parents with earnings above the phase-out income level and a qualifying child. The child must be under age 19 (24 if a full-time student) and reside with the tax filer for more than half of the tax year. The tax filer must be a U.S. citizen or resident alien and live in the United States for more than half of the tax year. Workers ages 25-64 with no eligible children and AGI less than $11,750 ($13,750 for married couples) in tax year 2005 are also eligible for the EITC. Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) limit for EITC eligibility was set at $11,750 ($13,750 for married couples) in 2005. Congress implemented measures to prevent fraud in claiming EITC, including requiring social security numbers for tax filer and qualifying children. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 imposed penalties for fraudulent claims, barring offenders from claiming EITC for 10 years. The EITC was enacted in 1975 as a temporary measure to return a portion of the employment taxes paid by lower-income workers with children. Congress increased the credit in the 1990s, expanded it based on family size, and extended it to childless individuals. The law imposed penalties for fraudulent claims, including a 10-year ban on claiming the EITC for reckless or intentional disregard of rules. Paid preparers failing to meet due diligence requirements faced a $100 penalty. Members of the armed forces were allowed to include combat pay for computing the earned income credit for certain tax years. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (P.L. 107-16) made changes to the EITC for married tax filers filing jointly, increasing the phase-out range and simplifying the credit calculation. Tax filers no longer need to include nontaxable income from employment and can use adjusted gross income (AGI) instead of modified adjusted gross income. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and subsequent welfare reform laws changed the treatment of the EITC in means-tested programs. States have flexibility in how they treat the EITC in their TANF programs. Recipients engaged in workfare may have their EITC for TANF earnings disallowed. The EITC parameters for tax years 2003-2005 are shown in a table. Federal and state expenditures for TANF cash aid in FY2004 were estimated at $10.4 billion. The 1996 welfare reform law combined funding for AFDC, EA, and JOBS into a block grant for TANF. Each state receives an annual family assistance grant based on peak funding. The 1996 welfare reform law replaced AFDC, EA, and JOBS with a TANF block grant, providing states with annual family assistance grants. Territories and Indian tribes are also eligible for TANF grants, with additional funds available for qualifying states through various grants and bonuses. The TANF law established a contingency fund for states with high unemployment and increased food stamp caseloads, Welfare-to-Work grants for job creation efforts, and a revolving loan fund for state TANF operations. States must meet maintenance-of-effort levels to avoid penalties, with the MOE level set at 75-80% of historic expenditures on welfare programs. If a state fails to meet work participation minimums, the MOE level rises to 80%. State funds in separate programs count towards the TANF MOE rule. However, for the contingency fund, a higher state spending requirement is imposed (100% of historic level). TANF allows states to provide ongoing cash aid to needy families with minor children or pregnant women. States determine who is \"needy\" and set income and resource limits. Unwed mothers under 18 and their children are ineligible for TANF-funded cash aid unless they live in an adult-supervised arrangement and attend school if they are high school dropouts. TANF eligibility criteria include restrictions on school dropouts, drug-related felons, recent immigrants, and those who commit fraud. There is a benefit cutoff time limit for adults receiving TANF assistance. States must require recipients to engage in work activities to receive federally funded aid. States must enforce work requirements for TANF recipients after a maximum of 24 months of aid, with varying work trigger limits across jurisdictions. To meet minimum participation rates, specified work activities are countable, and recipients must work a minimum number of hours weekly based on their family composition. Single parents with young children must work 20 hours per week, while those with older children must work 30 hours. Two-parent families face longer work week requirements. In FY2000, TANF recipients must comply with work requirements or face sanctions, including aid reduction for refusal to work and assigning support rights to the state. Some states exempt single parents with children under one from work requirements, while others require work before the child turns one. The TANF program allows states to reduce benefits for non-compliance with requirements such as school attendance, immunization, and parenting classes. States can also waive certain rules for victims of domestic violence under the Family Violence Option. The TANF program allows states to reduce benefits for non-compliance with requirements such as school attendance, immunization, and parenting classes. A CRS telephone survey found that maximum benefits for a three-person TANF family in January 2004 ranged from $170 in Mississippi to $709 in Vermont and $923 in Alaska. The 1996 law retained AFDC eligibility limits for use in Medicaid, foster care, and adoption assistance, requiring states to provide Medicaid coverage and benefits to those who would be eligible for AFDC cash aid. States may increase income and resource standards by the percentage rise in the consumer price index since enactment of TANF. The law extends federal foster care and adoption assistance to children eligible for AFDC cash aid as of July 16, 1996. Nonassistance benefits under TANF are not subject to time limits or work requirements but must align with TANF goals. States determine eligibility and income limits for different services. For more details, refer to CRS Report RL32748 and The 2004 Green Book on TANF. Title IV-E of the Social Security Act provides federal matching funds to states for maintenance payments for low-income children in foster care. The federal matching rate ranges from 50% to 77.08%, with additional matching funds for certain administrative and training expenses. In FY2004, expenditures totaled $8.6 billion, with 53% from federal funds. In FY2004, $8.6 billion was spent on foster care, with $4.5 billion (53%) from federal funds. To claim federal payments for a child in foster care, there must be a judicial determination that efforts were made to keep the child at home and that it's not in the child's best interest to remain there. Continued eligibility requires regular judicial reviews to ensure efforts are being made to find a permanent placement. States can also claim federal payments for children in foster care under voluntary placement agreements with certain judicial findings within 180 days. In FY2004, federal funds accounted for 53% of the $8.6 billion spent on foster care. To claim federal payments, efforts must be made to keep the child at home, and regular judicial reviews are required for continued eligibility. Children in foster care must meet AFDC eligibility standards, be placed in licensed homes, and have a written case plan. States must make reasonable efforts to prevent foster care placement and reunify children with their families when possible. Administrative costs in FY2004 represented 57% of total federal spending for foster care. In FY2002, maintenance payments for foster care varied widely, with an average monthly payment of $423 for a 2-year-old, $440 for a 9-year-old, and $497 for a 16-year-old. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program, established in 1986 and expanded in 1999 and 2001, provides grants to assist foster children aging out of care and transitioning to independent living. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program provides grants to assist foster children aging out of care and transitioning to independent living. A separate grant is also authorized for education and training vouchers for these youth, which are not means-tested. The program is 100% federally funded through the tax system, with $31.9 billion claimed in child credits for tax year 2004. Eligibility for the child credit requires having a child under age 17 and being able to claim a dependent exemption for the child. The child tax credit begins with eligibility based on claiming a dependent exemption for a qualifying child. The credit amount has varied over the years, with increases up to $1,000 in tax year 2010 before reverting back to $500 in 2011. The child tax credit amount has varied over the years, reaching $1,000 per child for tax years 2003-2004. The credit is refundable for a percentage of the taxpayer's earned income above $10,000, with changes in refundability starting in 2004. Prior to EGTRRA, the credit was refundable in two ways, including as a supplemental credit with the Earned Income Tax Credit. The Child Tax Credit is phased out based on income thresholds for different filing statuses. The refundable portion of the credit does not count as income for determining eligibility for federal or state benefits. Federal funding for veterans' and survivors' pensions totaled $3.391 billion in FY2004 and was expected to reach $3.294 billion in FY2005. The veteran's pension eligibility requires a discharge from active service of 90 days or more, with at least one day served during a period of war. The survivor pension is for spouses and children of wartime veterans who died of nonservice-connected causes. The Department of Veterans Affairs pays monthly amounts to qualified veterans to bring their total incomes to specified levels, with maximum benefits shown below. The veteran's pension eligibility is based on discharge from active service of 90 days or more, with at least one day served during a period of war. Pensions can be reduced for medical and educational expenses. Since 1979, applications are processed under the Improved Law program, which provides higher benefits but has eliminated most exclusions. The Improved Law program covers 98% of pension costs and 88% of beneficiaries. Title IV-E of the Social Security Act provides federal matching funds to states for adopting low-income children with special needs. The federal matching rate for adoption assistance ranged from 50% to 77.08% in FY2004. The 1986 tax reform legislation authorized 50% federal matching for certain adoption expenses up to $2,000. FY2004 expenditures were $2.9 billion, with $1.6 billion from federal funds. Eligibility criteria include SSI or AFDC program standards. The federal government provides adoption assistance to children with special needs, including those who meet SSI or AFDC program standards. The amount of adoption payment is determined by the state adoption assistance agency and cannot exceed what would have been paid to maintain the child in a foster family home. Children receiving federally subsidized adoption assistance are automatically eligible for Medicaid. Benefits can continue until the child reaches age 18. Parents of veterans who died from a service-connected cause are eligible for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) if their income is below certain limits. In FY2004, there were over 315,000 DIC recipients, including low-income parents. Annual income limits in 2004 were $11,560 for a sole surviving parent unremarried and $15,538 for a sole surviving remarried parent. In 2004, DIC rates for parents were established by the Veterans' and Survivors' Pension Improvement Act of 1978. The maximum monthly benefit for a sole surviving parent was $487, while for one of two parents not living with a spouse, it was $352. There are no net worth rules for the DIC program. In 2004, the DIC program provided monthly payments to parents of deceased veterans, with a maximum of $330 for one parent living with a spouse. Additional aid and attendance allowance of $263 was available for parents in need. General Assistance (GA) to Indians is funded by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) with 100% federal funding, totaling $68.7 million in FY2004. Needy Indians who are members of a recognized tribe are eligible for assistance. Tribes can redesign their own GA programs with BIA approval. Needy Indians who are members of recognized tribes or Alaskan Natives with at least one-fourth degree Native blood are eligible for General Assistance (GA) funded by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). They must meet state TANF program standards, reside in the tribe's service area, and actively seek work. They cannot receive TANF or SSI and must apply for other eligible aid programs. Needy Indians who are members of recognized tribes or Alaskan Natives with at least one-fourth degree Native blood are eligible for General Assistance (GA) funded by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). They must meet state TANF program standards, reside in the tribe's service area, and actively seek work. Certain sums of earned income are disregarded in determining benefits, including taxes, work-related expenses, child care costs, and shelter costs. Liquid resources up to $2,000 annually and home produce are also disregarded as income or resources. General Assistance (GA) is available to needy Indians and Alaskan Natives with at least one-fourth degree Native blood. They must meet TANF program standards, reside in the tribe's service area, and actively seek work. Certain income is disregarded, and liquid resources up to $2,000 annually are exempt. GA eligibility must be reviewed periodically, with an expected increase in the caseload. Many Indians enrolled in TANF may remain ineligible for GA due to TANF's 60-month limit, which does not apply in Indian country or Alaska Native villages with high unemployment rates. The General Assistance (GA) program provides cash payments and work experience/training to needy Indians and Alaskan Natives with at least one-fourth degree Native blood. GA payments are based on state need standards under the TANF program, with maximum monthly benefits varying by state. The program aims to increase self-sufficiency, and as more Indian TANF recipients exceed their time limits, the GA caseload is expected to rise. The state TANF program sets varying maximum monthly benefits, ranging from $170 in Mississippi to $923 in Alaska. GA recipients participating in the Tribal Work Experience Program receive an extra monthly payment for work experience and job skills training. TWEP programs can be integrated into self-determination contracts and federally-funded employment and training programs. Needy refugees and asylees are eligible for 100% federally funded cash assistance for their first three years in the United States. Needy refugees and asylees in the United States receive federally funded cash assistance for their first three years, administered by the Department of Health and Human Service's Office of Refugee Resettlement. Funding has been appropriated for the first eight months after entry, with estimated expenditures of $41.6 million in FY2004. Eligibility criteria include being admitted as a refugee or asylee, Cuban or Haitian entrant, or having an asylum application pending. After October 10, 1980, refugees, asylees, and certain other groups are eligible for Temporary Aid for Needy Families (TANF) for five years, provided they meet state income and asset tests. Those who do not qualify for TANF or SSI may receive Refugee Cash Assistance (RCA) if deemed needy by state standards. Participation beyond five years is at the state's discretion. Under PRWORA, refugees who qualify for SSI are eligible for seven years after entry, instead of permanently. If they were receiving SSI by August 22, 1996, they remain eligible. RCA payment levels are based on the state's TANF payment to a family unit of the same size. Under PRWORA, refugees qualifying for SSI receive RCA benefits equivalent to a two-person TANF family. Federal funds cover food stamp benefits, administrative costs, and training programs, with states responsible for the remaining expenses. Puerto Rico and American Samoa receive annual grants instead of food stamps for nutrition assistance. In FY2004, Puerto Rico and American Samoa received $1.4 billion and $5.6 million in grants, respectively, for nutrition assistance. The Northern Marianas received $8.3 million based on identified needs. The Food Stamp program has eligibility tests including income limits, asset limitations, employment requirements, and restrictions on noncitizen eligibility. Recipients of TANF, SSI, or GA programs are usually automatically eligible for food stamps for up to five months after leaving the program. Households may qualify for food stamps for up to five months after leaving a TANF program if their monthly income falls below the federal poverty guidelines. Income limits are adjusted annually and include all cash income except for certain payments made to third parties. Additionally, basic monthly income must be below 130% of the poverty guidelines for households without an elderly or disabled member to qualify. Changes in income limits take effect each October. Certain types of income are excluded when determining eligibility for food stamps, including lump-sum payments, federal earned income tax credits, federal energy assistance, reimbursements, income earned by children in school, self-employment income costs, education assistance, student aid for tuition and fees, certain payments under the Workforce Investment Act, income set aside by disabled SSI recipients, and other types of income required to be disregarded by federal laws. States may also exclude certain income within limits. States have the flexibility to exclude certain income when determining eligibility for TANF or Medicaid. Net monthly income is calculated by deducting a standard monthly deduction, 20% of earned income, dependent care expenses, medical expenses for elderly or disabled household members, shelter expenses, and child support payments. Monthly net and gross income limits vary by location. The asset test for food stamps in the US excludes certain liquid assets, with a limit of $2,000 or $3,000 for households with elderly or disabled members. The value of a vehicle owned by an applicant household is considered as an asset, with varying rules by state. Some states disregard the value of a vehicle or apply a more liberal threshold. The asset test does not apply to automatically eligible TANF, SSI, and GA households. States also have the flexibility to exclude certain assets when determining eligibility. Certain nonworking able-bodied adult household members must register for employment, accept a suitable job if offered one, fulfill work requirements, provide necessary information to the welfare agency, and not quit a job without good cause. Exemptions include caregivers, those already meeting work requirements, full-time workers, postsecondary students, residents of treatment programs, and the disabled. Certain nonworking able-bodied adult household members must fulfill work requirements to receive food stamps. Exemptions include caregivers, full-time workers, postsecondary students, residents of treatment programs, and the disabled. Failure to meet requirements may result in disqualification for the entire household for up to 180 days. Individual disqualification periods vary based on the number of violations, ranging from one to six months and potentially permanent disqualification. Additional rules apply to able-bodied adults without dependents. Certain nonworking able-bodied adult household members must fulfill work requirements to receive food stamps. Exemptions include caregivers, full-time workers, postsecondary students, residents of treatment programs, and the disabled. Failure to meet requirements may result in disqualification for the entire household for up to 180 days. Individual disqualification periods vary based on the number of violations, ranging from one to six months and potentially permanent disqualification. Additional rules apply to able-bodied adults without dependents, who may be disqualified from receiving food stamps for three months if they do not work at least 20 hours a week or participate in an approved work/training activity. They can re-enter the program by working 80 hours or more in a 30-day period or participating in a work/training activity. They are allowed only one additional three-month period in any 36 months without half-time work or enrollment in a work/training effort. States must operate work and training programs for welfare recipients to fulfill employment requirements. Categorical eligibility restrictions include bans on noncitizens, striking members, nonworking postsecondary students without families, and persons living in institutional settings. The Food Stamp Act specifies eligibility criteria including bans on certain individuals, limits on participation, requirements for Social Security numbers, and denial of eligibility for various reasons such as intentional rule violations or asset transfers. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Thrifty Food Plan determines monthly food stamp allotments based on household size and income. Benefits are issued through EBT cards for purchasing food at approved stores. The Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act provides federal subsidies for free or reduced-price lunches served to needy children in schools and residential child care institutions. The cash subsidy consists of a basic payment for every lunch served and an additional special assistance payment for free or reduced lunches. The federal government provides cash subsidies and commodity assistance for lunches served to lower-income children under Section 11 of the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act. State and local government funds, children's payments, and a charge of up to 40 cents for reduced-price lunches help finance the program. Schools can set charges for lunches served to children who do not qualify for free or reduced-price lunches, as long as it does not result in a profit. States are required to contribute at least 30% of the total federal funding provided in the 1980-1981 school year to their lunch programs. The federal government provides cash subsidies and commodity assistance for lunches served to lower-income children under Section 11 of the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act. All children are eligible to receive at least a partially subsidized lunch in participating schools and RCCIs, with higher subsidies for free or reduced-price meals. Schools must meet nutrition requirements, offer free and reduced-price meals to lower-income children, and not make a profit on their meal program to receive federal subsidies. Children with family incomes at or below 130% of the federal poverty guidelines are eligible for a free lunch. Children with family incomes between 130% and 185% of the federal poverty guidelines are eligible for reduced-price school lunches. Annual income limits for a family of four in the 2004-2005 school year were $24,505 for free lunches and up to $34,873 for reduced-price lunches. Schools receive federal cash subsidies for each lunch served, with specific reimbursement rates adjusted annually for inflation. Reimbursement rates for the 2004-2005 school year were $2.24 for each free lunch, $1.84 for each reduced-price lunch, and 21 cents for each full-price lunch. The federal government also provides commodity assistance for all meals served in participating schools and residential child care institutions, with an assistance rate of 17.25 cents a meal. Schools in the School Lunch program can expand to cover snacks and suppers for children through age 18, with federal subsidies varying based on family income. In FY2004, over 90% of schools and RCCIs received school lunch program subsidies, with about 29 million children participating daily. 14.1 million children received free lunches, 2.8 million had reduced-price lunches, and 12 million students had subsidized lunches at the full-price rate. Subsidies for free or reduced-price lunches accounted for over 90% of federal spending on the school lunch program. The Child Nutrition Act provides 100% federal funding through grants to states for food costs and nutrition services and administration. State allocations are based on a formula reflecting food and NSA caseload costs, inflation, and poverty indices. WIC benefits are available for lower-income mothers, infants, and children at nutritional risk. WIC program provides benefits for mothers, infants, and children at nutritional risk. Recipients must be certified by a professional authority and meet income eligibility criteria. Income limits are based on federal poverty guidelines. The WIC program provides benefits based on federal poverty guidelines, with states setting lower income limits not below 100% of the poverty guidelines. Funding limits eligibility, with a priority system ensuring those at greatest risk are served first, aiming to reach at least 80% of the eligible population. In FY2004, the WIC program served an average monthly participation of 7.9 million women, infants, and children by providing supplemental foods through food packages or vouchers/checks. Federal regulations govern the types and quantities of food available, with state agencies having some flexibility in designing food packages. The national average monthly federal cost of food in a WIC voucher/package was $38 in FY2004. The WIC program in FY2004 provided a $38 voucher/package (after rebates) for supplemental foods, along with nutritional evaluations, breastfeeding support, and nutrition education. States also offered a farmers' market nutrition program. The Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act provided 100% federal funding for meals and snacks in participating child and adult day care centers. Federal subsidies for meals and snacks are provided to licensed public and private nonresidential nonprofit child care, adult care, and Head Start centers, sponsors of after-school programs, and family/group day care homes. Subsidies are based on the number of meals served and participants' family income or provider's income level. Administrative payments are also given to sponsors of day care homes, with limited federal commodity assistance available. Matching funds from non-federal sources are not required. Federal subsidies are available for meals and snacks served at licensed child care centers and group day care homes that meet federal nutrition requirements. For-profit child care institutions are also eligible, with limitations based on serving lower-income children. Participation is voluntary, with higher subsidies for those serving free or reduced-price meals to lower-income individuals. Subsidies are highest for those with household incomes below 130% of the federal poverty guidelines. Federal subsidies are available for meals and snacks served at licensed child care centers and group day care homes based on household income levels. Subsidies are highest for those below 130% of the federal poverty guidelines, with lesser subsidies for those between 130% and 185% of the guidelines. Centers have flexibility in adjusting fees to account for subsidies, and all children in participating family day care homes receive federally subsidized meals/snacks. Federal subsidies are provided for meals and snacks at licensed child care centers and group day care homes based on household income levels. Subsidies vary depending on income, with higher subsidies for those below 130% of the federal poverty guidelines. Participating centers receive cash subsidies for meals, with amounts ranging from $2.24 to 21 cents for lunches/suppers and $1.23 to 23 cents for breakfasts. Snack subsidies range from 61 cents to 5 cents. Centers may also receive federal commodity assistance or cash in lieu of commodities. Federal subsidies for family day care homes differ from those for licensed child care centers and group day care homes. Family day care homes receive two distinct annually indexed subsidy rates, with \"Tier I\" homes in lower-income areas receiving higher cash subsidies and \"Tier II\" homes receiving lower subsidies. For July 2004 through June 2005, Tier I homes had lunches/suppers subsidized at $1.92, breakfasts at $1.04, and snacks at 57 cents, while Tier II homes had lunches/suppers subsidized at $1.16, breakfasts at 39 cents, and snacks at 15 cents. Organizations sponsoring homes receive monthly payments for administrative costs, varying by the number of homes sponsored. Tier II homes may seek higher rates for meals/snacks served to low-income children with proper documentation. Public and private nonprofit organizations operating after-school programs can receive federal subsidies for snacks served free to children in lower-income areas. Subsidies are also offered for suppers in after-school programs. In FY2004, 46,000 child care centers and 2,500 adult care centers participated in the program. The Child Nutrition Act provides federal subsidies for free or reduced-price breakfasts served to needy children in schools and residential child care institutions. Approximately 95% of the subsidy costs are for meals served to needy children, with some schools designated as \"severe need\" schools receiving higher subsidies. State and local government funds, as well as children's meal payments, also contribute to financing breakfast programs. The Child Nutrition Act provides federal subsidies for free or reduced-price breakfasts in schools and residential child care institutions. Schools and institutions must meet nutrition requirements and offer free or reduced-price meals to lower-income children to receive subsidies. Children with family incomes at or below 130% of the federal poverty guidelines are eligible for a free breakfast. The federal poverty income guidelines determine eligibility for free or reduced-price breakfasts in schools and residential child care institutions. Annual income limits are adjusted for inflation, with specific reimbursement rates for each type of breakfast served. Children from families receiving public assistance can also be certified eligible for free breakfasts. The federal poverty income guidelines determine eligibility for free or reduced-price breakfasts in schools and residential child care institutions. Reimbursement rates for each type of breakfast served are adjusted annually for inflation. In FY2004, 78% of schools in the School Lunch program also operated breakfast programs, with a total average daily participation of 8.9 million children. The Older Americans Act provides funding for nutrition services programs, including congregate and home-delivered meal services. Federal funds cover up to 85% of project costs, with states receiving allotments based on their share of the population aged 60 and over. States can also receive funds for commodities or cash in lieu of commodities from HHS/AoA. The Older Americans Act provides funding for congregate and home-delivered meal services for persons aged 60 and over, as well as their spouses. Funds are allocated to states based on the number of meals served in the previous fiscal year. Eligible individuals for home-delivered meals are those who are homebound due to illness or disability. Preference is given to those with the greatest economic and social need. Total FY2005 appropriations for the nutrition program were $719 million. The Older Americans Act prioritizes individuals with the greatest economic and social need for congregate meal services. Group one includes those with income at or below the poverty guideline, while group two consists of individuals whose need is due to noneconomic factors. Meals must be located near eligible older persons, offered daily, and meet one-third of the daily recommended dietary allowances. The Older Americans Act requires nutrition services to meet specific requirements set by the Food and Nutrition Board. Providers must offer participants the opportunity to contribute towards the cost of the meal, but cannot deny services based on inability to pay. Voluntary contributions must be used to expand services for the elderly. The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) provides federally donated food commodities to states for distribution to emergency feeding organizations, including soup kitchens and food banks, serving the homeless and needy. Cash grants are also provided to help with administrative costs. The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) provides federally donated food commodities to states for distribution to emergency feeding organizations. Funding for administrative costs comes from direct appropriations and using some funding provided for food purchases. Commodities are allocated based on a poverty-unemployment formula, with states required to match funds not passed along to local agencies. In FY2004, federally donated commodities distributed under TEFAP were valued at $362 million, with federal support totaling $421 million. State agencies administering TEFAP select emergency feeding organizations to distribute food to needy persons. Eligibility criteria are set by states, including income-based standards, to ensure commodities go to those in need. The TEFAP program includes income-based standards to ensure commodities go to households in need. The commodities are acquired through USDA funds, surplus purchases, and Commodity Credit Corporation stocks. These commodities are distributed to food banks, pantries, soup kitchens, homeless shelters, and feeding centers for the poor. The USDA provides a variety of food items for distribution to centers serving meals to the poor, including fruits, vegetables, beans, meats, pasta, dairy, and rice. Food package sizes are tailored for at-home consumption or meal service operations. TEFAP benefits are not considered income or resources for recipients. The Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act provides federal funding for meals and snacks served under summer programs for children. Matching funds are not required from non-federal sources. The USDA provides food items for distribution to centers serving meals to the poor. Summer program sponsors receive federal support without requiring matching funds from non-federal sources. Eligibility for benefits is tied to the location of the program, with income criteria based on federal poverty guidelines. Sponsorship is available to various types of organizations. The Summer Food Service Program provides federal cash subsidies to sponsors for serving meals at residential nonprofit summer camps, private nonprofit organizations, and colleges. Subsidy rates in 2005 were $2.48 for lunch/supper, $1.42 for breakfast, and 58 cents for snacks. Sponsors also receive funds for administrative costs based on meals served. Meals/snacks are limited to two per day, with 3,700 sponsors serving 2 million children in 2005. The Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) operates in 144 project areas in 31 states, providing USDA commodities and funds for food packages to low-income individuals. Appropriations finance food purchases and distribution costs, with projects also receiving bonus commodities. The Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) operates in 144 project areas in 31 states, providing USDA commodities and funds for food packages to low-income individuals. Projects can receive \"bonus\" commodities without appropriated funds from Agriculture Department stocks. Funding and commodities are distributed based on caseload allocations, with expansion funding available for new slots or state projects with added appropriations. FY2004 funding was approximately $109 million, benefiting pregnant women, infants, and children up to age 6 who qualify for low-income governmental programs and are at nutritional risk. The Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) serves low-income individuals, including pregnant women, infants, children, and elderly persons. Participants must meet income guidelines, with the elderly making up over 85% of recipients. Participants receive food commodities from local agencies, with food packages tailored to each category of participant. Commodities include items such as infant formula, cereals, canned meats, fruits, and vegetables. The Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) provides food packages valued at $17-$20 a month to 522,000 individuals, including mothers, infants, children, and elderly persons. The program is funded under the Food Stamp Act and operated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in collaboration with Indian Tribal Organizations (ITOs) and state agencies. Food commodities such as dry milk, canned meats, fruits, and vegetables are distributed to participants through FDPIR. The Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) provides food packages valued at $17-$20 a month to eligible households, operated by Tribal Organizations and state agencies. The federal government covers at least 75% of administrative and distribution costs. Recipients must reside on or near a participating reservation or within a stipulated service area. Financial eligibility is determined based on public assistance or income standards similar to the Food Stamp program. The FDPIR provides monthly food packages to eligible households, with benefits including a variety of nutritious items. Stamp program rules are similar to Food Stamp program, with agencies certifying eligibility and distributing commodities. Both programs can be available in the same area, but not concurrently for individual households. The FDPIR provides monthly food packages with nutritious items like oil, peanut butter, corn syrup, and fresh fruits/vegetables. Federal funding supports farmers' market nutrition programs for WIC participants and seniors. Funding for the WIC program comes from annual appropriations and unused funds from prior years. In FY2004, funds for the Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition program totaled $28 million, allocated based on state plans and federal funds availability. 36 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and five Indian Tribal Organizations participated in the WIC Farmers' Market Nutrition program, with states required to contribute 30% of administrative costs. In FY2004, 39 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and six Indian Tribal Organizations received grants under the Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition program, with no state match required. Expansion of both programs depends on additional federal funding. Approved farmers' markets, roadside stands, and community projects can participate in the programs. WIC recipients and lower-income elderly are eligible for the programs in participating jurisdictions. Under the Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition program, lower-income elderly persons aged 60 and above with household income below 185% of the federal poverty guidelines are eligible for benefits. Proof of participation in means-tested programs like food stamps or SSI can also determine eligibility. Benefits are issued as coupons or vouchers for fresh fruits, vegetables, and herbs at participating markets. Vouchers under the WIC program are limited to $30 per year per recipient, while those under the Senior program have no value limit by law. The Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition program provides benefits to lower-income elderly persons aged 60 and above. Benefits are issued as coupons or vouchers for fresh produce with no value limit by law. The Child Nutrition Act provides federal funding for free half-pints of milk served to low-income children by schools and residential child care institutions. The Child Nutrition Act provides federal funding for subsidized milk for children in participating schools and RCCIs. Schools must lower milk prices and may offer free milk to low-income children. Free milk eligibility is based on income standards from the School Lunch or Breakfast programs. The Child Nutrition Act provides federal funding for subsidized milk for children in participating schools and RCCIs. Free milk eligibility is based on income standards from the School Lunch or Breakfast programs. In FY2004, 103 million subsidized half-pints were served to roughly 500,000 children daily through some 7,000 schools and RCCIs, funded 100% by the federal government with outlays of $22.4 billion. The Section 8 Housing Program, established in 1974, consists of two components: project-based rental assistance and Housing Choice Vouchers. The program provides rent subsidies to low-income families and individuals, with eligibility based on income below 80% of the local area median income. HUD is not entering new contracts for project-based rental assistance, transitioning households to vouchers instead. Extremely low-income households, with incomes below 30% of the median, are also eligible for assistance. Extremely low-income households, defined as those with incomes at or below 30% of the local area median income, are targeted for assistance. 40% of project-based rental assistance subsidies and 75% of vouchers must be directed to extremely low-income households. Project owners prioritize working families on waiting lists for project-based rental assistance, while local Public Housing Authorities manage waiting lists for Section 8 vouchers and can establish local preferences for prioritization. Various deductions are made from gross income to determine a family's annual countable income, including allowances for dependents, elderly family members, medical costs, child care, and handicapped assistance. Families with net assets above $5,000 have those assets included in their income calculation. In 1990, the National Affordable Housing Act increased deductions for Section 8 housing and public housing, subject to approval in appropriations. Section 8 recipients must recertify their incomes annually. Net family assets above $5,000 are included in income calculations for eligibility and rent determination. Rental charges for Section 8 project-based rental assistance are based on family income. Families pay the highest of 30% of counted income, 10% of gross income, or a minimum rent set by the PHA. The federal government covers the difference between contract rent and tenant payment. Contract rent must be within HUD-established limits. P.L. 98-181 revoked authority for additional Section 8 project-based rental assistance units. Section 8 project-based rental assistance involves families paying 30-40% of their adjusted income towards rent, with the federal government covering the difference through a Housing Assistance Payment. The payment standard is calculated by the PHA as an amount between 90-110% of FMR. This program is fully funded by the federal government, with indirect local contributions from local housing authorities. Public housing, which is publicly owned housing for low-income families, received $7.5 billion in federal outlays in FY2004. Public housing is publicly owned housing for low-income families managed by Public Housing Authorities. The federal government subsidizes operating and capital costs through regular and competitive subsidies. Competitive subsidies include grants for revitalization and safety programs. Eligibility is based on income below 80% of the local median income. The program was authorized by the U.S. Housing Act of 1937. Public housing units must have at least 40% occupancy by extremely low-income families, defined as those with income at or below 30% of the area median income. Various deductions are made from gross income to determine annual countable income, including $480 per dependent, $400 for an elderly family, excess medical costs, and child care/handicapped assistance. Families with net assets above $5,000 have their assets included as income. The net cash value of various investments is used to determine eligibility and rental charges for public housing. Residents may be required to participate in a self-sufficiency program or community service. Certain exemptions apply, such as for those in educational programs, with disabilities, or over 62 years old. Under P.L. 105-276, residents of public housing must comply with rent payment requirements based on income. Non-compliance could lead to lease renewal loss. Rent is calculated as 30% of counted income, 10% of gross income, or a minimum of $50 set by the PHA. Hardship exemptions to minimum rent levels are possible. Tenants can choose between flat or income-based rent annually to encourage employment. Income increases do not immediately affect rent, with adjustments phased in after a year. Federal subsidy for public housing is based on cost differences. The federal subsidy for public housing is determined by the cost of operating and maintaining the projects compared to tenant rent collected. In FY2004, federal outlays for public housing averaged $6,298 per unit, with $4.6 billion in obligations for direct and guaranteed loans. Loan funds are allocated based on factors like rural population and low-income households. The HOPE VI program, fully funded by the federal government, revitalizes public housing. The 1983 Housing and Urban-Rural Recovery Act (Titles I through V of P.L. 99-181) allows loans for owners of farms, homes, or nonfarm tracts in rural areas who lack safe housing and cannot get credit elsewhere. Section 502 loans are available to very-low- and low-income families, with requirements for occupancy by very-low-income families. The law defines income limits based on public housing and Section 8 housing criteria. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 directed the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) to administer the program. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 allows moderate-income borrowers to obtain guaranteed loans under Section 502 for single-family homes. Eligibility requirements are set by the Rural Housing Service (RHS), with income limits not exceeding 115% of the area median. Borrowers must have sufficient income to cover mortgage payments, premiums, taxes, maintenance, and living expenses. Adjusted annual income is defined according to criteria used by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for Section 8 housing and public housing. The Rural Housing Service (RHS) sets eligibility requirements for guaranteed loans under Section 502 for single-family homes, with income limits not exceeding 115% of the area median. Deductions from countable income include expenses for dependents, elderly families, medical costs, child care, and handicapped assistance. Net family assets are considered for loan repayment purposes, including real property equity, savings, stocks, and bonds. Residents of rural areas may qualify for direct loans from RHS to purchase or repair modest homes. The Rural Housing Service (RHS) offers Section 502 direct loans with terms of 33 years, extendable to 38 years for low-income borrowers. Interest rates can be subsidized to as low as 1%. In FY2004, RHS provided $1.4 billion in direct loans for 15,245 low-income families. Private lenders issued $3.2 billion in guaranteed loans to 34,817 low- to moderate-income families. Home Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) funds are allocated based on housing need, with PJs receiving grants and contributing a 25% match. The HOME program, established in 1990, requires PJs to contribute a 25% match unless in fiscal distress. In FY2004, $1.6 billion in federal outlays were used to leverage $4.2 billion in funding. Eligibility for HOME-funded assistance is based on income tests, with income limits set for rental housing, tenant-based rental assistance, and home buyers. The HOME program aims to increase affordable housing supply for low-income Americans. Income limits are set at 80% of the area median, with three definitions of annual income accepted. Maximum rental subsidy is the difference between rent standard and 30% of family's monthly adjusted income. Over $8.5 billion in HOME funds and $26.8 billion in leveraged funds have assisted the program. The HOME program, along with other leveraged funds, assisted in completing 552,262 housing units and providing tenant-based assistance to 110,534 families. The majority of tenants and residents assisted had incomes of 50% or less of the area median income. The programs are funded 100% by the federal government, with combined outlays of $1.098 billion in FY2004. Section 202 and Section 811 provide capital advances for construction, rehabilitation, or supportive housing for the elderly and persons with disabilities. The Section 202 and Section 811 programs offer interest-free capital advances for building supportive housing for low-income elderly and disabled households. The advances can be forgiven if the property remains available for these households for 40 years. Rental assistance similar to Section 8 is provided, with eligibility restricted to households with income at or below 50% of the local median income. Deductions are made from gross income, such as $480 per dependent and $400 for an elderly person. Deductions are made from gross income for families in Section 202 and Section 811 programs, including $480 per dependent, $400 for an elderly or disabled family, excess medical costs, child care costs, and care for disabled family members. Federal regulations consider net family assets above $5,000 in determining eligibility and required rent. Net family assets include real property, savings, stocks, bonds, and other investments, excluding furniture and automobiles. Residents must recertify their incomes annually for eligibility and rental charges based on expected income in the following 12 months. Rental charges for Section 202 and Section 811 properties are based on household income. Residents must meet age or disability requirements to qualify. They pay either 30% of counted income or 10% of gross income towards rent. The federal government pays the difference between the contract rent and tenant's payment. Contract rent must be within HUD-established limits. In FY2004, HUD spent $823 million for Section 202 and $275 million for Section 811 programs, supporting 75,227 Section 202 units and 21,646 Section 811 units. The program is funded 100% by the federal government and allocated based on factors like rural population, housing conditions, and poverty levels. Federal obligations totaled $580.6 million in FY2004 for rental assistance payments to owners of RHS-financed rural rental housing. The Section 515 and Sections 514/516 programs provide rental assistance for rural housing and farm labor housing to eligible tenants with low income. Owners must operate the property on a limited profit or nonprofit basis, with rental assistance agreements lasting 20 years for new construction and five years for existing projects. Payments are made directly to housing owners to bridge the gap in rent charged to eligible tenants. In the rental assistance program, payments are made directly to housing owners to cover the gap between tenants' payments and the approved rent. Tenants now pay 30% of their monthly adjusted family income or 10% of their income, with assistance also available for welfare recipients. In FY2004, the program aided 48,056 families with a total outlay of $559 million, funded entirely by the federal government. This program is authorized by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. The Section 236 Payments (IRP) program provides mortgage subsidies to owners of multifamily properties for low-income families. Eligibility is based on income not exceeding 80% of the area median income. Income definitions changed after December 21, 1979, to align with Section 8 program procedures. The Section 8 program excludes certain items from income and allows deductions such as $480 per dependent, $400 for an elderly family, and costs of child care. Income recertification is required annually, and subsidy amounts are based on anticipated income. HUD makes payments to reduce the effective interest rate of the project to 1%. The Section 8 program provides fair market rental charges based on operation costs and debt service requirements. Tenants pay 30% of adjusted gross income or market rent, with additional help for those who can't afford it. Elderly and handicapped families paying over 50% of income for rent can receive Section 8 assistance.

Three-fourths of formula grants are distributed. In FY2004, HOPWA funds were distributed with 90% by formula and 10% by competitive awards. Formula grants are mainly allocated to eligible cities and states based on AIDS cases and population criteria. Competitive awards are available for projects of national significance proposed by nonprofit entities. HOPWA outlays for FY2004 totaled $254 million. The AIDS Housing Opportunity Act (part of P.L. 101-625) provides housing assistance to low-income individuals with AIDS or related diseases, including HIV infection. The program defines low-income as not exceeding 80% of the local area median income, with flexibility for adjustments. HOPWA serves households with extremely low incomes, offering various benefits and services such as housing information and acquisition.

Federal obligations for the program totaled $114.5 million in FY2004. Loans are available for rural rental and cooperative housing units for families with \"very low\" or \"moderate\" income, handicapped or disabled persons, or those aged at least 62. The law requires a percentage of units to be occupied by \"very-low-income\" families or persons. The law requires occupancy of Section 515 housing units by low-income families within income limits set by HUD. Vacant units for six months may be exempt if project viability is at risk. \"Low-income\" and \"very-low-income\" families are defined based on HUD limits for public housing and Section 8. Moderate-income limits are $5,500 above low-income ceilings. Sponsors can be nonprofit or profit-oriented. In FY2004, Section 515 loans financed housing for about 7,639 families, with loan amounts and terms determined by RHS. Nonprofit sponsors and state and local public agencies are eligible for loans up to 100% of the appraised value or development cost. This program is funded 100% by the federal government.

Private or public nonprofit corporations may be eligible for two-year site loans under Section 523 or Section 524. Private nonprofit organizations must have a membership of at least 10 community leaders. The site loans can be used to buy and develop rural land, which is then subdivided into building sites and sold on a nonprofit basis to low- and moderate-income families. Generally, a loan will not be made unless it will result in at least 10 sites, and the sites do not need to be contiguous. Sites financed through Section 523 may only be sold to families building homes by the mutual self-help method, while Section 524 site loans have no restrictions on construction methods. Houses built on subsidized sites are usually financed through the Section 502 rural housing loan program. The RHS state director may approve TA grants of up to $200,000 to eligible organizations.

Grants were awarded through FY1996 on a competitive basis to nonprofit organizations, resident management corporations, cooperative associations, public housing authorities, or other bodies. Recipients of HOPE 3 implementation grants contribute $1 in matching money for each $4 in federal funds awarded. Some money already committed and in the pipeline continues to be spent, with federal outlays from current balances in FY2002, FY2003, and FY2004. The HOPE programs, established in 1990, assist low-income, first-time homebuyers in purchasing government-owned housing. Eligibility is based on tenant status, income not exceeding 80% of the median, or residency in HUD-assisted housing. HOPE 1 funds tenant management, project-related jobs, and unit sales. HOPE 2 grants support multifamily property sales and economic development. HOPE 3 provides funds for single-family home purchases. Various HUD programs have sold public housing units to low-income households. Since 1993, HUD has approved the sale of over 4,700 public housing units to tenants and low-income households through programs like HOPE 1. The process of moving from planning to actual sale can take up to 10 years. Grantees often use part of the grant to support resident organizations, counseling, training, and neighborhood economic development activities. HOPE 1 Implementation Grants totaled $82.4 million for 30 grants from FY1992 to FY1994, while HOPE 2 grants amounted to about $75 million through FY1996. By July 1997, HOPE 3 implementation grants reached $210 million for 258 grantees, resulting in 2,298 homes acquired and 1,234 transferred to new buyers. Federal Pell Grants, the largest federal student grant assistance program, are fully federally funded. Pell Grants, fully federally funded by the Department of Education, are available to undergraduate students who meet needs test criteria outlined in the Higher Education Act. Grantees must meet general student aid eligibility requirements and undergo a federal need analysis based on income and assets. The expected family contribution (EFC) is determined based on the student and their family's income and assets. Updates to the need analysis tables for the 2005-2006 award year were announced by the Department of Education on June 17, 2004. This includes adjustments to income protection allowance and net worth calculations. The Expected Family Contribution (EFC) is calculated based on various factors such as income, assets, and education savings. Pell Grant recipients typically have total incomes below $40,000 for dependent students and below $30,000 for independent students. Pell Grant awards are determined by subtracting the EFC from the maximum award or cost of attendance. In the 2003-2004 academic year, around 5.1 million students received Pell Grants averaging $2,467. The Higher Education Act prohibits certain government programs from considering Pell grants when determining eligibility for benefits or benefit amounts. Head Start funds are allocated to states based on a formula and can cover up to 80% of program costs, with the possibility of a larger share if deemed necessary by the Secretary of HHS. Federal regulations allow for a higher federal share for Head Start agencies in poor counties or those affected by disasters if they are unable to pay a 20% share despite reasonable efforts. Agencies that received over 80% federal share in FY1973 or FY1974 can continue to receive the larger share. The non-federal share can be paid in cash or in kind by the agency or another party. Head Start agencies are designated local organizations operating the program, with FY2005 appropriations at $6.8 billion. Eligibility criteria are determined by HHS, targeting low-income families. The eligibility criteria for Head Start programs require at least 90% of children to be from low-income families, with income below the poverty line. Additionally, 10% of enrollment opportunities must be for handicapped children. Federal poverty income guidelines in 2005 were $16,090 for a family of three and $19,350 for a family of four. Head Start does not have asset rules for eligibility. Small, remote communities can establish their own criteria if at least half of families meet income guidelines. Head Start programs serve preschool children in medically underserved communities with a population under 1,000. Services provided include educational, dental, medical, nutritional, and social services. Families are not charged fees, but voluntary payments are accepted. Federal Stafford loans are available to students through the FFEL and Ford DL programs, with capital provided by private lenders or the federal government. The FFEL program and Ford direct loan program offer subsidized loans to undergraduate, graduate, or professional students. These programs are authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965. Estimated net obligations for FY2004 were $5.3 billion. Eligibility is not restricted to individuals with limited income, but applicants must satisfy a test of need. Institutions use a need analysis system to calculate expected financial need. The need analysis system in Title IV calculates the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) for educational expenses based on income and assets. Updates in 2004 adjusted tables for income protection, business net worth, education savings, and assessment rates. The EFC determines eligibility for subsidized loans. The Department publishes an annual booklet explaining the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) formula for undergraduate students. Eligibility for a Pell Grant must be determined before applying for a subsidized loan to ensure eligible students receive grant aid first. The borrower's interest rate for FFEL Stafford and Stafford/Ford loans varies annually based on the 91-day Treasury bill rate plus a premium. In the FFEL program, the lender pays a 3% origination fee to the federal government. In the DL program, borrowers pay a 3% origination fee to the federal government. Undergraduates may borrow $2,625 for their first year of study, $3,500 for their second year, and $5,500 per year for the next three years of study; for graduate and professional school students, the limit is $10,500 per year for up to five years of school. The aggregate loan limit for undergraduate, graduate, and professional study is $65,500. In FY2004, subsidized FFEL Stafford and DL Stafford/Ford loan disbursements totaled over $52.1 billion. The federal government incurs costs in the Direct Loan (DL) and Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) programs, including foregone interest payments, defaults, and administrative expenses. Revenues offset some costs, such as fees from students and collections on defaulted loans. In FFEL, lenders and guaranty agencies also pay fees. The Higher Education Act of 1965 authorizes federal funding for part-time employment for students in post-secondary education. Students can work on or off-campus for public or private organizations.

The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 created the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG), providing federally funded discretionary funds to states. In FY2004, federal outlays for CCDBG totaled $6.9 billion, including funds from entitlement programs. 0.5% of discretionary funds is reserved for territories, and 1% to 2% is reserved for other purposes determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) allocates discretionary funds to states, with a percentage reserved for Indian tribes and tribal organizations. States must allocate funds based on the proportion of children under age five, those receiving free or reduced-price school lunches, and per capita income. States were previously required to reserve 25% of funds for child care quality improvement, but this changed in FY1996. States can now only spend up to 5% on administrative costs and must allocate at least 4% to improve child care quality and availability. Before October 1, 1997, states also received federal funds for child care services for recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). The 1996 welfare reform law replaced AFDC-related child care programs with entitlement funding for child care services. It allocated $13.9 billion over six years, with annual amounts increasing from $2.1 billion in FY1998 to $2.9 billion in FY2010. States must transfer and spend these funds in accordance with CCDBG rules. The 1996 welfare reform law replaced AFDC-related child care programs with entitlement funding for child care services, allocated $13.9 billion over six years. States must transfer and spend these funds in accordance with CCDBG rules. The combined discretionary and entitlement funding streams are referred to as the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF).

In FY2004, TANF-funded services expenditures were $6.3 billion, with $4.9 billion from federal funds and $1.4 billion from state-local funds. TANF law allows states to use block grant funds to provide services to recipient families and other \"needy\" families to help end dependence on government benefits or care for children at home. States set income limits for services and may tailor them to individual families. Services can also be provided to non-needy families to prevent out-of-wedlock pregnancies or promote two-parent families. Families not enrolled in cash aid may include former cash recipients, those at risk of eligibility, and unemployed or underemployed non-custodial parents. Income limits typically range from 150% to 250% of federal poverty guidelines. Various services are provided, such as transportation subsidies, parental skill-building, home energy aid, housing aid, rehabilitation services, and domestic violence counseling. Some TANF-funded services, like teen pregnancy prevention and family planning, have no income test requirements.

Funding has been maintained at $1.7 billion annually since FY2002. States can transfer up to 10% of their TANF block grants to the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG), which totals $16.5 billion annually. States have the freedom to set their own eligibility criteria for Title XX social services and decide how to allocate funds among 29 eligible service categories, such as child care, home-delivered meals for the elderly, and family planning services. State expenditure reports provide national data on SSBG fund usage, with the highest percentage of spending in FY2003 going towards certain services. In FY2003, the highest percentage of spending in the country was on special services for the disabled (13.7%), child protective services (8.7%), foster care services for children (13.3%), and home-based services (6.9%). TANF child care expenditures in FY2004 were estimated at $2.5 billion, with $1.4 billion from federal funds and $1.047 billion from state-local funds. TANF-funded child care is provided to TANF families, former TANF families, and other low-income families to promote work or job preparation. States determine income limits for eligibility, with most offering free or subsidized child care to recipient families, former cash recipient families during a transition period, and families at risk of becoming income-eligible for cash aid. Some states use a relative standard as the income test for families not in the cash program, with age cutoffs for TANF-funded care varying. TANF no longer guarantees child care for welfare parents but provides protections for single parents with children under age six. States determine charges for child care services. States determine charges for TANF child care and offer \"transitional\" child care to families who have left cash welfare rolls. HUD provides funding for programs aiding the homeless under the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act. Funding for the Emergency Shelter Grants program is provided through formula grants to states, cities, and counties, while money for other programs is awarded through competitive grants to various organizations. Grantees are required to match federal dollars, with different matching requirements for each program. HUD homeless assistance funds also support \"Supportive Services Only\" projects linked to housing. The FY2005 Appropriations Act required a 25% match for all HUD-funded services, with outlays for the Homeless Assistance Grants program totaling $1.238 billion in 2004. Grantees must develop consolidated plans for homeless services under HUD's \"continuum of care\" strategy. Grantees under the Emergency Shelter Grants program receive funds by formula, while others compete for approval. Individual eligibility for assistance depends on local sponsor decisions, with some programs having specific beneficiary categories. The Shelter Plus Care, SRO, and Supportive Housing programs have specific beneficiary categories such as homeless persons with disabilities, chronic substance abuse problems, or AIDS. Homeless Assistance grants can be used for various activities including renovation of buildings for emergency shelters, social services, and initiatives to prevent homelessness. Supportive Housing program funds can help homeless individuals transition to independent living. The federal government provides various housing and support services for homeless individuals, including transitional housing, permanent housing for those with disabilities, alternative housing for long-term homeless, and safe havens. Programs like Shelter Plus Care and SRO offer rental assistance.
