    "content": "The FY2012 Agriculture Appropriations Act (P.L. 112-55) was signed into law on November 18, 2011, as part of a larger appropriations bill. It reduces regular discretionary Agriculture appropriations by $372 million to $19.8 billion, a decrease of -1.8% from FY2011 levels. Additionally, $367 million of conservation-related disaster assistance was included, bringing the total appropriation to $20.2 billion. In December 2011, the Department of Agriculture implemented provisions related to livestock marketing and payment limits. The Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act provides funding for various agencies and departments, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Jurisdiction for the appropriations bill lies with the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) oversees various responsibilities through multiple internal agencies and offices. USDA spending includes farm programs, conservation, and nutrition programs. The largest mission area is food and nutrition programs, supporting SNAP, WIC, and child nutrition programs. The second-largest mission area is farm and foreign agricultural services, including commodity price and income support programs. The USDA oversees various responsibilities through multiple internal agencies and offices, including farm commodity price and income support programs, crop insurance, conservation and trade programs, farm loans, and foreign food aid programs. Other mission areas include natural resource and environmental programs, rural development, research and education programs, marketing and regulatory programs, and food safety. The Forest Service, funded through the Interior appropriations bill, accounts for over one-third of USDA's personnel. Comparing USDA's organization and budget data to the Agriculture appropriations bill in Congress can be challenging. The Agriculture appropriations bill organizes funding differently from USDA's mission areas. Foreign agricultural assistance is separate in the bill but combined with domestic farm support in USDA's \"farm and foreign agriculture\" mission area. Conservation programs in the bill are discretionary, while mandatory funding for conservation is under the Commodity Credit Corporation in the bill. USDA's natural resources mission area includes both discretionary and mandatory programs. The Agriculture appropriations bill includes funding for the Commodity Credit Corporation and USDA's natural resources mission area, which covers discretionary and mandatory conservation programs. The bill also includes appropriations for the Food and Drug Administration and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Funding for these agencies makes up about 2% of the overall Agriculture and Related Agencies appropriations bill. Jurisdiction over CFTC appropriations is assigned differently in the House and Senate. The CFTC's jurisdiction alternates between the Agriculture and Financial Services appropriations subcommittees each year. Despite the growing importance of non-agricultural issues, agriculture and food issues remain significant for the FDA and CFTC. The FDA and CFTC have seen an increase in medical, drug, and financial futures contract issues. Food safety responsibilities shared between USDA and FDA have been in the spotlight, while volatility in agricultural commodity markets has been scrutinized. Discretionary spending is controlled by annual appropriations acts, with subcommittees originating bills for funding and activities. Mandatory programs have eligibility criteria written into them. In FY2011, 84% of the Agriculture appropriations bill was classified as mandatory programs, with Congress controlling spending through authorizing committees. Major discretionary programs include conservation, rural development, research, education, agricultural credit, WIC, Food for Peace, meat inspection, and food marketing. FDA and CFTC are also part of discretionary accounts. The largest component of USDA's mandatory spending is for food and nutrition programs like SNAP and child nutrition, along with farm commodity price support, crop insurance, and agricultural conservation programs. Mandatory spending tends to rise over time, driven by factors like program participation rates and economic conditions. The USDA's mandatory spending includes food and nutrition programs like SNAP and child nutrition, as well as farm commodity price support and agricultural conservation programs. Funding for these programs is based on projected spending needs and may receive supplemental appropriations if estimates fall short. The Commodity Credit Corporation operates on a line of credit with the Treasury and receives an annual appropriation to reimburse the Treasury. Budget authority is the amount of money Congress allows a federal agency to commit to spend. Budget authority is the limit on funding that Congress allows a federal agency to spend, representing the legal basis for incurring obligations. Obligations are the actual amount of money agencies commit to spend, while outlays are the money that flows out of an agency's account. Program level is the sum of activities supported by an agency, which may exceed its budget authority. The FY2012 Agriculture Appropriations Act was passed by both chambers and signed by the President on November 17, 2011. It was part of a three-bill \"minibus\" appropriation including Commerce-Justice-Science and Transportation-Housing and Urban Development appropriations. The FY2012 Agriculture Appropriations Act was part of a minibus appropriation bill that included Commerce-Justice-Science and Transportation-Housing and Urban Development appropriations. The bill also included a short-term continuing resolution through December 16, 2011, for the remaining nine appropriations bills. The Agriculture bill was the vehicle for the minibus, as it was the only one of the three subcommittee bills to have passed the House. Stand-alone Agriculture appropriations bills were enacted five times in the past 14 fiscal years, while omnibus appropriations and year-long continuing resolutions were also used. The House marked up its FY2012 Agriculture appropriations bill in May 2011. The full appropriations committee reported bill H.R. 2112 by voice vote, adopting several amendments. The Rules Committee discussed the rule for floor consideration (H.Res. 300) on June 13, leaving four provisions unprotected from points of order. Floor consideration began on June 14, and the House passed H.R. 2112 on June 16 by a vote of 217-203. Members offered 61 amendments under an open rule, with 22 adopted, 33 rejected, and 3 disallowed by point of order. The House-passed bill H.R. 2112 included funding reductions for various programs like WIC, food safety, and international food aid. Non-money amendments were also adopted, including ones related to ethanol and RU-486. The Senate Appropriations subcommittee marked up the FY2012 Agriculture appropriations bill (H.R. 2112, S.Rept. 112-73) with various amendments related to ethanol, RU-486, food aid to North Korea, and USDA policy on climate change adaptation. The bill also included a 0.78% across-the-board rescission to discretionary accounts. The full committee bypassed subcommittee action by \"polling\" the bill out, allowing it to advance quickly. The Agriculture appropriations bill for FY2012 was part of a \"minibus\" of three appropriations bills. Floor consideration began on October 18, 2011, and final passage occurred on November 1, 2011, with 19 amendments proposed and 12 adopted. Out of the 19 proposed amendments for the Agriculture appropriations bill for FY2012, 12 were adopted, 4 were rejected, 2 were withdrawn, and 1 fell by point of order. Six recorded votes were taken, including passage of a farm subsidy AGI payment limit and an increase in disaster funding. Only two amendments changed amounts in the bill, increasing disaster funding by $110 million and transferring $8 million to increase conservation. The Senate-passed Agriculture appropriations bill for FY2012 included amendments to transfer $8 million for conservation and policy changes related to nutrition standards, fund usage, and USDA loan programs. The bill cut discretionary appropriations to $19.8 billion, with increases in funding for domestic nutrition programs, foreign assistance, FDA, agricultural research, and rural development. The Senate-passed Agriculture appropriations bill for FY2012 included funding increases for agricultural research, rural development, and disaster assistance for conservation and forestry. Short-term continuing resolutions have been necessary every year since at least FY1999. The minibus appropriation bill for FY2012 was passed with more than two-thirds majorities in both chambers on November 17, 2011, and signed into law as P.L. 112-55 the next day. The bill aimed to reduce discretionary spending to the $1.043 trillion government-wide total allowed for FY2012. The White House had issued a Statement of Administration Policy (SAP) on October 19, 2011, emphasizing the importance of adequate funding for food safety, WIC, and global food security in the Agriculture bill. The FY2012 Agriculture appropriation bill reduces discretionary spending by $372 million to $19.8 billion, a cut of -1.8% below FY2011 levels. It includes $367 million for conservation-related disaster assistance, bringing the total appropriation to $20.2 billion. Reductions in discretionary spending range from 3%-6%, with cuts to rural development programs (-$233 million, -8.8%) and discretionary agriculture programs (-$209 million, -3%). The FY2012 Agriculture appropriation bill reduces discretionary spending by $372 million to $19.8 billion, a cut of -1.8% below FY2011 levels. Reductions in discretionary spending range from 3%-6%, with cuts to rural development programs, discretionary agriculture programs, discretionary nutrition assistance, foreign assistance programs, and conservation programs. The budget authority for the Food and Drug Administration and Commodity Futures Trading Commission increases by about 1.5% to 2%. The House passed a budget resolution with a $1.019 trillion discretionary budget limit for FY2012, resulting in a $30.4 billion cut from FY2011 across all 12 appropriations bills. The Budget Control Act of 2011 set the total FY2012 discretionary limit for all 12 appropriations bills at $1.043 trillion, which is $24 billion higher than the House budget resolution. The Senate Appropriations Committee adopted subcommittee allocations for the Agriculture bill on September 7, 2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee adopted revised subcommittee allocations for the Agriculture bill, increasing the initial allocation to $20.156 billion. This was due to disaster designations and was higher than the FY2011 allocation. The Senate Appropriations Committee adopted a final Agriculture subcommittee allocation of $20.24 billion, including $367 million for disaster designation under the Budget Control Act. $1.75 billion is designated for security spending. Discretionary Agriculture appropriations peaked in FY2010, while mandatory nutrition spending continues to rise. Total discretionary appropriations in the Agriculture appropriations bill have grown at an average annualized rate of +2.0% over the past 10 years. The nutrition portion shows a +3.7% average annual increase, while the rest of the bill has a +1.1% average annual increase. Mandatory appropriations have a 10-year average annual growth of +7.5%, while discretionary appropriations show a +2.0% rate. The total (mandatory plus discretionary) appropriations in the Agriculture bill have increased by an average of +6.4% annually over the past 10 years. Nutrition spending has risen from 46% to 77% of the total, with an average annual increase of +10.8%. The rest of the bill, excluding nutrition programs, has seen a decline of -1.3% annually. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and child nutrition programs have seen significant increases in mandatory spending over the past 10 years, with an average annual growth rate of +11.5%. Discretionary spending on nutrition programs has also increased, but at a slower rate of +3.7% per year. Non-nutrition programs in the bill have a more even split between mandatory and discretionary accounts, with slower overall growth compared to nutrition programs. Mandatory spending on other components has shown a decline of -2.6% annually over 10 years, while discretionary spending has increased by +1.1% per year. The Agriculture appropriations have shown positive \"real\" growth over the past 10 years, with an average annual increase of +1.1%. Nutrition programs have seen a higher average annual real rate of growth at +8.4%, while non-nutrition programs have shown a decrease in real change. Total Agriculture appropriations have increased at an average annual real rate of +4.2% over the past 10 years. The Agriculture bill's share of the federal budget declined from 4.4% in FY1995 to 2.7% in FY2009, then rose to 3.7% in FY2012. Nutrition programs' share decreased from 2.6% in FY1995 to 1.8% in FY2008 but increased to 2.9% in FY2012. Agriculture appropriations have been steady at under 0.75% of GDP from FY2000-FY2009, rising to about 0.86% in FY2012 due to increased demand for nutrition programs. Nutrition programs have been rising as a percentage of GDP, while non-nutrition agricultural programs have been declining. The Agriculture bill's share of the federal budget declined from 4.4% in FY1995 to 2.7% in FY2009, then rose to 3.7% in FY2012. Nutrition programs' share decreased from 2.6% in FY1995 to 1.8% in FY2008 but increased to 2.9% in FY2012. On a per capita basis, inflation-adjusted total Agriculture appropriations have risen slightly over the past 10 to 15 years, while nutrition programs have risen more steadily. Non-nutrition agricultural programs have been more steady or declining. The enacted FY2012 appropriation contains rescissions and limitations on mandatory farm bill programs to score savings for discretionary budget allocations. The FY2012 appropriation included reductions in discretionary appropriations achieved through limitations and rescissions on mandatory farm bill programs. The limitations increased by 27% to $1.2 billion, while rescissions decreased to $445 million. These actions helped meet budget allocations and avoid deeper cuts to regular discretionary accounts. The total reductions in limitations and rescissions decreased from $1.87 billion in FY2011 to $1.65 billion in FY2012. The limitations and rescissions in FY2012 increased cuts to agency programs by $220 million to achieve a reduction in total discretionary spending to $19.8 billion. Appropriators have placed limitations on mandatory spending authorized in the farm bill, known as CHIMPS. These limits do not change the authorizing law but restrict mandatory program funding. In FY2012, limitations and rescissions increased cuts to agency programs by $220 million to reduce total discretionary spending to $19.8 billion. Appropriators have restricted mandatory program funding authorized in the farm bill through limitations known as CHIMPS, without changing the authorizing law. This division over funding certain agriculture programs between appropriators and authorizers dates back to the 1930s. The creation of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) in the 1930s aimed to address the unpredictable funding issue for farm commodity programs. However, tension arose in the 21st century as mandatory funds were used for discretionary programs, leading to a debate between authorizers and appropriators over funding responsibilities. Some question the use of the CCC for programs that are not farm commodity-related. The CHIMPS funding reductions in FY2012 affected various programs, including conservation, rural development, bioenergy, and smaller nutrition assistance programs. The reductions totaled $1.206 billion in the conference agreement, with the House bill proposing $1.439 billion and the Senate bill $1.131 billion. This marked a significant increase from previous years and approached the $1.5 billion level of CHIMPS. The House bill proposed funding reductions in FY2012 that approached the $1.5 billion level of CHIMPS last reached in FY2006. Appropriators made changes to avoid greater impacts on the baseline budget. Rescissions are a method of permanently cancelling funds provided by previous appropriations laws to achieve budgetary savings. Rescissions in the FY2012 conference agreement total $445 million, less than half of FY2011 levels. FY2011 saw unusually large rescissions, totaling about $925 million, mainly from unobligated balances in accounts like building and facilities. These one-time savings were difficult to repeat in FY2012. The Agriculture and Related Agencies appropriations bill covers nearly 95% of USDA's total appropriation, excluding the Forest Service which is funded through the Interior appropriations bill. The order of sections in the bill reflects the agencies listed, with a focus on USDA's research, education, and economics mission carried out by four agencies including the Agricultural Research Service (ARS). The National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), the Economic Research Service (ERS), and the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) play key roles in addressing food and agriculture issues at national and regional levels. NIFA distributes federal funds to support research, education, and extension activities at land grant colleges of agriculture. ERS provides economic analysis on agriculture, natural resources, food, and rural America, while NASS collects and publishes agricultural statistics, including data from the Census of Agriculture conducted every five years. The USDA REE mission area received $2.533 billion for FY2012, with cuts to ARS, ERS, and NIFA budgets compared to FY2011. For FY2012, the USDA REE mission area received $2.533 billion, with cuts to ARS, ERS, and NIFA budgets compared to FY2011. NASS received a $2.2 million increase, while the House-passed bill would have provided $2.217 billion and the Senate bill $2.538 billion. The FY2012 funding levels for REE activities followed a 9% reduction in FY2011 levels. No earmarks were included in the FY2012 appropriation for REE-related activities. The 2008 farm bill made significant changes to the REE mission area structure. The 2008 farm bill made changes to the REE mission area, establishing NIFA and AFRI. USDA funding for agriculture research has remained relatively flat since the early 1970s. Funding levels increased from FY2001-2003 due to anti-terrorism activities, but have since remained constant when adjusted for inflation. The USDA research budget has remained fairly constant on an inflation-adjusted basis, with concerns expressed by agricultural scientists, stakeholders, and partners over long-term funding. The enacted FY2012 appropriation for the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is $1.095 billion, which is a decrease from the FY2011 level. The Administration requested $1.137 billion for FY2012, but the allocated amount does not include resources for ARS Buildings and Facilities. The FY2012 agricultural appropriations bill allocated $1.095 billion for ARS, with plans to close 10 research facilities. The enacted FY2012 appropriation for NIFA was $1.202 billion, slightly less than the Administration's request but with an increase in Research and Education activities funding. The FY2012 budget for USDA's Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) and other programs saw slight increases or decreases in funding compared to FY2011. Extension Activities received $475.2 million, a decrease from the previous year. Integrated Activities faced significant cuts, with a $15.4 million decrease from FY2011. The Administration requested $1.205 billion for NIFA in FY2012, while the House-passed bill allocated $1.012 billion and the Senate-passed bill allocated $1.214 billion. The House-passed bill proposed over a 15% cut in funding for research and education programs. In FY2012, NIFA funding saw variations in the House and Senate bills. The House proposed significant cuts, reducing AFRI and Hatch Act funds by over 13%. Extension and Integrated Activities were also reduced. In contrast, the Senate bill aimed to maintain funding close to FY2011 levels, with slight increases in research and education activities. P.L. 112-55 ultimately provided $77.7 million for NIFA. The enacted FY2012 appropriation provided $77.7 million for the Economic Research Service (ERS), $4.1 million less than FY2011. The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) received $158.6 million, $2.2 million more than FY2011. Up to $41.6 million is available for the Census of Agriculture. The Administration requested $165.4 million for NASS for FY2012. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is responsible for protecting U.S. agriculture from pests and diseases, facilitating agricultural trade, and administering the Animal Welfare Act. Key concerns include avian influenza, mad cow disease, invasive plant pests, and a national animal identification program. The FY2012 appropriation for APHIS is $816.5 million, $47 million less than FY2011. The amount is lower than the Senate-passed bill of $823.3 million and higher than the House-passed bill of $783.8 million. The enacted bill authorizes APHIS to collect fees to cover costs and provides $3.2 million for buildings and facilities. The Administration's budget request proposed a new budget structure for APHIS. The committee report supports a new budget structure for APHIS, managing 29 budget line items instead of 45. The restructuring moves from specific animal disease line items to commodity-based \"Health\" lines, allowing flexibility to address emerging situations. Both House and Senate bills endorse this change for APHIS to prioritize funds efficiently. The committee expects APHIS to prioritize core programs and mission areas before less critical functions. The enacted bill provides appropriations for animal health, plant health, wildlife services, regulatory services, safeguarding and emergency preparedness, safe trade and international technical assistance, animal welfare, and agency management. $154.0 million is allocated to Specialty Crop Pests. The conference bill highlights funding levels for various programs, including $32.5 million for Animal Health Technical Services, $52.0 million for Avian Health, $4.3 million for APHIS Information Technology Infrastructure, $9.1 million for Field Crop and Rangeland Ecosystems Pests, $55.7 million for Tree and Wood Pests, and $2.8 million for the National Veterinary Stockpile. Other funding includes $17.8 million for cotton pests, $0.7 million for activities under the 1970 Horse Protection Act, $1.5 million for the scrapie program, $1.0 million for wildlife services methods development, and $1.5 million for eradicating the European Grape Vine Moth. The conference agreement allocates funding for various programs, including $1.0 million for wildlife services methods development and $1.5 million for wildlife damage management program for aviation safety. Matching state funds for a brucellosis eradication program must be at least 40%. Appropriators expect USDA to transfer funds for pest and disease eradication activities. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and congressional appropriators have debated over funding for the eradication of animal and plant pests and diseases. The enacted agreement includes $1 million for a \"contingency fund\" to control outbreaks of insects, plant diseases, animal diseases, and pest animals and birds in emergency conditions. The House and Senate committee reports implicitly approved language addressing funding for various agricultural issues, including eradication of pests like the Pale Cyst Nematode and the Brown Marmorated Stink Bug. The Senate report also included concerns about declining bee populations and invasive honey bee pests, equine transport issues, and livestock predation. The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is responsible for promoting marketing. The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is responsible for promoting the marketing and distribution of U.S. agricultural products in domestic and international markets. User fees and reimbursements fund AMS activities like product quality programs and commodity grading. For FY2012, P.L. 112-55 provides $82.2 million to AMS, which is $4.3 million below FY2011 levels. The Section 32 account is funded by a permanent appropriation of 30% of the previous year's customs receipts, used for various programs like child nutrition and surplus farm commodity purchases. The 2008 farm bill set maximum annual amounts for Section 32 funds, with mandates for funding a fresh fruit and vegetable program in schools. The 2008 farm bill mandates additional purchases of Section 32 funds for fruit, vegetables, and nuts for domestic food assistance programs. The FY2012 appropriation provides $1.08 billion for AMS, representing actual funding available for obligations. Section 32 funds are used at the Secretary's discretion for commodity purchases, school lunch programs, disaster assistance, and budgetary savings through rescissions. The FY2012 appropriation included a rescission of $150 million from unobligated balances carried over from FY2011. It also prohibited the use of Section 32 funds for direct payments to farmers. USDA's GIPSA oversees the marketing of various agricultural products. The Government's GIPSA oversees the marketing of U.S. agricultural products and enforces standards for inspection and grading. The FY2012 Agriculture Appropriations Act allocated $37.75 million for GIPSA, with restrictions on finalizing proposed rules. The conference agreement includes conditions that restrict USDA from finalizing its proposed rule on livestock and poultry marketing practices. The proposed rule addresses competitive injury under the Packers and Stockyards Act and sets criteria for unfair practices. Proponents argue it brings fairness, while opponents fear market disruption and increased litigation. The USDA is restricted from finalizing a proposed rule on livestock and poultry marketing practices if the annual cost to the economy exceeds $100 million. The USDA must publish any rules in the Federal Register by December 9, 2011, and no funding can be used to implement the rules until 60 days after publication. The final rule on livestock and poultry marketing published on December 9, 2011, included only four provisions from the original 13, with an estimated economic impact of less than $100 million. Poultry companies suspend bird deliveries to growers, require additional investments. Criteria set for breach of contract remedy time. Contracts with arbitration must offer opt-out. USDA restricted from finalizing rule on livestock marketing practices. House version of H.R. 2112 prohibits USDA spending on rule development. The House Committee report expressed concerns about the GIPSA proposed rule on livestock marketing practices, including misinterpretation of Congress's intent and underestimation of costs. It also raised issues with USDA's compliance with the Administrative Procedures Act and limited public input by closing the comment period before all workshops were held. For more details, refer to CRS Report R41673. Federal agencies like the FDA and USDA oversee food safety regulations in the U.S. FDA is responsible for most food products, while USDA's FSIS regulates meat, poultry, and egg products. Historically, funding and staffing levels for FDA and FSIS have been disproportionate to their responsibilities. FSIS oversees 10%-20% of the food supply, while FDA is responsible for the rest. The FDA and USDA oversee food safety regulations in the U.S. FSIS has 60% of the food safety budget, while FDA has 40%. FSIS received $1.007 billion in funds in FY2011, while FDA's budget was $835.7 million. FSMA authorized additional appropriations and staff for FDA's food safety activities. FSMA, enacted in the 1930s, enhances food safety by increasing inspections, tightening record-keeping, extending oversight to farms, and mandating recalls. It requires facilities to create safety plans, implement controls, improve illness surveillance, and scrutinize imports. The cost estimate for implementing FSMA was $1.4 billion over five years, excluding revenue offsets. The FDA and other federal agencies are involved in activities related to FSMA, which includes new user fees. These fees cover activities like the voluntary qualified importer program and certain periodic activities. FSMA did not introduce new facility registration fees. The estimated cost of implementing FSMA over five years was $1.4 billion, with additional outlays of $1.1 billion required to cover new requirements within FDA. Despite authorizing appropriations, Congress did not provide full funding for FDA to carry out these activities. The FDA did not receive full funding for FSMA activities, leading to concerns about the U.S. food safety system overhaul. The Administration requested a 30% increase in FDA funding for food programs in FY2012. The House Appropriations Committee discussed FDA and USDA food safety budgets, including FSMA implementation and coordination between the agencies. The enacted appropriation provided a 3.5% increase in FDA funding for food safety efforts in FY2012. The enacted FY2012 appropriation provides a 3.5% increase in FDA funding for food safety efforts, with a slight reduction in USDA funding. FDA's Foods Program receives $866.1 million, $30.4 million above FY2011 levels. The enacted amount is slightly less than the Senate-passed bill and significantly more than the House-passed bill. The enacted FY2012 appropriation provides a 3.5% increase in FDA funding for food safety efforts, with a slight reduction in USDA funding. FDA's Foods Program receives $866.1 million, $30.4 million above FY2011 levels. The enacted bill assumes FDA will collect over $79 million in new user fees under its foods program, including food and feed recall fees, food reinspection fees, export certification fees, and voluntary qualified importer program fees. This amount is almost $90 million less than the Administration's request, raising questions about implementing food safety reforms and investing in preventive efforts to address food safety threats. FDA projected a total need of $1.035 billion for its food program for FY2012, excluding expected fees, based on elements of the newly enacted food safety law (FSMA). The House committee acknowledged the projected $1.4 billion needed for FDA's foods program under the FSMA but deemed the proposed 156% increase in funding since 2004 as \"unsustainable.\" The Obama Administration criticized the House-passed funding reduction, with unsuccessful attempts to restore funding through amendments. The Senate committee recognized budget constraints and directed FDA to prioritize food safety activities with increased funds. The FDA was directed to prioritize food safety activities with increased funds, including new preventative controls for food processing facilities, import oversight, inspections, and improved scientific capabilities. The enacted appropriation includes a $39 million increase for FDA to implement FSMA, with recommendations for FDA to address foodborne illnesses. The conferees urge the FDA to work on understanding the causes of foodborne illnesses, both from known pathogens and unknown sources, to develop new prevention strategies. They also direct the FDA to prioritize effective food safety activities to reduce illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths, and to allocate funding based on both known and unknown sources of illness. This information should be communicated in the FY2013 budget. The conferees direct FDA to develop a comprehensive program for imported seafood due to concerns about the low inspection rate of less than 2%. Recommendations on seafood safety, nutrition labeling, gluten-free labeling, and seafood consumption during pregnancy were not specifically addressed in the conference agreement. The House-passed bill also called for FDA to reconsider the 2004 seafood advisory. The FDA was directed to reconsider the 2004 advisory in light of the 2010 Dietary Guidelines. The bill also included provisions for food safety information-sharing, antimicrobial resistance concerns, and collaboration on research needs to reduce redundancy. Additionally, FDA was directed to enhance trade facilitation and interagency cooperation efforts. The committees directed FDA to improve trade facilitation and interagency cooperation efforts for serious compliance infractions. They recommended establishing a pilot project for expedited imports for highly compliant importers. The House-passed bill did not include funding for USDA's Microbiological Data Program, stating that other agencies are better equipped for this function. The House-passed bill did not include funding for USDA's Microbiological Data Program. Representative Clarke introduced an amendment to restore $1 million for the program, but it was not adopted. The bill also sought to prohibit FDA from restricting substances without strong scientific evidence. The provision added in committee as an amendment by Representative Denny Rehberg was challenged by Chairman Fred Upton as a violation of House rules. Media reports suggest it aimed to prevent FDA actions, including restrictions on antibiotics in animal feed. The provision was later removed under a point of order. The FY2012 appropriation for USDA's FSIS is $1.004 billion, slightly less than FY2011. The FY2012 appropriation for USDA's FSIS is $1.004 billion, slightly less than FY2011. Congressional appropriations will be supplemented by existing user fees and credits from laboratory accreditation fees. New user fees proposed by the Administration are not assumed in the House or Senate bill. FSIS's appropriations will be allocated to federal, state, international, Codex Alimentarius, and Public Health Data Communications Infrastructure System. The conference agreement allocates $34.6 million for the Health Data Communications Infrastructure System, with $1 million potentially credited from fees collected for national laboratory accreditation programs. Funding for the system must remain available until expended. FSIS is required to continue implementing a grading and inspection program for catfish, maintain at least 148 FTEs for enforcing the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act, and limit building alteration costs to 10% of the current replacement value. Other recommendations include continuing pilot inspection programs for poultry slaughter and improving enforcement of the HMSA. The Senate committee report urges FSIS to enhance poultry slaughter inspection, protect public health from E. coli, and expand the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point Based Inspection Model Project. Concerns were also raised about the implementation of USDA's Public Health Information System. USDA's Farm Service Agency administers farm subsidy and disaster assistance programs, farm loan programs, conservation programs, and international food assistance and export credit programs. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) administers various programs including farm subsidy, disaster assistance, conservation, and international food assistance. FSA receives funds for salaries, expenses, and administrative support from different sources within USDA. The enacted FY2012 appropriation provides $1.497 billion for FSA salaries and expenses. The FY2012 appropriation for FSA salaries and expenses is $1.497 billion, $25 million less than FY2011. The Administration's proposal requested $1.718 billion, with a 10% reduction in staffing. Funding prioritizes information technology modernization, including $66.7 million for the MIDAS computer upgrade. The FY2012 appropriation for FSA includes funding for the Common Computing Environment and MIDAS implementation. FSA serves as a lender of last resort for family farmers, providing direct farm loans and loan guarantees. Loans are used for farm real estate, operating expenses, and disaster recovery, with some at subsidized interest rates. An annual appropriation covers the federal cost of direct and guaranteed loans. The FY2012 appropriation provides $108 million of loan subsidy to support $4.787 billion of direct and guaranteed loans, with the loan authority being larger than the subsidy level. This amount is slightly lower than FY2011 for loan subsidy but higher for loan authority. The appropriation remains the same for farm ownership loans and guaranteed operating loans compared to FY2011. Funding for the guaranteed interest assistance operating loan program has been eliminated. The FY2012 appropriation increases direct farm operating loan authority by $100 million and restores $150 million of loan authority for the 2008 farm bill's new conservation guaranteed loan program, which was defunded in FY2011. Demand for FSA farm loans and guarantees increased after the 2008 financial crisis, leading to supplemental appropriations in FY2009 and FY2010. The FY2012 loan authority is $1.2 billion less than in FY2010 due to decreased demand in the current lower interest rate environment. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) is the funding mechanism for mandatory subsidy payments to farmers, with borrowing authority of up to $30 billion from the U.S. Treasury. Most USDA agriculture and conservation programs are funded by the 2008 farm bill. Loan demand remained high in FY2011, leading to some states exhausting their loan availability. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) is funded through borrowing authority from the U.S. Treasury for various agricultural programs. It borrows money for ad hoc farm disaster payments, market loss payments, and disease eradication efforts. The CCC must periodically replenish its borrowing authority through congressional appropriations to avoid reaching its $30 billion debt limit. Congress typically provides this funding through the annual Agriculture appropriation law. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) receives funding through borrowing authority from the U.S. Treasury for agricultural programs. The funding is provided through an indefinite appropriation, allowing for necessary sums during the fiscal year. The amount needed fluctuates based on economic and weather conditions, making it difficult to estimate. The enacted FY2012 Agriculture appropriation includes an estimated $14.1 billion for CCC, up 1% from the previous year. This funding replenishes CCC's borrowing authority with the Treasury to ensure continued operations. The enacted FY2012 Agriculture appropriation includes a new $1 million Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) limit for the direct payment portion of the farm commodity program. This tighter AGI limit, proposed by Senator Coburn, restricts payments to individuals with AGI exceeding $1 million for FY2012 only. The FY2012 Agriculture appropriation includes a new $1 million AGI limit for direct payments to individuals. Despite concerns about the language used, the provision is being implemented, potentially reducing government payments to farmers. The successful Senate vote on the Coburn amendment shows congressional support for payment limits, while the House had unsuccessful attempts at tighter limits. The House committee-reported version contained an amendment by Representative Flake with a $250,000 AGI limit. The amendment was challenged and removed from the bill. Representative Flake offered a similar amendment without the stronger language, which was rejected. Representative Blumenauer also offered a payment limits amendment, which was rejected. The Coburn amendment is a small reduction in the limit compared to larger reductions in the next farm bill. The Coburn amendment is a small reduction in payment limits compared to larger proposed reductions. It is unclear if the success of this amendment and the failure of others reflect differences in attitudes between the House and Senate. The FY2012 appropriation includes a provision limiting USDA's ability to provide marketing assistance loans for mohair, similar to a provision in the FY2011 appropriation. Despite lacking CBO scoring, the Department suspended the MAL and LDP program for mohair in both FY2011 and FY2012. The Department suspended the MAL and LDP program for mohair in FY2011 and FY2012. The enacted appropriation does not contain provisions related to the cotton program or a payment to the Brazil Cotton Institute as part of a WTO settlement. CCC funding for the Brazil Cotton Institute payment was used as a budgetary offset in an amendment to increase funding for the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program. The DeLauro amendment included increased funding for WIC in the bill, with the offset payment to Brazil being removed due to a point of order raised by Representative Lucas. However, a separate amendment by Representative Kind to prohibit payment to the Brazil Cotton Institute was adopted in the House-passed bill. The Kind amendment, similar to the DeLauro offset provision, aimed to prohibit payment to the Brazil Cotton Institute. It did not prompt a point of order due to a less strict wording. The Congressional Budget Office did not assign budgetary savings to the provision as it lacked certain language. Despite appearing to prevent payment to the Institute, it did not have the same effect as the original DeLauro language. The provision did not make it into the conference agreement. The amendment (\u00a7741) aimed to reduce upland cotton payment rates to offset costs for the Brazil Cotton Institute. It was removed for legislating in an appropriations bill. The federal crop insurance program, administered by USDA's Risk Management Agency, offers free catastrophic insurance with the option to purchase additional coverage at a subsidized rate. Policies are serviced by private insurance companies with losses reinsured by USDA. The Agriculture appropriations bill provides funding for the federal crop insurance program, including salaries, expenses, premium subsidies, and indemnity payments. The FY2012 appropriation includes $75 million for RMA expenses and $3.1 billion for the Federal Crop Insurance Fund, a decrease from FY2011. The FY2012 appropriation for the federal crop insurance program is $4.5 billion less than estimated for FY2011 due to a one-time shift in cash flows specified in the 2008 farm bill. This reduction is mainly an accounting change, not a cut in program benefits to farmers. The provision prohibits performance-based premium discounts to farmers, saving $25 million in each of FY2011 and FY2012. In early 2011, RMA proposed a program to reward farmers in the federal crop insurance program for good performance, funded by savings from USDA's renegotiation of the Standard Reinsurance Agreement. Concerns were raised by Congress about program design and payments to producers no longer in the program. The FY2012 appropriation provides $367 million for watershed and conservation recovery programs. The FY2012 appropriation provides $367 million for three watershed and conservation recovery programs, with funding designated as disaster funding. The Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) offers assistance for farmland rehabilitation after natural disasters and has not been funded since FY2009. The enacted FY2012 appropriation allocates $122.7 million for ECP, with a backlog of unfunded requests totaling over $127 million. The Senate-passed bill aimed to increase funding by $126.7 million. The enacted FY2012 appropriations provide funding for the Emergency Forest Restoration Program (EFRP) at $28.4 million, which is $20.6 million less than the Senate-passed bill. The Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) program is also funded with $215.9 million, repurposing $31 million of previously authorized funding. EWP has a backlog of unfunded requests totaling over $200 million. The enacted FY2012 appropriation requires disaster designation for funding eligibility, potentially limiting recovery assistance distribution. USDA agricultural conservation programs offer various assistance, including working land, land retirement, easement, watershed, and technical assistance programs. NRCS and FSA are the main agencies administering these programs. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is funded through the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). The enacted FY2012 appropriation reduces discretionary NRCS funding by $45 million. Mandatory programs under the 2008 farm bill are authorized to automatically increase by an estimated $880 million in FY2012. The enacted FY2012 appropriation reduces discretionary NRCS funding by $45 million, while mandatory conservation programs are estimated to increase by $880 million. This reduction is more than the Senate-passed bill but less than the House-passed bill, reverting to a trend prior to the 2008 farm bill. The reduction mainly affects the Conservation Operations program. The FY2012 appropriation reduces discretionary NRCS funding by $45 million, with funding directed towards various Administration initiatives. The conference report provides funding for projects such as the Conservation Effects Assessment Project, Conservation Delivery Streamlining Initiative, and the Common Computing Environment. Other proposed initiatives were rejected in the report. The FY2012 budget rejected several proposed initiatives, including a $15 million increase for Strategic Watershed Action Teams and a fee for conservation planning. The Administration also sought to terminate programs like Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations and Watershed Rehabilitation, but funding for the latter was included in the enacted appropriations. The FY2012 budget included $8 million for the Watershed Rehabilitation program, which was not initially funded. The Resource Conservation and Development (RC&D) program, authorized in 1962 with 375 designated areas, had its funding terminated in FY2011 and continued in FY2012 as requested by the Administration. NRCS assists RC&D councils through an RC&D coordinator, with 80% of the budget directed towards personnel. Approximately 80% of the RC&D budget is directed towards personnel. The termination of RC&D funding could result in the survival of the 140 healthiest councils with funds from elsewhere, while the other 235 may be dissolved. Following the termination of the RC&D program and other funding reductions in FY2011, buyout and early retirement packages were approved for 544 positions at USDA. Over 400 buyout offers were made available to NRCS employees. The enacted FY2012 appropriation includes $7.5 million for the Water Bank Program, a program that was dormant since FY1995. The Water Bank Program (WBP) was eliminated in the FY1995 Agriculture Appropriations Act due to being duplicative of the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) and less effective. The program operated in 12 states, primarily in migratory waterfowl areas, with North Dakota receiving the most benefits. The Devils Lake and Stump Lake basins in North Dakota were potential beneficiaries of WBP funding. The Water Bank Program (WBP) was eliminated in the FY1995 Agriculture Appropriations Act due to being duplicative of the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) and less effective. The program operated in 12 states, primarily in migratory waterfowl areas, with North Dakota receiving the most benefits. The Devils Lake and Stump Lake basins in North Dakota were potential beneficiaries of WBP funding. The enacted FY2012 appropriation does not rescind the funding for mandatory conservation programs administered by NRCS and FSA, funded by the CCC without requiring annual appropriation. The enacted FY2012 appropriation reduces funding for mandatory conservation programs by $929 million, with cuts to programs like the Conservation Reserve Program and EQIP. Funding for the largest conservation program, CRP, remains unchanged at about $2.2 billion. The appropriation also adopts limits to EQIP at $1.4 billion for FY2012, a reduction of $350 million from the authorized level. The enacted FY2012 appropriation reduces funding for mandatory conservation programs by $929 million, with cuts to programs like the Conservation Reserve Program and EQIP. The reduction in funding for EQIP is $350 million from the authorized level. The primary differences between the enacted, House, and Senate bills are in the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) and the Grasslands Reserve Program (GRP). Congress has included reductions in mandatory conservation programs each year since FY2003 in the annual agricultural appropriations law. The FY2012 appropriation reduces funding for mandatory conservation programs by $929 million, with cuts to programs like the Conservation Reserve Program and EQIP. Reductions in conservation programs have been a concern for various groups and members of the House Agriculture Committee due to the impact on funding commitments established in the farm bill. The FY2012 appropriation reduces funding for mandatory conservation programs by $929 million, with cuts to programs like the Conservation Reserve Program and EQIP. Conservation advocates criticize reduced funding, especially for FY2012, as most farm bill program authorities will expire at the end of that fiscal year. To address concerns about the impact on the 10-year funding baseline for the farm bill reauthorization, the enacted FY2012 appropriation extends select farm bill expiration dates to 2014. The extension of select farm bill expiration dates to 2014 allows appropriators to score savings in FY2012 without affecting the overall farm bill baseline. CBO could score the amended conservation programs based on their authorized funding level in 2014, potentially reducing the impact on the Agriculture Committee's overall farm bill baseline. However, the reestablishment of the farm bill baseline through expiring conservation programs does not guarantee future support for conservation in subsequent farm bills. The extension of farm bill expiration dates to 2014 allows for savings in FY2012 without affecting the overall baseline. Programs like WRP and GRP lack funding beyond 2012, making them vulnerable to appropriations reductions. The Voluntary Public Access and Habitat Incentives Program faces termination in FY2012 due to lack of funding. Extending program authority would require offsets under current budget law. USDA's rural development mission involves three agencies: RHS, RBS, and RUS. The Rural Development mission area, consisting of RHS, RBS, and RUS, administers various programs with a budget authority of $2.25 billion for FY2012. This supports a program level of $36.15 billion in USDA rural development loans and grants. Salaries and expenses total $653.9 million, $34.4 million less than FY2011. Expenses in P.L. 112-55 total $653.9 million, $34.4 million less than FY2011 (-5%). The conference report allows the Secretary to allocate funds for rural development projects in strategic regional areas. A one-time fee of up to 3% of the loan principal is permitted for Business and Industry Guaranteed Loans. P.L. 112-55 provides $1.52 billion in budget authority for RHS, $156 million less than FY2011 (-9%). The enacted appropriation for RHS provides $1.09 billion for loans and grants, $134 million less than FY2011. This budget authority will support $26.5 billion in housing loans in FY2012, with the largest loan account being the single-family housing loan program. The guaranteed loan program is larger than the direct loan program, with $24 billion authorized. The Secretary can charge up to 4% for the loan guarantee fee. Most of the budget authority is for salaries and expenses rather than loan subsidy or grants. Section 504 Housing Repair loan programs receive $1.4 million to support $10 million in loans. The enacted appropriation for RHS provides $1.09 billion for loans and grants, $134 million less than FY2011. The Multi-Family Housing loan guarantee program grew by $100 million over FY2011. The Section 515 rental housing program receives $64.5 million in loan authority, $5 million less than FY2011. The rental assistance program (Section 521) receives $904.6 million, a decrease of $48 million from FY2011. Mutual and self-help housing grants receive $30 million, while rural housing assistance grants receive $33.1 million. The enacted appropriation for the Rural Community Facilities account is $29.3 million, a decrease of $12.1 million from FY2011. The budget includes grants for essential community facilities in rural areas with less than 20,000 population. Additionally, funding is provided for the Rural Community Development Initiative, Economic Impact Initiative Grants, and grants to tribal colleges. The budget also includes direct loans and guaranteed loans totaling $1.3 billion and $105.7 million respectively. The conference agreement allocates $113.9 million in FY2012 budget authority to the RBS before the Cushion of Credit rescission. The enacted appropriation for the Rural Community Facilities account is $29.3 million, a decrease of $12.1 million from FY2011. The budget includes grants for essential community facilities in rural areas with less than 20,000 population. Funding is provided for the Rural Community Development Initiative, Economic Impact Initiative Grants, and grants to tribal colleges. Direct loans and guaranteed loans totaling $1.3 billion and $105.7 million respectively are included in the budget. The conference agreement allocates $113.9 million in FY2012 budget authority to the RBS before the Cushion of Credit rescission. After transferring salaries and expenses, a net $109.3 million of budget authority supports the loan and grant program for the Rural Business Program account. The enacted appropriation provides $880.2 million in loan authority for various RBS loan programs. The conference agreement provides $74.8 million in budget authority for the Rural Business Program account, including various grant programs. The conference agreement provides $6 million in budget authority for the Intermediary Relending Program, with a loan level $1.4 million less than FY2011. Rural Cooperative Grants receive a total of $25.0 million, divided among different grant programs. The Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) receives $3.4 million in discretionary funds for loan subsidies. The conference report provides $3.4 million in discretionary funds for loan subsidies and grants, which is $1.6 million less than FY2011 and $33.4 million less than the budget request. The recommended loan subsidies would support $6.5 million in loans for FY2012, approximately $4.3 million less than in FY2011. The enacted appropriation blocks $3 million of mandatory spending for the Rural Microentrepreneur Assistance Program and provides no discretionary appropriation for the program. The conference agreement provides $587 million in budget authority for the Rural Utilities Service, with a net appropriation for loans and grant programs of $551.0 million, $46 million less than FY2011. Loan subsidies and grants under the Rural Water and Waste Disposal Program account for approximately 93% of the total budget authority under RUS programs. The conference agreement provides $513.0 million in budget authority for RUS programs, supporting direct and guaranteed loans totaling $793.6 million. The budget authority is allocated to various programs including Water/Waste Water subsidies and grants, Solid Waste Management grants, Individual Well Water grants, and High Energy Cost grants. Additionally, $7.0 billion is authorized for electric loans, with a majority for direct Federal Finance Bank electric loans. The Distance Learning/Telemedicine program receives $21.0 million in funding. The conference agreement provides $21.0 million in grant support for the Distance Learning/Telemedicine program, $11.4 million less than FY2011. The rural broadband program receives $6 million for direct loan subsidies and $10.4 million for grants, totaling $30.7 million below FY2011. Loan subsidies would support $212.0 million in broadband loans, $188.0 million below FY2011. Funding for domestic food assistance represents over two-thirds of USDA's budget and is mostly mandatory entitlements. The biggest mandatory food assistance programs include SNAP, child nutrition programs, and TEFAP. Discretionary budget items include WIC, CSFP, and federal nutrition program administration. The enacted FY2012 appropriation provides $105.6 billion for domestic food assistance programs, $6 billion more than requested by the Administration. The House bill reduced funding to the WIC program and TEFAP. The enacted FY2012 appropriation provides $80.4 billion for food assistance programs, with higher funding for WIC and TEFAP compared to the House bill. The enacted FY2012 appropriation provides $80.4 billion for food assistance programs, including $78.3 billion for SNAP, with a $3 billion contingency reserve and $5.5 million for administrative costs. The FY2012 appropriation includes $1.84 billion for administrative costs, $260 million for TEFAP commodities, $5 million each for Community Food Projects and SNAP program access grants, and $103 million for FDPIR. The House-passed bill reduced TEFAP funding to $200 million with a cap in Section 730. The ARRA will continue to provide added SNAP benefits until October 31, 2013. The FY2012 appropriation includes savings through a \"change in mandatory spending\" and rescinds SNAP employment and training funds. Child nutrition programs funded under the budget account include School Lunch and Breakfast programs, CACFP, Summer Food Service program, Special Milk program, and assistance for child-nutrition-related state administrative expenses. The FY2012 appropriation for child nutrition programs includes funding for state administrative expenses, procurement of commodities, Coordinated Reviews, Team Nutrition, food safety education, and support activities. The total appropriation is $18.2 billion, a 5% increase from FY2011, primarily due to added funding for school meal programs. The enacted FY2012 funding for child nutrition programs includes $10.2 billion for the School Lunch program, $3.3 billion for the School Breakfast program, $2.8 billion for the CACFP, $1.1 billion for procurement of commodities, $400 million for the Summer Food Service program, and $279 million for SAE. Funding for \"Hunger-Free Community\" and State Childhood Hunger Challenge grants was not provided. The enacted law responds to USDA's proposed rule on nutrition standards in school meal programs. The enacted FY2012 funding for child nutrition programs includes provisions influencing USDA's rulemaking on nutrition guidelines for school lunch and breakfast programs. The rule, based on recommendations from the National Research Council, includes changes to meal patterns. The Institute of Medicine's recommendations for school meal patterns include more fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and reductions in fat, calories, and sodium. The proposed rule also changes how tomato paste is credited in school lunch and breakfast programs, with all fruits and vegetables (except dried fruits and leafy greens) to be credited based on volume served. Section 743 of P.L. 112-55 prohibits funds from being used to implement a rule requiring crediting of tomato paste based on volume. The proposed rule changes how tomato paste is credited in school meal programs, impacting the nutritional crediting of cheese pizza without added vegetables. The rule would no longer allow the sauce on a typical cheese pizza to be credited as a serving of vegetables. Section 743 also addresses sodium reduction and whole grain requirements in the proposed rule. The proposed rule includes language on sodium reduction, whole grain requirements, and limits on starchy vegetables in school meals. Senator Susan Collins introduced amendments related to these aspects, which were negotiated with USDA and passed in October 2011. The Senate-passed bill includes language on starchy vegetables, with a focus on white potatoes. Sections 743 and 746 withhold funds for regulatory implementation, impacting USDA's rule timing. Section 734 allows schools to donate unused food without liability. The FY2012 appropriation provides $6.619 billion for WIC. The enacted FY2012 appropriation provides $6.619 billion for WIC, with $35 million more than the Senate-passed bill and $582 million more than the House-passed bill. It is $150 million below the FY2011 appropriation and $800 million less than the Administration's request. $60 million is allocated for breastfeeding peer counselors and related activities. WIC is a discretionarily funded program, historically treated as an entitlement. Questions arise about rising food costs not being fully accounted for in the Senate WIC amount. An inadequate appropriation may reduce services for pregnant women, infants, and children. The House-passed bill for the WIC program faced amendments and extensive debate over funding levels. An amendment by Representative Rosa DeLauro increased WIC funding by $147 million by prohibiting USDA payments to the Brazil Cotton Institute. This included an increase in the WIC appropriation section and an offset from mandatory funds under the Agriculture authorizing committee. The House-passed bill for the WIC program faced amendments and extensive debate over funding levels. Representative Lucas successfully raised a point of order against an offset provision, resulting in an increase to WIC funding without a corresponding offset. To address this, Chairman Kingston offered an amendment for an across-the-board 0.78% rescission to discretionary accounts in the bill, saving $147 million. This rescission affected the WIC section, resulting in WIC funding in H.R. 2112 being $6.001 billion. The WIC funding in H.R. 2112 was reduced to $6.001 billion from the original $6.048 billion figure. The Commodity Assistance Program budget account supports various programs including CSFP, TEFAP, WIC Farmers Market Nutrition program, and Pacific Island assistance. The enacted FY2012 appropriation allocated $242 million for the Commodity Assistance Program account. The FY2012 appropriation for the Commodity Assistance Program account is $4 million less than FY2011 appropriations and $54 million less than the Administration's request. Approximately $176.8 million will be appropriated for the CSFP, $48 million for TEFAP costs, and $17 million for the WIC Farmers' Market Nutrition Program. The total appropriation includes $1 million for Pacific Island assistance. The enacted FY2012 appropriation provides $139 million for federal administration of USDA domestic food assistance programs, including the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion. Food commodities for child nutrition programs are also funded through permanent appropriations under Section 32. The Fresh Fruit and Vegetable program, funded by the 2008 farm bill, provides fresh produce to elementary schools nationwide. The program receives mandatory funding at the beginning of each school year, but delays in funding availability have been common in recent years. The Agriculture appropriations act in 2012 allocated annual spending for the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable program by fiscal year, maintaining overall support. The Food Service Management Institute receives $4 million annually for technical assistance. The Seniors Farmers' Market Nutrition program gets $21 million per year outside the regular appropriations process. Farm bill programs funded promote U.S. agricultural exports, provide international food aid, and offer technical assistance for global agricultural productivity. The USDA Foreign Agriculture Service and USAID administer programs in developing countries to improve global agricultural productivity and market development. The Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) works to enhance U.S. agriculture's competitiveness in the global market and administers export credit guarantee and food aid programs. The Food for Peace Program aims to combat hunger, malnutrition, and promote global food security. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Export Credit Guarantee Program supports agricultural trade. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Export Credit Guarantee Program provides payment guarantees for U.S. agricultural exports. The McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program offers donations of U.S. agricultural products and assistance for school feeding projects in developing countries. Funding for foreign assistance and related programs in FY2012 was $1.836 billion, a decrease from FY2011 levels. The Administration requested $2.13 billion for foreign agriculture-related activities in FY2012, including mandatory spending for overseas market development and food assistance programs. The FY2012 appropriation for foreign agriculture-related activities was $473 million more than the House-passed bill and $94 million less than the Senate-passed bill. The enacted appropriation included $176.3 million for the Foreign Agriculture Service, which was $9.3 million less than FY2011. The Administration's budget request for FAS was $230 million, with $20 million for trade expansion activities under the National Export Initiative. The FY2012 budget for foreign agriculture activities included $14.6 million for reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq. Food for Peace humanitarian aid received $1.466 billion, $31 million less than the previous year. The enacted funding levels were $224 million lower than the Administration's request. The House bill proposed $1.03 billion for Title II aid, while the Senate bill proposed $1.56 billion. No new funding was requested for Title I or Title III activities. The FY2012 budget for foreign agriculture activities included $14.6 million for reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq. Food for Peace humanitarian aid received $1.466 billion, $31 million less than the previous year. Three provisions affecting the Food for Peace program were included in the General Provisions of P.L. 112-55, including waivers for minimum funding requirements, limits on funds available for reimbursement, and requirements for monitoring and controls for assistance to recipient nations. The Obama budget requests do not allow the Administrator of USAID to use up to 25% of Food for Peace Title II funds for local or regional purchases of commodities. Instead, $300 million from the International Disaster Assistance account is made available for local and regional procurement of food assistance. The 2008 farm bill authorized $60 million of CCC funds for this purpose. Monitoring and controls are in place to ensure emergency food aid reaches intended beneficiaries in areas affected by food shortages. The 2008 farm bill authorized $60 million of CCC funds for a pilot project to assess local and regional purchases of food aid for emergency relief. P.L. 112-55 provides $184.0 million for the McGovern-Dole Program, $15.1 million less than FY2011 levels. The enacted FY2012 appropriation includes $6.8 million of discretionary appropriations for administrative expenses to support an overall program level of $5.5 billion. The House-passed bill would have provided $6.8 million for administrative expenses, while the Senate bill would have provided $6.5 million. Export credit programs are permanently authorized, with appropriations used for administrative expenses. The 2008 farm bill includes mandatory funding for programs promoting export market development, such as the Market Access Program, Foreign Market Development Program, TASC Program, and Emerging Markets Program. Administration requested mandatory funding levels for international food assistance programs include $156 million for Food for Progress and $5 million for other programs. The FY2012 appropriations act does not specifically address the USDA-wide initiative \"Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food.\" However, a reporting requirement is placed on USDA to post information on its website prior to any travel related to the initiative and submit a report on its impacts over the previous two years. The House-passed version of H.R. 2112 contained provisions to restrict funding for activities under \"Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food.\" The \"Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food\" initiative, a USDA-wide program launched in 2009, aims to develop local and regional food systems and promote economic opportunities. The Senate-passed version of the FY2012 appropriations act did not impose funding restrictions on this initiative. It is designed to enhance collaboration among USDA programs and staff to support the connection between local production and consumption. The USDA's \"Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food\" initiative aims to support local and regional food systems by leveraging existing programs within the department. It is not a standalone program with its own budget but rather a departmental initiative focused on connecting local production with consumption. Various programs are available to support local farmers, strengthen rural communities, promote healthy eating, protect natural resources, and provide grants and loans. The initiative also aims to link local and regional food production systems through marketing and promotion programs, rural and community development programs, and other initiatives. The USDA's \"Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food\" initiative supports local and regional food systems by utilizing existing department programs. It aims to connect local production with consumption through various programs, grants, and loans. Some USDA nutrition and food programs, like farm-to-school initiatives, are associated with the effort. Funding has been announced for projects promoting sustainable operations. Congressional challenges have been raised regarding the initiative's spending. The USDA's \"Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food\" initiative has faced concerns about its spending and prioritization of local food systems. A letter questioned the focus on small, hobbyist, and organic producers over conventional farmers. USDA clarified that the initiative is a communications mechanism to support existing programs, not a standalone program with budgetary authority. The USDA's \"Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food\" initiative does not have standalone programs but supports existing programs through authorizing legislation and regulations. Some programs have preferences for local and regional food system projects, such as a 5% set-aside in the 2008 farm bill and an allowance for schools to use $5 million for local purchases under the Department of Defense Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program. In FY2010, USDA set a goal for each state to fund at least one project supporting the initiative. The FY2012 House-passed bill included provisions restricting funding for USDA programs supporting local and regional food production projects and the \"Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food\" initiative. The House bill prohibited funds for the initiative and required USDA to provide notification and post media advisories for any related travel. The House report expressed concern about USDA awarding over $23 million in grants for regional food systems and directed the agency to focus on high-priority research. Representative Foxx introduced an amendment to prohibit funding for the \"Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food\" initiative. Other failed amendments aimed to support local food systems and fund programs like the Healthy Food Financing Initiative. The FY2012 appropriation bill does not address USDA's \"Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food\" initiative. However, a reporting requirement is placed on USDA regarding the initiative. The Department is directed to post travel information related to the initiative on its website and submit a report on the initiative's impacts over the previous two years to Congress. The House and Senate committees recommended no appropriation for USDA's Healthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI) in the fiscal year 2013 budget. The President's budget proposed $35 million for this initiative, which aims to provide financing for businesses that promote nutritious foods. The joint explanatory statement of the conference report confirmed that no appropriation was included for HFFI. The conference report reiterates that the enacted agreement does not include an appropriation for HFFI and questions the effectiveness of the initiative. It directs USDA to develop metrics to measure the initiative's effectiveness. The FDA regulates food safety, cosmetics, drugs, biologics, and medical devices. FDA's budget falls under the jurisdiction of the Agriculture appropriations subcommittees. The FDA's budget for FY2012 consists of direct appropriations and user fees. The total program level is $3.899 billion, which is 5.7% higher than FY2011 but 9.3% lower than the President's request. The direct appropriation is $2.506 billion, 1.99% higher than FY2011. User fees amount to $1.393 billion, including fees for prescription drugs, medical devices, and tobacco.
