Financial incentives are needed to support the development of facilities for commercial-scale production of synthetic fuels. The \"Foreign Oil Displacement Act\" promotes a synthetic fuels industry using domestic resources. It introduces the carbonaceous fuels facility credit, providing a 28% credit for qualified investments in carbonaceous fuels conversion facilities. The carbonaceous fuels conversion facility is defined as a facility owned by the taxpayer, depreciable under section 167, with a useful life of at least 4 years. The carbonaceous fuels conversion facility must be owned by the taxpayer, depreciable under section 167, and have a useful life of at least 4 years.

For non-self-constructed property, qualified progress expenditures are the amount paid to another person for construction during the taxable year. Other definitions are provided for this subsection.

'Non-self-constructed property' is property that does not meet this criteria. 'Construction' includes reconstruction and erection in this context.

An election can be made regarding these expenditures, which applies to the current and subsequent taxable years. Coordination with other credits is also mentioned in this subsection.
