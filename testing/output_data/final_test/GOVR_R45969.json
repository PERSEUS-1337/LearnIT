It provided relief to the American airline industry and established the Victim Compensation Fund (VCF) to compensate those affected by the attacks. The VCF was reopened and expanded in 2011 to include responders and others affected by health issues after the attacks. It has been reauthorized multiple times and is currently authorized through FY2092 with a deadline for claims in 2090. The VCF, created by Title IV of the ATSSA, provided cash benefits to those affected by the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. A special master determined benefit amounts based on economic and noneconomic losses. Payments did not include punitive damages and were reduced by collateral source payments. The deadline for VCF claims is October 1, 2090. The VCF, established by the ATSSA, provided compensation for 9/11 victims. Benefits were based on economic and noneconomic losses, excluding punitive damages and offset by collateral source payments. Filing a VCF claim waived the right to sue for damages in federal or state court. Funding for the VCF was provided by Congress with no cap on benefits. The VCF was established to provide compensation for 9/11 victims based on economic and noneconomic losses. The original VCF closed in 2003 after receiving 7,403 claims and awarding $7.049 billion to 5,560 claimants. It was reopened in 2010 to extend eligibility for cash benefits to those who suffered physical injuries or illnesses from rescue, recovery, or debris removal work at the September 11th crash sites. The Victim Compensation Fund (VCF) was reopened for new claims from September 11, 2001 to May 30, 2002, providing compensation for 9/11 victims and those near the World Trade Center. Total benefits were capped at $2.775 billion, with attorney fees limited to 10% of the award. The VCF was reauthorized in 2015, extending the claim period for five years. The Victim Compensation Fund (VCF) was reauthorized in 2015 with a $7.375 billion funding cap for Group A and B claims. In 2019, the VCF was reauthorized again with a funding cap of $4.6 billion for Group B claims, extending the deadline to October 1, 2090. The 2019 reauthorization extends the VCF deadline to October 1, 2090. Eligibility for VCF benefits includes being a victim of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks or being present at a crash site and suffering physical harm. Survivors are also eligible for the VCF. To be eligible for VCF benefits related to the September 11th attacks, individuals must have suffered physical harm as a result, demonstrated by a WTC-related physical health condition covered by the WTCHP. This includes conditions listed in the Public Health Service Act and those added by the WTCHP administrator. Exposure after the attacks must be a significant factor in the illness to qualify for compensation. The WTCHP provides guidance to determine if a person's condition was caused by exposure after the 9/11 attacks. Certification by WTCHP is required for compensation by the VCF, based on time spent at the site and specific activities engaged in. For example, search and rescue workers must have been present for at least 4 hours for certification. The WTCHP evaluates exposure conditions for VCF compensation eligibility based on time spent at the site and specific activities engaged in. Mental health conditions are not considered for VCF benefits, and cancer coverage is periodically reviewed for inclusion in the WTCHP. The WTCHP evaluates exposure conditions for VCF compensation eligibility based on time spent at the site and specific activities engaged in. Cancer coverage is periodically reviewed for inclusion in the WTCHP, and a petition was filed by several representatives and senators to add new medical evidence showing increased cancer rates to the list of covered conditions. The WTCHP administrator added over 60 types of cancer to the list of WTC-related health conditions, making them compensable under the VCF, based on new medical evidence and STAC recommendations. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the WTCHP administrator used a hazards-based approach to evaluate cancers for inclusion on the WTC-related health list, based on post-9/11 exposures. A scientific panel supported this approach but suggested it could benefit from independent peer review. The WTCHP administrator added prostate cancer to the list of WTC-related health conditions and established latency periods for cancer and onset periods for aerodigestive disorders. The VCF, administered by the Civil Division of the Department of Justice, appoints a special master to decide on eligibility and benefits, with the option for claimants to appeal decisions. A claimant can appeal VCF decisions before a hearing officer, with no further appeal or review options. Claims must be filed by October 1, 2090, and claimants must register by specific deadlines based on their knowledge of 9/11-related harm. Amendments to claims are allowed with new relevant material. The VCF provides benefits to individuals affected by the September 11th attacks, with no cap on total benefit amount but limits on individual amounts. Benefits are determined by economic and noneconomic losses, with a cap of $250,000 for cancer claims and $90,000 for other claims. In cases of WTC-related health condition causing death, the presumed award is $250,000 for noneconomic loss plus an additional $100,000. The VCF regulations provide $250,000 for noneconomic loss, with an additional $100,000 for the person's spouse and dependents. The special master can exceed these limits for \"special circumstances.\" Economic losses are calculated based on the first $200,000 of annual income, with adjustments for inflation. VCF benefits are reduced by collateral source payments like life insurance, workers' compensation, and government benefits. The 2019 reauthorization of the Public Safety Officers' Benefits program ensures that any benefit award previously reduced due to insufficient funding will be paid in full. To receive a VCF award for 9/11 attacks, individuals must waive their right to sue entities like airlines or building owners for damages, but can still sue knowing participants in the attacks or recover collateral source obligations. The VCF statute grants exclusive jurisdiction to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York over lawsuits related to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and establishes liability limits for various entities involved. Attorney fees for claimant assistance are capped at 10% of the VCF award amount, with the special master having the authority to reduce excessive fees. Recipients of VCF awards are prohibited from receiving additional compensation from the United States Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund. The 2019 VCF reauthorization provides funding for VCF awards without requiring annual appropriations or being subject to the annual appropriations process."
