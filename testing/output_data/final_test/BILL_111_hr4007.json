    "content": "Medical tribunal pilot programs. The Secretary of Health and Human Services can grant funds to 5 States for pilot programs where medical malpractice cases are heard by a tribunal consisting of a judge, physician, and lawyer. States must meet certain criteria to be eligible for the grant. A grant awarded over 3 fiscal years requires states to establish a medical tribunal pilot program for hearing medical malpractice cases. The program includes elements such as hearing cases in the first instance and determining admissible evidence. The medical tribunal determines if evidence is sufficient for a plaintiff's case. If deemed sufficient, the case proceeds through the usual judicial process. If deemed insufficient, the plaintiff must file a bond before pursuing the case further. The composition of a medical tribunal includes a State trial court judge, a licensed physician, and a licensed lawyer. The judge selects the physician and lawyer from lists provided by the State medical and bar associations. If the defendant in a medical malpractice case is not a physician, a practitioner in the relevant field of healthcare is included. The State trial court judge selects a practitioner in the relevant field of healthcare to serve on the medical tribunal instead of a physician. After the 3rd fiscal year of grant funds, the Secretary collects data on the effectiveness of medical tribunals from each State. The State receives grant funds to assess medical malpractice insurance costs, number of practicing physicians, insurance carriers, and settlement amounts. It also evaluates the percentage of meritorious malpractice cases settled before trial compared to all cases filed in the 3-year period prior to receiving the funds. The State assesses medical malpractice cases settled before trial, including meritorious and nonmeritorious cases, and reports data to Congress 18 months after receiving grant funds. In medical malpractice cases, a tribunal determines if the evidence supports the plaintiff's claim. A medical malpractice case involves harm from a healthcare provider's error or breach of care. Appropriations are authorized for implementing this section from 2011 to 2013."
