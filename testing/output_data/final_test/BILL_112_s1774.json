SEC. 3. ROCKY MOUNTAIN FRONT CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT AREA. The Rocky Mountain Front Conservation Management Area is established in the State, consisting of approximately 195,073 acres of Federal land managed by the Forest Service and 13,087 acres managed by the Bureau of Land Management. Any acquired land within the area will become part of the Conservation Management Area and be managed accordingly. The Conservation Management Area established in the State includes Federal land managed by the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management, governed by specific laws and regulations to conserve, protect, and enhance for public benefit. The Conservation Management Area is managed to conserve, protect, and enhance its resources in accordance with specific laws and regulations applicable to the National Forest System and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. The Conservation Management Area, managed by the Bureau of Land Management, allows only specified uses determined by the Secretary to further conservation purposes. Motorized vehicles are restricted to existing roads, trails, and designated areas. The Secretary can reroute or close roads to protect natural resources and construct temporary roads for vegetation management projects in the Conservation Management Area. The Secretary can authorize the use of motorized vehicles for administrative purposes, including noxious weed eradication or grazing management, and responding to emergencies. Temporary roads constructed for vegetation management projects must be decommissioned within 3 years. Grazing is permitted in the Conservation Management Area. The Secretary allows grazing within the Conservation Management Area, subject to regulations and laws, and consistent with the area's purposes. Vegetation management projects can also be conducted within the area, following reasonable regulations. The Secretary permits grazing in the Conservation Management Area, subject to regulations, laws, and purposes outlined in subsection (b). SEC. 4. DESIGNATION OF WILDERNESS ADDITIONS. Certain Federal land in the State is designated as wilderness and added to the National Wilderness Preservation System, including approximately 50,401 acres to the Bob Marshall Wilderness and approximately 16,711 acres to the Scapegoat Wilderness in the Lewis and Clark National Forest. The Public Law 92-395 designates certain Federal land in the State as wilderness additions to the National Wilderness Preservation System. The Secretary shall administer these lands in accordance with the Wilderness Act, allowing for continued grazing of livestock and maintenance of existing facilities. The Secretary may take measures to manage wildfires, insects, and diseases in designated wilderness areas, coordinating with state or local agencies as needed. The designation of wilderness additions does not create protective buffer zones, and nonwilderness activities may be visible or audible within the area. Activities or uses within a designated wilderness addition shall not restrict those activities outside the wilderness area. Overflights, including low-level overflights, are not restricted within wilderness or the Conservation Management Area. SEC. 5. The Secretary will prepare maps and legal descriptions for the Conservation Management Area and wilderness additions. These documents will have the same legal force as the Act, with the Secretary allowed to correct errors. They will be available for public inspection. SEC. 6 addresses noxious weed management.
