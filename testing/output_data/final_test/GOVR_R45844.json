    "content": "In 2018, 59 major disasters were declared under the Stafford Act, and as of May 23, 2019, 27 major disasters have been declared. The demand for federal budget resources increased due to ongoing recovery efforts and new disasters, leading to requests for supplemental appropriations by the Administration. The Trump Administration did not formally request supplemental funding. The Trump Administration did not request supplemental funding for disaster assistance in FY2019. Congressional leadership initiated consideration of a $19.19 billion supplemental appropriations measure in June 2019 (P.L. 116-20). This report provides a legislative history and overview of issues related to supplemental disaster assistance appropriations. The remaining regular appropriations bills were funded under two continuing resolutions lasting until December 21, 2018. Discussions about supplemental appropriations for disaster assistance had been ongoing, with the Senate passing a third CR for FY2019 on December 19, 2018. The House amended the bill the next day, adding $7.8 billion for disaster assistance, which passed by a vote of 217-185. On December 21, the Senate agreed to consider the House-passed bill, but without enough votes to proceed. This led to a partial government shutdown when funding expired. The 115th Congress adjourned, and the 116th Congress took office. A new bill was introduced to provide disaster relief funding and end the shutdown with a continuing resolution through February. The partial government shutdown was resolved by a continuing resolution through February 8. The House passed the bill on January 16, 2019, with amendments, and the Senate considered it on January 22, 2019. Cloture attempts on amendments by McConnell and Schumer were unsuccessful on January 24, 2019. The shutdown was ended with a separate measure providing for continuing appropriations through February 15. On March 14, the Senate returned to consideration of H.R. 268. On March 14, the Senate resumed consideration of H.R. 268. Cloture was invoked on March 26, and the measure was laid before the Senate on March 28. Chairman Shelby offered a substitute amendment providing $13.45 billion for disaster relief. Attempts to invoke cloture on both the amendment and H.R. 268 on April 1 were unsuccessful. Chairwoman Lowey introduced H.R. 2157 on April 9, a supplemental appropriations bill for previous and additional disasters. The bill passed the House on May 10, 2019, with $19.26 billion in discretionary spending. The Senate and House reached a bipartisan agreement on FY2019 disaster funding, with the amended bill passing 354-58 in the House and signed into law as P.L. 116-20 on June 6, 2019. Congressional clients can refer to CRS Report R45714 for further details on specific programs and provisions in the bill. Table 1 in CRS Report R45714 outlines disaster supplemental appropriations for FY2019 proposed by senior party leadership or enacted, organized by appropriations subcommittee. It shows specified amounts in bill text, excluding indefinite appropriations. P.L. 116-20's Medicaid appropriation is not included due to unspecified amounts. Some appropriations in P.L. 116-20 are available until expended, while others have limited availability, such as Grant funding through the Department of Agriculture for various purposes (available through FY2020). The curr_chunk outlines appropriations for various purposes through different fiscal years for agencies like NOAA, U.S. Coast Guard, National Park Service, Forest Service, Department of Labor, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Education, and Military Construction. The federal government has a role in supporting state and local governments in disaster response and recovery through regular annual appropriations and supplemental appropriations when necessary. P.L. 116-20 was developed by Congress without a formal request from the Administration for disaster funding. The Administration has requested supplemental appropriations for disaster funding, raising various issues in congressional debate such as timeliness, scope, budget limits, offsets, and oversight of spending. Congressional offices seek information on past enactment times for disaster assistance appropriations, but this question lacks a clear answer. The question of past enactment times for disaster assistance appropriations lacks a clear answer due to various reasons. There are significantly fewer supplemental appropriations measures than declared disasters, as recovery efforts may not always require federal funding beyond regular annual appropriations. Appropriations for disaster recovery may come in multiple measures over several years, with a single act potentially meeting needs from multiple disasters. Table 2 provides data on Stafford Act major disaster declarations and public laws with supplemental disaster assistance appropriations from 2011 to 2018. In the period from 2011 to 2018, there were 17 catastrophic events and 12 public laws enacted with supplemental appropriations for disaster assistance. The time from a disaster to a supplemental appropriations measure does not provide meaningful data for calculating an average due to the disparity between disaster declarations and supplemental measures. The 2017 hurricane season exemplifies the challenge of calculating this time frame accurately. The appropriations measures for Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria included funding for the Disaster Relief Fund, Small Business Administration disaster loans, and HUD's CDBG-DR program. Three acts were enacted at different times, with the third addressing the largest range of programs. This scenario raises questions about which supplemental appropriations bills should be associated. The comparison of time between Hurricane Irma and supplemental appropriations versus Hurricane Harvey and supplemental appropriations shows limited meaningful differences in how Congress and the Administration approached relief processes. The enactment of supplemental appropriations legislation is influenced by legislative rhythms and may move more quickly at certain times due to the legislative environment. Supplemental appropriations are often included in various legislative vehicles such as continuing appropriations measures and consolidated appropriations measures. These vehicles serve as a convenient way to allocate additional funds for disaster recovery programs. For example, the FAA Reauthorization Act included a $1.68 billion supplemental appropriation for CDBG-DR in areas impacted by major disasters declared in 2018. Administration requests for supplemental disaster assistance can also impact the timing of these appropriations. The timing of congressional consideration of supplemental appropriations can be influenced by requests for supplemental disaster assistance. Individual Members of Congress or state delegations may propose legislation, but it is usually not taken up without consultation with majority party leadership. The Administration's request for supplemental appropriations sets the stage for congressional deliberations on the federal government's needs. In 2017, three requests were made for disaster-related funding. In 2017, three requests for disaster-related funding were made, leading to supplemental appropriations measures being enacted. P.L. 116-20 was enacted without a formal request for supplemental disaster assistance appropriations for FY2019. The Budget Control Act of 2011 placed limits on discretionary spending, with exceptions for emergency requirements. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 established limits on discretionary spending and adjustments to those limits. The Budget Control Act of 2011 placed limits on discretionary spending, with exceptions for emergency requirements, including disaster relief. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 also provided for adjustments to discretionary spending limits for emergency needs, sparking debate over potential abuse of designated funding. The Budget Control Act of 2011 imposed limits on discretionary spending, with exceptions for emergency requirements like disaster relief. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 modified the calculation for disaster relief adjustments, allowing for additional budget authority. When Congress provides more funding for disaster relief than the adjustment allows, the emergency designation can be used. Congress is divided on the issue of disaster relief funding. Senator Mitt Romney introduced an amendment to eliminate the adjustment for disaster relief in FY2021, advocating for including funding for natural disasters in the annual budget process to avoid increasing national debt. Congress may also provide disaster recovery funding with an emergency designation, as seen in P.L. 116-20. Congress has debated whether disaster relief costs should be offset by cuts to other spending, especially with the constraints of the Budget Control Act. The question is whether disaster relief should be treated like regular appropriations under the BCA spending caps, potentially requiring an offset. The debate in Congress revolves around whether disaster relief costs should be offset by cuts to other spending to prevent breaching spending caps and triggering sequestration. FEMA's DRF has historically received prompt funding without offsets, but there have been instances of shifting resources between programs for disaster assistance. One notable occurrence was after Hurricane Katrina, where $23.4 billion was rescinded from the DRF and appropriated to other agencies for disaster response and recovery. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Michael Enzi raised the issue of disaster offsets on April 4, 2019. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Michael Enzi commended Senator Romney for addressing the challenge of budgeting for disasters and emergencies. Enzi emphasized the importance of incorporating disaster relief funding into base budgets and expressed willingness to work with colleagues on better budgeting strategies. The Senate Budget Committee discussed options such as offsetting emergency spending increases with reductions in other areas or establishing a dedicated fund. Budgeting for emergencies and disasters is a complex task that requires careful consideration. One option is to establish a dedicated fund for emergencies, similar to how some States budget for these events. Another possibility is to create an actuarially sound insurance program to assess the risk for disasters while keeping premiums affordable. Congress can improve its approach to emergency funding by avoiding adding to the debt and finding ways to offset costs, as seen in the case of Hurricane Sandy relief efforts. The Obama Administration requested $60.4 billion in supplemental appropriations for Hurricane Sandy, with $11.5 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund, and opposed offsetting the cost of the legislation. During Senate debate on a supplemental appropriations bill after Hurricane Sandy, a point of order was raised against the emergency designation for $3.4 billion in Army Corps of Engineers Construction appropriation for disaster mitigation projects. The motion to waive the point of order failed, leading to the elimination of the emergency designation. This decision meant that the $3.4 billion for the mitigation projects would count against discretionary spending limits, setting a precedent for requiring offsets for disaster assistance. The Trump Administration's disaster supplemental appropriations requests have sought an emergency designation for funding, with the November 2017 request including offsets for additional spending. This approach suggested rescissions, spending cuts, and potential future savings to offset costs, unlike previous requests. No offsets were included in the supplemental appropriations measures enacted after the 2017 disasters. The supplemental appropriations measures enacted after the 2017 disasters have been criticized for including \"unrelated\" spending. Determining what appropriations may be considered \"unrelated\" presents methodological challenges. The content of these measures typically goes beyond the colloquial name associated with them. The scope, purpose, and size of a supplemental appropriations measure can be driven by events, unfunded needs, and political support. The supplemental appropriations measures for disaster relief and recovery are driven by events, unfunded needs, and political support. Controlling language is often included to clarify specific appropriations and counter unrelated spending charges. P.L. 115-123 included various forms of controlling language to limit the availability of funds. The supplemental appropriations measures for disaster relief and recovery include controlling language to limit funds for specific purposes related to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, as well as other natural disasters in 2017. This language does not typically apply to accounts focused on disaster assistance, such as the SBA Disaster Loan Program Account and FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund. The $1.65 billion supplemental appropriation for the Department of Transportation's Emergency Relief Program under the Federal Highway Administration in P.L. 116-20 provides flexibility for agencies to meet evolving needs. FEMA's DRF appropriations are regularly used for relief efforts from multiple disasters across fiscal years, allowing for effective response without limiting resources. The appropriations in P.L. 116-20, totaling almost twice the amount provided for the DRF in P.L. 113-2, include controlling language mainly referencing Hurricanes Michael and Florence. The appropriations evolved over time to address additional disaster needs, showing flexibility in responding to various incidents. The Department of Agriculture funding in P.L. 116-20 increased from $1.1 billion to over $3 billion. The assistance now covers losses from various natural disasters in 2018 and 2019. Funding for disaster relief varies in how it is used, requiring a comparison of timelines to assess program efficiency. Assessing program efficiency for disaster relief funding involves understanding differences in mission and program structure. Costs for relief efforts can be incurred upfront or reimbursed later, depending on the type of assistance provided. Some projects, like infrastructure restoration, may take longer to obligate and expend funding. Redevelopment funds may also require time for state and local governments to develop and get approval for a plan before funds can be obligated. Disaster recovery funding may not have an expiration date, but some grants for operational costs and specific programs may have limited availability. Concerns about waste and fraud are heightened for disaster relief funding, with special attention given to oversight efforts. The 2019 disaster supplemental appropriations include funds for audits and oversight, with $27 million allocated for this purpose. The federal government has faced challenges in tracking disaster relief spending, with over $277 billion in obligations identified over a 10-year period. However, not all disaster-related programs and activities were separately tracked, leading to difficulties in accountability. At least 5 federal departments and agencies reported that some disaster assistance programs are not separately tracked due to budget integration. The federal government has challenges in tracking disaster relief spending, with over $277 billion in obligations identified over a 10-year period. Some disaster assistance programs are not separately tracked due to budget integration. For example, U.S. Coast Guard and Army expenses related to disaster readiness are not separately tracked. Other federal departments and agencies also struggle to track disaster assistance activities. Disaster assistance activities lack reliable tracking, making it difficult to estimate spending. Implementing consistent reporting requirements for agencies providing disaster relief could help clarify federal spending. This includes pass-through requirements for state and local governments to provide contract and subcontract data. However, this information alone cannot determine if funds are being misused. The Office of Management and Budget issued new guidelines for tracking emergency funding and disaster relief funds, requiring agencies to use a special accounting code. It is uncertain if the FY2019 supplemental appropriations will be monitored similarly to previous disaster relief funding. Congress has previously attempted to track large supplemental appropriations after events like Hurricane Sandy. After Hurricane Sandy, a Recovery and Transparency Board (RATB) was authorized to detect and prevent waste, fraud, and abuse in funds. The RATB developed a website with financial reports and spending summaries under the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013. The RATB's mission was extended and funded until FY2015, but it shut down at the end of that year. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) established a Program Management Office (PMO) in 2013 to monitor Hurricane Sandy Recovery funding, working in coordination with the RATB. The HUD Sandy PMO transferred its responsibilities to FEMA's OFDC in November 2014. Data comparison between agencies was challenging due to inconsistent methodologies, such as FEMA reporting all obligations for Hurricane Sandy, not just those funded by P.L. 113-2."
