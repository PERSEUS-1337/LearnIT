    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Civil War Defenses of Washington National Historical Park Act\" and includes sections on findings, purpose, redesignation, areas included in the park, possible inclusion of additional areas, a report on the National Civil War History Education Center, administration, and definitions. The Congress finds and declares the significance of the Civil War as the United States commemorates its 150th anniversary. It was a tragic war that divided the nation but also led to the abolition of slavery and the establishment of the United States as a beacon of hope and democracy. The Civil War's impact on the United States, with its battlegrounds soaked in blood, pitted families and friends against each other. The war ultimately led to a stronger nation, advancing towards achieving the founders' goals and values. The defenses of Washington played a crucial role in the war's outcome, constructed in 1861 as fortifications. During the Civil War, Washington's defenses were crucial, with 68 forts, 93 batteries, and 807 cannons. Confederate General Jubal Early's 1864 campaign aimed to attack the Nation's Capital from the north, diverting Union forces from Richmond. During the Civil War, Confederate General Jubal Early aimed to attack Washington from the north but was delayed by Union forces at the Battle of Monocacy and Battle of Fort Stevens. The Shenandoah Valley Campaign ended with Union General Philip Sheridan defeating General Early at the Battle of Cedar Creek. The Battle of Fort Stevens was the second and last attempt by the Confederates to attack Washington, following the failed effort at Gettysburg in 1863. President Abraham Lincoln redefined the nation's purpose in his address at Gettysburg Cemetery in November 1863. The Battle of Fort Stevens was a crucial moment during the Civil War, where President Abraham Lincoln came under hostile fire. It was the only time a sitting President faced such a threat. The battle was a key defense of Washington, with the potential loss of the Nation's Capital, Presidency, Union Government, and emancipation at stake. The victory at Fort Stevens saved the city and national government, leading to Union victories in the Shenandoah Valley, ensuring Lincoln's re-election and the preservation of the Union. After the war, most Civil War defenses of Washington were returned to private landowners, with some sites remaining in public ownership. The Senate McMillan Commission in 1902 proposed the development of a \"Fort Drive\" to connect Civil War defenses in Washington, DC. Funds were allocated in the 1930s to purchase lands for this project, but it was never fully completed. The remaining Civil War defenses in Washington offer natural and recreational resources, as well as scenic views of the Nation's Capital, contributing to its history and character. Sites associated with Civil War defenses in Washington, managed by the National Park Service, require Congressional action for proper protection, management, and interpretation to preserve their historical and educational significance. The battles in the District of Columbia, Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland during the Civil War were pivotal to the war's outcome and the promise of the United States. It is crucial to protect, preserve, and interpret these historically important sites for present and future generations to honor the vision of democracy reflected in the Constitution. The National Historical Park commemorates the American Civil War's impact on the values and strengths of the United States. The Act aims to protect and interpret the cultural and historical resources of the Civil War defenses in Washington, Virginia, and Maryland, as well as explore creative ways to convey the war's history effectively. The Act of 1864 aims to assemble and convey historical resources for the public's benefit. The Civil War defenses of Washington have been redesignated as the Civil War Defenses of Washington National Historical Park. This change is in line with the Act of 1864, which aims to gather historical resources for public benefit. The Civil War Defenses of Washington National Historical Park includes various fortifications and associated lands currently owned by the Federal Government and under the administration of the National Park Service. The Civil War Defenses of Washington National Historical Park includes forts like Fort Reno, Fort Ricketts, Fort Slocum, Fort Stanton, Fort Stevens, and Fort Totten, as well as affiliated National Park Areas such as Fort Circle Drive, Battleground National Cemetery, Fort Washington, and Oxon Cove Park. Local government-owned sites in Virginia, Maryland, or DC can also affiliate with the park through cooperative agreements. The Civil War Defenses of Washington National Historical Park includes forts like Fort Ward, Fort C.F. Smith, Fort Ethan Allen, Fort Willard, and Battery Bailey. SEC. 5. POSSIBLE INCLUSION OF ADDITIONAL AREAS. The Secretary may affiliate private sites with the Civil War defenses of Washington National Historical Park through cooperative agreements. Non-Federal properties require owner consent for inclusion in the park, and the Secretary cannot use condemnation to acquire land for the park. The Secretary must consult with state and local officials, organizations, and the public before entering into cooperative agreements under this Act. SEC. 6. NATIONAL CIVIL WAR HISTORY EDUCATION CENTER REPORT. The Secretary is tasked with studying and finding ways to preserve the history of the Civil War, including the defenses of Washington and the Shenandoah Valley Campaign of 1864, for public education and inspiration about the war's impact on the United States. Assistance from experts and organizations is sought for this study. The Secretary will submit a report with recommendations to Congress one year after the enactment of the Act regarding the study on preserving the history of the Civil War. SEC. 7. ADMINISTRATION. The Secretary administers the National Historical Park in accordance with applicable laws. They may provide technical assistance, accept donations, and enter into cooperative agreements for the preservation of Civil War defenses of Washington.

They can also mark significant historical sites related to the Civil War in Washington, northern Virginia, and Montgomery County with consent from the owners. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS.
