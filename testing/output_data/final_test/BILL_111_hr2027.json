    "content": "The Act titled \"Aircraft Passenger Whole-Body Imaging Limitations Act of 2009\" limits the use of whole-body imaging technology for aircraft passenger screening. The Aircraft Passenger Whole-Body Imaging Limitations Act of 2009 amends Section 44901 of title 49, United States Code to restrict the use of whole-body imaging technology for passenger screening. The Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security must ensure that this technology is not used as the sole method of screening and can only be used if another screening method indicates a need to prevent the passenger from boarding an aircraft. The Aircraft Passenger Whole-Body Imaging Limitations Act of 2009 restricts the use of whole-body imaging technology for passenger screening. Passengers must be provided with information on the technology, privacy policies, and the option for a pat-down search instead of screening. Images generated by the technology cannot be stored, transferred, shared, or copied. The Assistant Secretary must report annually to Congress on the implementation of the restrictions on whole-body imaging technology for passenger screening. This report includes data on the number of passengers screened with this technology, the percentage of passengers opting for a pat-down search, privacy protection measures, and any privacy violations related to the technology. In this subsection, definitions for \"pat-down search\" and \"whole-body imaging technology\" are provided. A pat-down search is a physical inspection of an aircraft passenger's body according to TSA procedures, while whole-body imaging technology uses x-rays or millimeter waves to detect objects on individuals. Whole-body imaging technology creates a visual image of an individual's full body, showing the skin surface and objects on the body. The text introduces a penalty for the misuse of certain images related to aircraft passenger screening by officers or employees of the United States. Violators may face fines or imprisonment for up to three years. The effective date for this penalty is 30 days after the enactment of the Act."
