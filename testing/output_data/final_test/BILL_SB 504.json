    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1203.45 of the Penal Code is amended. In cases where a person was under 18 years old when committing a misdemeanor and is eligible for relief under Section 1203.4 or 1203.4a, they can petition the court to seal their record. The court may grant this relief if the person meets the criteria, and the conviction will be deemed not to have occurred. If a misdemeanor conviction is sealed under Section 1203.4 or 1203.4a, any arrest or proceeding related to it will be deemed not to have occurred. This section applies to convictions before or after the effective date, excluding offenses requiring registration under Section 290, violations of Health and Safety Code, or certain misdemeanor violations of the Vehicle Code. It does not apply to multiple convictions unless one offense includes the others or the convictions were for specific offenses. The section applies to misdemeanor violations of the Vehicle Code, local ordinances related to motor vehicles, and offenses committed by individuals under 21 before March 7, 1973. In defamation cases, court may order sealed records to be opened and admitted as evidence upon good cause shown. The records are confidential and accessible only to authorized individuals. After the judgment becomes final, the court will seal the records. A person 26 years or older petitioning to seal a record may need to reimburse the court, county, and city for costs incurred, not exceeding $150. Ability to pay will be assessed by the court. The court may order reimbursement for costs incurred, not exceeding $150, based on ability to pay without undue hardship. Section 781 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read: 781. In cases involving juvenile court proceedings, a person or probation officer may petition the court to seal records five years after court jurisdiction ends or after the person turns 18. The court may seal records of arrest in the custody of the juvenile court and other agencies if the person has not been convicted of certain crimes and has shown rehabilitation. The district attorney and probation officer can testify at the hearing on the petition. The court can seal records of arrest in the custody of the juvenile court and other agencies if the person has not been convicted of certain crimes and has shown rehabilitation. Once the court orders the person's records sealed, the proceedings in the case are deemed never to have occurred, allowing the person to respond accordingly to any inquiries about the events. The court orders agencies to seal records and notify the court of compliance. Juvenile records can be sealed, relieving the person from registration requirements and destroying registration information. The court cannot seal records for individuals found guilty of certain offenses at age 14 or older. Unfulfilled restitution orders converted to civil judgments do not prevent record sealing. Outstanding fines and fees do not hinder record sealing based on rehabilitation. The court may seal records upon petition, allowing inspection by named persons. In defamation cases, sealed records can be opened with court approval. Records are confidential and accessible to the court, jury, parties, and authorized individuals. After final judgment, the court orders the records sealed. The court may seal records of convictions under the Vehicle Code or local ordinances, which would otherwise be public records. If a court seals a case record with a conviction, it must notify the Department of Motor Vehicles. The Department of Motor Vehicles allows access to conviction records only to the subject and insurers with requestor code numbers. Insurers must be notified if a sealed record is disclosed and can only use the information for insurance purposes. Other agencies can still seal records not held by the DMV. This subdivision does not impact the Department of Motor Vehicles' procedures or authority to purge department records. The court shall order the destruction of sealed juvenile court records after five years for Section 601 cases or when the person reaches 38 years old for Section 602 cases, except for serious offenses committed at age 14 or older. Other agencies may destroy sealed records after five years. The court may access sealed files to verify jurisdictional status for a ward petitioning for court jurisdiction. Sealing records does not apply to offenses convicted in criminal court. Minors must still fulfill restitution orders even if records are sealed. After sealing records, victim restitution orders and fines can still be enforced. The court can access sealed records for civil judgment enforcement. Information on record sealing eligibility must be provided to individuals facing juvenile court adjudication or probation. The Judicial Council will develop materials and a form for sealing and destroying records by January 1, 2015. Individuals over 26 years old are responsible for costs related to sealing juvenile court or arrest records. In cases where a petition is filed to seal a record, individuals aged 26 or older may need to reimburse the county and court for services rendered, up to $150, based on their ability to pay determined by the court. This reimbursement is not a requirement for eligibility under this section. If a petition to declare a minor a dependent child is dismissed before the jurisdictional hearing, a person is not liable for costs. Any court determination under this section must follow Judicial Council procedures. The Commission on State Mandates will provide reimbursement for mandated costs to local agencies and school districts."
