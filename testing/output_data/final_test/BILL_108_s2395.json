The Congress finds that Theodore Roosevelt, born on October 27, 1858, in New York City, had a distinguished career including serving as a representative in the New York State Assembly, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department, Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Colonel of the Rough Riders during the Spanish-American War, and Governor of New York. Theodore Roosevelt, Governor of New York, became the 25th Vice-President in 1900 and the 26th President in 1901. He played a significant role in foreign affairs, making the US a world power and implementing reforms on labor, monopolies, and conservation.

During his presidency, Theodore Roosevelt placed nearly 230 million acres of land under public protection, including bird reserves, game preserves, national forests, national parks, and national monuments. He was posthumously awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for his bravery in the Spanish-American War, becoming the first President to receive this honor.
