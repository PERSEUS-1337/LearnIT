The Act of 1999, titled the \"Missouri River Valley Improvement Act,\" highlights findings such as Lewis and Clark's discoveries, the importance of the 2,321-mile long Missouri River, the impact of human interventions on the river's ecosystem, and the efforts of river organizations for habitat restoration. The Act of 1999, known as the \"Missouri River Valley Improvement Act,\" aims to protect, restore, and enhance the fish, wildlife, and plants of the Missouri River, as well as revitalize historic riverfronts and natural places to benefit native river fish and wildlife, reduce flood losses, and enhance recreation and tourism by the year 2004. The Missouri River Valley Improvement Act aims to revitalize historic riverfronts, monitor the health of the Missouri River, restore fish and wildlife habitat, protect cottonwoods along the river, and educate the public about the river's importance. The Missouri River Valley Improvement Act defines the Missouri River as extending from its mouth to the confluence of the Jefferson, Madison, and Gallatin Rivers in Montana. It authorizes actions to protect, enhance, and restore fish and wildlife habitat. Section 9(b) of the Flood Control Act of 1944 is amended to include a comprehensive plan for fish and wildlife habitat protection on the Missouri River. Additionally, there is a provision for the acquisition of land for the National Wildlife Refuge System. The Secretary of the Interior will study the Missouri River for land acquisition for the National Wildlife Refuge System. Any new refuge land will be acquired from willing sellers using existing procedures. Additionally, there is a Missouri River Mitigation Project. The Missouri River Mitigation Project aims to acquire and restore lost habitat in the Missouri River floodplain in Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, and Missouri. The Secretary of the Army, in consultation with relevant agencies, will submit a report to Congress outlining the feasibility and costs of restoring up to 25% of lost habitat. The Secretary of the Army, in collaboration with the US Fish and Wildlife Service, will conduct a study on the adverse effects of the Missouri River Mainstem Reservoir Project on aquatic and riparian-dependent wildlife in four states. Recommendations for mitigation measures will be provided within 2 years. The Secretary of the Army will submit a report to Congress within 2 years on the results of a study on the Missouri River Mainstem Reservoir Project's impact on wildlife. A pilot mitigation program will be developed, involving warm water releases from Fort Peck Dam to preserve native fish and wildlife habitat without adversely affecting reservoir use. The Secretary of the Army will conduct a study on fish loss through Garrison Dam and Oahe Dam, with recommendations to reduce it. A report will be submitted to Congress within 2 years. Authorization of Appropriations: $200,000 for completing the required study and $1,000,000 annually from 2000 to 2010 for implementing other provisions of the section. SEC. 8. MISSOURI RIVER CHANNEL ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM. The Secretary of the Army, in consultation with the Director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service, will modify navigation and bank stabilization structures on the Missouri River to protect native wildlife and support ecosystem restoration. This project includes modifications on publicly owned property to benefit native fish and wildlife. Operation and maintenance of the project activities will be a federal responsibility. Authorization of appropriations is provided for this purpose. Authorization of $5,000,000 annually for fiscal years 2000 through 2010 is provided to the Secretary of the Army for modifications on the Missouri River to protect native wildlife and ecosystem restoration. SEC. 9. RIVERFRONT REVITALIZATION.

The Secretary will not provide funds for the operation and maintenance of projects under this paragraph. SEC. 10. COTTONWOOD PROTECTION STUDY. The Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Secretary of the Army, will conduct a study to protect and replenish cottonwoods along the Missouri River in Montana. The study will evaluate cottonwood reproduction, wildlife, flood losses, water supply needs, recreation, and dam operations. A report on the study results is due to Congress by July 31, 2001. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress on the study results. $5,000,000 is authorized for the Secretary to carry out this section. SEC. 11. LONG-TERM MONITORING PROGRAM. Establishment of a program at the River Studies Center in Columbia, Missouri to monitor the Missouri River's characteristics in accordance with the Department of the Interior Appropriations Act. The program will assess biota, habitats, and water quality with input from Governors of affected States and the Secretary of Agriculture. The program established at the River Studies Center in Columbia, Missouri will provide scientific information to guide the operation and management of the Missouri River, including dams, and measure the impact of management alternatives through monitoring biota, habitats, and water quality. The program will involve the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of Energy, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Missouri River Basin Tribes. The program at the River Studies Center in Columbia, Missouri will establish a baseline for future activities on the Missouri River. The Secretary will create a database on river biota, habitats, and water quality, and make it accessible to the public. A report on the environmental health of the Missouri River will be submitted to Congress every 3 years. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations for the Missouri River program includes $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, $7,000,000 for fiscal year 2001, and $13,600,000 annually from 2002 to 2014.
