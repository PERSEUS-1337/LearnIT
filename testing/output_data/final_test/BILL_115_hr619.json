    "content": "FIRE-RETARDANT MATERIALS EXEMPTION. Section 3503 of title 46, United States Code, is amended to require passenger vessels with accommodations for at least 50 passengers to be constructed of fire-retardant materials and meet specific safety regulations for engines, boilers, electrical systems, and egress points. Before December 1, 2028, vessels exempt from fire-retardant standards must notify passengers and crew of non-compliance due to wooden construction in berthing areas. Display of this information throughout the vessel is required. The owner or managing operator of a vessel must comply with safety regulations, maintain liability insurance, and make annual structural alterations. Penalties apply for violations of these regulations. The owner or managing operator of a vessel must make annual structural alterations to reduce combustible fire-load by 10 percent in non-fire retardant areas, with priority given to key engineering areas. Advance notice to the Coast Guard is required for these alterations. The Coast Guard considers preserving historic integrity of vessels, owners must notify ports of noncompliance with fire safety standards due to wooden construction, crews must receive specialized training. The Coast Guard requires specialized training for shipboard firefighting on exempted vessels, with annual audits conducted by the Secretary. Regulations will be prescribed for passenger notification, and noncompliant vessels may have their inspection certificates withdrawn. The Coast Guard may withdraw inspection certificates for passenger vessels that do not comply with regulations."
