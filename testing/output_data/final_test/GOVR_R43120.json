He expressed willingness to work with Congress on a bipartisan scheme but also stated that the actions announced would not require congressional approval. This followed his vow in the 2013 State of the Union Address to pursue a market-based solution to climate change if Congress did not act. President Obama announced a national plan on June 25, 2013, to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, and to encourage adaptation to climate change. The President faced pressure from environmental allies to take action on climate change after Congress failed to pass comprehensive bills. Some states and organizations threatened to sue if the EPA did not finalize greenhouse gas emission standards for new power plants by April 2013. Members of Congress remain divided on the economic costs and benefits of addressing climate change. The President's commitment to reducing U.S. GHG emissions by 17% below 2005 levels by 2020 is driven by concerns for future generations, global benefits, and Earth system stability. Despite congressional divisions, executive branch authorities are being utilized. In 2012, U.S. GHG emissions were 10% below 2005 levels, with a peak in 2007. Economic activity increased by 73% from 1990 to 2012, while population rose by 26%. U.S. energy-related CO2 emissions are projected to grow by 3.5% from 2012 to 2020. The United States is projected to reduce all greenhouse gas emissions to 16% below 2005 levels by 2020, with transportation sector emissions falling by 2%, industry CO2 emissions growing by 14%, and electricity sector emissions rising by almost 4%. President Obama has identified actions to abate GHG emissions and enhance resilience to climate change. Obama outlined actions to reduce GHG emissions and build resilience to climate change in three main categories: cutting carbon pollution, preparing for climate impacts, and leading global efforts. The plan includes new measures announced in June 2013, with a focus on EPA regulations to limit carbon emissions from power plants. The Presidential Memorandum instructs the EPA to issue a proposal under the Clean Air Act for GHG emissions from new power plants, setting emissions limits for coal and natural gas-fired units. The proposal includes standards for carbon capture and sequestration technology. The Presidential Memorandum directs the EPA to issue guidelines for CO2 emissions from existing power plants by June 1, 2015. States must submit implementation plans by June 30, 2016, with a focus on reducing costs and maintaining reliable power. EPA will engage states and leaders in the process and allow for market-based instruments and performance standards. The President directed EPA to work with states, industry, and other stakeholders to promote cleaner and more efficient technologies for electricity generation. This includes using market-based elements and state-specific guidelines for existing power plants to allow flexible compliance options. EPA standards should provide flexibility to different states. The EPA standards aim to provide flexibility to states and regulated entities, building on existing leadership. Stakeholders are commenting on the stringency of guidelines, base year for reductions, and costs and benefits. The President's goal is to double electricity generation from wind, solar, and geothermal energy by 2020, with significant increases already seen from 2009 to 2011. The President aims to double renewable electricity generation by 2020 through various initiatives, including issuing permits for 10 GW of renewable capacity on public lands, expanding hydropower generation, deploying 3 GW on military installations, installing 100 MW for federally subsidized housing, and streamlining electricity transmission project reviews. The State Department is facing a decision on the Keystone XL pipeline. The State Department is considering granting a Presidential Permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, which would transport oil sands crude from Canada to Gulf Coast refineries. Environmental groups are urging the President to deny the permit due to concerns about carbon pollution. The President emphasized the importance of the project not exacerbating climate impacts in a speech. EPA recommended including monetized estimates of GHG emissions in the final Environmental Impact Statement for the permit application. The final Environmental Impact Statement for the Keystone XL pipeline project may include monetized estimates of GHG emissions from oil sands crude. The President proposed phasing out tax incentives for fossil fuels and increasing funding for clean energy technology development in his FY2014 budget. The Department of Energy (DOE) plans to issue a draft solicitation for up to $8 billion in loan guarantees for advanced fossil fuel energy projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A Federal Quadrennial Energy Review will assess energy infrastructure challenges and propose investments over four-year planning horizons. The Department of Energy plans to issue a draft solicitation for up to $8 billion in loan guarantees for advanced fossil fuel energy projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Federal Quadrennial Energy Review will propose investments over four-year planning horizons, including increasing fuel economy standards for heavy-duty vehicles post-2018 and developing next-generation energy sources for transportation. This includes research on advanced biofuels, batteries, and fuel cells in all modes of transportation. The Department of Energy plans to issue loan guarantees for advanced fossil fuel energy projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The President set a goal for efficiency standards to reduce carbon emissions by 3 billion metric tons by 2030. The USDA's Rural Utilities Service Energy Efficiency and Conservation Loan Program would provide funding for rural electric utilities to finance energy efficiency investments. The government plans to provide loan guarantees for efficiency and renewable energy investments by agricultural producers and rural small businesses. HUD's Multifamily Energy Innovation Fund will continue to support residential energy efficiency with $23 million. The Federal Housing Administration will explore incentives for energy efficiency in mortgage underwriting and appraisal. The DOE's Better Buildings Challenge will expand to include multifamily housing. EPA will work to phase down Hydrofluorocarbon emissions. The EPA will use its authority to identify and approve climate-friendly chemicals as alternatives to HFCs and prohibit certain uses of harmful chemicals. The Administration will purchase safer alternatives and transition over time. Multiple agencies will collaborate to develop an Interagency Methane Strategy to reduce methane emissions, assess technologies, and identify incentives. EPA will assess emissions from the oil and gas sector to pursue further methane reduction efforts. The EPA will propose updated standards on methane emissions from new landfills and consider updating standards for existing landfills. The Department of the Interior will propose updated standards on venting and flaring of methane from oil and gas production on public lands. Additionally, a joint biogas roadmap will be developed to accelerate the adoption of methane digesters to reduce emissions from cattle waste by 25% by 2020. In response to climate change, conservation and land management efforts will focus on protecting and restoring forests, grasslands, wetlands, and other resources to help remove carbon from the atmosphere. Agencies will continue to implement Executive Order 13514 by promoting energy savings, enhancing energy efficiency, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. President Obama signed E.O. 13514 on October 5, 2009, calling for federal agencies to actively participate in developing environmental, energy, and economic performance approaches. The Executive Order called for federal agencies to develop climate change adaptation strategies and report progress to the President. Agencies were instructed to include adaptation plans in their 2012 Strategic Sustainability Performance Plans. The first adaptation plans were released in February 2013 for public comment. The Climate Action Plan in June 2013 called for additional actions by agencies. The plan includes directing agencies to identify and remove barriers to climate-resilient investments, support resilient investments through grants and technical assistance, integrate climate risk management into federal planning, and establish a task force for climate preparedness recommendations. The Task Force is working to support communities in becoming more resilient to climate change by providing targeted assistance through federal programs. Recommendations are expected to be delivered to the President in November 2014, including boosting resilience of buildings and infrastructure and enhancing resilience in rebuilding efforts following disasters like Hurricane Sandy. Enhancing resilience in rebuilding post-Hurricane Sandy through federal relief programs, including financial assistance from various agencies like the Federal Transit Administration, DOI, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Specific actions are being taken in sectors such as energy production, healthcare, insurance, and land and water resource conservation. Launching a new National Drought Resilience Partnership and expanding forest- and rangeland-restoration efforts are among the initiatives to reduce vulnerability to disasters. The government is focusing on forest and rangeland restoration to reduce vulnerability to catastrophic fires. They are also working on global change research and completing the National Climate Assessment, set to be released in spring 2014. Additionally, a Climate Data Initiative has been launched to make government data more accessible, along with a Toolkit for Climate Resilience. Executive Order 13653 was issued to enhance climate preparedness and resilience through intergovernmental partnerships and risk-informed decision making. The executive order establishes a Council on Climate Preparedness and Resilience to replace the Inter-Agency Climate Change Task Force. It also establishes a State, Local, and Tribal Leaders Task Force on Climate Preparedness and Resilience to support intergovernmental partnerships. The Task Force shall provide recommendations to the Council by November 1, 2014, and shall terminate no later than six months after submitting its recommendations. E.O. 13653 builds on previous executive orders and policies requiring agencies to develop climate change action plans and timelines. The executive order increases reporting on agencies meeting requirements for natural resource management resilience to climate change. It calls for a web-based portal on \"data.gov\" for better access to climate-related data and tools. The United States agreed to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations to prevent dangerous interference with the climate system. The United States signed the 1997 Kyoto Protocol but never ratified it due to strong opposition in Congress. There are no legally binding obligations to reduce GHG emissions under the UNFCCC, but negotiations are ongoing for a global agreement by 2020. President Obama pledged to reduce U.S. GHG emissions by 17% compared to 2005 levels, but without rules to reduce power plant emissions, this goal may not be met, impacting U.S. leadership in climate change efforts. The President's Climate Action Plan includes efforts to end U.S. support for public financing of new coal-fired power plants overseas, exempting efficient coal technology in poor countries. Bilateral and multilateral programs focus on promoting energy efficiency and clean energy partnerships with major economies like China, India, and Brazil. The President's Climate Action Plan includes agreements with major economies like China, India, and Brazil to phase down hydrofluorocarbons globally and eliminate fossil fuel subsidies. President Obama proposes eliminating U.S. tax provisions benefiting fossil fuel supply. He also suggests negotiating a global free trade agreement on environmental goods and services under the World Trade Organization. The President's Climate Action Plan includes negotiating a global free trade agreement on environmental goods and services at the WTO. This plan aims to eliminate tariffs on environmental goods with major trading countries and includes environmental services in trade agreements. Additionally, the plan supports initiatives to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation globally, as well as cooperation to reduce \"super-pollutants.\" The Climate and Clean Air Coalition was formed in 2012 to reduce short-lived climate pollutants like methane and black carbon. The Obama Administration pledged $30 billion in financing from 2010-2012 to help developing countries mitigate GHG emissions. The President's plan for 2020 financing is outlined in general terms. The President's plan for 2020 financing envisions actions that do not require further authority from Congress, but some may rely on appropriations of funds. Questions have been raised about the cumulative impacts of existing measures and the distributional impacts of the plan. Some in Congress oppose regulation of GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act, and there are proposals to limit executive authority in this area. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to overturn finalized rules with expedited procedures, requiring a presidential signature or a two-thirds vote to overcome a veto. The Administration released updated estimates for the \"social costs of carbon\" (SCC) in May 2013, used to compare benefits and costs of climate change mitigation. The SCC estimates are used to compare benefits and costs of regulations, with some concerns raised about their accuracy and potential impact on future actions. Congress may consider the development process of SCC values and their implications on regulatory choices. Some lawmakers may seek alternative approaches to EPA regulation of GHG emissions and Obama administration measures. Some policy makers propose fees on GHG emissions as an alternative to Obama administration measures. The Keystone XL pipeline requires a Presidential Permit, with supporters and environmentalists divided on its approval. Congress may need to assess the project's impact on national interest. Additional CRS reports are available on President Obama's climate change policies. President Obama's climate change policies are detailed in various CRS reports, including EPA standards for greenhouse gas emissions, legal issues, federal agency actions, and renewable energy.
