    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Comprehensive National Mercury Monitoring Act\". Congress finds that mercury is a potent neurotoxin with significant ecological and public health concerns. Over 410,000 children born in the US each year are exposed to levels of mercury that can impair neurological development. 6% of women of childbearing age have unsafe blood mercury levels. Exposure to mercury mainly comes from contaminated fish, which are important for dietary protein and the US economy. Fish and shellfish are nutritious, low in saturated fat, and rich in omega-3 fatty acids. A balanced diet including these foods promotes heart health and proper growth in children. A national mercury monitoring network is crucial for tracking the status of this important resource. Mercury enters aquatic ecosystems primarily through atmospheric emissions, posing challenges for predicting its concentrations in fish. Federal and State governments are taking steps to address these issues. Regulations to curb mercury emissions by the Federal Government and State governments should be evaluated by a nationwide monitoring network to determine their effectiveness. The nationwide monitoring network should evaluate regulations to curb mercury emissions by the Federal Government and State governments. The Administrator will establish a national-scale mercury monitoring program to track trends in atmospheric mercury concentrations, deposition, and mercury levels in watersheds, surface waters, and fish and wildlife in various ecosystems. Monitoring sites will be determined in coordination with the Mercury Monitoring Advisory Committee within one year of the Act's enactment. The Administrator, with input from Federal agency heads, will choose multiple monitoring sites across different ecoregions in the US for the mercury monitoring program. These sites will include national parks, wildlife refuges, estuarine reserves, and sensitive ecological areas impacted by reductions in domestic mercury emissions. Monitoring sites may be located alongside other long-term environmental monitoring programs. The Administrator will establish standardized measurement protocols for the mercury monitoring program, in coordination with the Mercury Monitoring Advisory Committee. Data collection and distribution protocols will be established within one year of the enactment of the Act. The Administrator will establish a centralized database for environmental mercury data, in coordination with the Mercury Monitoring Advisory Committee. The mercury monitoring program will monitor long-term changes in mercury levels in air and watersheds, including measuring wet and estimating dry mercury deposition, mercury flux, and mercury export, as well as reemitted mercury levels from aquatic and terrestrial environments into the atmosphere. The mercury monitoring program will track long-term changes in mercury and methylmercury levels in water and soil at selected sites. This includes analyzing sediment cores, measuring mercury concentrations in sediments and surface water, and understanding the cycling of mercury through the ecosystem. The mercury monitoring program will measure total mercury and methylmercury concentrations in aquatic and terrestrial organisms at selected sites, including zooplankton, invertebrates, yearling fish, and commercially relevant fish. The mercury monitoring program includes measuring total mercury concentrations in selected insect- and fish-eating birds and mammals. SEC. 4. ADVISORY COMMITTEE. The Mercury Monitoring Advisory Committee is established to advise on the national mercury monitoring program. It consists of scientists appointed by various federal agencies. The Mercury Monitoring Advisory Committee includes scientists appointed by the National Park Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. SEC. 5. REPORTS.\n\nThe Administrator must provide Congress with a report on the mercury monitoring program every 2 years, including trend data. Every 4 years, the report must assess the reduction in mercury deposition rates needed to prevent adverse effects on humans and the environment.\n\nSEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\nAppropriations for this Act are authorized as follows: $37,000,000 for fiscal year 2013, $29,000,000 for fiscal year 2014, and $29,000,000 for fiscal year 2015.\n\nSEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"Administrator\" refers to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. The term \"applicable Federal agency\" may include various federal agencies determined relevant by the Administrator. An \"ecoregion\" is a large area of land and water with distinct natural communities. \"Mercury export\" is the flux of mercury from a watershed to a water body. Mercury flux refers to the transfer rate of mercury between ecosystem components, expressed as mass per unit time. The Mercury Monitoring Advisory Committee is established under section 4. Surface sediment is sediment in the uppermost 2 centimeters of a lakebed or riverbed."
