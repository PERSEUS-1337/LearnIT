    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Social Security Reporting Improvements Act of 2000\". The Social Security Advisory Board, Panel, and Chief Actuary are commended for their work on projecting the future financial operations of the social security program. The Panel recommended changes in 1999 that would increase estimates of the program's unfunded obligations. The Panel recommended using standards of comparison for program sustainability and evaluating reform proposals based on their impact on the Federal budget and funding shortfalls. Other recommendations included workforce participation, poverty rates among the elderly, and equity investment returns. Adoption of these recommendations would assist in improving the social security program. Adoption of the Panel's recommendations would assist in developing a fiscally responsible reform solution that avoids passing hidden costs to future taxpayers. SEC. 3. ANNUAL REPORT FROM THE COMMISSIONER OF SOCIAL SECURITY. Amends Section 704 of the Social Security Act to include a new subsection for an Annual Report to Congress. The Commissioner, along with other key officials, must submit an annual report to Congress detailing projections and financing shortfalls of the old-age, survivors, and disability insurance program. The Board of Trustees projects that tax revenues from the program will be insufficient to cover program outlays. The report should include benefit levels, tax rates, effects on national savings, and estimates of benefits for different demographics. The amendment applies to reports for calendar years after the enactment of the Act, detailing benefit levels, tax rates, and estimates for different demographics. The Sense of Congress regarding Social Security reform legislation is outlined in Section 4. Congress and the President should enact bipartisan social security reform that ensures 75-year actuarial solvency and addresses sustainability, fiscal impact, reduction of unfunded obligations, solvency under different assumptions, and retirement income levels. The proposed reform aims to address benefit reductions or tax increases required for the social security program, based on estimates from the Board of Trustees. It also considers the long-term impact on workforce participation, poverty among the elderly, national savings levels, and other identified issues. Congress believes that the recommendations of the Panel should be implemented as deemed reasonable by the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, in consultation with relevant agencies and offices."
