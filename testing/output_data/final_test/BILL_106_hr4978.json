The Airline Competition Preservation Act of 2000, also known as the Airline Competition Preservation Act, focuses on oversight of air carrier pricing through an amendment to Chapter 415 of title 49, United States Code. This includes a provision for immediate effect upon the Secretary of Transportation's determination that 3 or fewer air carriers control 70% or more of scheduled revenue passenger miles in interstate air transportation due to consolidation or merger. The Airline Competition Preservation Act of 2000 allows the Secretary of Transportation to monitor air carrier pricing and intervene if 3 or fewer carriers control 70% or more of scheduled revenue passenger miles in interstate air transportation. This includes oversight of ownership changes and the use of data to determine concentration levels. The Airline Competition Preservation Act of 2000 gives the Secretary of Transportation authority to investigate high fares charged by air carriers for interstate air transportation routes. Factors considered include fare comparisons with other routes and fare increases. The Airline Competition Preservation Act of 2000 authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to investigate high fares charged by air carriers for interstate air transportation routes. Factors considered include fare comparisons, fare increases, and ensuring a fair balance of costs between price-sensitive and time-sensitive passengers. If unreasonable fares are found, the Secretary may order the carrier to reduce the fare after a hearing. The Airline Competition Preservation Act of 2000 allows the Secretary of Transportation to investigate high fares on interstate air routes. The Secretary can order carriers to reduce fares, offer discounts on specific seats, and provide rebates to affected individuals. Orders issued by the Secretary remain in effect for a determined period. Additionally, the Act addresses actions of dominant air carriers in response to new entrants offering lower fares on specific routes. The Airline Competition Preservation Act of 2000 empowers the Secretary of Transportation to investigate and address high fares on interstate air routes. The Act also ensures that dominant air carriers must continue to offer lower fares when a new entrant increases passenger capacity on a specific route. Additionally, the Secretary can intervene to promote competition at hub airports. The Secretary can investigate if a dominant air carrier at a hub airport is charging higher than average fares on 20% or more of its routes in interstate air transportation. This is determined if the carrier's average fare is at least 5% higher than the average fare of all air carriers on comparable routes, after adjustments for specific costs. The Secretary can order a dominant air carrier at a hub airport to take actions to increase competition if they are charging higher than average fares. This can include making airport facilities available to other carriers, adjusting commissions paid to travel agents, and modifying frequent flyer programs. In this section, definitions for \"dominant air carrier\", \"hub airport\", and \"interstate air transportation\" are provided. A dominant air carrier is one that accounts for over 50% of total annual boardings at a hub airport, while a hub airport has at least 0.25% of total annual boardings in the US. Interstate air transportation includes intrastate air transportation. The term 'new entrant air carrier' refers to an air carrier that represents less than 5% of total annual boardings at a hub airport in the previous 2-year period. Oversight of air carrier pricing."
