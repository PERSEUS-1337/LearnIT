The Act, titled \"Offshore Wind Energy Research, Development, Demonstration, and Commercial Application Act of 2009,\" defines key terms such as \"institution of higher education,\" \"national offshore wind center,\" \"program,\" and \"Secretary.\" SEC. 3. OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. The Secretary will implement a program to enhance offshore wind turbine efficiency, reliability, and capacity, while reducing costs. This includes developing advanced turbine components for various water depths and conducting full-scale testing. The program aims to enhance offshore wind turbine efficiency, reliability, and capacity by conducting full-scale testing of components, establishing regional demonstrations, assessing offshore wind resources, designing integrated sensors and advanced materials, and advancing blade manufacturing activities. The program aims to enhance offshore wind turbine efficiency, reliability, and capacity through full-scale testing of components, regional demonstrations, assessing offshore wind resources, designing sensors and materials, and advancing blade manufacturing. Research areas include stimulating blade manufacturing capacity, assessing and mitigating wind energy system effects on marine ecosystems and industries, and other relevant topics determined by the Secretary. The National Offshore Wind Energy Research, Development, and Demonstration Centers are established to enhance offshore wind turbine efficiency, reliability, and capacity through testing, demonstrations, resource assessment, sensor design, and blade manufacturing advancements. The Secretary will award grants to institutions of higher education to establish national offshore wind centers based on technical merit. Preference will be given to institutions that cover transitional depth technologies, host offshore wind energy research programs, and employ experts in novel materials development for commercial applications. A national offshore wind center established with funds provided by the Secretary through a grant shall focus on deepwater floating offshore wind energy technologies and facilitate initiatives to advance activities in the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, or Pacific Ocean. Authorization of $50,000,000 annually from 2011 to 2021 for the Secretary to implement the Act."
