    "content": "Federal government programs can be funded with discretionary and mandatory spending. Discretionary spending is controlled through annual appropriations acts and includes operations of executive branch agencies. Mandatory spending is controlled by laws and includes entitlement programs like Social Security. Congress sets eligibility requirements and benefit formulas for mandatory programs, with outlays made automatically if requirements are met. Mandatory programs can be seen as multiyear appropriations in authorizing legislation. In agriculture, mandatory spending programs have payment formulas. Mandatory spending programs in agriculture have payment formulas, funding levels, and acreage allotments authorized by law. The 2008 farm bill authorizes spending on various agricultural, conservation, nutrition, and bioenergy programs, viewed as a contract by many in the agricultural community. The 2008 farm bill authorizes spending on agricultural programs, with funding from the Commodity Credit Corporation and other sources. Farmers and bankers view it as a contract and do not want it reopened before it expires. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) provides program payments to farmers from the USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA) and conservation payments from the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and FSA. It also funds USDA programs for foreign trade, bioenergy, rural development, agricultural research, and other programs. The CCC has a large pool of mandatory funding, with a 10-year projection of $86 billion for farm commodity programs, $55 billion for conservation, and smaller amounts for trade, bioenergy, horticulture/organic agriculture, research, and rural development. The CCC is a government corporation with the authority to borrow up to $30 billion from the U.S. Treasury. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) operates like a revolving line of credit, borrowing up to $30 billion from the U.S. Treasury to make program payments separate from appropriations. It repays the Treasury with funds from the annual Agriculture appropriations law, restoring its borrowing authority. Historically, mandatory agricultural funding was reserved for farm commodity programs tied to commodity prices. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) was created to remove unpredictable funding issues from the annual appropriations process by tying program payments to commodity prices. The concept of funding agricultural programs with mandatory spending has expanded to include conservation, rural development, research, and bioenergy programs, generating both concern and support. Appropriations bills have recently reduced mandatory program spending below authorized levels. The Congressional Budget Office estimates reductions in mandatory program spending, known as CHIMPS, to offset increases in discretionary spending above budget caps. Authorizing committees also reduce mandatory spending levels for various reasons, including offsetting spending increases for other programs and achieving budget reconciliation savings required by Congress. Congress holds the power of the purse over appropriations. The power of the purse is granted to Congress, with a division of labor between authorizations and appropriations. Legislative committees authorize legislation, while appropriations committees handle annual appropriations. Multiyear appropriations for mandatory programs can bypass the two-step process. There is tension over which committee brings final budget recommendations. The tension between appropriators and authorizers over budget recommendations for agricultural programs dates back to the 1930s. Farm commodity subsidies are difficult to budget due to market fluctuations, leading to the creation of the Commodity Credit Corporation for mandatory funding. In the late 1990s and 2002 farm bill, authorizers began using mandatory funds for discretionary programs, changing the dynamic. The tension between appropriators and authorizers over budget recommendations for agricultural programs dates back to the 1930s. In the late 1990s and 2002 farm bill, authorizers began using mandatory funds for discretionary programs, creating a complicated process for establishing budget authority. Questions have been raised about whether authorizers or appropriators should have final funding decisions for these programs. The tension between appropriators and authorizers over budget recommendations for agricultural programs dates back to the 1930s. In recent years, appropriators have not always funded the Agriculture Committees' priorities as desired, leading authorizers to justify using mandatory funding at their discretion. This allows for goals to be met with a smaller discretionary spending allocation, potentially through the use of CHIMPS in appropriations bills. Congress makes final funding decisions for programs through laws and appropriations, with tension among committees, interest groups, and parties. The production agriculture community generally accepts reductions in mandatory programs, but opposes increases for nonagricultural programs. Environmental and conservation supporters are more vocal about reductions in funding. Environmental and conservation groups are concerned about reductions in funding for conservation programs in the farm bill, arguing that cuts undermine political support and commitments made in previous bills that used mandatory funding to support various programs. Funding for mandatory programs is determined by authorizing committees, not annual appropriations. Some appropriations bills have reduced funding for newly mandatory programs, using savings to increase spending on discretionary programs. Appropriators limit mandatory spending without changing the authorizing law, affecting only the one-year appropriation. Language like \"None of the funds appropriated shall be used\" is used to put limits on mandatory programs. Table 1 lists CHIMPS in agricultural programs enacted by Congress since FY2003, totaling $7.5 billion over eight years. CHIMPS peaked in FY2006, with notable reductions in subsequent years. Conservation programs accounted for $3 billion of the total, with EQIP having the highest multiyear total of $1.2 billion. Appropriators sometimes reduce mandatory program funding in appropriations bills without changing the authorizing law. In regular appropriations bills, authorizing committees reduce mandatory program authorizations to offset new spending on agricultural purposes like disaster assistance or child nutrition. This involves changing the authorizing law directly. Since 2003, Congress has enacted reductions to mandatory programs outside of the farm bill through budget reconciliation and other required offsets. For example, the Conservation Security Program saw reductions of $3.1 billion in FY2003 and $2.9 billion in FY2005 for agricultural disaster assistance. In the 109th Congress, authorizers cut $2.7 billion of mandatory funding over five years from various conservation, rural development, and research programs to find savings for budget reconciliation. The authorizing committees have reduced funding for conservation, rural development, and research programs to capture savings for reconciliation. A funding proposal aims to cut EQIP by $2.2 billion over 10 years to fund the child nutrition program. The Administration can also take actions to reduce mandatory outlays, such as negotiating with crop insurance companies to lower payments. The Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA) proposes to reduce payments to crop insurance companies, resulting in budgetary savings of $6-$8 billion over 10 years. The debate revolves around whether these cuts will be achieved administratively through the SRA or legislatively through congressional action. The baseline serves as a benchmark for future budget analyses, projecting federal spending under current law without policy changes. The impact of federal mandatory spending on budget constraints is measured as a difference from the baseline, with the Congressional Budget Office overseeing the process. Questions arise regarding how budgetary savings are calculated from reducing mandatory programs, such as the use of CHIMPS and the effect of reductions by authorizers or the Administration on funding levels. When mandatory funds are available for only one fiscal year, the savings from a reduction are straightforward. When appropriators block mandatory funding using CHIMPS, the funding remains available for future years. This can lead to an overstatement of budget savings, as successive appropriations acts can limit the same pool of funding as long as the \"no year\" funding authority remains. For example, a $50 million mandatory authorization can be blocked by CHIMPS in one year and still be available for future use. The CHIMPS program allows for blocking $50 million in funding for two years, resulting in $100 million in savings. This affects future legislation budgets, such as the farm bill, by reducing the budget baseline. This impacts the farm bill debate due to budget constraints imposed by Congress. The baseline calculation assumes current policies and economic conditions. Reductions in program funding lead to long-term savings by lowering the budget authority. For example, a $100 million annual budget for a 5-year farm bill sets the baseline at $100 million each year. If the authorization is reduced to $85 million annually, the baseline decreases by $15 million per year. The Administration can make changes to reduce mandatory outlays, affecting the baseline. For instance, the USDA is negotiating to lower payments to crop insurance companies, aiming for $6-$8 billion in savings over 10 years. Leaders in the agriculture community prefer Congress to make cuts to crop insurance rather than USDA doing so administratively. This would allow for savings to be used in other programs in the farm bill, which would not be possible if USDA makes the cuts. Budget reconciliation may also lead to reductions in crop insurance as a way to save money. In the future, reductions to crop insurance may be a primary target for meeting reconciliation targets before cutting spending on other programs. The Small Watershed Rehabilitation Program exemplifies potential double counting in CHIMPS, with mandatory funding reductions not fully replaced by discretionary funds during FY2003-FY2010. In FY2003-FY2007, funds for a program increased annually from $45 million to $65 million. Appropriators used CHIMPS to block mandatory spending, resulting in $500 million in savings over four years. This was used to offset discretionary programs in Agriculture appropriations acts. Compliance with budget reconciliation directives in FY2006 led to further adjustments. In FY2003-FY2007, funds for the Dam Rehabilitation Program increased annually from $45 million to $65 million. Appropriators used CHIMPS to block mandatory spending, resulting in $500 million in savings over four years. The 2008 farm bill authorized an additional $100 million in FY2009. Appropriators were credited with $460 million in savings from $165 million in mandatory funds over FY2007-FY2010. The Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry marked up the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, which would reauthorize USDA child nutrition programs and increase funding by $4.5 billion over 10 years. To offset new spending, a proposed reduction to the Environmental Quality Incentives Program was included, yielding an estimated $2.2 billion in savings over 10 years. Much concern during the markup revolved around this proposed reduction. The Agriculture Committee markup of the child nutrition bill focused on the proposed reduction of EQIP funding to offset increases for child nutrition. Supporters argue for the reduction to allow for reallocating funds, while others warn of potential cuts to EQIP in the future. Senator Chambliss proposed an amendment to reduce authorized acres under EQIP. Senator Chambliss proposed reducing authorized acres under the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) instead of EQIP at the committee markup on March 24, 2010. The amendment had bipartisan support but failed by one vote. Opponents argued that cutting CSP could impact future farm bill baselines more than reducing EQIP. Further debate on offset alternatives is expected as the bill moves to the floor. CSP was created in the 2002 farm bill without a maximum enrollment limit or cap on funding. In FY2003, a limitation was placed on CSP enrollment, resulting in a $3.1 billion reduction in estimated outlays over 10 years. The FY2004 appropriations bill restored CSP's full funding by eliminating the cap. The FY2004-FY2007 annual appropriations for CSP were affected by various budgetary actions, including a restoration of full funding in FY2004, a cap on funding in FY2005 resulting in a $649 million reduction, and additional disaster assistance offsetting $2.9 billion in FY2005. The Conservation Security Program faced funding reductions from FY2004 to FY2007, leading to its termination in the 2008 farm bill. It was replaced by the Conservation Stewardship Program, which has not seen funding reductions so far. There is ongoing tension between agriculture appropriations and authorizing committees regarding spending recommendations for mandatory agricultural programs. Congress makes the final decision on these programs. Authorizers and appropriators disagree on funding decisions for new programs, with authorizers preferring consistent funding while appropriators want discretionary control. CHIMPS and budget reductions can complicate funding streams, potentially reducing discretionary allocations for appropriations subcommittees. The allocation of funds to subcommittees using CHIMPS can impact other subcommittees' allocations. Reductions in mandatory programs by authorizing committees can affect future farm bill baselines, leading to potential conflicts between the Administration and Congress over budget and policy implementation. Preserving the existing baseline is crucial to maximize resources for writing a new farm bill amidst budget deficits and the possibility of budget reconciliation."
