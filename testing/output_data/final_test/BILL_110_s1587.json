    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Recycling Investment Saves Energy\" or the \"RISE Act\". The Senate acknowledges the significant impact of recycling in the United States, with over 56,000 establishments employing more than 1,100,000 people and generating billions in revenue. Recycling scrap materials also contribute to billions in exports. Additionally, recycling helps save energy by reducing the need for virgin raw materials in manufacturing. The United States recycling rate for various consumer commodities like aluminum, glass, and plastic is stagnant or declining. Businesses relying on recycled materials are struggling to obtain the quantity and quality needed, leading to manufacturing facilities closing or switching to virgin materials. Not recycling aluminum, steel cans, paper, printed materials, glass, and plastic is equivalent to the annual output of 15 medium-sized power plants. Reusing 500 steel drums per week can save enough energy to power a city the size of Colorado Springs for a year. Increased reuse and recycling have significant environmental benefits, such as cleaner air, safer water, and reduced production costs. For example, between 2 and 5 percent of the waste stream is reusable, preventing waste creation and adverse impacts from disposal. Recycling office paper prevents 60 pounds of air pollutants from being released, saves 7,000 gallons of water, and 3.3 cubic yards of landfill space. Aluminum, plastic, and glass recycling also have substantial environmental benefits. A national investment in the reuse and recycling industries is crucial to preserve and expand America's recycling infrastructure. Recycled paperboard products significantly reduce fossil fuel usage and greenhouse gas emissions, preventing tons of material from going to landfills and reducing landfill gases. Steel and aluminum recycling also save significant landfill space. SEC. 3. SPECIAL DEPRECIATION ALLOWANCE FOR CERTAIN REUSE AND RECYCLING PROPERTY. Section 168 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to include a special allowance for qualified reuse and recycling property. This allows for a 50% depreciation deduction for such property in the year it is placed in service, with the adjusted basis reduced accordingly. The special allowance for qualified reuse and recycling property allows for a 50% depreciation deduction in the year it is placed in service, with specific criteria such as a useful life of at least 5 years and acquisition after December 31, 2006. The special allowance for qualified reuse and recycling property allows for a 50% depreciation deduction in the year it is placed in service, with specific criteria such as acquisition after December 31, 2006, and exceptions for alternative depreciation property. The special rule for self-constructed property under subsection (g) allows taxpayers manufacturing their own property to meet specific requirements if production begins after December 31, 2006. The special rule for self-constructed property under subsection (g) allows taxpayers manufacturing their own property to meet specific requirements if production begins after December 31, 2006. The deduction for qualified reuse and recycling property in computing minimum tax is determined without adjustments under section 56. Reuse and recycling property refers to machinery, equipment, and software necessary for operation. The term 'qualified reuse and recyclable materials' refers to various types of scrap materials generated by individuals or businesses, excluding rolling stock or transportation equipment. The term 'electronic scrap' includes cathode ray tubes, flat panel screens, and central processing units with a screen size greater than 4 inches. Recycling refers to the process of turning worn materials into usable commodities for manufacturing consumer goods. The amendment applies to property placed in service after December 31, 2006, regarding the use of virgin materials in manufacturing consumer and commercial products, including packaging. Tax-exempt bond financing is available for recycling facilities. Tax-exempt bond financing is available for solid waste disposal facilities, which are defined as facilities used for the collection, sorting, storage, treatment, handling, or processing of solid waste to dispose of it, including converting it into energy or products. The solid waste disposal function ends at the point of final disposal, after incineration or processing to generate heat that is sold or used, or when waste is converted into a sellable material or product. The costs of a facility used for solid waste disposal and another function are determined based on facts and circumstances. If at least 65 percent of materials processed in the facility are solid waste materials, it qualifies for certain tax-exempt bond provisions. The term 'solid waste' refers to garbage, refuse, or discarded materials from various activities, regardless of their value. If a property is used for processing waste materials, all costs are allocated to solid waste disposal if the majority of materials processed are solid waste. The term 'solid waste' excludes materials in domestic sewage, pollutants in water resources, or other liquid or gaseous waste. The effective date for this amendment applies to bonds issued before, on, or after the enactment of this Act."
