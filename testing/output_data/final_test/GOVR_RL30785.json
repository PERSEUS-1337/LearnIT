    "content": "The Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) provides subsidies to assist low-income families in obtaining child care so that parents can work or participate in education or training activities. This program is authorized by the CCDBG Act, which is currently due for reauthorization. Mandatory funding for child care subsidies, authorized in Section 418 of the Social Security Act, is also due for reauthorization. These funding streams are commonly referred to as the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF). The term CCDBG specifically refers to discretionary funding, while CCDF refers to jointly administered funding. The Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) provides subsidies for low-income families to access child care, administered by the Department of Health and Human Services. The CCDF is the primary federal funding source for child care subsidies, with nearly $5.3 billion in funding in FY2014. The funding includes discretionary and mandatory funds to improve child care quality and supply for working families. Before 1996, federal child care programs were consolidated and created under the welfare reform law (P.L. 104-193). Three separate programs supported child care for low-income families associated with the cash welfare system, providing free child care for families on AFDC and transitional subsidized child care for those leaving the AFDC rolls with employment. Critics argued that the complexity of navigating these programs was unnecessary. Mothers navigating the welfare system faced unnecessary complexity that could be alleviated with a more unified child care program. AFDC Child Care, Transitional Child Care, and AFDC At-Risk were funded with mandatory money and fell under the same congressional committee jurisdiction. AFDC Child Care and Transitional Child Care were open-ended federal entitlements, while AFDC At-Risk was authorized as a \"capped entitlement\" at $300 million annually. The CCDBG Act of 1990 established the CCDBG program to support child care for low-income families. The CCDBG was created to provide child care support for low-income families not connected to the AFDC welfare system. It subsidized child care for children under 13 with working family income below 75% of state median income. Unlike AFDC programs, CCDBG was funded with discretionary funds and aimed to improve child care quality. The 1996 welfare reform law repealed AFDC and its associated child care programs. The 1996 welfare reform law (P.L. 104-193) repealed AFDC and its associated child care programs, creating a consolidated block of mandatory funding under Section 418 of the Social Security Act. This new funding was targeted towards families on or at risk of receiving welfare (TANF) and was administered through each state's lead agency managing the CCDBG, following CCDBG rules. Funding for the new mandatory child care program was authorized through FY2002. The 1996 welfare reform law reauthorized the CCDBG through FY2002 and made changes to income eligibility requirements. The child care provisions aimed to promote self-sufficiency through work and address concerns about the effectiveness of child care programs. The legislation consolidated previous child care programs with different rules into one block grant. The CCDBG Act was reauthorized through FY2002 under the 1996 welfare reform law to streamline federal programs and increase state flexibility. Despite the expiration of its authorization, CCDBG has received discretionary funding annually since FY2002. Efforts to reauthorize the program have been made by Congress, with recent bills approved in FY2014. The CCDBG Act was reauthorized through FY2002 under the 1996 welfare reform law. Recent bills in FY2014 increased mandatory child care funding by $1 billion over five years. Funding was maintained at $2.917 billion for FY2011-FY2013 through short-term extensions. A 16-day funding gap occurred at the start of FY2014. The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2014 was approved by the House and Senate, reauthorizing the CCDBG through FY2020. The House version specified appropriations levels, starting at $2.360 billion, while the Senate version authorized \"such sums as may be necessary.\" Funding had faced a 16-day gap at the start of FY2014 but has since been restored at $2.917 billion. The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2014 reauthorized CCDBG through FY2020 with specific appropriations increasing from $2.360 billion in FY2015 to $2.759 billion in FY2020. The bill amends the CCDBG Act with new requirements for state health and safety standards, monitoring visits for child care providers, background checks, professional development, quality improvement activities, continuity of care, and consumer education. HHS published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in 2013 for comprehensive updates to CCDF regulations. The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2014 reauthorized CCDBG through FY2020 with specific appropriations increasing from $2.360 billion in FY2015 to $2.759 billion in FY2020. HHS published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in 2013 for updates to CCDF regulations related to state health and safety standards, monitoring practices, consumer education, payment rates, continuity of care, state contracts, and program integrity. The public comment period ended on August 23, 2013, and HHS is required to consider all comments before publishing a final rule. A new Office of Child Care was created at ACF in October 2010 to administer the CCDF, reporting directly to the Assistant Secretary for Children and Families. This reorganization aimed to elevate child care issues within ACF and facilitate collaboration with other early childhood programs and agencies. The creation of an Office of Child Care in October 2010 aimed to strengthen the quality of child care and maximize its effectiveness in supporting employment for low-income families and promoting healthy development for children. This reorganization reflected the Obama Administration's key priority of early childhood development. The Office of Child Care was created in October 2010 to enhance child care quality and support low-income families. The reorganization aimed to promote healthy child development and employment. Federal law requires states to designate a lead agency to administer the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF), with flexibility in program design but must meet federal requirements to receive funds. The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) aims to promote parental choice, provide consumer education, offer child care for parents seeking independence, and implement health and safety standards. States have the discretion to set income eligibility limits below the federal maximum of 85% of the state median income. Funding is not guaranteed, and states can prioritize assistance based on their own eligibility thresholds. The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) requires states to prioritize families with very low income. Children under 13 living with working parents, students, or those in need of protective services are eligible for CCDF funds. States must allocate 70% of funds for child care services for families receiving public assistance or at risk of dependency. The remaining funds should be used for eligible families not on welfare or at risk of dependency. The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) provides child care subsidies to eligible families, with about 1.5 million children receiving assistance in FY2012. Parents have the option to choose a child care provider with a grant or contract from the state or receive a certificate to purchase child care services. A child care certificate, also known as a voucher, authorizes child care payments for the provider chosen by parents. It can be in the form of a check or cash, but must be used for child care services only. The 1996 law expanded the definition to allow vouchers to be used as a deposit for child care services. Families contribute to the cost of care on a sliding fee scale basis, with waivers available for those with incomes at or below the poverty guidelines. States can also waive contributions on a case-by-case basis. States have flexibility in establishing rules for counting income and must ensure equal access to child care services for eligible children. Payment rates for child care services should be sufficient, and families may be required to contribute up to 10% of their income. Waivers are available for families in protective services or foster care. Payment rates for child care services under CCDF are reimbursement rate ceilings, with providers being paid the state's established rate or the actual fee charged to nonsubsidized parents, whichever is lower. States may link payment rates to factors like quality of care and regional variation. Some states conduct local market rate surveys to determine payment rates. States must conduct a local market rate survey every two years to set payment rates for child care services under CCDF. Federal regulations recommend rates at the 75th percentile to ensure equal access for eligible families. States have flexibility in determining payment rates based on various factors like setting and child age. Many states use tiered reimbursement systems for child care providers, issuing higher rates based on quality standards, non-traditional hours, and special populations. Federal law mandates that 4% of CCDF expenditures be spent on improving child care quality through activities like professional development and provider compensation. Federal appropriations also target funds for quality improvement initiatives. The CCDF allows states to allocate discretionary funds for quality improvement activities, with specific set-asides for infant and toddler care, school-aged child care, and child care resource and referral services. Federal regulations limit administrative costs to 5% of CCDF funds, but certain activities integral to service delivery are excluded from this cap. Additionally, federal funds cannot be used for purchasing items prohibited by the CCDBG Act. The CCDBG Act prohibits the use of federal funds for land or building purchases, with exceptions for sectarian organizations and Indian tribes. States must submit plans to HHS to receive federal funding for child care, with detailed information on program administration and eligibility criteria. State plans for child care funding must include details on administration, eligibility criteria, parental choice, access, complaints, consumer education, licensing, regulation, and health/safety requirements. HHS introduced a new state plan format in 2011, which has been maintained in subsequent years, divided into three main sections: Administration, CCDF Subsidy Program Administration, and eligibility rules. The changes initiated in 2011 required states to conduct a self-assessment and goal-setting process in four areas: licensing and health/safety standards, early learning guidelines, quality improvement activities, and professional development systems. States had to identify goals in these areas and report progress in an annual Quality Performance Report. The first round of reports was due in December 2012, with subsequent reports due annually. Parents of eligible children must be given the option to enroll with a provider that has a grant or contract. The CCDBG Act requires states to ensure parental choice in child care providers, offering the option to enroll with a state-contracted provider or receive a child care certificate. States must describe how parental choice is implemented and ensure equal access to child care services for eligible children. Eligible providers include individuals aged 18 and up. Under the CCDBG Act, eligible child care providers can include individuals aged 18 and older who provide child care services for family members. Questions have arisen about how parental choice protections in the Act interact with state initiatives requiring providers to meet minimum quality standards, such as through Quality Rating and Improvement Systems (QRIS). States may require providers to meet a minimum QRIS score to be eligible for federal subsidies. HHS issued a program instruction on parental choice and QRIS initiatives, stating that policies requiring child care providers to meet a minimum QRIS score should not significantly restrict parental choice. States must ensure families can choose from various providers and settings, with procedures in place for unlimited parent access to children in care. States must maintain records of substantiated complaints made by parents and make this information publicly available. The state plan must also include consumer education information for parents, including details about available providers and health and safety requirements. Licensing requirements for child care services must be in place and effectively enforced, with the state plan detailing these requirements. Federal law does not specify the exact licensing requirements or types of providers. The 1996 federal law does not specify licensing requirements for child care providers but states must have health and safety regulations in place. States must ensure that subsidized child care providers comply with these requirements, including prevention and control of infectious diseases. The 1996 federal law requires states to have health and safety regulations for child care providers, including prevention of infectious diseases. A 2011 memorandum recommended comprehensive criminal background checks for child care providers receiving subsidies under the CCDF. The memorandum recommends comprehensive criminal background checks for child care providers under the CCDF, including fingerprint checks of state and FBI criminal history records, checks of state child abuse registries, and sex offender registries. Tribal lead agencies may also need to comply with the Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act for employees in contact with American Indian children. States vary in background check requirements for child care providers. As of February 2012, 40 states and territories required FBI fingerprint checks for center-based child care providers, while only 31 states and territories required such checks for providers in group child care homes. A report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) highlighted cases where individuals convicted of serious sexual offenses were employed or present at child care facilities, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive background checks for child care providers. In recent years, Congress has shown interest in requiring criminal background checks for certain child care providers. Several bills were introduced in the 113th Congress for this purpose. HHS mandates that discretionary CCDBG funds supplement state general revenue funds for child care assistance for low-income families. This requirement is not in the CCDBG Act but is typically included in federal appropriation laws. The CCDBG Act, included in the FY2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act, authorizes discretionary funds subject to annual appropriations. Actual appropriations have exceeded the authorized level, reaching $2.358 billion for FY2014. Mandatory CCDF funding, provided by the 1996 welfare reform law, was pre-appropriated to states from FY1997 to FY2002 without going through the annual appropriations process. CCDF funding does not go through annual appropriations. Mandatory funding was provided through FY2005 via extensions. In 2006, a budget reconciliation bill pre-appropriated $2.917 billion annually for FY2006-FY2010. Since FY2010, funds have been extended. Funding history for FY2013-FY2015, ARRA summary, and other funding issues are discussed. The Senate Appropriations Subcommittee approved an FY2015 appropriations bill for Departments of Labor, HHS, Education, and Related Agencies, providing $2.458 billion in discretionary CCDBG funding. The Obama Administration requested $2.417 billion for FY2015, an increase of $59 million from FY2014. The House Appropriations Committee has not taken action on the bill yet. The FY2015 President's Budget proposed a $809 million increase in funding for child care, totaling $6.084 billion, with a focus on improving quality and safety measures. This includes $200 million for new formula state grants and a $750 million increase in mandatory funding. In FY2015, the President's Budget proposed a $809 million increase in child care funding to $6.084 billion, aiming to serve 1.4 million children. Future plans included reaching $5.917 billion by FY2024 and reforming CCDF funding to improve quality, safety, and access for low-income children. President Obama signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, providing $2.360 billion in discretionary CCDBG funding for FY2014, later reduced to $2.358 billion. This represented a $153 million increase from FY2013. The law included set-asides for quality activities and funding for a national toll-free hotline for child care information. Funding for a hotline has been provided every year since FY2000, except for FY2011. Prior to P.L. 113-76, FY2014 CCDBG funding was provided by short-term resolutions. A funding gap in FY2014 led to a government shutdown until a CR was signed on October 17, 2013. Unspent CCDF funds from prior years were made available for expenditure. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved an FY2014 appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor, HHS, Education, and Related Agencies, providing $2.500 billion in discretionary CCDBG funds. Mandatory child care funds also faced a funding gap at the beginning of FY2014, but subsequent CRs resolved the issue. The FY2013 operating level for the discretionary CCDBG was $2.206 billion, $73 million less than the FY2012 funding level. This amount was extended through September 30, 2014, by subsequent CRs and the full-year consolidated appropriations act. The operating level reflected reductions required by sequestration, an across-the-board rescission, and transfers/reprogramming of funds authorized by the HHS Secretary. The Budget Control Act of 2011 directed OMB to implement sequestration of FY2013 funding to enforce deficit reduction goals. The sequestration was postponed and ultimately issued on March 1. The House and Senate initiated the FY2013 L-HHS-ED appropriations process, with the House subcommittee approving a bill for full committee consideration. The bill would have provided $2.303 billion in discretionary CCDBG in FY2013 but was not taken up by the full committee. In 2012, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported a bill for full-year FY2013 L-HHS-ED appropriations, including $2.438 billion in discretionary CCDBG funds. Mandatory child care funding was extended through temporary extensions, maintaining funding at $2.917 billion annually since FY2006. Unlike discretionary funds, mandatory child care funds are exempt from sequestration. In FY2009, the CCDBG received $2.0 billion in discretionary funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The funds were to supplement state general revenue spending on child care for low-income families and reserve $255 million for activities like consumer education and improving child care quality. In FY2009, the CCDBG received $2.0 billion in discretionary funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, with $94 million reserved for improving infant and toddler care. States were required to obligate their ARRA funds by September 30, 2010, and had until September 30, 2011 to expend them. As of June 30, 2011, states had spent approximately 95% of their ARRA allocations. States spent the majority of CCDF ARRA funding on direct services, such as lowering parental co-payments, increasing payment rates to child care providers, and expanding income eligibility thresholds. ARRA funds were also used to avoid waiting lists for eligible children and provide services for an estimated 336,000 children. Additionally, states invested in quality activities using ARRA funds. States used ARRA funds to expand investments in quality activities, such as creating or expanding Quality Rating and Improvement Systems, supporting programs for infants and toddlers, and improving health and safety standards. The treatment of CCDBG funding in the appropriations process changed in FY1997 to advance fund the program by a year, ensuring funds were available for obligation at the beginning of the fiscal year. In FY1997, CCDBG funding was advance funded by a year, with $19 million appropriated specifically for that year. The bulk of the appropriation, $937 million, became available in FY1998. Funds are allocated based on states' child population, free/reduced-price lunch recipients, and per capita income, with reservations for territories and Indian tribes. Federal law requires the Secretary of HHS to reserve between 1% and 2% of mandatory funds for payments to Indian tribes and tribal organizations, with an additional 0.25% reserved for technical assistance. States do not need to match these discretionary funds, and any unused funds can be reallocated by the Secretary. The FY2014 discretionary CCDBG allocations are shown in Table 2. The Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) program allocates funds to states based on specific criteria. States receive a guaranteed mandatory amount of $1.2 billion each year, with no state match required. Additional mandatory funds are allocated based on each state's share of children under age 13, subject to maintenance-of-effort and matching requirements. States must spend their guaranteed federal entitlement funds for child care, plus 100% of the amount spent with state funds in previous years, and provide matching funds at the Medicaid rate to receive additional entitlement funds. The Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) program allocates funds to states based on specific criteria. States must spend their guaranteed federal entitlement funds for child care, plus 100% of the amount spent with state funds in previous years, and provide matching funds at the Medicaid rate to receive additional entitlement funds. Unused funds may be redistributed among other states based on their shares of children under age 13. States can also transfer up to 30% of their TANF block grant allotment to the CCDF, with transferred funds required to be spent according to CCDBG Act rules. In FY2013, states spent $1.1 billion in federal TANF money on child care within the TANF program. The Secretary must coordinate child care activities within HHS and with other federal agencies, publish child care standards every three years, provide technical assistance to states, monitor state compliance, and establish procedures for complaints. If a state is out of compliance, the Secretary can require reimbursement to the federal government. States must reimburse the federal government for misspent funds or face withholding from their CCDF allotment. They must undergo independent audits and repay any misspent funds. A case review is required every three years to check for improper payments, linked to State Error Rate Reporting regulations. In 2010, the GAO reported fraud in child care assistance programs, with investigators successfully billing for fictitious children. The GAO found that care providers billed for $11,702 in child care assistance for fictitious children due to lack of controls in five states. Unregulated providers were identified as a vulnerability for fraud and abuse in child care assistance programs. HHS issued guidance in 2010 to improve program integrity and financial accountability under CCDF. Unregulated child care providers made up 19% of all providers receiving CCDF support in FY2010. The program instruction provided recommendations for strengthening program integrity in child care assistance programs, including verification of eligibility, monitoring providers, and recovering payments from fraud. HHS identified CCDF as at risk for improper payments and conducted assessments every three years. The HHS responded to the mandate by publishing new regulations effective October 1, 2007, on state requirements for error rate reporting in the administration of CCDF grant funds. States are now required to calculate, prepare, and submit reports on error rates, establish target error rates, discuss strategies for reducing errors, and report on state error rates and improper payments. The CCDF error rate methodology requires states to review case records to determine improper payments. States must report findings to HHS every three years and provide federal staff access for oversight. HHS uses a three-year rotation to measure improper authorizations for payments. The CCDF error rate data is released annually by HHS in the Agency Financial Reports. The most recent FY2013 error rate was 5.9%, down from 9.2% in FY2012. The net error rate for FY2013 was 5.0%. Actual improper payments rendered are about 17% lower than improper authorizations. Regulations state that improper payments should be reviewed by states every three years. Improper payments identified during case reviews are subject to federal disallowance procedures for misspent funds, regardless of whether the state pursues recovery. States must recover improper child care payments resulting from fraud, but have discretion for non-fraud cases. Recovered funds can be used for approved state activities within the obligation period. If recovered after the obligation period, funds must be returned. In 2007, HHS revised CCDF regulations to increase state flexibility in meeting match requirements. The final rule allowed up to 30% of a state's CCDF match to come from public pre-kindergarten expenditures. Additionally, the rule amended requirements for using privately donated funds. The new rule allows states to designate multiple public and/or private entities to receive privately donated funds for CCDF, with certification required by the state's lead agency and either the donor or designated entity. Private donations must be unrestricted and cannot be earmarked for specific recipients. The federal law specifies data reporting requirements for states and territories administering CCDF programs, including quarterly reports to HHS with disaggregated data on recipients and annual aggregated data submissions. Tribes and tribal organizations are not subject to the same reporting requirements but must submit annual aggregated data. The Secretary of HHS is required to submit a report to Congress every two years summarizing and analyzing the data submitted by lead agencies. The report to Congress summarizes data submitted by lead agencies on child care access and affordability. Program data for states and territories from FY1998 to FY2010 is available on the HHS website. States and territories are required to collect information on family income, demographics, type of child care, provider, cost, and duration of benefits. States and territories report detailed data on child care providers to HHS, including information on costs, hours of care, and provider characteristics. The revised ACF-801 form now includes new data elements such as unique provider IDs, quality ratings, and accreditation status. This updated form became mandatory in October 2013. Additionally, federal law mandates states to submit aggregated data on child care providers annually. Under the CCDBG Act, states and territories submit aggregated data reports annually to HHS on the ACF-800 form, detailing the number of child care providers receiving funding, monthly costs of services, payments made, consumer education information provided, and the total number of children and families served. Religious providers may receive assistance on the same basis as nonsectarian providers, with the ability to use funds for construction assistance. Providers receiving CCDF funding can use funds for construction assistance to ensure compliance with health and safety requirements. However, using funds for religious activities is generally prohibited, except for sectarian child care services chosen by parents. Admissions policies cannot discriminate based on religion, except for family child care providers or those receiving assistance through child care certificates. Child care providers receiving assistance under the act may reserve unsubsidized slots for children whose families participate in their activities, with exceptions for those funded primarily by federal or state funds. Employment practices cannot discriminate based on religion for employees working directly with children, but sectarian providers can prioritize individuals who participate in their activities. Sectarian organizations can require adherence to religious tenets and rules on drugs/alcohol, with exceptions for those funded primarily by federal or state funds. The welfare reform law of 1996 included relevant provisions. The welfare reform law of 1996 (P.L. 104-193) allows states to provide child care services through charitable and religious organizations without compromising their religious character. 1-2% of child care funds are reserved for payments to Indian tribes and tribal organizations, with unused funds allocated to other eligible tribes and organizations. Indian tribes and tribal organizations must submit applications to receive funding. Indian tribes and tribal organizations must submit applications to receive reserved funds for child care services. The Secretary, in consultation with tribes, develops minimum child care standards reflecting tribal needs. Funds generally cannot be used for construction, but exceptions may be made for tribes lacking adequate facilities. The Secretary may approve requests for reserved funds for child care services if adequate facilities are not available and their absence will hinder future operations. States use CCDF quality funds to support Quality Rating and Improvement Systems (QRIS) to assess and enhance early childhood program quality. QRIS rates providers based on selected measures to improve care quality, provide technical assistance, and inform parents about program quality. Quality Rating and Improvement Systems (QRIS) assess and enhance early childhood program quality using three- or four-star rating scales. Common elements include standards, accountability through inspections, and program support like training and mentoring for providers. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $2.0 billion in discretionary child care funds to provide financial incentives for providers to improve the quality of their programs. This included tiered subsidy reimbursement, professional development grants, and tax credits for parents enrolling children in rated programs. HHS provided states with their full ARRA allocations in FY2009, doubling CCDF allotments. Table A-1 shows FY2009 CCDF allocations from all federal sources."
