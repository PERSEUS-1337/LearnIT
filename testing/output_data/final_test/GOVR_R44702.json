    "content": "In 2002, Congress passed the Improper Payments Information Act (IPIA) and the Recovery Audit Act to address improper payments made by federal agencies. Reports on improper payments and recovery audits were first issued for FY2004, showing uneven progress in reducing improper payments between FY2004 and FY2008. Between FY2004 and FY2008, the government-wide improper payment rate increased. In response to identified weaknesses in recovery audit programs, Congress passed the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010 (IPERA), which amended IPIA and the Recovery Audit Act. IPERA retained core provisions of IPIA, required improvements in improper payment estimation methodologies, and expanded reporting requirements for recovery audit programs. Improper payments are defined as payments made in incorrect amounts, including overpayments and underpayments, to ineligible recipients or duplicates. Under IPERA, payments that were made to ineligible recipients, duplicates, for goods/services not received, or without accounting for applicable discounts are considered improper. The law applies to federal funds transferred to nonfederal entities, including grantees, contractors, and loan recipients. Agencies must conduct risk assessments to identify programs susceptible to significant improper payments exceeding $10 million for FY2011 and FY2012. Beginning in FY2013, the threshold for \"significant\" improper payments under IPERA dropped to 1.5%, with agencies required to perform initial risk assessments for every program and activity in 2011 and subsequent assessments at least every three years. Risk factors considered include program complexity, volume of payments, and recent changes in program funding or practices. IPERA requires agencies to estimate and report on improper payments for programs identified as susceptible, detailing causes and planned actions to reduce them. IPERA mandates agencies to report on improper payments, including causes and corrective actions. Target dates for reducing improper payments must be approved by OMB, with performance criteria to hold parties accountable. Agencies must evaluate internal controls to prevent, detect, and recover improper payments. They must also assess if they have sufficient resources for internal controls, such as human capital and information systems. OMB is required to establish criteria for agencies to demonstrate effective internal control systems and submit a report to congressional committees on government-wide efforts to reduce improper payments. The report includes reduction targets, agency compliance status, progress towards targets, and actions taken to reduce improper payments. The OMB provides guidance on improper payments reports required by IPERA, with agencies needing to comply by publishing financial statements, conducting risk assessments, and setting reduction targets. Compliance is determined by reporting no improper payment rate exceeding 10%. Agencies must report improper payment rates below 10% to comply with IPERA. Noncompliant agencies must submit a plan to Congress with milestones, a responsible official, and accountability measures. If noncompliant for two years, additional funding may be required for compliance efforts. IPERA requires agencies to obligate additional funds determined by OMB for intensified compliance efforts. Noncompliant agencies may need statutory authority to transfer funds under Title 31 of the U.S. Code. If an agency is noncompliant for three or more consecutive years, reauthorization proposals must be submitted to Congress. OMB has the authority to conduct compliance pilot programs and report findings within five years. Recovery audits are used to identify overpayments. Recovery audits, also known as payment recapture audits, are a management function designed to detect and recapture overpayments. IPERA mandates agencies to conduct recovery audits on programs with expenditures over $1 million annually, with a focus on cost-effectiveness. The legislation outlines procedures for recovery audits, overpayment collection, allocation of recovered amounts, and reporting requirements. The legislation mandates agencies to conduct recovery audits on programs with expenditures over $1 million annually, prioritizing recent payments and those susceptible to significant improper payments. Recovery audit services can be performed by agencies, other U.S. departments, or private sector services through contracts. Contractors can assist with recovery audits but require agency consent for certain actions and cannot make final decisions. The legislation mandates recovery audits on programs with expenditures over $1 million annually. Contractors cannot make final decisions on overpayment claims and must report all overpayments detected. Nongovernmental entities are prohibited from disclosing identifying information uncovered through recovery audits. Agencies must take prompt action to collect overpayments identified in audits. The legislation mandates recovery audits on programs with expenditures over $1 million annually. Contractors cannot make final decisions on overpayment claims and must report all overpayments detected. Agencies must take prompt action to collect overpayments identified in audits. The collected amounts are distributed at the discretion of agency heads, with limits on the maximum percentage allocated to various programs and activities. Up to 100% of the collected amounts may be deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. IPERA specifies reporting requirements. IPERA mandates recovery audits on programs with expenditures over $1 million annually. Agencies must report on improper payment recovery actions, including estimates of improper payments, methods used for recovery, amounts recovered, outstanding, and not collectable, reasons for uncollected amounts, aging schedule of outstanding amounts, disposition of recovered amounts, resolution of conditions leading to improper payments, and justification for not conducting a recovery audit if deemed not cost-effective. Agencies must also submit a report to OMB and Congress by November 1 each year on actions taken to address identified conditions. The Director of OMB must provide reports to Congress on actions taken to address overpayments identified by recovery audit contractors. Additionally, the Chief Financial Officers Council must conduct a study on the implementation and effectiveness of recovery audit provisions within two years of IPERA's enactment. The Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Audit Improvement Act of 2012 (IPERIA) requires OMB to identify high-priority federal programs for increased oversight based on dollar value, error rate, or susceptibility to improper payments. IPERIA mandates OMB to set targets and actions to reduce improper payments in high-risk programs. Agencies must submit annual reports on prevention efforts, with the inspector general assessing payment estimates and controls. OMB issues guidance for compliance. IPERIA requires agencies to follow new standards for sampling payments, verify recipient eligibility before issuing payments, and review databases like the Death Master File and Excluded Parties List System. The initiative aims to increase accuracy in agency improper payment estimates. The Do Not Pay Initiative, under IPERIA, allows OMB to include various databases like the Credit Alert System and List of Excluded Parties and Entities. OMB must report to Congress annually on agency efforts to reduce improper payments and incorrect data identification. IPERIA also requires OMB to submit a plan for integrating other databases, maximizing agency access, and developing agreements between agency inspectors. The Do Not Pay Initiative, under IPERIA, allows OMB to include various databases for reducing improper payments. OMB is required to issue guidance on agreements between agency inspectors for data sharing. States and contractors can access the databases with an \"appropriate\" system in place. The Attorney General must assess using incarceration status to prevent improper payments. IPERIA mandates agencies to establish annual payment recapture targets and requires the Director of OMB to set recovery targets for improper payments. It also expands on provisions for detecting, preventing, and recovering improper payments, including using incarceration status as a method for identification. The law aims to improve the accuracy and timeliness of death data maintained by SSA and requires a report from the Secretary of the Treasury on data analytics for improper payment detection within 180 days of enactment. The Director of OMB is required to determine current and historical improper payments recovery amounts and rates, including those recaptured by recovery audit contractors, and provide a list of agency recovery audit contract programs. OMB's guidance in Appendix C of OMB Circular A-123 clarifies definitions of improper payments and programs, including grants, procurements, credit programs, regulatory activities, and research and development activities. OMB's guidance in Appendix C of OMB Circular A-123 clarifies definitions of improper payments and programs. A-123 requires agencies to review all programs, identify those susceptible to improper payments, develop estimates, implement reduction plans, and report progress. The same definition of \"significant\" improper payments is used by A-123 and IPERA for identifying susceptible programs. The guidance in A-123 outlines criteria for identifying programs susceptible to improper payments based on thresholds of 1.5% of outlays and $10 million, or total outlays exceeding $100 million. OMB may require risk assessments for programs below the threshold. A-123 also requires OMB approval of agency sampling methodologies to ensure accurate reflection of improper payments, with detailed steps provided for establishing valid methodologies. Estimates should only include the erroneous amount of payments. A-123 allows agencies to sample transactions at specific high-risk steps in the payment process to reduce improper payments. If a payment is made without sufficient documentation, the entire amount is considered improper. Agencies must develop a plan to reduce improper payments as required by A-123. A-123 requires agencies to develop a plan to reduce improper payments, including identifying root causes, setting OMB-approved reduction targets, and ensuring accountability. Agencies must assess infrastructure and identify barriers, with an option to request waivers for non-risk-susceptible programs. A-123 mandates agencies to report improper payment estimates in their Performance and Accountability Report or Annual Financial Report, along with plans to prevent, detect, and recover improper payments. It also provides guidance on steps agencies should take to reduce improper payments, including using predictive modeling and data mining. A-123 mandates agencies to partner with inspectors general to prevent fraud, focus on data mining, and train staff on identifying improper payments. OMB can classify programs as high-priority if they have significant improper payments exceeding $750 million. Agencies must develop tailored corrective action plans for high-priority programs and report to IGs on prevention efforts. IPERA requires agencies with expenditures over $1 million to conduct payment recapture audits. A-123 mandates agencies to implement payment recapture audit programs for expenditures over $1 million annually. The program should focus on risk analysis, audits, and recovery activities to ensure cost-effectiveness. Payment recapture audits should prioritize categories with the highest potential for overpayment recoveries. The Payment Recapture Audit Program must focus on categories with the highest potential for overpayment recoveries. Contractors can notify entities of potential overpayments, respond to questions, and take administrative action, but cannot make final decisions on overpayment claims. Instances of potential fraud must be reported, and underpayments must be corrected. Agencies must perform recovery audits if cost-effective, as per IPERA and A-123 guidelines. According to A-123, agencies should consider the likelihood of overpayment recapture in determining whether a recapture audit is cost-effective. Factors to consider include laws permitting recovery, recipient resources for repayment, clarity of overpayment evidence, and recoverability of improper payments. If a payment recapture audit program is not cost-effective, agencies must inform OMB and the inspector general with supporting analysis. OMB may review and mandate the audit program if necessary. Agencies must also report programs and activities in their annual financial reports where recapture audits were not deemed cost-effective. Agencies must report in their annual AFR or PAR programs where a payment recapture audit program is not cost-effective, along with an explanation. They must set annual recapture targets for their programs, which OMB must approve, with varying targets based on payment types. A-123 provides guidelines for coordination between federal agencies and state/local governments for payment recapture audits and financial management improvement efforts. Grant programs are subject to IPERA's recovery audit provisions and are often administered by states and local governments. The guidance instructs federal agencies to work with state and local governments to ensure sufficient resources for payment recapture audits. Agencies may use recovered funds for financial management improvement. IPERA allows for recovery audits to be done by the agency, other U.S. departments, private sector entities, or nonfederal entities. IPERA allows agencies to use various contract types for recovery audit services, including contingency contracts where contractors receive a percentage of overpayments collected. Certain recovered payments cannot be used for contingency fees, requiring alternative payment arrangements. Contractors must report on improper payments and provide mitigation recommendations to the agency. Payment recapture audit contractors must report improper payments, notify the agency of overpayments, and report fraud. They must protect sensitive financial information and are not allowed to compel the production of records. Collection activities are carried out by federal agencies or nonfederal entities, not by the contractors. A-123 outlines the process for recapturing overpayments from federal awards, specifying that overpayments from different types of funds must be returned to their respective accounts. Recaptured amounts can be used to pay audit contractors and reimburse agency expenses. Unused funds are allocated with up to 25% for specific purposes. The recaptured amounts from federal awards can be used to reimburse agency expenses or pay audit contractors. Up to 25% can be used for a financial management improvement program, 25% for the original purpose of the funds, and 5% for the agency IG. The remaining amount is credited to the expired account. IPERA requires agencies to report annually on their payment recapture audit programs in their Performance and Accountability Reports or Agency Financial Reports. OMB's guidance in A-123 aligns with IPERA but includes additional requirements. The guidance in OMB Circular A-136 and A-123 requires agencies to report on payment recapture audit programs in their Performance and Accountability Reports or Agency Financial Reports. This includes details on recoveries collected, methods used for overpayments, justification for uncollectible overpayments, total overpayments and underpayments, and recommendations for mitigation of conditions promoting overpayments. Agencies using federal employees or external contractors must also submit an additional annual report to OMB and congressional committees. The agency is required to report on mitigation of conditions that lead to overpayments and actions taken in response to recommendations. Despite efforts to reduce improper payments over the years, there has been no sustained progress on a government-wide basis, with several programs still experiencing significant improper payments. The government's improper payment rate is 4.39%. The government's improper payment rate of 4.39% in FY2015 has remained nearly unchanged since FY2004. Agencies have made over a trillion dollars in improper payments since IPIA took effect, with $137 billion in improper payments in FY2015 alone. The inability to reduce improper payment rates is partly due to agencies' failure to reduce error rates for high-priority programs, some of which have actually increased over time. The improper payment rates for various government programs have increased over time. For example, the Medicare Fee-for-Service program saw an increase from 5.2% in FY2005 to 12.1% in FY2015, with improper payments tripling from $12 billion to approximately $43 billion. While some programs have reduced error rates slightly, others like the Unemployment Insurance and Supplemental Security Income programs have also seen increases in improper payment rates. In FY2015, improper payments totaled approximately $137 billion, with agencies needing to address high-priority programs to improve error rates. Some risk-susceptible programs, including Temporary Aid for Needy Families, lacked established improper payment reporting. The EITC, administered by the Department of the Treasury, has a high improper payment rate, with estimates ranging from 21% to 26% in FY2015, resulting in over $15 billion in improper payments. Agencies are required to set and meet annual reduction targets for improper payments, but many fell short in FY2014. In FY2014, agencies fell short of setting and meeting annual reduction targets for improper payments. Agency Inspectors General did not always meet IPERA reporting requirements, which are important oversight tools for Congress to evaluate agency efforts in addressing improper payments. In FY2014, agency Inspectors General did not always report on compliance with IPERA requirements, limiting Congress's ability to compare agencies' implementation status. IPERIA mandates agencies to verify recipient eligibility against six databases before issuing payments. OMB implements the DNP initiative, and the Department of the Treasury hosts the DNP. The Department of the Treasury hosts the DNP initiative, allowing agencies to access six databases. A recent review found that agencies have limited access to three databases, resulting in only $680,000 in prevented improper payments in FY2015. The lack of clear guidance from OMB and Treasury is cited as a key factor in the initiative's limited effectiveness. Agencies are required by IPERA to conduct recovery audits for programs with expenditures over $1 million. Some agencies are not consistently meeting requirements for recovery audit programs, leading to potential loss of recaptured overpayments and oversight of risk-susceptible programs. For example, the Department of Health and Human Services did not conduct audit recovery activities for Medicare Advantage in FY2015 due to contractor issues. The U.S. Department of Agriculture also faced legal and accounting obstacles preventing engagement in recovery audit activities. The USDA has faced legal and accounting issues hindering full-scale recovery audit programs. In FY2016, USDA will require compliance with IPERA recovery audit criteria for all programs for the first time. Additional guidance may be needed to ensure agencies meet recovery audit requirements, even in unexpected circumstances. Agencies do not consistently report exempted programs from recovery audits, potentially leading to oversight. For example, HUD did not include information on exempted programs in its FY2015 PAR, lacking a systematic evaluation process for recovery audits. The Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015 (FRDAA) requires agencies to establish financial and administrative controls to prevent fraud and improper payments. It became law on June 30, 2016, after passing the Senate and House. Congress lacks information on the scope of recovery audit program exemptions at HUD and other agencies, leading to potential oversight. The Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015 mandates agencies to implement controls to prevent, detect, and respond to fraud, including improper payments. Guidelines must incorporate leading practices from a GAO report on fraud risk management. Agencies must evaluate fraud risks, use a risk-based approach for control activities, monitor fraud trends, and improve prevention controls. Annual financial reports must discuss progress in implementing fraud risk guidance, identifying risks, and establishing strategies to combat fraud for the first three fiscal years following enactment. The Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015 mandates agencies to implement controls to prevent, detect, and respond to fraud, including improper payments. The Act requires OMB to establish a working group to develop strategies for sharing best practices and data analytics techniques to combat fraud. The working group will submit a plan to Congress for an interagency library of data analytics and data sets. It will be composed of the OMB Controller, agency CFOs, and other relevant parties, consulting with agency IGs and fraud experts."
