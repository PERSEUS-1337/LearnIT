    "content": "The \"Duty Suspension Facilitation Act of 2010\" provides a procedure for the International Trade Commission to submit legislation for temporary duty suspensions or reductions in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. The International Trade Commission must submit proposed legislation every 2 years to amend the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, including extending existing duty suspensions, providing new duty reductions, and making technical corrections. The International Trade Commission solicits views from agencies and the public when formulating recommendations and proposed legislation. They provide notice, opportunity for written views, and hold public hearings. Duty suspension or reduction recommendations cannot be made if an interested Federal agency opposes. The International Trade Commission seeks input from agencies and the public for duty suspension or reduction recommendations. An interested Federal agency can object if the suspension or reduction is not in the interest of the United States, if there is domestic production available, if the revenue loss exceeds $500,000 annually, or if the duty reduction period exceeds 3 years. Legislation for proposed changes to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule must include specific details like heading numbers, CAS numbers, duty rates, and any other necessary information. The International Trade Commission must also provide recommendations along with the proposed legislation. The International Trade Commission must submit a summary of information and views on proposed legislation, which must be published in the Federal Register 60 days before submission. Starting in 2013, the dollar amount in subsection (c)(3) will be adjusted for inflation based on the CPI. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the preceding calendar year will determine any increase in the dollar amount starting in 2013. The CPI is the average of the Consumer Price Index as of the close of the 12-month period ending on August 31 of the calendar year. Increases will be rounded to the nearest dollar."
