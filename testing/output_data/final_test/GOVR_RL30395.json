Since World War I, temporary foreign workers have been allowed to supplement domestic farm workers. Fruit and vegetable growers heavily rely on hand labor and are the largest users of hired and contract workers. Immigrants have historically found employment on farms, and there is a growing share of domestic farm workers composed of immigrants. The U.S. Department of Labor estimated that unauthorized aliens accounted for a significant portion of the domestic crop workforce, reaching 55% in the late 1990s before decreasing slightly. Despite studies showing no nationwide shortage of domestic farm labor, the presence of unauthorized foreign-born workers in seasonal agriculture suggests a lack of legal workers relative to employer demand. This imbalance could become more apparent if the supply of unauthorized workers is restricted. The fear of farm labor shortages due to curtailed supply of unauthorized workers has concerned growers. Government enforcement activities and no-match letters have disrupted workforces, leading to instability in labor supply. Legislative responses have been prompted by the perception of negative impacts on U.S. agriculture. The report examines the seasonal agricultural labor force, analyzing trends in employment, wages, and shortages of farm workers. Immigration legislation has been crafted to address labor requirements of U.S. crop growers, such as the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 aimed to reduce unauthorized aliens in the US by penalizing employers who hire them. It included industry-specific legalization programs like the Special Agricultural Worker (SAW) and Replenishment Agricultural Worker (RAW) programs. However, these programs did not offset the influx of unauthorized aliens in seasonal agricultural services (SAS), as found in a 1992 report by the Commission on Agricultural Workers. The SAW program legalized farm workers who planned to stay in agriculture indefinitely. Many SAWs intend to work in the fields until retirement, but aging and physical demands may prompt some to leave. The average age of SAW-legalized workers in 2007 was 47, and few farm workers continue crop production beyond age 44 or 54. The 1986 legalization program for farm workers has become less effective over time due to various factors, including the increasing presence of unauthorized aliens in the agricultural sector. The share of unauthorized workers in the labor force has significantly risen, with their workdays more than tripling between FY1989 and FY2002. Additionally, a large majority of foreign-born newcomers in FY2000-FY2002 were employed without authorization. Unauthorized aliens in the agricultural industry have been displacing legal workers, as crop producers prefer them for their lower bargaining power. Despite risks of penalties, growers argue that the presence of unauthorized workers implies a shortage of legal workers. Farm worker groups suggest that the industry could adjust by implementing labor-efficient technologies and raising wages. Unauthorized aliens in the agricultural industry have been displacing legal workers, as crop producers prefer them for their lower bargaining power. Farm worker groups suggest that the industry could adjust by implementing labor-efficient technologies and raising wages to attract more authorized workers. Grower advocates argue that further mechanization for many crops would be challenging and that raising wages could make the U.S. industry uncompetitive in world markets, leading to reduced farm employment. However, farm worker supporters believe that higher wages would only result in a slight rise in retail prices, as wages are a small part of the consumer price for fresh fruits and vegetables. These arguments remain untested as perishable crop growers have rarely operated without unauthorized aliens in their workforces. The farm labor market does not show a nationwide shortage of domestic workers, but spot shortages may occur in certain areas at times. Caution is advised when interpreting statistics on farm workers' employment, wages, and time worked due to differences in survey groups and sample sizes. The industry has rarely operated without unauthorized aliens, making it difficult to test arguments for adjusting labor practices. Household surveys like the CPS may underestimate farm workers and unauthorized workers due to living arrangements and reluctance to respond. Surveys with employers as respondents are more likely to capture unauthorized employment. Estimating worker sufficiency is challenging without a clear definition of labor shortage. Labor markets aim to balance supply and demand, with a lag, complicating the assessment of employer demand fulfillment. Economists believe labor markets reach a balance between supply and demand, with a lag, absent government policies that prevent shortages or surpluses. Estimating shortages or surpluses is challenging as the supply and demand for labor cannot be directly measured. Businesses perceive a shortage in an occupation if they cannot obtain as many workers as needed at the current wage. Employment is often used as a measure of demand, with an increase indicating an employer's higher demand for labor. The trend in wages can clarify the relationship between labor supply and demand, with a decrease in employment indicating reduced demand for labor. Other indicators like unemployment and time worked can also shed light on this relationship. The employment of hired farm workers in crop or livestock production has decreased over time, with a 12% gain in the 1990-2000 period. In contrast, wage and salary workers in nonfarm industries experienced steady job growth of 18% during the same period. This suggests that hired farm workers did not benefit equally from the economic expansion of the 1990s and challenges the notion of a nationwide farm labor shortage at that time. The employment of hired farm workers in crop or livestock production has decreased over time, with a 12% gain in the 1990-2000 period. Nonfarm wage and salary employment showed signs of revival from the 2001 recession in 2003, continuing to rise until the second recession in December 2007. Farm worker employment fluctuated erratically between recessions, ending the period down from their initial level. This disparity suggests that hired farm workers did not equally benefit from the nation's economic expansion and challenges the idea of a nationwide farm labor shortage. The employment of hired farm workers in crop or livestock production has fluctuated over time. Data from California and Florida show an increase in farm employment between July 2006 and July 2009, with rates above the national average in some periods. This challenges the notion of a nationwide farm labor shortage. The substantial growth rate in California suggests a tighter labor market in July 2007, while total farm employment fell considerably. Variable climate conditions may explain yearly fluctuations in farm employment, with drought or hurricanes affecting crop production and labor requirements. In July 2008, California experienced a decrease in planted acreage of cotton, dry beans, and sugar beets due to a lack of available irrigation water, leading to lower demand for field workers. In Washington state, different weather conditions in 2006 affected the timing of labor demand for harvesting cherries, impacting the supply of labor to other growers. This resulted in workers continuing to harvest cherries instead of switching to apple growers in August. The concern of agricultural producers is the adequacy and timeliness of seasonal agricultural workers. Employment data may not fully reflect the state of the labor market, leading to a shrinking supply of untapped labor. The unemployment rate for hired farm workers in crop or livestock production remains high, even during economic booms. This high unemployment rate may be due to discouragement over employment prospects in agriculture or better opportunities elsewhere. Some unemployed farm workers may have left the sector due to concerns over employment prospects in agriculture or better opportunities elsewhere, leading to a reduced number of farm workers over the years. The GAO found that agricultural areas often have high unemployment rates, indicating a surplus rather than a shortage of farm workers. The DOL also suggests the availability of untapped farm labor. The DOL's National Agricultural Worker Survey (NAWS) indicates that farm workers spend two-thirds of the year on farm jobs, with the rest of the time either in nonfarm work, not working, or out of the country. This suggests an excess supply of labor, although some argue it's due to the seasonal nature of the industry. Data shows no significant increase in work hours despite claims of a labor shortage. The average workweek of hired farm workers has remained around 40.0 hours since the mid-1990s, showing no year-to-year variation. Data also indicates that there is not much variability in demand based on hours worked throughout the year. In 2008, the average weekly hours worked ranged from 38.4 to 41.3 hours. Farm operators anticipated utilizing a low of 557,000 farm workers over the course of a year. Farm operators anticipated a low of 557,000 farm workers on their payrolls for at least 150 days in 2008 and a high of 679,000 (un)authorized workers in 2002. Year-round workers typically account for three-fourths of hired farm workers. Economic theory suggests that wages will increase in a tight labor market. Average hourly earnings of field workers have increased similarly to non-management employees in the private sector. California growers raised the hourly wages of field workers and agricultural service workers well above those of nonfarm employees in other private sector industries between July 2006 and July 2007, leading to a significant increase in farm employment during that period. However, the tight labor market for growers in 2007 did not continue in 2008 or 2009. Between July 2007 and July 2008, California growers raised field workers' wages by 2.6%, slightly less than other private sector employers. Agricultural service workers saw no change in hourly wages due to reduced demand for farm labor in July 2008. From July 2008 to July 2009, field workers' wages increased by 2.5%, slightly lower than other private sector employers, while agricultural service workers experienced a raise after no increase the previous year. The lack of a raise in the prior year may have made it easier for California farmers to attract workers from other sectors due to the recession and construction industry decline. Nationwide shortage of farm workers is inconsistent with supply-demand indicators, which include both authorized and unauthorized employment. While shortages may occur in certain regions at times, the analysis does not address the adequacy of authorized workers relative to grower demand. The potential for an adequate supply of authorized U.S. farm workers with new technologies or labor practices remains uncertain. The unresolved question of whether raising wages would attract more U.S. farm workers and the potential impact on industry competitiveness remains due to the reliance on unauthorized aliens in the domestic farm workforce."
