It was enacted in 1972 to ensure a reasonable level of income for surviving dependents. Military retirees can have a portion of their monthly pay withheld to provide a survivor benefit. The cost is shared by the retiree, the government, and sometimes the beneficiary. This report outlines the categories of beneficiaries eligible for survivor benefits under the military Survivor Benefit Plan. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) provides cash benefits to surviving spouses or eligible recipients of retired or deceased members of the uniformed services. In fiscal year 2017, there were 276,820 survivors receiving SBP annuity payments for total DOD expenditures of $3.7 billion. Of those receiving SBP payments, 10,295 were from sponsors who died on active duty, including 3,377 spouses and 6,918 children. Survivors of military members may also be eligible for other benefits such as life insurance, TRICARE health benefits, and Department of Defense death gratuity. In fiscal year 2017, there were 10,295 survivors receiving benefits through the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP), which includes 3,377 spouses and 6,918 children. Participation rates in SBP have increased over the years, with 1.1 million military retirees enrolled in the program. Rates have risen from 58% in 1993 to 78% in 2017 for retiring members. Among nondisabled retirees, participation rates are 58% for enlisted and 74% for officers in the regular component, and higher for Reserve Component retirees at 91% and 90% respectively. The independent assessment of the SBP program in Fiscal Year 2017 found that the SBP benefit accounts for 34%-48% of total income for military widows. The study compared SBP benefits with other federal and private-sector plans, concluding that SBP benefits are comparable to federal benefits and more generous than private-sector plans. The study compared SBP benefits with other federal and private-sector plans, finding them to be comparable to federal benefits and more generous than private-sector plans. Military widows receiving survivor benefits have similar average total income, poverty rates, and participation in public assistance programs as those receiving private-sector benefits. Nonmilitary widows receiving survivor benefits from government pension plans had higher average total income, lower poverty rates, and lower participation in public assistance programs compared to military widows. The RSFPP program was fully paid for by participants, making it expensive for retirees. The decision to elect coverage had to be made before 18 years of military service, leading to uncertainty in cost and benefits. Participation never exceeded 15% of eligible retirees, with DOD obligations for survivors in FY2017 totaling $15 million. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) was expected to be more popular than the Retired Serviceman's Family Protection Plan (RSFPP) due to lower costs and broader benefits for survivors. However, SBP also entails higher costs to taxpayers as the government shares the expenses. Coverage and benefits under SBP vary based on the retiree's status and elections made at retirement. Retirees can choose different levels of coverage or opt out, with the maximum benefit being 55% of the military retired pay at the time of death. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) provides 55% of the base amount of military retired pay at the time of the retiree's death. Retirees can choose reduced coverage, subject to a $300 minimum, if they elect a base amount less than total retired pay. Spouse concurrence is required for any election made on or after March 1, 1986. Retirees who initially opt out of SBP but marry after retirement can elect SBP benefits for their new spouse within one year of marriage, with a one-year waiting period before it takes effect. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) provides 55% of military retired pay at the time of the retiree's death. Retirees can choose reduced coverage with a $300 minimum. Spouse concurrence is required for elections made after March 1, 1986. SBP coverage is free for those in active service, with costs deducted from retired pay. Changes post-retirement are based on cost-of-living adjustments. SBP premiums can be paid from Combat Related Special Compensation (CRSC) payments. Formula for retired pay withholding is based on the member's retirement date. The formula for determining the amount of retired pay withheld is based on the member's retirement date and the type of retirement entitlement. Military personnel who entered service on or after March 1, 1990, and are not entitled to retired pay under certain codes have withholdings computed under the Flat-Rate method. For those who first became a member before March 1, 1990, or have their retired pay computed under specific codes, DFAS computes SBP withholdings under the Original or Flat-Rate formula. DFAS computes SBP withholdings based on retirement date and entitlement type. Premiums are withheld from retired pay for eligible spouse beneficiaries. Reductions in retired pay for SBP premiums are not taxable income. The \"paid-up\" provision stops retiree contributions when they reach age 70 and have participated in SBP for 360 months, effective October 1, 2008. Retiree's contribution to SBP cost is 2.5% of base retired pay plus 10% of the remaining base amount. The retiree's contribution to Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) cost is 2.5% of base retired pay plus 10% of the remaining base amount. For example, a retiree with a monthly base amount of $1,616 would have $101 deducted to provide a survivor benefit of $888 per month to their spouse. If the retiree receives more than $1,616 in total retired pay but elects to use $1,616 as the base amount, the costs and benefits remain the same. The computation of Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) withholdings is based on a formula that deducts 6.5% of the base amount of retired pay. The FY2017 NDAA established a new Blended Retirement System (BRS) for military personnel. The FY2017 NDAA introduced the Blended Retirement System (BRS) for military members, allowing a lump sum payment of 25% or 50% of retired pay upon retirement. Participants in SBP who choose the lump sum will have coverage at the full base amount, equal to their unreduced monthly retired pay. Members who elect lump sums under BRS will receive equivalent annuities as if they had not taken the lump sum. Premiums are deducted from the remaining retired pay after the lump sum payment. For example, a retiree with a $1,616 monthly pay and a $101 SBP premium would receive a $707 monthly annuity after a 50% lump sum. The spouse survivor would still receive a $889 monthly annuity. The SBP program offers a monthly annuity for retirees, but taking a lump sum may reduce participation. SBP elections are generally irrevocable, but there are exceptions for termination, such as between the 25th and 36th month of retirement with spouse agreement, VA rating of total disability, mental incompetence reversal, divorce from beneficiary, or eligibility changes due to marriage or children. Limited open enrollment periods, known as open seasons, may occur in rare cases. During limited open enrollment periods, participants in the SBP may need to pay a buy-in equal to all premium payments since retirement, which can be costly. There are six types of beneficiary coverage available, including spouse only, spouse and child(ren), child(ren) only, persons with an insurable interest, former spouse, and former spouse and child(ren). To be eligible for spouse only coverage, the beneficiary must have been married to the retiree at the time of retirement for at least one year. At the time of retirement, eligibility for spouse-only coverage in the SBP requires being married to the retiree for at least one year. Withholding for this coverage is calculated using specific formulas. A surviving spouse may lose SBP benefits if they remarry before reaching certain ages, depending on the date of remarriage. The SBP benefits can be reinstated if a second marriage ends due to death, annulment, or divorce. The surviving spouse of multiple military retirees can choose the more financially advantageous benefit. SBP benefits are first paid to the surviving spouse, and if the spouse is no longer eligible, benefits are then paid to designated child(ren) in equal shares. The SBP benefits for children are paid in equal shares as long as they remain eligible. The cost is determined based on the age of the retiree, spouse, and youngest child. A child becomes ineligible at age 18 (or 22 if a full-time student) or upon marriage. Incapacitated children may still be eligible. An eligible child who is incapacitated can continue to receive SBP benefits if the condition existed before turning 18. SBP benefits are paid directly to surviving children of a deceased military retiree under child(ren)-only coverage. The cost of this coverage is based on an actuarial basis and can be modified. The SBP survivor benefit for a surviving child can be provided through child-only coverage until age 18 or 22. Insurable interest coverage is available if there is no spouse or dependent child, allowing relatives or nonrelatives with an insurable interest to be beneficiaries. Insurable interest coverage must be elected at the maximum level and costs 10% of the base amount of military retired pay. Insurable interest coverage for military retired pay costs 10% of the base amount plus 5% for each full five years the beneficiary is younger. The total cost cannot exceed 40% of total retired pay. Coverage can be voluntarily discontinued, except for former spouses. Retirees can rejoin SBP under a different beneficiary category if coverage is discontinued. A military member may provide SBP coverage for a former spouse, depending on the divorce date. Before November 14, 1986, no court could order SBP protection for a former spouse. Retirees can switch to former spouse coverage within one year of divorce if it occurred before November 14, 1986. After this date, a court may order SBP coverage for a former spouse. After November 14, 1986, a court may order a member or retiree to provide SBP protection as part of a divorce. The FY1987 DOD Authorization Act allows courts to require a person to elect to provide an annuity to a former spouse. Military retirees and former spouses covered under the insurable interest category can elect to switch to spouse coverage within one year. Former spouse coverage can be elected after March 1, 1986, with costs and benefits calculated similarly to spouse coverage. However, choosing former spouse coverage may prevent SBP protection for a second or future spouse. It is unclear if courts can divide SBP benefits between a former spouse and a current or subsequent spouse. The FY2000 National Defense Authorization Act allows for the effectuation of intended SBP annuity for a former spouse in cases where the retiree dies within 21 days of agreeing to provide SBP coverage. Former spouse and child(ren) coverage under SBP became available on March 1, 1986, with the same terms as spouse and child(ren) coverage. Members of the reserves and National Guard can elect to provide SBP protection for their survivors. The Reserve Component SBP (RC-SBP) differs from active duty SBP due to age restrictions on receiving retired pay. Prior to 1978, Reserve Component personnel could not provide survivor protection until age 60. In 2008, Congress allowed reservists on extended active duty to start receiving retired pay at a reduced age of no less than 50. Legislation passed in 1978 allows Reserve Component members to decide on RC-SBP participation before age 60. Retirement-eligible members can choose from three SBP options within 90 days of notification. Option A allows retirees to decline SBP protection, with no benefit if they die before receiving retired pay. Option A allows retirees to decline SBP protection, with no benefit if they die before receiving retired pay. Option B and C offer RC-SBP coverage with survivor payments starting either upon the retiree's death or immediately after, shared costs between the retiree, government, and beneficiary. The RC-SBP benefit allows for deductions in retired pay to provide coverage for eligible surviving spouses, dependent children, or former spouses of Reserve Component members. The add-on premium is paid through a reduction in the annuity, with costs depending on coverage type, age of the retiree, and selected beneficiary(ies). Legislation has expanded the coverage of the RC-SBP, providing a benefit equal to 55% of retired pay for eligible survivors of deceased active duty members. This benefit is payable to eligible spouses, dependent children, former spouses, or a combination of former spouses and dependent children. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) provides coverage to survivors of individuals who die while on active duty, including those who are not retirement-eligible. Benefits can also be paid to surviving children. In FY2017, there were 10,295 survivors receiving SBP benefits, with 6,918 being surviving children. Congress has made changes to the effective dates of these benefits over the years. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) was integrated into the federal benefits system in 1972 to provide full or supplemental survivor coverage for servicemembers' families. It ensures support when Social Security or VA benefits are insufficient, with adjustments made if the survivor receives VA Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC). The SBP-DIC offset reduces the SBP benefit to match the DIC benefit for surviving spouses. If the DIC benefit is equal to or greater than the SBP benefit, only the DIC benefit is paid. Surviving spouses subject to the offset receive a refund of the deceased retiree's SBP premiums. Children designated as the SBP recipient do not have a DIC offset. Younger surviving spouses of active duty personnel can designate their children as the SBP recipient. Unmarried children remain eligible for SBP until age 18 or 22 if a student, or for life. Eligibility for SBP continues until age 18 or 22 (if a student) or for life if incapacitated before age 18. Marriage terminates eligibility. DIC and offset-SBP payments must equal full SBP benefit. Refunds of deceased retiree's SBP contributions are given if DIC is paid. Remarriage results in loss of DIC but restoration of full SBP benefit. The remarried spouse or former spouse can have their full SBP benefit restored if they remarry after age 55, following SBP restrictions. SBP payments can also be restored if the beneficiary becomes ineligible for DIC but remains eligible for SBP, with refunded SBP premiums returned to the government. A 2009 court decision allows surviving spouses who remarry after age 57 to receive full SBP and DIC benefits without an offset, as long as refunded SBP premiums are returned. Un-remarried surviving spouses receiving SBP and DIC have their SBP payments reduced by the amount of DIC, but the Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance (SSIA) was created in 2009 to offset this reduction with an additional $50 per month. The Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance (SSIA) was initially set to increase by $10 each year until reaching $100 in 2014, with a sunset in 2016. However, it was made more generous during the 111th Congress, increasing to $310 by 2017 and permanently authorized in 2018. The SSIA benefit is adjusted to the COLA each year, cannot exceed the SBP offset, and is taxable. Supporters of a full repeal of the SBP-DIC offset argue that the benefits are different types of compensation. The SBP is a purchased annuities benefit for surviving spouses, while DIC is an indemnity payment received from the VA. Advocates believe that surviving spouses should be entitled to receive both SBP and DIC concurrently to avoid financial hardship. Repealing the SBP-DIC offset is a contentious issue. Some argue that receiving both benefits creates financial hardship, while others believe it is unfair to taxpayers. The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC) is examining this issue. The MCRMC recommended a new SBP option where members fully fund the costs to eliminate the SBP-DIC offset. The House version of the FY2019 NDAA aimed to address the issue of survivor benefit plan payments and dependency and indemnity compensation. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that eliminating the survivor benefit plan offset would cost $7 billion over the 2010-2019 period."
