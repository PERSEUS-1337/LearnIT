    "content": "The 2012 NDAA detainee provisions aimed to confirm or expand the President's detention authority post-9/11. The AUMF authorized the use of force against those involved in the attacks to prevent future terrorism. Many captured individuals were placed in preventive detention to halt their involvement in hostilities or terrorism. In the 2004 case of Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, the Supreme Court recognized the President's authority to detain enemy combatants captured while fighting U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Subsequent judicial activity on U.S. detention policy has mainly occurred in the D.C. Circuit. The D.C. Circuit has considered habeas petitions by Guantanamo detainees challenging their detention under the AUMF. Court rulings have generally favored the government's position on detention authority. The Supreme Court may review these rulings in the future. Congress has not passed legislation to clarify detention authority under the AUMF. The D.C. Circuit has looked to post-AUMF legislation for guidance on military commissions' jurisdiction. In 2010, the circuit court concluded that the government had authority under the AUMF to detain persons associated with Al Qaeda or the Taliban, including those who support them in hostilities. Most detainees were picked up during military operations in Afghanistan or abroad and held at Guantanamo Bay or other locations for interrogation. The United States held detainees at Guantanamo Bay and other locations for interrogation. A larger number of detainees were held at a facility in Parwan, Afghanistan, with plans to transfer control to the Afghan government. Disagreements between Afghan and U.S. authorities delayed the transfer, but Afghan prisoners were eventually handed over in March 2013. Non-Afghan detainees remained in U.S. custody for some time, with the Department of Defense announcing in December 2014 that all remaining detainees had been dealt with. In December 2014, the Department of Defense announced that all remaining detainees in U.S. custody had been transferred to foreign custody, and that it no longer operates detention facilities in Afghanistan. Persons suspected of terrorist activity on behalf of Al Qaeda are usually prosecuted in federal court instead of being placed in military detention. The detainees, labeled as \"enemy combatants,\" were transferred back to civil authorities and tried in federal court after being initially arrested for alleged terrorist activities. There has been controversy over the appropriate method for handling suspected terrorists in U.S. custody. Some argue that suspected terrorists should be held in military custody and tried before a military commission, while others believe they should be transferred to civilian law enforcement for trial in an Article III court. There is disagreement over the best approach, with some advocating for executive discretion in handling each case individually. This debate has arisen in high-profile cases, including the Obama Administration's plans to transfer Guantanamo detainees to the United States. Congress passed funding restrictions in 2011 that prevented the transfer of Guantanamo detainees, like Khalid Sheik Mohammed, to the US for trial in civilian courts. This restriction has been extended through subsequent legislation, making military commissions the only viable option for prosecuting these detainees. Other cases of terrorist suspects apprehended by US authorities have also garnered attention. Some high-profile cases of terrorist suspects apprehended by US authorities have sparked controversy over whether they should be held in military or civilian custody. Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, a Somali national, was brought to the US to face terrorism charges in a civilian court after being detained on a naval vessel for interrogation. Similar debates arose over the arrests of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab and Faisal Shahzad, with some arguing they should have been held by military authorities. Additionally, criticism was directed at the Administration for bringing civilian charges against Iraqi refugees suspected of insurgent activities against US military forces. The decision to bring criminal charges against former Al Qaeda spokesman Sulaiman Abu Ghayth in civilian court rather than transferring him to military custody at Guantanamo was criticized. The capture of alleged Benghazi ringleader Ahmed Abu Khattalah has led to calls for interrogation at Guantanamo and possible prosecution by military commission. Issues may arise regarding the application of detainee provisions to US operations against the Islamic State. The Obama Administration relies on the 2001 AUMF for military action against the Islamic State, considering it a successor to Al Qaeda. The US has not detained many Islamic State members, but if they are captured, the AUMF's application would need to be assessed. Current practice involves holding IS fighters briefly before transferring them to Iraqi or Kurdish authorities. The Obama Administration relies on the 2001 AUMF for military action against the Islamic State in Iraq, transferring detainees to Iraqi or Kurdish authorities instead of Guantanamo. The current status of U.S. policies and legal authorities regarding detainee matters is discussed, including detention authority under the AUMF and practices for initial status determinations and periodic reviews of detainee cases. Recidivism concerns influence restrictions on transferring detainees from Guantanamo. The 2012 NDAA aims to clarify detention authority for persons captured in conflict with Al Qaeda, but its scope is open to interpretation. Section 1021 seeks to codify existing law on the President's detention authority under the AUMF, without limiting or expanding it. The Obama Administration's stance on detention authority under the AUMF was outlined in a 2009 court brief. The 2012 NDAA clarifies detention authority for persons involved in terrorist attacks like 9/11. It includes detaining those who supported Taliban or Al Qaeda forces. Questions arise over the broad category of \"associated forces\" and the definition of \"substantial support.\" The Supreme Court's interpretation in Hamdi is relevant to understanding the AUMF's detention authority. The Supreme Court in Hamdi interpreted the detention authority under the AUMF with reference to law of war principles. There is a dispute over indefinite detention based on providing support to a belligerent force. The government's 2009 brief did not clarify the nature of \"substantial support\" or \"associated forces\" for detention. The Obama Administration's scope of detention authority is similar to the Bush Administration's, requiring \"substantial support\" instead of just \"support.\" The Supreme Court in Hamdi interpreted the detention authority under the AUMF with reference to law of war principles. Court decisions have not clarified the \"substantial support\" prong for detention eligibility, with cases relying on proof of detainee involvement with Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces. The executive branch has included \"associated forces\" in its detention authority scope since 2004. Lower courts are tasked with defining the full parameters of detention. The Supreme Court in Hamdi interpreted the detention authority under the AUMF with reference to law of war principles. The Court did not mention \"associated forces\" in its opinion, leaving lower courts to define the full parameters of detention authority. The government explained in 2009 that the AUMF covers organizations beyond just al-Qaida or the Taliban, allowing for the detention of individuals involved in groups that supported them in Afghanistan. This authority is consistent with principles of co-belligerency in traditional international armed conflicts. In Parhat v. Gates, the D.C. Circuit rejected the government's argument that affiliation with ETIM made a petitioner an \"enemy combatant.\" The court defined membership in an \"associated force\" as supporting forces associated with al Qaida or the Taliban engaged in hostilities against the U.S. The court found the government's evidence lacking and did not reach a conclusion on the petitioner's affiliation. The government defined \"associated force\" as being closely linked to al Qaida or the Taliban. The court in Parhat v. Gates rejected the government's argument that affiliation with ETIM constitutes being an \"enemy combatant.\" The court defined membership in an \"associated force\" as supporting forces linked to al Qaida or the Taliban in hostilities against the U.S. The evidence presented by the government did not establish a sufficient connection between ETIM and Al Qaeda to be considered an \"associated force.\" In habeas cases, the term \"associated forces\" has been interpreted to cover armed groups assisting the Taliban or Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. For example, membership in groups like \"Zubayda's militia\" or Hezb\u2013i\u2013Islami Gulbuddin (HIG) has been considered an \"associated force\" under the AUMF. The D.C. Circuit affirmed the detention of individuals associated with these groups. The D.C. Circuit affirmed the detention of a person engaged as a cook for the 55th Arab Military Brigade, an armed force defending the Taliban. The 2012 NDAA may broaden the interpretation of \"associated forces\" for detention authority. Uncertainty remains on applying AUMF to persons captured outside Afghanistan, especially U.S. citizens or those with ties to the U.S. The AUMF permits detention of individuals with ties to the U.S., including U.S. citizens. The D.C. Circuit has ruled that the AUMF authorizes detention of individuals linked to Al Qaeda. The Fourth Circuit upheld military detention of a U.S. citizen and a lawful alien captured in the U.S. as enemy combatants. The AUMF allows for the detention of individuals connected to the U.S., including U.S. citizens. The Fourth Circuit upheld the military detention of a U.S. citizen and a lawful alien captured in the U.S. as enemy combatants. The detainee was transferred to civilian law enforcement custody for criminal prosecution before the Supreme Court could review the case. The legality of detaining a U.S. citizen or person captured in the U.S. under the AUMF remains uncertain. The 2012 NDAA and subsequent defense spending laws have not changed this legal status. The Pentagon established Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs) in response to Supreme Court decisions in 2004 regarding \"enemy combatants\" at Guantanamo. Detainees at Guantanamo are subject to detention based on enemy belligerency status. Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs) determine POW status for Guantanamo detainees. CSRTs confirmed 539 enemy combatants between 2004 and 2009. The process has been largely inactive since 2007 due to fewer detainees. Any new detainees at Guantanamo would likely go through a CSRT. The process is only used for Guantanamo detainees. Non-citizen detainees at Guantanamo have more procedural rights compared to those held in Afghanistan. While Guantanamo detainees can challenge their detention in federal court, non-citizen detainees in Afghanistan do not have the same privilege. President Obama created task forces to study Guantanamo detention and U.S. detention policy. Military commission and administrative review boards at Guantanamo were put on hold during these studies. The Obama Administration implemented a new review system for detainees at Bagram Theater Internment Facility in Afghanistan. President Obama issued Executive Order 13567 in 2011 for periodic review of Guantanamo detainees' continued detention. The executive order establishes a Periodic Review Board (PRB) to assess the need for continued detention of individuals not facing formal charges, with efforts made to find suitable transfer locations outside the US if release is deemed appropriate. An initial review must occur within a year, allowing detainees to challenge their detention. The executive order establishes a Periodic Review Board (PRB) to assess the need for continued detention of individuals not facing formal charges. The order requires a full review every three years and a file review every six months. The process is discretionary and does not create additional detention authority. The initial one-year review deadline was not met, with guidelines for implementation issued in 2012 and the first periodic review boards announced in 2013. As of January 9, 2014, the first Periodic Review Boards (PRB) were completed, with 31 initial determinations, four full reviews, and nine file reviews conducted. Concerns about released Guantanamo detainees engaging in terrorist activities have led to limits on transfers, requiring certification of preventive measures in the destination country. Post-release detainee activities remain classified, but some have been involved in terrorism post-release. The Pentagon reported that 30 former Guantanamo detainees engaged in militant activities or anti-U.S. propaganda after their release, sparking debate over the policy implications and fairness of long-term detention without trial. Researchers at Seton Hall University challenged these numbers, questioning the accuracy of the reported activities. The Pentagon reported that former Guantanamo detainees engaged in militant activities after release, sparking debate. Researchers challenged the accuracy of the reported activities, noting discrepancies in DOD data and lack of identifying information for verification. Some post-release terrorist conduct could be explained by radicalization during internment. Defense Intelligence Agency confirmed 36 ex-detainees returned to terrorism in 2008. In 2009, the Pentagon reported that 1 in 7 detainees transferred from Guantanamo engaged in terrorism or militant activity. Recent estimates by the executive branch show varying numbers. In December 2010, the Director of National Intelligence released a report on recidivism rates of former Guantanamo detainees, stating that 13.5% are confirmed and 11.5% are suspected of returning to terrorism. The report stated that 81 detainees (13.5%) were confirmed and 69 (11.5%) suspected of reengaging in terrorist activities post-transfer. Of the 150 recidivist detainees, 13 were deceased, 54 in custody, and 83 at large. Since Executive Order 13492, 66 detainees were transferred from Guantanamo, with 2 confirmed and 3 suspected of terrorist activities. In September 2011, Lt. Gen. James Clapper testified that 27% of former detainees engaged in terrorism post-release. In January 2012, the Intelligence Authorization Act of FY2012 was signed into law. In March 2012, the DNI released a summary stating that 15.9% of Guantanamo detainees transferred by the end of 2011 were confirmed to have reengaged in terrorist activities, while 12.0% were suspected. Since Executive Order 13492, 3 detainees were confirmed and 2 suspected of terrorist activities. The report does not consider anti-U.S. statements as evidence of reengagement. The latest DNI recidivism summary, released in March 2016, shows that out of 676 transferred or released Guantanamo detainees, 118 have been confirmed to reengage in terrorist activities (17.5%), while 86 are suspected of reengaging (12.7%). The accuracy of these numbers has been questioned, with some estimating the actual threat posed by released detainees to be closer to 6%. The DNI's recidivism summary from March 2016 shows that out of 676 transferred or released Guantanamo detainees, 118 have been confirmed to reengage in terrorist activities (17.5%), while 86 are suspected of reengaging (12.7%). Some question the accuracy of these numbers, estimating the actual threat posed by released detainees to be around 6%. The 2012 NDAA affirms the authority for the U.S. Armed Forces to detain \"covered persons\" pending disposition under the law of war. The 2012 NDAA affirms the authority for the U.S. Armed Forces to detain individuals involved in terrorist activities, including those who planned or supported the 9/11 attacks or are affiliated with al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces. Section 1021 allows for detention without trial, trial by military commission, transfer to another court, or transfer to a foreign country. The provision also allows for the possibility of adding other options. Section 1021 of the 2012 NDAA allows for detention without trial, trial by military commission, transfer to another court, or transfer to a foreign country. It does not clarify if U.S. citizens or lawful resident aliens may be considered \"covered persons.\" An amendment was adopted to ensure existing laws regarding detention of U.S. citizens and lawful resident aliens are not affected. The 2012 NDAA's Section 1021 allows for detention without trial, but it does not specify if U.S. citizens or lawful resident aliens may be considered \"covered persons.\" The provision does not expand or limit the President's authority to detain individuals captured in the United States, which has been a contentious issue without clear resolution in the courts. The Supreme Court has recognized the military detention of individuals captured while fighting U.S. forces in Afghanistan, but the rules for detaining individuals captured within the U.S. remain unclear. Section 1021 of the 2012 NDAA does not clarify the circumstances for preventive military detention of individuals captured in the U.S., leaving it up to the courts to interpret. The provision does not provide additional clarification on terms like \"substantial support\" or \"associated forces,\" potentially allowing for a broadening of detention scope. The 2012 NDAA's Section 1021 lacks clarity on preventive military detention in the U.S., leading to potential broadening of detention scope. The provision requires the Secretary of Defense to brief Congress on its application, including defining \"covered persons.\" The term \"lawful resident aliens\" is not defined, possibly referring to legal permanent residents. President Obama signed the 2012 NDAA into law, stating that it codifies established detention authorities under the AUMF. He clarified that he would not authorize indefinite military detention without trial for American citizens, regardless of the AUMF or the NDAA. Section 1022 of the 2012 NDAA requires military custody for certain Al Qaeda members and associated forces, excluding U.S. citizens but including lawful resident aliens. The President can waive this provision under certain circumstances. The 2012 NDAA requires military custody for certain Al Qaeda members and associated forces, excluding U.S. citizens but including lawful resident aliens. The President can waive this provision under certain circumstances by submitting a certification to Congress. The mandatory detention requirement applies to covered persons captured in hostilities authorized by the AUMF, defining them as individuals involved in planning or carrying out attacks against the United States or its coalition partners. The 2012 NDAA mandates military custody for certain Al Qaeda members and associated forces, excluding U.S. citizens but including lawful resident aliens involved in attacks against the United States or its coalition partners. Detainees can be held in military custody, tried before a military commission, transferred for trial by another court, or transferred to a foreign government. If prosecution in a civilian trial is desired, consultation with the National Director of Intelligence and the Secretary of Defense is required. The 2012 NDAA mandates military custody for certain Al Qaeda members and associated forces, excluding U.S. citizens but including lawful resident aliens involved in attacks against the United States or its coalition partners. Section 1022 applies to members of Al Qaeda and \"associated forces\" who act in coordination with or pursuant to the direction of Al Qaeda. The provision does not explicitly mention the Taliban, suggesting it may not be treated as an associated force unless its actions are sufficiently coordinated or directed by Al Qaeda. The question arises if an associated force acts independently but coordinates some activity with Al Qaeda, whether all members or only those involved in coordinating units would be subject to mandatory detention. Section 1022 of the 2012 NDAA mandates military custody for certain individuals involved in attacks against the United States or its coalition partners, excluding U.S. citizens but including lawful resident aliens. The provision applies to members of Al Qaeda and associated forces acting in coordination with or under the direction of Al Qaeda. The definition of what constitutes an \"attack\" is not clearly defined, leaving room for interpretation whether it includes acts against civilian targets. The application of the law of war to circumstances involving attacks against the United States is uncertain. The provision in the 2012 NDAA mandates military custody for individuals involved in such attacks, including lawful resident aliens. The definition of an \"attack\" is open to interpretation, with some suggesting it covers incidents like the attempted airliner bombing in 2009. Administration objections led to changes in the mandatory detention provision in Congress. In response to objections to the mandatory detention provision in the 2012 NDAA, a new requirement was added for the President to submit a report to Congress within 60 days of enactment. This report describes procedures for implementing the provision, including designating who is authorized to determine covered persons and preventing interruption of surveillance or intelligence gathering. The 2012 NDAA added a requirement for the President to submit a report to Congress within 60 days of enactment, detailing procedures for implementing the provision. This includes designating authorized persons to determine covered individuals and preventing the interruption of surveillance or intelligence gathering. The procedures apply to persons taken into custody on or after the 2012 NDAA's date of enactment. It is unclear how these procedures will interact with those under Section 1024, which requires DOD to submit procedures for status determinations for persons detained under the AUMF. The 2012 NDAA added procedures for determining covered individuals subject to mandatory military detention under the AUMF. It is unclear if multiple processes or a single procedure will be used to make these determinations. The 2012 NDAA added procedures for determining covered individuals subject to mandatory military detention under the AUMF. Section 1022 allows for the appropriate disposition under the law of war, potentially avoiding the need to transfer a person to military custody. The process for making these determinations would likely involve constitutional due process requirements and could be challenged through habeas corpus. The Obama Administration opposed this provision, arguing it restricted the President's authority to defend the nation from terrorist threats. The 2012 NDAA added procedures for determining covered individuals subject to mandatory military detention under the AUMF. Section 1022 allows for appropriate disposition under the law of war, potentially avoiding the need to transfer a person to military custody. The Obama Administration opposed this provision, arguing it restricted the President's authority to defend the nation from terrorist threats. However, a new proviso was added in conference, reducing Administration concerns and averting a veto. Section 1022, as emerged from conference, clarifies that it does not affect the existing criminal enforcement and national security authorities of the FBI or any other domestic law enforcement agency regarding a covered person held in military custody. FBI Director Robert Mueller expressed concern about potential confusion, but the White House issued a statement explaining the revised provision. The White House issued a statement regarding the 2012 NDAA, expressing concerns about potential negative impacts on counterterrorism efforts. President Obama disapproved of Section 1022, stating it did not enhance national security. The statement warned of corrective action if problems arise. President Obama disapproved of Section 1022 in the 2012 NDAA, stating it did not enhance national security. He signed the bill with the understanding that it provides broad authority to the executive branch to determine the best way to implement it, including the ability to waive military custody requirements in certain cases for national security interests. President Obama issued a directive on February 28, 2012, regarding the implementation of Section 1022 in the 2012 NDAA. This directive allows for the waiver of mandatory detention requirements in certain circumstances to maintain flexibility and protect national security interests. The 2012 NDAA directive waives mandatory detention requirements and clarifies procedures for detention reviews at Guantanamo under Executive Order 13567. Section 1023 requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report on review panel procedures within 180 days of enactment. The 2012 NDAA directive clarifies procedures for detention reviews at Guantanamo, emphasizing that reviews are to determine ongoing threat to U.S. security, with final release decisions resting with the Secretary of Defense. Factors considered include likelihood of terrorist activity, rehabilitation support, potential trial by military commission, and law enforcement interest. Administration objected to Defense Department assuming responsibility. The 2012 NDAA directive clarifies procedures for detention reviews at Guantanamo, emphasizing the shift of responsibility to the Defense Department. The review process does not create legal proceedings or discovery rights for detainees or their representatives. Mitigating information provided to detainees is compiled in good faith without creating rights on their behalf. President Obama criticized the 2012 NDAA provision for interfering with detainee status reviews. Section 1024 requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to congressional committees within 90 days of enactment. Private counsel's access to classified information is subject to national security constraints. The 2012 NDAA provision requires the Secretary of Defense to report to congressional committees on detainee status reviews. Procedures for determining the status of detained persons under the AUMF for Section 1021 are unclear. Military judges preside over status determination proceedings for unprivileged enemy belligerents. Military counsel representation is allowed for the belligerents. The 2012 NDAA provision mandates the Secretary of Defense to report on detainee status reviews. Procedures for determining detainee status under the AUMF for Section 1021 are unclear. Military judges oversee status determination proceedings for unprivileged enemy belligerents, with military counsel allowed for representation. The impact of this provision on Guantanamo detainees remains uncertain. The 2012 NDAA provision requires the Secretary of Defense to report on detainee status reviews, but procedures for determining detainee status under the AUMF for Section 1021 are unclear. The provision raises questions about how to determine detainee status for new captures and those designated for long-term detention. The 2012 NDAA provision raises questions about determining detainee status for new captures and those designated for long-term detention. Long-term procedures may be triggered by subsequent reviews at the discretion of the Secretary of Defense, with limited rights for long-term detainees in certain circumstances. The provision excludes captured unprivileged enemy belligerents destined for trial or transfer from military counsel representation or military judge presiding over status determination proceedings, leading to disapproval from the White House. The 2012 NDAA provision, particularly Section 1024, faced disapproval from the White House due to concerns about detainee status determination procedures conflicting with established military protocols. President Obama emphasized the broad discretion granted to the Secretary of Defense in interpreting the provision. Additionally, Section 1025 required the submission of a national security protocol for Guantanamo detainees, originating from the House bill's Section 1035. The 2012 NDAA required a national security protocol for Guantanamo detainees, covering various aspects like legal representation, communications, and enforcement measures. President Obama expressed concerns about detainee status determination procedures conflicting with military protocols. The 2012 NDAA included provisions restricting the transfer or release of Guantanamo detainees into the United States, prohibiting the use of funds for constructing facilities for detainment. Similar restrictions were also present in subsequent legislation. Section 1027 of the House bill restricts the transfer of detainees from Guantanamo into the United States. This restriction is part of ongoing efforts by Congress to limit executive discretion in transferring or releasing Guantanamo detainees into the country. The 2012 Minibus and 2012 CAA funding limitations prohibited transferring Guantanamo detainees to the US for prosecution. Restrictions were extended until 2016, favoring military commissions over civilian courts for detainee trials. The Obama Administration opposed a provision in H.R. 1540 that barred transferring detainees into the United States, citing interference with executive discretion in prosecuting detainees. The White House argued that the restriction on detainee transfers would challenge Executive branch authority and undermine counterterrorism efforts. The Obama Administration opposed a provision in H.R. 1540 that restricted transferring detainees into the United States, citing interference with executive discretion in prosecuting detainees. President Obama signed the 2012 NDAA but expressed concerns about a provision that could violate separation of powers principles. Section 1027 of the 2012 NDAA raised concerns about violating the separation of powers principle, but the Administration planned to interpret it to avoid conflicts. Section 1028 limited funds for transferring Guantanamo detainees, except in cases where a court order required release. These restrictions were similar to those in the 2012 CAA and remained in effect until the end of the fiscal year. Restrictions on Guantanamo detainee transfers were set by various legislative acts, including the 2011 NDAA and the 2013 CAR. Congressional concerns about recidivism led to these restrictions, with supporters arguing they reduce the risk of detainees engaging in terrorist activities post-release. After the 2011 NDAA and CAA went into effect, detainee transfers became less frequent. The Secretary of Defense had to certify to Congress before any transfer, ensuring the destination country was not a state sponsor of terrorism and could control the detainee. The 2011 NDAA and CAA set certification requirements for detainee transfers to ensure the receiving country can control the detainee and prevent future threats. Section 1028 prohibited transfers to countries with confirmed cases of detainee recidivism. The House provision for U.S. access to transferred individuals was not included in the final report. The 2011 NDAA and CAA set certification requirements for detainee transfers to prevent future threats. Section 1028 prohibited transfers to countries with confirmed cases of detainee recidivism, with exceptions for pretrial agreements or court orders. Certification requirements could be waived by the Secretary of Defense under certain conditions. The 2011 NDAA and CAA set certification requirements for detainee transfers to prevent future threats. Section 1028 prohibited transfers to countries with confirmed cases of detainee recidivism, with exceptions for pretrial agreements or court orders. The Secretary of Defense could issue a waiver for the provision barring transfers if alternative actions would mitigate the risk. Transfers had to be determined to be in the national security interests of the United States, with required notifications to congressional defense committees. The 2011 NDAA and CAA set certification requirements for detainee transfers to prevent future threats, prohibiting transfers to countries with confirmed cases of detainee recidivism. The scope of the term \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" was broad enough to cover foreign refugees brought to the Migrant Operations Center at Guantanamo. The requirements also applied to persons subject to mandatory detention under Section 1022, but not to all \"covered persons\" within the meaning of Section 1021. The White House and DOD expressed disapproval of the transfer certification during congressional deliberations over the House and Senate bills competing to become the 2012 NDAA. President Obama expressed disapproval of the transfer certification requirements in the 2012 NDAA, stating that they hinder the executive branch's authority to transfer detainees to foreign countries and could violate constitutional separation of powers principles. The executive branch needs flexibility to negotiate detainee transfers swiftly with foreign countries. If the statutory restrictions in sections 1027 and 1028 conflict with constitutional principles, the Administration will act accordingly. The 2012 NDAA transfer certification requirements were criticized by President Obama for hindering the executive branch's authority and potentially violating constitutional separation of powers principles. The 2014 NDAA somewhat relaxed detainee transfer restrictions, but they were reinstated in modified form by the 2016 NDAA. Section 1029 requires consultation among key officials before initiating prosecution in certain cases, originally applying to non-citizens tried by military commission. The 2016 NDAA requires consultation among key officials before initiating prosecution in certain cases, involving a discussion on where the prosecution should take place and whether the individual should be transferred into military custody for intelligence interviews. The White House opposed this provision, citing existing interagency coordination in terrorism-related prosecutions. President Obama signed the 2012 NDAA into law, expressing concerns that Section 1029 could interfere with the Department of Justice's authority in criminal prosecutions and hinder operational flexibility in counterterrorism efforts. The provision may cause delays in apprehending individuals posing imminent threats to national security. The administration aims to interpret and implement Section 1029 to maintain operational flexibility and limit disruptions in security measures. Section 1030 of the Military Commissions Act of 2009 is amended to allow guilty pleas in capital cases before military commissions with unanimous approval from panel members. This addresses concerns about delays in investigations and ensures the independence of the Department of Justice. Section 1033 also allows for pre-trial agreements in military commission cases. Section 1033 of the Military Commissions Act amends pre-trial agreements to allow for a reduction in the maximum sentence but not the imposition of a death sentence by a military judge alone. Section 1034 includes technical amendments clarifying the right to representation by counsel and the composition of the Court of Military Commission Review. The review authority of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit is limited to specific determinations. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has limited review authority over matters of law related to military commission judgments. Changes have been made to clarify the deadline for seeking review, and guidelines have been published for the periodic review process for Guantanamo detainees. Periodic review board proceedings have begun for 71 detainees. The Executive has started periodic review board proceedings for Guantanamo detainees and submitted a report to congressional committees on the status determination process. Restrictions on detainee transfers have hindered executive efforts, but after Congress relaxed the transfer restriction in the 2014 NDAA, the Administration increased the pace of transfers. Prior to the 2012 NDAA, transferring suspected terrorists from civilian to military custody was rare. Section 1022 of the act requires foreign members of Al Qaeda or associated forces to be transferred temporarily. The 2012 NDAA includes Section 1022, which mandates the temporary transfer of foreign members of Al Qaeda or associated forces to military custody. President Obama opposed this provision but stated that it would be implemented in a flexible manner. Section 1021 of the NDAA allows for detention without trial, drawing criticism for potentially targeting U.S. citizens. The 2012 NDAA includes Section 1022, which mandates the temporary transfer of foreign members of Al Qaeda or associated forces to military custody. A federal judge initially enjoined the detention of persons based on support for belligerent parties, but the injunction was reversed on appeal. The White House issued a directive on February 28, 2012, waiving the mandatory military detention requirement for certain categories of persons and reaffirming the FBI's lead role in investigating terrorist acts within the United States. The directive under the 2012 NDAA waives military transfer requirements for certain individuals in U.S. custody, including green-card holders arrested for conduct in the U.S., those arrested on non-terrorism charges by federal agencies, and individuals transferred from state or local to federal custody. This waiver aims to avoid hindering counterterrorism cooperation with foreign countries. The waivers under the 2012 NDAA allow for exceptions to transferring individuals to military custody in certain cases, such as when cooperation or prosecution efforts would be hindered. These waivers cover various categories of individuals, including legal permanent residents arrested for domestic activities and those originally in state or local custody. The directive establishes procedures for determining whether a person must be transferred to military detention as a \"covered person\" under Section 1022, which requires detention of non-citizens involved in Al Qaeda or associated forces. The procedures do not apply when a suspect is initially taken into custody by DOD. The directive outlines procedures for determining if an individual should be transferred to military custody as a \"covered person\" under Section 1022. It requires a multi-level review process before transfer, and the Attorney General must be notified if there is probable cause to believe the individual is a \"covered person.\" The directive outlines procedures for determining if an individual should be transferred to military custody as a \"covered person\" under Section 1022. If probable cause exists and no waiver applies, the Attorney General, in coordination with senior national security officials, reviews to confirm the individual falls under Section 1022. If clear and convincing evidence is found, the person may be deemed a \"covered individual\" with the concurrence of key officials. The directive delegates authority to the Attorney General to waive Section 1022 on a case-by-case basis, considering factors like legal strength of charges and impact on intelligence collection. Waivers must be in the national security interest of the United States and can be issued without a final determination of a \"covered person\" under Section 1022. The directive specifies that in cases where a person is determined to be covered by Section 1022, the transfer to military custody may not be immediate. The federal law enforcement agency must consult with the Attorney General and Secretary of Defense to ensure the transfer does not interrupt an interrogation or compromise national security. Covered persons arrested in the United States cannot be transferred to custody without proper considerations. The 2012 NDAA specifies that individuals covered by Section 1022 must be transferred to military custody unless the FBI determines it would not disrupt ongoing interrogation, compromise national security, or interrupt surveillance. The President can waive the military transfer requirement if it is in the national security interests of the United States. Some have questioned the validity of the waivers issued under this directive. Observers have questioned the consistency of waivers issued under the directive with statutory requirements. Legal challenges to waivers may face procedural barriers, making judicial resolution unlikely. Congressional action may be necessary if disagreement with the President's implementation of Section 1022 arises. The directive clarifies that it does not create enforceable rights against the United States and addresses the issue of mandatory military detention under the 2001 AUMF. The House and Senate versions of the 2013 NDAA addressed detainee transfers and restrictions, with the Obama Administration threatening to veto both bills. The bills also tackled the issue of detention of U.S. persons within the country in different ways. The 2013 NDAA was approved by the House and Senate after resolving differences in a conference, with detainee measures largely adopted from the House version. It became law on January 2, 2013. The act included provisions on wartime detention and military trials for foreign terrorist suspects. The 2013 NDAA extends provisions from the 2012 NDAA regarding Guantanamo detainees, including funding restrictions on transfers and construction of facilities in the US. The 2013 NDAA includes provisions on certification requirements for transferring Guantanamo detainees, restrictions on detainee travel to certain territories, and reporting on recidivism rates for former detainees in Afghanistan.

The 2013 NDAA includes provisions on recidivism rates for former detainees in Afghanistan and reporting on the use of naval vessels for detainment under the AUMF. Despite assurances, the detention authorization in the 2012 NDAA continues to draw criticism, with a Senate measure clarifying that authorizations to use force should not permit detention of U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents in the United States unless expressly authorized by Congress. An amendment to remove military detention as an option for persons in the U.S. failed to pass. Section 1029 of the 2013 NDAA clarifies habeas corpus rights for persons inside the United States, ensuring access to Constitutional rights in court. The provision also requires the President to notify Congress within 48 hours of detaining such individuals. The 2013 NDAA clarifies habeas corpus rights for persons in the United States, ensuring access to court within 30 days of military custody. Ambiguity remains on who can be lawfully detained, but access to habeas corpus is guaranteed. The House passed H.R. 1960 for FY2014. The House and Senate committees reached an agreement on the Defense Authorization Act for FY2014, H.R. 3304, resolving differences on Guantanamo detainee transfers. H.R. 1960 limited transfers, while S. 1197 allowed for transfers to foreign countries and detention in the US. The 2014 NDAA, H.R. 3304, extended the ban on transferring Guantanamo detainees to the US until the end of 2014.

The Secretary of Defense must consider various factors before transferring a detainee, with a 30-day advance notice requirement to the relevant congressional committee. The 2014 NDAA required the Executive to report on Yemen's capability to detain, rehabilitate, or prosecute detainees, without statutorily barring transfers to Yemen. It also mandated information on detainees deemed a threat at the Parwan detention facility in Afghanistan. The 2014 NDAA clarified procedures for military commissions and required the chief defense counsel to have the same rank as the chief prosecutor, with the option for waivers in certain circumstances. It also instructed DOD to issue guidance for resource allocation in prosecutions. The 2014 NDAA clarified procedures for military commissions and required equal rank for chief defense counsel and chief prosecutor. DOD to issue guidance for resource allocation in prosecutions, including support for prosecution and defense in military commission proceedings. Provision in the initial House-passed bill allowed U.S. citizens apprehended in the U.S. to seek habeas relief, with the government having the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the citizen is an unprivileged enemy belligerent. The evidentiary standard for detention is higher than that applied to Guantanamo cases. Congress considered U.S. wartime detention policy in relation to Al Qaeda in the 2015 NDAA. The provision for U.S. citizens to seek habeas relief was not included in the final enactment. The 2015 NDAA, H.R. 4435, extended limitations on transferring Guantanamo detainees to the US through 2015. The Senate version, S. 2410, would have allowed more transfers to the US and banned transfers to Yemen in 2015. A compromise version, H.R. 3979, was enacted into law.

The Executive did not comply with notification requirements when transferring five Taliban detainees to Qatar as part of a prisoner exchange for U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl. In the 2014 NDAA, Section 1035 required notification to Congress 30 days before a detainee transfer, but the Executive argued it did not apply to the exchange to rescue a soldier. The 2015 NDAA did not change these requirements, leaving open the possibility that prior congressional notification may not always be required for Guantanamo detainee transfers. The House passed the 2016 NDAA, H.R. 1735, without easing transfer restrictions. The House voted to tighten restrictions on detainee transfers, adding new elements to reports on detainee recidivism and limiting expenditures by the Office of the Secretary of Defense until certain documents were received. The bill also prohibited detainee transfers to Yemen for two years and to combat zones for tax exemption purposes. The Administration opposed these provisions and threatened a presidential veto. The Senate Armed Services Committee reported favorably on its version of the 2016 NDAA.

The final bill included a comprehensive plan for Guantanamo detainees and future law of war detainees. The House's demand for documents on the Bergdahl-Taliban Five swap was resolved with the DOD. The anti-torture amendment was retained as a limitation on interrogation techniques. President Obama vetoed the bill. President Obama vetoed H.R. 1735 due to the use of Overseas Contingency Operations funding to bypass sequestration requirements and objected to Guantanamo detainee provisions.

Other agencies must adopt similar procedures. Exemptions include FBI, DHS, and federal law enforcement. Review and update of the manual is mandated by the Secretary of Defense in consultation with other key officials. The Army Field Manual is being reviewed and updated to comply with U.S. legal obligations and exclude the use of force.

Section 1045(b) requires notifying the ICRC about detainees in armed conflicts and providing access to them. President Obama announced the release of the Department of Defense plan to close the Guantanamo Bay prison facility, which includes procedures for transferring detainees and relocating certain detainees to a secure detention facility in the United States. The plan does not specify a location within the U.S. for housing detainees but mentions 13 possible sites. The plan to close the Guantanamo Bay prison facility includes identifying transfer opportunities for detainees, reviewing the threat posed by detainees not eligible for transfer or facing charges, and continuing military commissions. It predicts cost savings of $140-180 million over FY2015 operating costs. The plan to close the Guantanamo Bay prison facility involves identifying transfer opportunities for detainees, reviewing the threat posed by detainees not eligible for transfer or facing charges, and continuing military commissions. A \"limited number\" of detainees may not be suitable for transfer or prosecution, and the Administration hopes to persuade Congress to permit their continued detention within the continental United States. Out of the 91 detainees remaining, 35 are eligible for transfer, with 29 being Yemeni nationals. The plan to close the Guantanamo Bay prison facility involves identifying transfer opportunities for detainees, reviewing the threat posed by detainees not eligible for transfer or facing charges, and continuing military commissions. 7 non-eligible detainees are in the pretrial phase; 2 have pleaded guilty and await sentencing; 22 others may be prosecuted. 30-60 detainees may require continued detention under the AUMF. Some Members criticize the lack of a specific location in the US for detainee transfer. The executive branch avoided assessing this due to legal concerns. The Administration recognizes the plan to close Guantanamo Bay requires action by Congress. Some are urging the executive branch to explicitly disavow any intention to violate statutory prohibitions. The Senate Armed Services Committee is expected to hold hearings on the plan."
