    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Revitalizing the Economy of Fisheries in the Pacific Act\" or the \"REFI Pacific Act\". It includes findings and a stated purpose. In 2000, the West Coast groundfish fishery was declared a Federal fisheries economic disaster due to low stock abundance, an overcapitalized fleet, and historically overfished stocks. In 2003, a $35,700,000 buyback loan was authorized to establish a Pacific Coast groundfish fishing capacity reduction program through the National Marine Fisheries Service fisheries finance program with a 30-year term. The groundfish fishing capacity reduction program removed 46% of total landings by eliminating limited entry trawl Federal fishing permits. $4,243,730 in interest accrued before fee collection procedures were established in 2005. In 2011, the West Coast groundfish fishery transitioned to an individual fishing quota fishery. By 2015, West Coast groundfish fishermen's expenses are expected to include fees of approximately $450 per day for observers, a 3-percent cost recovery fee for catch share programs, and a 5-percent ex-vessel landings rate for loan repayment. In 2012, the West Coast groundfish limited entry trawl fishery generated $63,000,000, an increase from an average of $45,000,000 during the years 2006 to 2011. This revenue is expected to continue to increase post-rationalization. The purpose of this Act is to refinance the Pacific Coast groundfish fishery fishing capacity reduction program to protect. The Coast groundfish fishery fishing capacity reduction program aims to protect and conserve the West Coast groundfish fishery and the coastal economies in California, Oregon, and Washington. REFINANCING OF PACIFIC COAST GROUNDFISH FISHING CAPACITY REDUCTION LOAN. The Secretary of Commerce will issue a loan to refinance the debt funding the West Coast groundfish fishery program. The loan will be issued in accordance with specific laws and regulations, with a different term than usual. Title 46, United States Code specifies that loans issued under this section must have a maturity of 45 years. If there is an outstanding balance after this period, the loan will continue until fully repaid. The fee for these loans cannot exceed 3 percent of the harvest value, and the interest rate is determined differently than usual. The interest rate on direct loans under this section is based on the Treasury borrowing rate. Subloans must have the same interest rate and can be paid off early. The ex-vessel landing fee for loan repayment should be set as low as possible based on recent landings. The ex-vessel landing fee for loan repayment should be set as low as possible based on recent landings and recalculated every 5 years. The Secretary of Commerce is authorized to appropriate funds equal to 1 percent of the loan amount for this purpose. The Secretary of Commerce is authorized to appropriate funds equal to 1 percent of the loan amount for purposes of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990."
