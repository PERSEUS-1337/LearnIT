    "content": "The \"Assessing Progress in Haiti Act of 2014\" was enacted following a devastating earthquake in Haiti in 2010, which resulted in a significant loss of life and destruction of homes. The Act acknowledges the impact of the disaster on the Haitian population and the need for assistance in rebuilding and recovery efforts. The 2010 earthquake in Haiti caused $7,804,000,000 in damages and economic losses, affecting the population. Haiti had low socioeconomic indicators even before the disaster, complicating recovery efforts. Over 6,700,000 people in Haiti are food insecure, and an outbreak of cholera in 2010 resulted in over 500,000 cases and 8,000 deaths, straining the public health sector. The international community, led by the United States and the United Nations, provided significant humanitarian aid to Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, with donors pledging approximately $10.4 billion for relief efforts. The response from the United States Government, USAID, and other organizations was swift and resolute in providing assistance. Since 2010, $1.3 billion in US assistance has been allocated for humanitarian relief in Haiti, with an additional $2.3 billion for recovery and development. $651 million was given to USAID for a recovery plan, including building a power plant for the Caracol Industrial Park and new settlements in various areas of Haiti. According to a recent report by the Government Accountability Office, USAID has disbursed 31% of its reconstruction funds in Haiti, with the port project 2 years behind schedule and insufficient funding for projected costs. The housing project has been reduced by 80%, and the sustainability of the power plant, port, and housing projects are at risk. Congress lacks sufficient information for effective oversight, and donors face challenges in implementing recovery programs nearly 4 years after the earthquake. Haiti continues to face challenges with displacement, high unemployment, corruption, land rights issues, wage violations, and a weak government capacity. To achieve stability and economic growth, donor assistance must be coordinated with Haiti's commitment to transparency, a market economy, rule of law, and democracy. The legal environment in Haiti remains a hurdle to international goals. The United States policy supports sustainable rebuilding and development efforts in Haiti led by its people. The United States policy supports sustainable rebuilding and development efforts in Haiti led by its people. This includes promoting local leadership, building government and civil society capacity, addressing gender equality, restoring natural resources, ensuring transparency in reporting and evaluations, prioritizing local procurement, and supporting free and fair elections. The United States supports sustainable rebuilding and development efforts in Haiti, promoting local leadership, transparency, and accountability. Congress emphasizes the importance of democracy and good governance in decisions regarding US assistance. The Secretary of State is required to submit annual reports on post-earthquake recovery and development efforts in Haiti. The United States Government agencies, other than USAID and the Department of State, are involved in Haiti recovery efforts. The progress of US efforts in advancing the objectives of the Post-Earthquake USG Haiti Strategy is assessed, including any changes to the strategy and progress towards meeting goals and benchmarks. The curr_chunk describes progress towards implementing a housing reconstruction strategy in Haiti, including addressing land ownership, water and sanitation, and vulnerable populations. It also includes efforts to construct a port and assesses the timeline and cost. The curr_chunk provides details on US Government efforts to attract private sector investments to the CIP, indicators for evaluating progress, financial commitments by sector and implementing partner, and risk mitigation measures to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse in assistance provided under the Strategy. The curr_chunk describes efforts to strengthen Haitian governmental and nongovernmental capacity for US-supported recovery programs, consult with local authorities on program goals, and engage with civil society for program design and implementation. The curr_chunk focuses on efforts to coordinate with the Haitian diaspora, strengthen anti-corruption institutions, involve the private sector in development activities, and address the specific needs of Haiti. The curr_chunk describes efforts to address the needs of vulnerable populations, the impact of agriculture and infrastructure programs on smallholder farmers, mechanisms for communicating progress to the people of Haiti, and steps taken by the Government of Haiti to receive individuals removed from the United States. The Secretary of State must coordinate and transmit a three-year Haiti strategy to congressional committees within 180 days of this Act's enactment. The strategy should address economic growth constraints, democratic institutions, and include an action plan with policy tools. The three-year Haiti strategy must include an action plan with policy tools, technical assistance, and resources to address economic growth and democracy constraints. It should also outline steps and benchmarks for providing bilateral assistance to the Government of Haiti, focusing on building capacity and governance sustainability. The curr_chunk outlines a plan to support Haiti in holding democratic elections and building government capacity, including reducing corruption, strengthening the rule of law, developing sustainable housing, expanding port capacity, attracting private sector investments, and promoting agricultural development to reduce food insecurity and boost economic growth. The strategy for Haiti includes improving access to water, sanitation, public health, and natural resources, as well as gaining access to affordable energy. Consultation with US government agencies, the Haitian government, and private sectors is essential in devising this strategy. The Secretary of State must consult with various sectors in Haiti and provide quarterly briefings on the progress of the implementation of the strategy for Haiti. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
