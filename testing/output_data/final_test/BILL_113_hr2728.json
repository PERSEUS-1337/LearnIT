    "content": "STATE AUTHORITY FOR HYDRAULIC FRACTURING REGULATION: This title allows states to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Mineral Leasing Act. The Department of the Interior will not enforce Federal regulations on hydraulic fracturing if the State has its own regulations. States have authority over hydraulic fracturing activities on Federal land, and they must submit their regulations to the Bureau of Land Management for transparency. The Secretary of the Interior will make State regulations on hydraulic fracturing available to the public for transparency. States must submit regulations requiring disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing on Federal land to the Bureau of Land Management. Hydraulic fracturing is used to create fractures in the target formation to increase permeability near the wellbore and improve production of natural gas or oil. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study on the economic benefits of domestic shale oil and gas production through hydraulic fracturing, including revenue generation, job creation, and potential energy prices. The findings will be reported to the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives. Additionally, there is a section on tribal authority on trust land. TITLE II--EPA HYDRAULIC FRACTURING RESEARCH\n\nSEC. 104. TRIBAL AUTHORITY ON TRUST LAND: The Department of the Interior cannot enforce Federal regulations on hydraulic fracturing on land held in trust for Indians without beneficiary consent.\n\nSEC. 201. SHORT TITLE: This title is known as the \"EPA Hydraulic Fracturing Study Improvement Act.\"\n\nSEC. 202. EPA HYDRAULIC FRACTURING RESEARCH: This section focuses on EPA research related to hydraulic fracturing. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must adhere to specific requirements for peer review and information quality before issuing any final or interim reports on the impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The reports are considered Highly Influential Scientific Assessments and must undergo peer review according to EPA guidelines. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must follow specific guidelines for peer review and information quality when issuing reports on the impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The reports must meet standards set by the EPA, OMB, and adhere to guidelines for ensuring quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information. The Environmental Protection Agency must ensure objectivity, utility, and integrity of information in reports on hydraulic fracturing impacts on drinking water resources, following guidelines from the OMB. Reports should include objective estimates of the probability, uncertainty, and consequence of identified impacts. The final report on hydraulic fracturing impacts must include quantitative estimates of probability, uncertainty, and consequence, based on valid data. It will be publicly released by September 30, 2016. The Secretary of the Interior will annually review and report to Congress on State activities related to hydraulic fracturing."
