    "content": "The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a civil rights act that prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities. The ADA Amendments Act (ADAAA) was enacted in 2008 to address narrow interpretations of disability. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) issued proposed regulations under the ADAAA in 2009. Comments on the proposed regulations were due by November 23, 2009. The ADAAA defines disability as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits major life activities. The ADA Amendments Act (ADAAA) provides new rules for defining disability, including interpreting \"substantially limits\" broadly and considering episodic impairments as disabilities. The ADA Amendments Act broadens the definition of disability, emphasizing that impairments should be assessed without considering mitigating measures. Changes to the regulations include specific examples of impairments that qualify as disabilities, a revised definition of \"substantially limits,\" and an expanded definition of \"major life activity.\" The EEOC also updated its guidance for Title I of the ADA. The EEOC provides interpretative guidance for Title I of the ADA, emphasizing that disability is determined based on an individualized assessment. Examples of impairments that consistently meet the definition of disability are provided, such as autism, cancer, and diabetes, while examples of impairments that are usually not disabilities are also listed. The EEOC provides examples of impairments that may be disabling for some individuals but not for others, including asthma, high blood pressure, learning disabilities, and carpal tunnel syndrome. Temporary impairments of short duration with little residual effects are usually not considered disabilities. This guidance may conflict with the ADA's statutory definition of disability. The EEOC provides examples of impairments that may be disabling for some individuals but not for others, including asthma, high blood pressure, learning disabilities, and carpal tunnel syndrome. The proposed regulation under the ADA emphasizes individualized assessment for determining disability, even for conditions like seasonal influenza. The EEOC guidance states that H1N1 is not considered a disability under the ADA Amendments Act, which rejects previous Supreme Court rulings on defining disability. The new law rejects the \"substantially limits\" requirements of previous cases and regulations, emphasizing a broad scope of protection under the ADA. The proposed regulations under the ADA Amendments Act focus on determining disability based on the impact on an individual's ability to perform major life activities, rather than specific factors like severity or duration of impairment. The Senate Managers' Statement for the ADAAA emphasized a broad scope of protection under the ADA. The EEOC's proposed regulations may not align with congressional intent regarding the ADA Amendments Act of 1990. The House debate discusses the interpretation of \"substantially limits\" in relation to academic performance. Representative Stark emphasizes that academic success does not preclude someone from being considered disabled. The legislation aims to broaden the definition of disability to include individuals with specific learning disabilities like dyslexia, ensuring coverage without considering mitigating measures. The EEOC's proposed regulations support this by recognizing limitations in reading, learning, thinking, or concentrating compared to most people. The ADA Amendments Act broadens the definition of disability to include individuals with specific learning disabilities like dyslexia. It emphasizes that an individual with a disability is not determined by their academic success or abilities despite impairments. Major life activities include caring for oneself, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, and working, as well as the operation of major bodily functions. The legislation clarifies that the impact of an impairment on major bodily functions should not be overlooked. The ADA Amendments Act broadens the definition of disability to include individuals with specific learning disabilities like dyslexia. Major life activities now include caring for oneself, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, and working, as well as the operation of major bodily functions. Judicial decisions have clarified that major bodily functions should not be dismissed as falling outside the definition of disability. The proposed EEOC regulations list major life activities such as sitting, reaching, and interacting with others, with examples provided by the House Education and Labor Committee report. The EEOC's proposed regulations address the major life activity of working, stating that an impairment substantially limits working if it affects the individual's ability to perform or qualify for the type of work in question. This interpretation is meant to be broadly construed. The EEOC's proposed regulations state that an impairment substantially limits working if it affects the individual's ability to perform or qualify for the type of work in question. This interpretation is to be broadly construed and does not require extensive analysis. The EEOC envisions courts using evidence from the individual's educational and vocational background to determine limitations caused by the impairment, eliminating the need for statistical analysis of job availability. The EEOC's proposed regulations focus on how an impairment affects an individual's ability to perform or qualify for a specific type of work. The term \"class of jobs\" and \"broad range of jobs in various classes\" have been replaced with \"type of work\" for clarity. This change has been controversial as it deviates from specific statutory language or legislative history, but aligns with the intent of ADA cases to focus on discrimination rather than meeting the definition of disability. The proposed regulations by the EEOC focus on how an impairment affects an individual's ability to perform specific work, rather than meeting the definition of disability. This change could significantly impact judicial determinations."
