    "title": "AB 2699",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 7159.5 of the Business and Professions Code requires all home improvement contracts to be in writing and include the total contract amount. Any separate finance charges must be clearly stated apart from the contract amount. Failure to comply with these provisions can result in disciplinary action. The home improvement contract must include a downpayment not exceeding $1,000 or 10% of the contract amount. Payments before completion must be detailed in a schedule referencing work, materials, and equipment. Contractor cannot request payment exceeding work value or materials delivered. (6) Contractor must provide a release from potential lien claims upon payment. Further payments can be withheld until releases are furnished. (7) Salesperson's commission payment should be proportional to contractor's payments. (8) Exceptions apply as per Section 717. A contractor providing certain bonds approved by the registrar is exempt from certain requirements and can accept payment before completion. If joint control is involved, the contractor must not have any financial interest in it. A violation of certain provisions by a licensee or person subject to licensing under this chapter is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of $100 to $5,000, or imprisonment up to one year, or both. Charges must be brought within four years from the date of the contract. An indictment or information against a licensed contractor must be brought within two years from the date of the contract or the first payment made by the buyer. Administrative actions are not subject to these limitations. Any person who violates this section as part of a plan to defraud in connection with repairs for natural disaster damage shall make full restitution to the victim. The court may also impose a fine of $500 to $25,000. This applies to disasters with a state of emergency declared by the Governor or the President. The board is required to develop a \"solar energy system disclosure document\" by July 1, 2017, which must be provided to consumers by solar energy systems companies before completing a sale, financing, or lease. This document includes information on financing sources, total costs, panel and energy calculations. The board is required to establish regulations for contractors to maintain a performance and payment bond for solar energy system installations. This includes details such as monthly fees, turn-on charges, guaranteed rebates, contract price, contractor license number, installation impacts, system malfunctions, lease vs. purchase information, and complaint procedures. The Legislature aims to ensure accurate information for prospective solar customers to make informed decisions and to meet the goal of one million solar rooftop systems by 2018. Contractors installing solar energy systems must adhere to down payment restrictions. Chapter 2.4 is added to Division 8 of the Business and Professions Code, defining terms related to solar companies and their services. The Department of Consumer Affairs oversees regulations for companies selling, financing, or leasing solar energy systems. Prior to completing a sale, financing, or lease of a solar energy system, a solar company must provide customers with a \"solar energy system disclosure document\" containing information on current electric rates, payback calculations based on the customer's rate, and a notification about potential future rate changes affecting savings estimates. The solar company must provide customers with information on their electricity provider's future rate filings, contractor's license details, insurance certificates, expected electricity production, and a notification about renewable energy attributes. The solar company must inform customers about payment obligations upon the customer's death, costs of removing and reinstalling solar panels, maintenance instructions, potential impact on electricity production, limitations on mortgage refinancing due to financing, and compensation for bill credits by other customers. A solar company selling or leasing solar energy systems in specific languages must provide disclosure documents in the same language. The Department of Consumer Affairs must adopt a regulation for a solar energy system disclosure document to inform customers about risks, rewards, warranty issues, and protection from unfair practices by solar companies. The document should include information on system malfunctions, installations not meeting code, and roof concerns. The Legislature intends to enact legislation requiring certification of solar companies and establishing an insurance pool for customer compensation in case of system claims, funded by all active solar companies in the state. Solar companies must not use the trade dress of other energy providers when marketing to avoid confusion unless authorized. Violations result in fines deposited in the Professions and Vocations Fund. A customer can sue a solar company for damages if they are willfully violated the provisions of the chapter. The court can award equitable relief, and these rights are in addition to any other legal remedies available."
