    "content": "Since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the enforcement of immigration laws has been a topic of debate. Some argue that state and local law enforcement should assist due to limited federal resources. However, questions remain about the role of state and local agencies given their own limitations and expertise. States and localities are primarily responsible for defining and prosecuting crimes, but they may also have the authority to enforce some federal laws, including immigration laws that involve criminal punishments and civil violations. The Immigration and Nationality Act limits state enforcement of civil and criminal provisions. Proposals have been made to involve state and local law enforcement in identifying and detaining deportable aliens, but this could be a new and unfamiliar mission for these agencies. This report examines the role of state and local law enforcement in enforcing immigration law, focusing on investigation, arrest, and detention of immigration violators. It discusses legal authority and the shift from INS to DHS activities. The report discusses the legal authority for state and local law enforcement to enforce immigration laws, current efforts to involve them in enforcement, and potential pros and cons of this policy. The debate over interior immigration enforcement intensified after September 11, 2001, due to perceived federal resource shortages. The INS had limited resources before 9/11, but the merger with Customs into ICE increased interior enforcement agents. Despite the increase, many believe the number is still insufficient. Agents now have multiple missions, including enforcing immigration laws, combating drug trafficking, and deterring money laundering. State and local law enforcement can assist federal officers as per federal law. State and local law enforcement can assist federal officers in enforcing immigration laws under certain circumstances, as authorized by laws enacted in 1996. The DHS also collaborates with these agencies on initiatives to investigate and apprehend foreign nationals who have violated the law, including the Criminal Alien Program. The National Fugitive Operations Program (NFOP) and Absconder Apprehension Initiative focus on identifying and removing criminal aliens who have failed to comply with removal orders. These programs work in conjunction with the Department of Justice to facilitate the removal of criminal aliens while they are in state or federal custody. ICE's Absconder Apprehension Initiative, led by former INS Commissioner James Ziglar in collaboration with the FBI, utilizes data from the NCIC to track absconders. State and local law enforcement officers can inquire about an immigrant's status during routine duties, indirectly assisting in immigration enforcement. The Law Enforcement Support Center (LESC) allows state officials to contact ICE agents to place detainers on suspects for immigration status verification. However, prolonged detention beyond local law enforcement needs may be unlawful, leading to controversies and allegations of abuse in immigration enforcement. Some localities have concerns about resources and community cooperation in enforcing immigration law. The federal government has exclusive power over immigration rules and enforcement, including setting penalties for violations like alien smuggling. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) distinguishes between civil and criminal violations. Illegal presence in the U.S. is a civil violation, while criminal violations include felonies and misdemeanors prosecuted in federal courts. Examples of criminal violations under the INA include bringing in and harboring undocumented aliens, illegal entry of aliens, and reentry of previously excluded or deported aliens. Congress has the authority to prescribe procedures for determining violations. Congress has exclusive authority to prescribe procedures for determining violations related to immigration, including the right of aliens in these proceedings. While enforcement standards may differ between criminal and civil aspects of immigration law, states may assist in enforcing both under federal and state law. There is a notion that states have \"inherent\" authority to enforce federal criminal laws related to immigration. The Supremacy Clause of the Constitution gives Congress the power to preempt state law in immigration enforcement. Congressional intent is crucial in determining preemption, with federal law taking precedence over inconsistent state laws. States may assist in enforcing both criminal and civil aspects of immigration law, but their actions must align with federal authority. The Supremacy Clause of the Constitution allows Congress to preempt state law in immigration enforcement based on explicit statutory language, exclusive federal authority in immigration, and conflicts with federal law. State involvement in immigration should be limited to express congressional indication. Congress cannot force states to enforce federal immigration law in a specific way. Federal power over immigration does not preempt every state activity affecting immigration. State and local officers may enforce the criminal provisions of the INA if state law permits, but are precluded from directly enforcing the civil provisions. The distinction between civil and criminal violations suggests a bifurcated role for state involvement in immigration enforcement. State and local law enforcement officers have a limited role in enforcing immigration laws, as they can arrest individuals for criminal offenses but not for civil violations. Their authority to investigate and arrest for federal law violations is determined by state law, with some recent court decisions suggesting they may have inherent authority in certain cases. The Department of Justice, Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinions and major cases on immigration enforcement authority, along with current provisions in law authorizing state and local involvement, have been examined. Various Administrations have addressed the scope of state and local participation, emphasizing the need for cooperation while highlighting the exclusive federal role in enforcing civil immigration law. The Reagan Justice Department in 1983 underscored cooperative measures but clarified that only INS could make arrests for civil immigration violations. State and local cooperation primarily involved notifying INS and detaining individuals. In 1989, the Department of Justice clarified that local police could enforce criminal violations of immigration law, but it was unclear if they could enforce non-criminal federal statutes. A 1996 opinion stated that state and local police could arrest aliens for criminal violations but lacked authority for civil provisions. After 9/11, there was a shift towards increasing the role of local law enforcement in immigration enforcement, with INS sending noncitizen names to NCIC databases in 2001. The Attorney General confirmed in 2002 that state and local officials have the authority to enforce federal immigration law by arresting noncitizens listed on the NCIC for violating immigration laws. The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel concluded that state and local police can voluntarily arrest aliens who have violated criminal or civil provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The 2002 OLC opinion concluded that states have the inherent authority to enforce federal immigration laws by arresting noncitizens listed on the NCIC for violations, as confirmed by the Attorney General. The Department of Justice initially withheld the opinion but released it in 2005 after a lawsuit under FOIA, with certain sections redacted. The 2002 OLC opinion confirms states' authority to make arrests for violations of federal law, including arresting aliens for civil deportability. It discredits previous opinions, considers new case law, and analyzes the legislative history of \u00a71252c regarding state authority to arrest for federal violations. The 2002 OLC opinion confirms states' authority to make arrests for violations of federal law, including arresting aliens for civil deportability. Critics have described the opinion as \"deeply flawed\" and unsupported by legislative history or judicial precedent. Immigration is a federal concern, and federal law only authorizes state and local enforcement in specific circumstances. The opinion does not address the distinction between criminal and non-criminal enforcement and could have implications beyond immigration. The 2002 OLC opinion cannot compel state action and interpretations in opinion letters are not controlling. The Ninth Circuit case of Gonzalez v. City of Peoria analyzed whether state and local law enforcement agencies can enforce provisions of the INA. The court found that Congress authorized local enforcement of the criminal entry provision of the INA, preempting state action. The 2002 OLC opinion confirms states' authority to make arrests for violations of federal law, including arresting aliens for civil deportability, but critics argue it lacks support from legislative history or judicial precedent. The Ninth Circuit case of Gonzalez v. City of Peoria determined that local police officers can stop individuals with reasonable suspicion of violating criminal immigration provisions of the INA. The court also found that the criminal immigration provisions did not indicate exclusive federal control over enforcement. The Ninth Circuit case of Gonzalez v. City of Peoria established that states do not have the authority to enforce civil immigration measures unless specifically granted by Congress. The court distinguished between civil and criminal provisions of the INA, stating that the former constitutes a pervasive regulatory scheme under exclusive federal power. The court in Gonzalez v. City of Peoria ruled that states can only enforce criminal immigration laws, not civil ones. Some critics argue that the preemption analysis in Gonzalez was based on an assumption and may not be binding precedent. The issue has yet to be definitively tested in court. In United States v. Salinas-Calderon, a state trooper detained individuals in a truck after discovering they were in the country illegally. The Tenth Circuit ruled that the trooper had probable cause to arrest them. In United States v. Salinas-Calderon, a state trooper detained individuals in a truck after discovering they were in the country illegally. The court determined that the trooper had general investigatory authority to inquire into possible immigration violations, regardless of whether they were civil or criminal violations. The focus was on probable cause and potential suppression of statements made by the individuals, not on differentiation between civil and criminal violations. In Vasquez-Alvarez, a state officer arrested an \"illegal alien\" without knowledge of his immigration status or criminal history. The defendant argued that the arrest was unauthorized under 8 U.S.C. \u00a71252c, but the Tenth Circuit ruled that this provision does not limit the general authority of state police officers. The court in Vasquez-Alvarez ruled that 8 U.S.C. \u00a71252c does not limit state police officers' general authority to enforce federal immigration law. The legislative history of \u00a71252c does not indicate Congress intended to displace state officers' preexisting enforcement powers. The Tenth Circuit addressed the role of local law enforcement in immigration in United States v. Santana-Garcia. A Utah police officer arrested two individuals for suspected violation of federal immigration law after a traffic stop where the driver and passenger indicated they were not \"legal.\" The court in United States v. Santana-Garcia recognized state and local police officers' implicit authority to investigate and arrest for violations of immigration law, based on previous decisions and Utah state law empowering officers to make warrantless arrests for any public offense, including federal law violations. The defendants were arrested for suspected violation of federal immigration law, despite only being in violation of a civil provision of the INA. The Santana-Garcia court did not differentiate between civil and criminal violations of the INA, raising questions about the extent to which state and local police can enforce civil immigration laws. The cases cited mainly involved criminal matters, weakening the argument for police involvement in civil immigration enforcement. However, there is a trend towards expanding their role, as seen in cases from the Tenth Circuit. The Tenth Circuit shows a trend towards increasing the involvement of state and local law enforcement officers in immigration law, including civil enforcement. Congress can delegate activities like arresting and transporting aliens to states, and has allowed state and local officers to participate in enforcing federal immigration laws. \u00a7133 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 grants broad authority for state and local immigration enforcement. Section 1357(g) authorizes state and local entities to enter agreements with the AG to allow officers to perform immigration functions, tailored to meet local needs and without interfering with their local duties. State and local officers can enter agreements with the AG to perform immigration functions, with specific powers and duties outlined, federal law knowledge required, and AG supervision mandated. AG-designated officers are not federal employees, except for certain claims, but have federal immunity. Section 1357(g)(9) states that states are not required to enter agreements with the AG under \u00a71357(g), and \u00a71357(g)(10) allows state officers to communicate with the AG on immigration matters without an agreement. Section 372 of IIRIRA amended INA \u00a7103(a) to permit the AG to involve state and local police in immigration emergencies. State and local law enforcement officers can be authorized by the Attorney General to exercise powers conferred by the Act or regulations during emergencies, such as mass influx of aliens. This authorization can only be used during the emergency situation, as outlined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a71103(a)(10) and a final rule issued by the DOJ on July 24, 2002. The DOJ amended regulations in February 2003 to provide flexibility for the AG in addressing unforeseen situations during mass influxes of aliens. The new rules allow for the abbreviation or waiver of training requirements to protect public safety, health, or national security. Section 1252c permits state and local officers to arrest aliens who have violated the INA. The DOJ amended regulations in February 2003 to allow flexibility for the AG during mass influxes of aliens. Section 1252c permits state and local officers to arrest aliens who have violated the INA by reentering the US illegally after being deported for a felony conviction. The DOJ amended regulations in February 2003 to allow flexibility for the AG during mass influxes of aliens. Section 1252c permits state and local officers to arrest aliens who have violated the INA by reentering the US illegally after being deported for a felony conviction. In United States v. Vasquez-Alvarez, it was found that there were no pre-\u00a71252c limitations on the powers of state and local officers to enforce federal law. Section 1252c(b) mandates cooperation between the AG and states to provide information that would assist state and local law enforcement officials in carrying out their duties. Congress has delegated arrest authority to local law enforcement officers in 8 U.S.C. \u00a71324, which establishes criminal penalties for the smuggling, transporting, concealing, and harboring of illegal aliens. The plain language in subsection (c) of \u00a71324 indicates that local law enforcement officers authorized to enforce criminal laws can make arrests for smuggling, transporting, and harboring offenses. The legislative history of \u00a71324 confirms this understanding, allowing state and local officers to enforce federal law in certain situations. The House removed the phrase \"of the United States\" to allow local officials to enforce criminal laws. This change clarified that all law enforcement officers, federal or otherwise, can enforce \u00a71324. Following the 2001 terrorist attacks, the AG (now the Secretary of Homeland Security) was authorized to enter agreements with states for immigration-related duties. This led to the creation of 287(g) programs, deputizing state and local officers to assist in anti-terrorism efforts. In 2002, Florida Department of Law Enforcement and DOJ signed a one-year MOA for state and local officers to assist in immigration enforcement for domestic security and counter-terrorism. Selected officers can enforce immigration laws after training by DHS. Officers assigned to the RDSTF undergo mandatory training provided by DHS instructors. Nominees must be U.S. citizens with at least three years of experience as a sworn officer and an Associate Degree. They also need to qualify for federal security clearances and have their employer's approval to work within the RDSTF for a minimum of one year. Training is conducted by ICE in Florida, covering topics such as the officer's authority, cross-cultural issues, the use of force, civil rights law, and liability issues. Officers assigned to the RDSTF undergo mandatory training provided by DHS instructors on their obligations under federal law and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Training materials are provided by DHS, and the FDLE covers costs of housing and meals. Upon completion of training, officers receive authorization to perform immigration enforcement functions for one year, with quarterly evaluations by the District Director and FDLE commissioner. Authorization can be revoked at any time by DHS, FDLE, or the employing agency. Immigration-related activities are supervised by DHS. Activities performed by officers in the RDSTF are supervised by DHS. Officers can only perform immigration officer functions under direct supervision for RDSTF duties. The MOA requires officers to be trained and certified, with complaints procedures disseminated in multiple languages. All arrests made must be reported to ICE within 24 hours. Under the MOA, complaints received by federal or state authorities must be reported to ICE's Office of Internal Audit. Complaints reported directly to ICE must be shared with FDLE for jurisdiction determination. Complainants must be notified of complaint receipt, and officers could be removed from activities pending resolution. A steering committee is established to review task force operations for effectiveness in domestic security and counter-terrorism matters. The MOA between Alabama and DHS is similar to Florida's MOA, with officers nominated by the state's DPS Director and trained by ICE. Nominees must be U.S. citizens with 3 years of law enforcement experience, no education requirement, and must qualify for federal security clearances. Training expenses are covered by DPS, with updated training provided after the first year. Officers conduct immigration enforcement activities. The MOA between Alabama and DHS involves state troopers appointed by the DPS Director and trained by ICE special agents in Alabama. The troopers conduct immigration enforcement activities under the supervision of ICE agents in Huntsville, Birmingham, and Montgomery. Arrests made under this authority must be reported to ICE within 24 hours and reviewed for compliance with immigration laws. 60 state troopers have been trained under this program. Other jurisdictions in Arizona, California, North Carolina, and Tennessee have also entered into MOAs with ICE to prevent the release of criminal aliens back into the community. In February 2005, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department (LASD) entered into an MOA with ICE allowing LASD personnel to complete criminal alien processing, prepare immigration detainers, affidavits, and NTAs, and interrogate for immigration violations. The MOA specifies that LASD will not detain an alien after eligibility for release, except for 48 hours. LASD has discretion to terminate the MOA if needed. In September 2005, the Arizona Department of Corrections (ADOC) entered into an MOA with the Department of Homeland Security to enhance Arizona's capacity to deal with immigration violators. Eight correction officer candidates and two supervisory correctional officers were nominated for training and certification, with specific criteria including bilingualism and no family associations that could impact their ICE functions. Selected officers are primarily assigned in Phoenix and Perryville. The Arizona Department of Corrections entered into an MOA with the Department of Homeland Security to enhance capacity for dealing with immigration violators. Selected officers have specific authorities and responsibilities under the MOA, with emphasis on community and media relations. ICE will engage in community outreach with interested organizations or individuals. ICE and state law enforcement entities coordinate information released to the media regarding MOAs. Officers are treated as federal employees under MOAs, with immunities and defenses from personal liability. Defendants in litigation can request representation by the DOJ. Any party can terminate the MOA at any time, with no set termination dates. Over 950 officers have been trained through the 287(g) program under 67 active MOAs. Appendix A lists participating law enforcement agencies. Appendix A lists law enforcement agencies participating in the program since August 29, 2007. Some jurisdictions have defined or limited their role in immigration enforcement, leading to debates over creating \"sanctuary\" cities. Supporters cite resource constraints and human rights, while critics argue it encourages illegal immigration. The lack of a clear definition for \"sanctuary\" policies has fueled the contentious issue. The issue of \"sanctuary\" policies has become contentious, with some jurisdictions rejecting such policies and encouraging cooperation with ICE. For example, Colorado passed legislation in 2006 requiring peace officers to cooperate with immigration officials. Houston Police Department, previously described as having a sanctuary policy, announced closer collaboration with immigration officials to identify illegal immigrants involved in crime. Under a new policy, police officers are prohibited from asking about immigration status unless the person is under arrest. They will detain suspects with deportation warrants, previously deported felons, and those with criminal warrants for ICE. The Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 requires a study on cities not cooperating with certain immigration provisions. State and local law enforcement officials do not have direct access to an alien's immigration status but can contact the LESC in Burlington, Vermont if needed. State and local law enforcement officials can contact the LESC in Burlington, Vermont to query an alien's immigration status. If the alien is unauthorized and will be released, immigration officials are notified to pick them up. Officials can also access the NCIC for absconders, but there is a backlog of over 350,000 names. Law enforcement officials have reported difficulties accessing LESC for immigration status queries and receiving cooperation from federal authorities. Concerns about civil rights violations and the need for improved cooperation exist among state and local law enforcement personnel. The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments protect civil rights, including due process and equal protection under the law. Courts also address police misconduct under the Fourth Amendment. Congress has laws prohibiting discrimination and providing remedies for victims, such as Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983. The Civil Rights Act of 1871 allows for monetary damages for deprivation of federal constitutional rights by state or local officials. The Violent Crime and Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 authorizes the DOJ to take action against police agencies engaged in unconstitutional practices. Enforcement of immigration laws may lead to civil rights violations, especially if police lack proper training and experience. The enforcement of immigration laws may lead to civil rights violations, including racial profiling. There is concern that allowing state and local law enforcement to enforce immigration law could result in more aliens being detained, posing a resource problem for ICE. Increasing the number of law enforcement officers to enforce immigration law may lead to more undocumented aliens being detained, posing challenges for states and local jurisdictions. The debate over the proper role of state and local law enforcement officials in enforcing immigration law has sparked controversy among lawmakers, scholars, observers, and law enforcement officials. Critics argue that utilizing state and local law enforcement for immigration enforcement could harm the relationship between these agencies and the communities they serve. Opponents argue that utilizing state and local law enforcement for immigration enforcement could harm the relationship between these agencies and the communities they serve. They assert that potential witnesses and victims of crime may be reluctant to come forward in fear of actions by immigration officials, exacerbating the negative relationship. Proponents believe state and local officers are best suited for enforcing such laws as they know the communities well. They argue that resources should not be diverted from federal responsibilities. Opponents argue that using state and local law enforcement for immigration enforcement could strain their relationship with communities, leading to reluctance from witnesses and victims of crime to come forward. Proponents believe that involving local agencies would enhance the enforcement of immigration laws deeper into the US interior and provide additional resources. Since 9/11, there has been a focus on enforcing immigration laws, with debates on involving state and local law enforcement. Critics fear this could undermine public safety and hinder cooperation in criminal and terrorist investigations. Proponents argue it would help in arresting potential threats, enhancing national security. The Secretary of DHS can make agreements with states for local officers to enforce immigration laws, which require specialized training. Some argue that state and local officers lack the expertise to differentiate between legal and fraudulent documents. Proponents believe that current training is sufficient for state and local officers to enforce immigration laws effectively. Congress is debating options for training state and local law enforcement to enforce immigration law, including access to databases. Some argue it would improve efficiency, while others are concerned about privacy issues. Access to alien's personal information by state and local law enforcement officials raises concerns about potential abuse and false positives leading to wrongful incarceration. Questions remain about the level of access, clearance for officers, and privacy protection for individuals. Congress could appropriate additional funding to state and local law enforcement agencies for their cooperation with enforcing immigration law, addressing the lack of resources and budget crises faced by many states. The reduction in federal reimbursement for the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) has impacted funding for incarcerating undocumented aliens, leading to concerns about database quality and potential false positives in identifying individuals. SCAAP funding for holding aliens due to state or local charges peaked in FY2002 at $565 million but dropped to under $400 million in FY2007. The debate on allowing state and local law enforcement to enforce immigration law revolves around their authority to address civil immigration violations. There is uncertainty on this issue, but some suggest that criminalizing all civil immigration violations could empower state and local agencies to arrest and detain violators. Some view the option to allow state and local law enforcement to arrest and detain immigration violators as closing a loophole, while others express concerns about their ability to differentiate between asylum seekers and fraudulent individuals. There are worries about the large number of violators and the already overburdened immigration system. Questions arise about the potential criminalization of civil immigration violations, including retroactivity and its impact on adjusting status for violators. The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 and other related legislative proposals included provisions for state and local law enforcement to enforce immigration laws and create a border relief grant program for addressing criminal activity near the border. The legislative proposals authorized grants for law enforcement near the border and reimbursement for training, equipment, and incarceration costs related to immigration enforcement. Other provisions included verifying immigration status of aliens apprehended by local police and taking possession of illegal aliens within 72 hours. S. 1348 and H.R. 842 proposed giving state and local law enforcement the authority to handle immigration enforcement, including investigating, identifying, apprehending, and transferring aliens to federal custody. The bills also included provisions for sharing information on aliens and designating central facilities for transferring custody. The bill H.R. 1645 would have required state and local law enforcement officers to assist federal immigration law enforcement. It would have designated central detention facilities for aliens in each state and affirmed officers' right to enforce immigration laws. Additionally, the bill would have created a Border Relief Grant Program for funding to address criminal activity. H.R. 1962 would provide funding to state and local law enforcement agencies near the U.S. border to address criminal activity related to border security. The bill authorizes DHS to grant funds for various expenses, including law enforcement activities and inmate transportation. Legislation in the 109th Congress aimed to enhance the role of local law enforcement in immigration enforcement, with only a few bills passing. During the 109th Congress, bills like H.R. 4437 and S. 2611 addressed local law enforcement's role in immigration enforcement. H.R. 4437 reaffirmed states' authority to handle immigration matters and authorized grants for state and local agencies. H.R. 4437 authorized grants for state and local police agencies to procure equipment for immigration law enforcement, allowed states to reimburse themselves with certain DHS grants for related activities, required designated sheriffs near the southern border to be reimbursed for costs associated with detained aliens, and mandated DHS to establish a training manual for law enforcement on enforcing immigration law. H.R. 1817, similar to H.R. 4437, would have authorized state and local law enforcement to enforce immigration law. S. 2611 in the Senate would have reaffirmed states' authority to enforce immigration laws and required DHS to promptly take custody of illegal aliens apprehended by local authorities. The DHS is required to promptly take custody of illegal aliens apprehended by local authorities, as stated in S. 2611. This provision is similar to the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007."
