    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Saffron Revolution Support Act of 2007\". It includes findings related to the Saffron Revolution. Congress finds that in 2007, citizens of Burma peacefully protested against the oppressive SPDC regime, demanding the release of political prisoners and national reconciliation. The SPDC responded with violence, injuring and imprisoning thousands. The Department of State's 2006 Reports on Human Rights Practices found that the SPDC in Burma routinely restricts freedoms of speech, press, assembly, association, religion, and movement, traffics in persons, discriminates against women and ethnic minorities, forcibly recruits child soldiers and child labor, and commits other serious violations of human rights. This includes extrajudicial killings, custodial deaths, disappearances, rape, torture, abuse of prisoners and detainees, and arbitrary imprisonment of citizens for political reasons. Aung San Suu Kyi has been arbitrarily imprisoned or held under house arrest for more than 12 years. The United States tightened economic sanctions against Burma and imposed visa bans on individuals responsible for human rights violations and aiding the SPDC's efforts to impede democracy in Burma. The Total Oil Corporation of France and the Chevron Corporation of the United States have significant stakes in Burma's Yadana natural gas field, generating millions in revenue for the repressive junta government. Burma is a major exporter of teak and precious gems, contributing to its foreign exchange earnings. The SPDC in Burma controls all mining operations for precious stones and faces international pressure to release political prisoners and engage in dialogue. Incentivizing cooperation through targeted economic sanctions may be effective. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the terms \"account\", \"correspondent account\", and \"payable-through account\" are defined as per section 5318A(e)(1) of title 31, United States Code. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" refers to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives. The term \"person\" includes individuals, corporations, partnerships, trusts, and other entities, along with their successors, subunits, or subsidiaries. The term \"United States person\" refers to an individual who is a citizen of the United States or owes permanent allegiance to the country, and also includes entities organized under U.S. laws where U.S. individuals own more than 50% of the entity's capital stock. STATEMENT OF POLICY: The United States condemns repression by the SPDC, supports democratic aspirations in Burma, provides assistance for a transition to democracy, and holds accountable those responsible for political repression. The President must provide a list of SPDC officials involved in repression in Burma and those supporting the SPDC economically or politically. The list must be updated regularly. Sanctions include a visa ban and financial restrictions on individuals involved with the SPDC in Burma. The Act imposes sanctions on individuals involved with the SPDC in Burma, prohibiting financial transactions with specified persons. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with other key officials, has the authority to impose banking sanctions on financial institutions related to specified individuals involved with the SPDC in Burma. The Secretary of the Treasury can impose banking sanctions on financial institutions that may be used by foreign banking institutions holding property of individuals on a specified list or conducting transactions on behalf of those individuals. The Secretary has the authority to define terms for this purpose. The President can impose sanctions on the SPDC until certain conditions are met, including the release of political prisoners, engaging in dialogue with democratic forces, and allowing humanitarian access in Burma. Appropriations are authorized for this purpose. The Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 is amended to prohibit the importation of Burmese gems, hardwoods, and other items. This includes gemstones, rough geological materials, teak, and other hardwood timber from Burma. Additionally, there is a prohibition on investment by United States persons in Burma. Investment in Burma by United States persons is prohibited, including investments based on agreements before May 20, 1997, facilitating investments by foreign persons that would violate the prohibition, and payments to the SPDC for divesting assets. Penalties may be imposed on violators by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of State can award grants to establish a database of human rights abuses by the SPDC. Additionally, support for democracy in Burma is emphasized. The President is authorized to use resources to assist Burmese democracy activists in promoting freedom, democracy, and human rights. $20,000,000 is authorized for aid to democracy activists, democracy programming, broadcasting into Burma, and compiling evidence of SPDC repression. The SPDC is involved in political activity and other human rights abuses. Congress urges the Director of National Intelligence to use intelligence resources to identify those responsible for the crackdown on peaceful protestors in Burma and ongoing human rights abuses against civilians. Additionally, a report on military aid to Burma is required. The Secretary of State must submit a report to Congress within 180 days listing countries providing military aid to Burma, detailing the types of aid given, including weapons, training, and joint exercises. The report can be unclassified with a possible classified annex."
