During World War II, members of the Armed Forces of the United States fought bravely against Japan in the Pacific, preventing Japan from achieving strategic objectives. In the Philippines, they were ordered to surrender in April 1942 and forced to march 65 miles. During World War II, members of the Armed Forces of the United States fought bravely against Japan in the Pacific, preventing Japan from achieving strategic objectives. They were ordered to surrender on April 9, 1942, and were forced to march 65 miles to prison camps where more than 10,000 Americans died during the \"Bataan Death March\" and subsequent imprisonment due to starvation, disease, and executions. Additionally, prisoners were transported to Japan, Taiwan, Manchuria, and Korea for slave labor on \"Hell Ships,\" with some estimates indicating over 3,600 American deaths from attacks by the US Armed Forces. Following World War II, the United States agreed to compensate former prisoners of war at $2.50 per day of imprisonment, funded by frozen Japanese assets. However, this compensation is inadequate to fully address the suffering endured. Other countries like Canada, the UK, and Australia have provided similar compensation to their veterans captured by Japan during the war. The United States has not awarded compensation to World War II prisoners of war who were forced into slave labor by Japan. The purpose is to recognize and compensate these individuals for their heroic contributions and the denial of their basic human rights. A covered veteran or civilian internee is defined as a U.S. citizen who was captured by the Japanese military during the war. The Secretary of Defense shall pay compensation to U.S. citizens who were members of the Armed Forces, civilians, or contractors during World War II, served in or with the Armed Forces, were captured by Japan, and forced into slave labor. Slave labor is defined as forced servitude under subjugation. The Secretary of Defense will compensate living veterans or civilian internees from World War II with $20,000 each. An application for compensation creates a rebuttable presumption of eligibility. Any payment under this section is additional to other payments for the same activity. Any amount paid to a person under this section is not subject to taxation, attachment, execution, levy, tax lien, or detention under any process."
