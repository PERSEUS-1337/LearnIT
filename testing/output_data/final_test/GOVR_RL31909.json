    "content": "One technique Congress uses to obtain documents from the executive branch is the resolution of inquiry, a direct request for specific information. This method has proven more effective than other approaches in obtaining information from the executive branch. The resolution of inquiry is a method used by Congress to request specific information from the executive branch. The Senate does not have a similar practice, relying instead on other legislative means like the nomination process and Senate \"holds.\" The resolution of inquiry is a method used by Congress to request specific information from the executive branch, not generally privileged for immediate consideration. Congress has a history of requesting information from the executive branch for legislative inquiries, dating back to its early years. The House resolution of inquiry allows lawmakers to request documents from the executive branch, a process that dates back to the early years of Congress. For example, in 1797, a resolution requested the President to provide information to the states. In 1811, the House considered a resolution requesting the President to provide a list of persons unlawfully taken from vessels under the United States flag. In 1820, the House clarified rules for requesting information from the executive branch due to concerns about lack of consideration in making such requests. Representative Charles Rich noted the employment of six clerks for this purpose. The House made changes to its rules for requesting information from the executive branch, including a proposition by Rich for a one-day delay before consideration and later requiring committee consideration the following day. The House rule regarding requesting information from the executive branch was changed to eliminate the need for unanimous consent to seek executive documents. Speaker Samuel J. Randall explained the reasoning behind this change. The House rule was changed to allow members to request information from the executive branch without needing unanimous consent. Representative Mills questioned the need to refer such resolutions to a committee, while Representative Garfield emphasized the importance of committee referral to avoid duplication of information requests on the floor. Garfield emphasized the importance of committee referral to avoid duplication of information requests on the floor. The House Committee on Rules recommended giving committees full discretion over resolutions for information from Executive Departments, with a procedure limiting such resolutions to Monday mornings. Representative Mills objected to this restriction, highlighting potential partisan issues. Garfield argued against potential partisan issues in information requests, questioning the effectiveness of resolutions that could expose malfeasance. Calkins disagreed, stating that if information had already been provided, it would suffice as a response. Mills raised concerns about committees using majority power to block actions. Speaker Randall and Representative Mills discussed the potential for majority party power to block resolutions, with Mills acknowledging the possibility but emphasizing the importance of having a record. Representative Baker proposed that committees must report on resolutions within one week, a suggestion supported by Speaker Randall and ultimately agreed upon. The House Rule XIII, clause 7 allows a resolution of inquiry to be addressed to the head of an executive department. If not reported within 14 legislative days, a motion to discharge the committee is privileged. The House debates the resolution for up to one hour before voting on it. The committee reports a resolution, with consideration time given to the committee chairman or ranking member. The deadline for reporting was extended to 14 legislative days in 1983, excluding the first and last day. Resolutions of inquiry are usually referred to the relevant committee, but multiple committees may be involved. The committee sends the resolution to the Administration for action and may act on it while waiting for a response from the executive branch. The committee may act on a resolution as referred or consider amendments. It votes to report favorably or adversely, or may not report at all. If the Administration's response is satisfactory, a motion to table the resolution can be made. The chairman becomes floor manager to pass or table the resolution if reported. If not reported, the sponsor can call it up as privileged business. The privileged status of a resolution applies to requests for facts within the Administration's control, not for opinions or investigations. In 1905, a Member of the House requested a report on the progress of an investigation, but objections were raised due to possible duplication of printing. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon clarified which parts of the resolution were privileged. Resolutions of inquiry are privileged when directed to the head of an executive department. In 1891, a resolution was challenged for being directed to the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution instead of an executive department. The Speaker clarified that the rule applies only to resolutions addressed to heads of Executive Departments. The question of privilege arises as a resolution is presented to the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, who are trustees for fund disbursement and park organization. There is a debate on whether the resolution is privileged as the Regents are not under the jurisdiction of any government department. Despite objections, the resolution is brought before the House for consideration. In a debate over privilege, a resolution is presented to the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, who are not under any government department's jurisdiction. Despite objections, the resolution is brought before the House for consideration. Speaker Crisp ruled against a resolution of inquiry directed at the Interstate Commerce Commission, stating it was not privileged as the Commission is not a department head. However, a resolution of inquiry to the Civil Service Commission was adopted through unanimous consent motion in 1904. In 1811 and 1812, resolutions were directed to the President requesting information on various subjects. The President is not considered a department head, but resolutions of inquiry can still be directed to him. The House requested copies of instructions given to the U.S. Minister at London regarding impressment of American seamen by Great Britain, with exceptions for confidential negotiations. In 1876, a resolution asked President Ulysses S. Grant about executive offices performed away from the established seat of Government since 1869, and the necessity and compliance with the 1790 act of Congress. President Grant chose to disclose constitutional reasons for declining to provide information requested by the House regarding executive offices performed away from the established seat of Government since 1869. He stated that congressional interest in this matter did not align with the powers of legislation or impeachment outlined in the Constitution. President Grant declined to provide information requested by the House regarding executive offices performed away from the established seat of Government, stating that it did not align with legislative or impeachment powers outlined in the Constitution. Other Presidents have provided information for impeachment proceedings, but Grant argued that the request was not in line with constitutional guarantees protecting citizens from self-incrimination. President Grant refused to provide information requested by the House regarding executive duties performed outside the capital, citing constitutional protections against self-incrimination. He emphasized the necessity for Presidents to conduct official business outside the nation's capital and highlighted the House's power to investigate public officers. President Grant defended his refusal to provide information on executive duties outside the capital, citing constitutional protections. He emphasized the need for Presidents to conduct official business outside the nation's capital and highlighted the House's power to investigate public officers. Grant stated that no act of Congress could limit his constitutional duty to discharge governmental functions outside the capital. The resolution entered into by President Harry Truman and Prime Minister Winston Churchill in January 1952, involving potential deployment of US Armed Forces beyond the country's borders, faced debate in Congress. Supporters saw it as non-binding, with Representative John Martin Vorys clarifying that it couldn't compel the Executive to respond. In 1979, a resolution of inquiry (H.Res. 291) requested certain facts from the President, but discretion over information release to Congress has been given to department heads. Representative James P. Richards argued that the President can refuse to disclose information deemed dangerous to national interests. The resolution of inquiry (H.Res. 291) requested information from the President regarding oil shortages and refinery capacity. It was adopted 340 to 4, and committees have various options when dealing with such resolutions. An adverse report may include information from the executive branch, potentially leading to compliance without further congressional action. Resolutions of inquiry can be amended at the committee level before reaching the House floor. In 1980, the House passed H.Res. 745 directing President Jimmy Carter to provide information on Billy Carter's role as a Libyan government agent. The House Judiciary Committee approved the resolution with amendments, including those from the Foreign Affairs Committee. The Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence also reported on classified material related to Libya and Billy Carter, finding the Administration in compliance. Representative Peter Rodino successfully moved for the committee amendments to be considered together during floor action. Rodino motioned to table H.Res. 745, citing substantial compliance by the Administration with previous resolutions. However, Representative McClory disagreed, pointing out an omission regarding President Carter's conversation on the Billy Carter investigation. Rodino's motion to table was rejected in a vote of 124 to 260. The House voted to agree to the resolution after rejecting Rodino's motion to table it. The committee's adverse report on a resolution of inquiry does not necessarily mean opposition, as executive branch documents may bring substantial compliance. An example from 1979 involved a resolution directing President Carter to provide information on the energy crisis. The House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce reported unfavorably on a resolution regarding oil supplies, criticizing the Department of Energy for not collecting all necessary information in a timely manner. 21 additional Members joined as sponsors of the resolution within a week. The House Committee criticized the Department of Energy for lacking timely and vital information on secondary stocks and actual sales of products. The department's information was often delayed due to long lag times in data collection and heavy reliance on unverified industry data, despite clear directives from Congress. The committee reported the resolution adversely, citing reasons such as the department providing requested documents but much of the information being confidential or proprietary. The House Committee criticized the Department of Energy for lacking timely and vital information on secondary stocks and actual sales of products. The committee reported the resolution adversely, citing reasons such as the substantial cost of reproducing confidential documents and the inadequate nature of the information available. The Congress has the right to information, but a resolution of inquiry is not the best way to obtain it. Representative Dingell acknowledged the Energy Department's data but criticized its timeliness. He emphasized the importance of continued congressional inquiry for clear information on energy supplies, demands, and prices. Several Members of Congress expressed dissatisfaction with the quality of departmental data during a debate on the resolution for an inquiry. Minority Leader John J. Rhodes noted that the technical answers provided were incomprehensible and did not inform the House or the American people adequately. During a debate on the resolution for an inquiry, Representative Dingell expressed support for the resolution but mentioned that the vote would not provide any new information beyond what was already available to his Republican colleagues. Representative Dingell expressed support for the resolution of inquiry, pledging to persist in efforts to obtain desired information. The resolution passed with a vote of 340 to 4. In 1986, Representative Panetta introduced a resolution to receive documents on the Administration's use of funds for Nicaraguan assistance, which was recommended favorably by a House subcommittee. The subcommittee recommended reporting adversely if information on six categories was not provided by the Administration. Representative Panetta found the Administration in compliance with the resolution but lacking monitoring procedures for humanitarian assistance to the Contras. He wrote to the full committee chairman stating the Administration had complied with his inquiry. The House Judiciary Committee reported a resolution of inquiry adversely in 1980, which directed the Attorney General to provide evidence related to the Abscam investigation involving Members of Congress. The Justice Department opposed the resolution, citing concerns about its implications. The House Judiciary Committee raised objections to disclosing evidence related to the Abscam investigation, citing concerns about jeopardizing ongoing investigations and potentially harming the reputations of innocent individuals. The House Standards of Official Conduct Committee also opposed the resolution of inquiry and was negotiating with the Justice Department for access to evidence. Additionally, two subcommittees of the House Judiciary Committee were planning hearings on the standards for the Justice Department's undercover operations, particularly involving Members of Congress. During House debate, concerns were raised about the separation of powers and the potential for the executive branch to compromise the independence of Congress in the Abscam investigation. Congress chose not to interfere with Justice Department prosecutions to avoid appearing self-serving. Some Members worried that releasing evidence could benefit those facing criminal charges and give the impression of lawmakers having greater protection. The House voted 404 to 4 to table a resolution of inquiry, showing a preference for timely legislative investigations over waiting for the Justice Department or Independent Counsel. This was seen in the Iran-Contra case, where Congress prioritized its own investigation over potential prosecutions. Lawrence Walsh, the independent counsel for Iran-Contra, acknowledged Congress's power to grant immunity, even if it meant potentially hindering prosecutions. In 1971, a motion to discharge a committee was privileged after a resolution of inquiry was not reported within the required timeframe. The resolution directed the release of documents related to federal funds for busing schoolchildren to achieve racial balance. In 1971, a resolution for busing to achieve racial balance was referred to the Committee on Education and Labor. When the committee failed to report the resolution within the deadline, Representative Collins moved to discharge the committee, which was agreed to by a vote of 252 to 129. Representative O'Neill expressed uncertainty about the resolution's meaning and clarified that the vote was not for or against busing, but for or against receiving information from HEW. Representative O'Neill clarified that the vote on the resolution was not about busing but about receiving information from HEW. He expressed support for the resolution and urged other Members to vote for it. Representative Perkins admitted forgetting about the resolution and suggested the sponsor could have obtained the information from HEW directly. Representative Green emphasized that the resolution was a request for information, not a legislative bill, and asked for details on busing expenditures and regulations within 60 days. The House passed a resolution to obtain information from HEW regarding busing guidelines and regulations for achieving racial balance. Resolutions of inquiry have been used by the House to gather information on defense and military matters, with a notable instance during the Vietnam War to access the \"Pentagon Papers.\" Representative Bella Abzug criticized the limited access provided to Members for reviewing the 47-volume study. H.Res. 489 and H.Res. 490 directed the President to provide the House of Representatives with the full text of the Pentagon Papers within fifteen days. The resolutions were reported adversely by the House Armed Services Committee and tabled on the floor. In 1971, the House also considered resolutions to obtain information on U.S. covert operations in Laos, including H.Res. 492 which directed the Secretary of State to provide any documents on CIA operations in Laos to the House. The House considered resolutions to obtain information on U.S. covert operations in Laos, including guidelines for CIA operations, foreign armed forces operations, bombing operations, and Agency for International Development operations in Laos. Representative Benjamin Rosenthal criticized the administration for refusing to disclose details of the CIA's war in Laos. The House considered resolutions to obtain information on U.S. covert operations in Laos, including guidelines for CIA operations, foreign armed forces operations, bombing operations, and Agency for International Development operations in Laos. Despite reports in the media, Congress lacked official information on U.S. involvement in Laos, leading to resolutions being tabled without further action. The House held hearings on H.Res. 918, a resolution of inquiry introduced by Representative Abzug regarding U.S. bombing in Vietnam. The resolution requested specific facts on military personnel, sorties flown, tonnage of bombs, and other statistics. Representative Abzug criticized the Nixon administration's commitment to a full-scale air war in Indochina. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Dennis J. Doolin provided information on the resolution, which was reported adversely. During the floor debate on H.Res. 918, the resolution was reported adversely, 32 to 4. Chairman F. Edward H\u00e9bert explained that the information sought was available in committee files for Congress to see. Representative William J. Randall noted that answers to questions were provided during executive session. The House floor debate on the Abzug resolution, which was ultimately tabled with a vote of 270 to 113, focused on obtaining information from the Administration regarding military operations in Vietnam. Some Members objected to the resolution's request for a target date for full independence for Saigon. Despite not passing, the resolution prompted the Administration to provide information to the Armed Services Committee and individual Members. In 1973, the House requested information on military operations in Cambodia and Laos, including the number of sorties flown, tonnage of bombs dropped, and aircraft lost. The House Armed Services Committee reviewed specific questions in a hearing, urging the Defense Department to be responsive and provide information in open session. If needed, classified information could be discussed in closed session. Deputy Assistant Secretary Doolin provided answers to questions in an open session, except for Question 10 which was delayed by 24 hours. Question 18 on legal authority for military activity in Cambodia and Laos since 1973 was addressed by DOD General Counsel Buzhardt in a legal analysis during the hearing. All information provided by Doolin and Buzhardt was in open session. During the hearing, Deputy Assistant Secretary Doolin answered questions, with Question 10 delayed by 24 hours. DOD General Counsel Buzhardt addressed Question 18 on legal authority for military activity in Cambodia and Laos since 1973. The resolution asking for information was deemed moot, and the committee voted 36 to zero to report it adversely. The answers to the questions were placed in the Congressional Record, and the resolution was then tabled. Some resolutions of inquiry have led to Congress taking legislative actions to address lack of information from the Administration. For example, H.Res. 552 sought information on the proposed sale of missiles to Jordan, triggering supplemental hearings after partial answers were provided by the Administration. President Ford responded to the resolution with answers to 20 questions, but there were doubts about its validity. The committee chairman questioned the validity of H.Res. 552 as a \"privileged resolution of inquiry\" under House rules. The resolution was tabled on June 26 because it required investigation by the President to answer some questions. Representative Rosenthal agreed to withhold a motion to call up the resolution for House action in exchange for committee hearings. The hearings were crucial as Congress was deciding whether to block the sale by passing a resolution of disapproval under Section 36(b) of the Foreign Military Sales Act. Representative Rosenthal criticized the lack of formal announcement and notification to Congress regarding a proposed arms sale. The Administration acknowledged the sale, with formal notice reaching Congress on July 10. Congress had until July 30 to pass a resolution of disapproval under Section 36(b) of the Foreign Military Sales Act. On July 14, Representative Jonathan Bingham and 10 other Members introduced H.Con.Res. 337 to disapprove the sale of missiles. Hearings were held on July 16 and 17, with objections raised by eight Members of Congress. President Ford withdrew the proposed sale on July 28 and negotiated a compromise on September 16, limiting the missiles to \"defensive and non-mobile antiaircraft weapons.\" In 1991, Representative Barbara Boxer and colleagues introduced H.Res. 19 to call for information on casualty estimates, biological and chemical weapons, and financial assistance. After the war began, Representatives Charles Schumer and Leon Panetta introduced H.R. 586 on January 18, requiring regular reports on U.S. military expenditures and financial contributions from other countries. The House moved to pass H.R. 586 on February 21 to avoid a resolution of inquiry deadline. During the debate, concerns were raised about the General Accounting Office not having access to war-related costs. Representative Schumer emphasized the need for transparency in financial reporting. After the introduction of H.R. 586 by Representatives Schumer and Panetta, lawmakers sought answers on allies' financial contributions during the war. Specific information was provided by Brent Scowcroft in response to H.Res. 19. H.R. 586 passed overwhelmingly, leading to a debate on H.Res. 19 which was ultimately tabled. Representative Fascell highlighted the resolution of inquiry's role in prompting the executive branch to provide necessary information to Congress. In 1995, a resolution of inquiry was introduced by Representative Marcy Kaptur regarding the Mexican peso rescue package. The House committee voted to report the resolution favorably, with a substitute directing the President to submit documents \"if not inconsistent with the public interest.\" This resolution aimed to gather information on actions taken to strengthen the Mexican peso and stabilize the economy of Mexico. The House adopted a resolution establishing a deadline for the White House to provide documentary material, but the Administration requested an extension until May 15. By April 6, the Treasury Department had supplied Congress with thousands of pages of documents. Representative Dennis Kucinich introduced a resolution to give the House access to the Iraqi declaration on weapons of mass destruction. The House requested access to the Iraqi declaration on weapons of mass destruction, which was provided to the UN Security Council on December 7, 2002. Representative Kucinich urged the Administration to release the document for evaluation. The Administration eventually gave a copy to the House on March 7, rendering a resolution moot. The House International Relations Committee voted adversely on H.Res. 68. On March 7, the Speaker directed the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to retain custody of classified documents. A significant increase in resolutions of inquiry was seen in the 108th and 109th Congresses, with a total of 53 introduced, surpassing the number introduced in the previous 25 years combined. During the 109th Congress, a record number of resolutions of inquiry were introduced, surpassing the total from the previous 25 years combined. These resolutions have historically been effective in obtaining information from the executive branch, even if they are reported adversely or tabled. In the 111th Congress, eight resolutions of inquiry have been introduced so far. Resolutions of inquiry are increasingly used in Congress to obtain information from the executive branch when other avenues have been exhausted. They can trigger additional congressional methods of obtaining information and are a way for Members to bring attention to an issue and potentially initiate further investigations."
