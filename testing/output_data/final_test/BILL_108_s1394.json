    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Money Follows the Person Act of 2003\". In his budget for fiscal year 2004, President George W. Bush proposes a \"Money Follows the Person\" initiative under Medicaid to help States rebalance their long-term services support systems between institutional and community-based services. This initiative aims to address the imbalance in Medicaid funding, where approximately 70 percent is currently spent on nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities. Only 30 percent of Medicaid funding is spent on community-based services, leading to long waiting lists. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 highlighted discrimination in institutionalization, with the Supreme Court ruling in Olmstead v. LC that needless institutionalization is discriminatory. The Supreme Court found that confinement in an institution diminishes individuals' everyday activities, impacting family relations, social contacts, work options, economic independence, education, and cultural enrichment. Additional resources are needed to help states rebalance their long-term services support system and comply with the Olmstead decision. SEC. 3. AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT MEDICAID DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS. In this section, definitions are provided for terms related to community-based services and supports, individual's representative, and Medicaid long-term care facility. The Medicaid program is defined as the State medical assistance program under title XIX of the Social Security Act. The Secretary refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the State is defined in relation to the Medicaid program. States can apply to the Secretary for approval to provide community-based services to eligible individuals in long-term care facilities. The State can apply for approval to provide community-based services to eligible individuals in long-term care facilities who have resided there for at least 90 days and require the same level of care. The State must continue to provide these services under the Medicaid program for as long as the individual remains eligible. The State must provide community-based services to eligible individuals in long-term care facilities, allowing them to choose the setting for these services. The State also needs to educate eligible individuals about the demonstration project. The State must ensure individuals in long-term care facilities have the opportunity to choose community-based services under the demonstration project. They should be informed and supported in making this choice, with a quality improvement system in place for adequate services. Public participation is required in the project's design and development. The demonstration project design must include participation from individuals with disabilities, elderly individuals, or individuals with chronic conditions. Federal funds supplement, not replace, State funds for community-based services under Medicaid. The Secretary will approve demonstration projects through a competitive application process. The Secretary will conduct a competitive application process for applications meeting requirements under subsection (c), with preferences considered. Waivers may be granted for certain requirements of the Social Security Act. The Secretary will give preference to approving applications for demonstration projects that focus on improving community-based long-term services for individuals with disabilities and preventing their entry into Medicaid long-term care facilities. The Secretary will prioritize demonstration projects that enhance community-based long-term services for individuals with disabilities and prevent their entry into Medicaid long-term care facilities. Additionally, states are encouraged to engage in systemic reform activities to rebalance Medicaid expenditures towards community services and address the needs of underserved populations. Collaboration between public entities is also emphasized. The curr_chunk discusses the need for collaboration between public housing agencies, the State Medicaid agency, and other entities to coordinate strategies for obtaining community integrated housing and supportive services for individuals participating in a demonstration project. This includes developing policies to transfer or integrate funds from the State Medicaid agency. The curr_chunk discusses the transfer of funds from State budget accounts for medicaid long-term care facilities to community-based services when individuals transition to the community. The Secretary will pay each State with a demonstration project 100% of their expenditures. The State will receive 100 percent of its expenditures for community-based services for individuals in the demonstration project. The report to the Secretary must include information on the types of community-based services provided. The Secretary will require information on the types of community-based services, number of individuals served, expenditures, savings, and changes in the State's long-term services system. A uniform data format will be developed for States to use in reporting. The Secretary will use up to one-half of 1 percent of the appropriated amount for evaluations. Funds appropriated for fiscal years 2004 through 2008, totaling $350,000,000 annually, will be used for evaluation of demonstration projects, technical assistance to States, and data collection. The funds will remain available until September 30, 2008."
