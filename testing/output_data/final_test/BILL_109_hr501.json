    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Fairness and Accountability in Broadcasting Act\". It includes findings related to broadcasting. The Congress finds that broadcasters have an obligation to promote the public interest due to receiving free licenses worth billions of dollars. The FCC previously required stations to air all sides of important issues, but since the Fairness Doctrine was rescinded, there has been a rise in highly partisan content. The country has seen a rise in highly partisan news outlets and ownership groups, leading to unbalanced news coverage. Talk radio predominantly presents a conservative viewpoint, with little attention given to other perspectives. This imbalance hinders listeners from receiving a range of opinions needed for informed decision-making. An April 2004 poll by Media Matters for America showed strong support for restoring fairness and balance rules on public airwaves. Democracy relies on an informed citizenry with diverse views for effective political decision-making. SEC. 2. IMPLEMENTATION OF PUBLIC INTEREST STANDARDS. Implementation of Public Interest Standard under Section 309 of the Communications Act of 1934 aims to restore fairness in broadcasting, ensure broadcasters meet public interest obligations, promote diversity, localism, and competition in American media, and hold radio and television broadcasters accountable to local communities by offering diverse views on public importance issues. The Federal Communications Commission requires broadcasting stations to facilitate public dialogue, cover local issues fairly, and hold hearings on community needs and interests to ensure compliance with public interest standards. Each broadcast station licensee must hold two public hearings annually in its community to determine community needs and interests. One hearing must occur two months before applying for license issuance or renewal. Transcripts of these hearings must be placed in the station's public file, made available online, and submitted to the Commission during license renewal. All interested individuals can participate in these hearings. Each broadcast station licensee must document and report programming biannually to cover public importance issues and reflect diverse community interests. Failure to do so may result in petitions to deny license renewal. The FCC may deny license renewal based on the applicant's failure to provide fair opportunities for opposing viewpoints, comply with programming rules, hold required hearings, assess community needs, or report on fairness and diversity. The FCC may deny license renewal if there is evidence of a violation regarding fairness and diversity in local programming. The Commission can conduct a hearing to investigate charges before renewing the license. Other sanctions can also be imposed for non-compliance with these requirements. The FCC must report annually to Congress on petitions to deny license renewals and decisions made on those petitions. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to reduce the term of license from 8 years to 4 years for licenses granted by the FCC after the enactment of this Act."
