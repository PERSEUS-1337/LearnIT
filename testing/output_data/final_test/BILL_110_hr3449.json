    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Guard and Reserve Early Retirement Act of 2007\". Congress acknowledges that members of the Active Components of the US Military Services can receive an immediate annuity after 20 years of service, while members of the Reserve Components must wait until age 60. The contributions of the Guard and Reserve in support of Active Duty missions have significantly increased over the past 15 years, with Reserve Component members actively participating in missions alongside Active Duty members during the Global War on Terrorism. These contributions have been made under various forms of active duty orders. Only a subset of mobilization orders are credited as supporting contingency operations. Enlisted and officers in the Reserve Component must complete professional training for promotion, often through non-paid correspondence courses, while Active Duty personnel are sent on Temporary Duty Assignments. National Guard and Reserve soldiers are not compensated for required professional courses. Members of the Guard and Reserve earn retirement points through training drills and active duty. A minimum of 50 points is needed for a creditable service year. Accumulating retirement points is crucial for the Reserve Component retirement system. Accumulating retirement points is essential for the Reserve Component retirement system as it would streamline eligibility criteria, encourage volunteerism, and improve retention rates. SEC. 3.

Person must meet age and years of service criteria, with exceptions for specific categories of service.

The 20-Year Letter is amended to require 20 years of service for eligibility for retired pay. Additionally, the minimum age for eligibility of nonregular service retirees for health care remains at age 60. The effective date and applicability of these changes are also addressed. The Act and its amendments will take effect within 180 days of enactment and apply to retired pay from that month onwards, except for those under 60 receiving non-regular service retired pay."
