    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Private Property Owners Bill of Rights\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2 as findings and purpose. The Congress finds that Federal environmental programs have deprived private property owners of their rights, violating principles of ownership and control outlined in the Constitution. Private property owners are facing challenges due to Federal policies impacting their rights and leading to costly litigation. A clear Federal policy is needed to guide agencies in implementing environmental laws that affect private property. The current nuisance laws protect property owners from harming neighbors, traditionally enforced at State and local levels. Pollution laws safeguard public health, while habitat protection programs focus on plant and animal welfare. The Act aims to support private property ownership and protect owners' constitutional rights at the Federal level. Private property owners' legal rights are protected by the Federal Government and its representatives. SEC. 3 of the Acts mandates that agency heads must comply with State and tribal laws regarding private property rights and privacy. They should minimize the impact on property owners' legal rights. Additionally, agency heads must establish rules to protect property owners' rights when making decisions that restrict property use. SEC. 4 requires agency heads to obtain written consent from private property owners before entering their property to collect information. The property owner must also be notified of the entry and be informed that any raw data collected must be provided to them at no cost upon request. Subsection (a) allows entry onto property for the purpose of obtaining consent or providing required notice. SEC. 5 prohibits agency heads from using data collected on private property for enforcement without providing the property owner access, a description of how the data was collected, and an opportunity to dispute its accuracy. SEC. 6 grants the right to an administrative appeal for wetlands decisions. Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to allow private property owners to appeal certain actions, such as regulatory jurisdiction determinations, permit denials, and penalty impositions. Private property owners can appeal actions related to their property, with appeals heard by a different official and conducted near the property. Private property owners have the right to appeal actions under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, with appeals heard by a different official near the property. Private property owners or their representatives can appeal certain actions under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, including designations of critical habitat, permit denials for incidental take, terms of incidental take permits, administrative penalties, and orders prohibiting activities. The Endangered Species Act allows property owners to appeal orders limiting property use. Appeals must be heard by a different official and conducted near the property in question. SEC. 8. COMPENSATION FOR TAKING OF PRIVATE PROPERTY. Private property owners deprived of 50% or more fair market value or viable use due to agency action are entitled to compensation. Within 90 days of the agency decision, owners can request compensation. The agency head must provide an offer to purchase the affected property within 180 days of the request. Private property owners affected by agency actions are entitled to compensation, including an offer to purchase the property at fair market value and compensation for any difference in value due to restrictions. Owners have 60 days to accept or reject the offers, with the option to submit the matter for arbitration if both offers are rejected. Arbitration is conducted according to the American Arbitration Association's rules. The arbitration process for private property owners affected by agency actions is conducted according to the real estate valuation arbitration rules of an association. A qualified agency action that deprives a property owner of their property is considered a taking under the Constitution of the United States if the owner accepts the agency's offer or submits to arbitration. Private property owners affected by agency actions can receive compensation through arbitration or by accepting an agency's offer. The agency head must pay the owner within 60 days of acceptance or arbitration decision. Payment can be in the form of fair market value or reduction in value of the property. Private property owners can receive compensation through arbitration or by accepting an agency's offer, which can be in the form of fair market value or a reduction in value of the property. This section does not limit any other remedies available under the Constitution or other laws. If an owner is unsuccessful in seeking compensation under this section and later obtains a final judgment for compensation under the fifth amendment, the agency head responsible for the taking must reimburse the judgment fund. The judgment against the United States can be paid from agency funds for the 2 fiscal years following payment. SEC. 9. DEFINITIONS. For the purpose of this Act, definitions include \"The Acts\" referring to the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, \"Agency head\" as the Secretary or Administrator with jurisdiction, \"Non-Federal person\" as someone not part of the Federal Government or a foreign government, and \"Private property owner\" as a non-Federal person owning property. The curr_chunk defines \"Property\" as land, interest in land, and proprietary water right. It also defines \"Qualified agency action\" as actions under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act or the Endangered Species Act of 1973. SEC. 10.
