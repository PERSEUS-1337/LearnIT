Around 34% of households live in rental housing, with 41% of renters residing in multifamily structures. Different ownership patterns exist based on the size of rental properties, with individual investors owning a majority of small- to medium-sized projects. Investment pools have also increased their presence in the single-family rental market since 2011. Multifamily and commercial mortgages have grown significantly, with multifamily mortgages totaling $908 billion and commercial mortgages totaling $2,233 billion by the end of the third quarter of 2013. These mortgages are typically much larger than single-family mortgages, often reaching millions of dollars. Additionally, many multifamily mortgages, especially those purchased by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are non-recourse, limiting the borrower's liability in case of foreclosure. Multifamily and commercial mortgages, unlike single-family mortgages, are non-recourse with limited borrower liability in foreclosure. They commonly have adjustable interest rates and prepayment penalties, with a typical lifespan of 7-10 years. Refinancing is common at the end of the mortgage term. FHA multifamily mortgages can have longer terms. Single-family mortgages typically have a 30-year term, while multifamily and commercial mortgages are underwritten based on rent collected. Financing for multifamily and commercial properties is customized and may include credit enhancements. All types of mortgages use loan-to-value ratio and mortgage payment to income ratio for risk assessment. Commercial and multifamily properties are purchased for profit, unlike single-family properties. Commercial and multifamily properties are purchased as investments for profit, while owner-occupied homes are bought for shelter. Profitability can be increased by leveraging borrowed money, but this also increases risk. Lenders assess the risk of potential borrowers and may adjust mortgage rates or terms accordingly. Borrowers can reduce lender risk by making a larger downpayment. Balloon payments in commercial or multifamily mortgages allow for a larger mortgage with the same cash flow. Soft bullets offer the option to extend the mortgage, while hard bullets do not. Refinancing is common for these mortgages due to the shorter terms. Prepayments in multifamily and commercial mortgages can pose risks for lenders when interest rates decline. Lenders prefer loans with prohibitions on prepayments or penalties to mitigate this risk. Borrowers, on the other hand, prefer terms that allow prepayments without penalties or higher interest rates. Multifamily and commercial mortgages often require defeasance, where borrowers must provide U.S. Treasury bonds to match the cash flow of the mortgage when prepaying. The shorter multifamily and commercial mortgage life reduces the incentive for prepayment, allowing property owners to increase leverage when refinancing. Nonrecourse features shift foreclosure costs from borrower to lender. Reserve accounts are often required for these mortgages. Reserve accounts are required for multifamily and commercial mortgages, expanding on escrow requirements for single-family mortgages. Homeowners make monthly payments for property taxes and insurance into an escrow account. Commercial or multifamily reserve accounts may include payments for major items like a new roof or HVAC system. Congressional interest has shifted towards reforming the single-family and multifamily mortgage markets post-recession. Key debate revolves around the federal government's role in residential mortgages. The debate revolves around the federal government's role in residential mortgage markets, including multifamily housing. Bills in Congress aim to wind down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, replacing them with a National Mortgage Market Utility without a government guarantee. The PATH Act proposes reforms to the Federal Housing Administration and aims to improve its finances. In the Senate, the Housing Finance Reform and Taxpayer Protection Act of 2013 suggests winding down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, replacing them with the Federal Mortgage Insurance Corporation to support the mortgage market. The FMIC would regulate mortgage-backed securities with a federal guarantee, taking over the GSEs' multifamily finance role. Securitization spreads risks globally, impacting U.S. investors. Concerns arose during the recession about delinquency rates in various real estate sectors. The owners of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village defaulted on $4.4 billion in mortgages, settling their debt by turning the properties over to lenders. The government's risk from mortgage markets has decreased as the economy recovered, with federal guarantees playing a key role. FDIC-insured depositories, especially small banks, have significant exposure to multifamily and commercial mortgages. FDIC insurance is funded by assessments on insured deposits, which could potentially prove inadequate. The FDIC could raise assessments on banks or seek special appropriations from Congress or Treasury for additional funds. FHA guarantees mortgages on various types of properties and must honor its guarantees to lenders if property owners default. The federal government implicitly backs Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's guarantees on mortgage-backed securities, with investors assuming government intervention if needed. Treasury invested over $187 billion in GSEs to maintain solvency. Despite recent profitability, Treasury may need to buy more preferred stock and issue debt. Mortgage markets are improving with decreasing delinquencies, rising real estate prices, and increasing mortgage volume. Commercial property prices are recovering, with no signs of excessive valuation. Multifamily and commercial delinquency rates are also declining. In the third quarter of 2013, multifamily and commercial delinquency rates continued to decline, reflecting overall economic gains. Improvements in property performance, values, and mortgage financing availability led to decreases in delinquency rates for major investor groups. Property values for home, multifamily, and commercial properties have increased, reducing loss severity. Commercial and multifamily property prices remained flat in 2001, increased until 2007, then sharply declined in 2008 and 2009. Since 2010, commercial prices have recovered to 90% of their peak, while multifamily prices have fully recovered. The volume of multifamily and commercial mortgages outstanding has generally increased since 2000. Multifamily volume slightly decreased from 2009 to 2012 but has been increasing since then. Commercial mortgages outstanding declined from 2009 to 2013 but have shown some increases since. As of the third quarter of 2013, multifamily and commercial real estate mortgages totaled $3,140.7 billion. The largest holder of commercial and multifamily mortgages is U.S.-chartered depositories, with 54.7% of commercial mortgages and 30.0% of multifamily mortgages. The GSEs hold 27.7% of outstanding multifamily mortgages, with government agencies securitizing an additional 15.3%. Overall, the GSEs and government agencies support 44.5% of multifamily mortgages. U.S.-chartered depository institutions and the GSEs are the largest investors in multifamily mortgages. The GSEs and Ginnie Mae have issued $139 billion of multifamily MBS. Commercial mortgage data is represented in Figure 4. ABS represent 22% of outstanding commercial mortgages. U.S.-chartered depositories hold 55% of commercial mortgages. Mortgage-backed securities pool multifamily and commercial mortgages, allowing institutional lenders to provide mortgage money nationwide efficiently. Some businesses specialize in originating and servicing multifamily and commercial mortgages, while others provide funds for these mortgages. Commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) are created by sponsors who sell mortgages to a trust, creating a \"bankruptcy remote\" entity. CMBS can be divided into tranches to meet different preferences for risk and cash flow. One typical CMBS prospectus aimed to raise $3.3 billion divided into 12 tranches of varying sizes. The CMBS ranged in size from $13 million to $1.2 billion and was divided into three separate REMICs. REMICs are tax pass-throughs, meaning holders are taxed but the REMIC itself is not. IRS regulations require REMICs to be \"passively\" managed to maintain tax pass-through status. IRS Revenue Procedure 2009-45 allows mortgage modifications before default if there is a significant risk of default. The contract between the MBS servicer and investors may prevent modifications that could lead to default of the loan without jeopardizing the REMIC's tax status. Underwriting mortgages involves assessing the risks and profitability of a loan application. Certain modifications are allowed in cases of imminent default or to reduce losses on a mortgage. Underwriting a loan application involves estimating the borrower's ability to repay on time and the collateral's value in case of default. Single-family mortgage underwriting considers income, payment history, and home value. Commercial and multifamily mortgage underwriting evaluates property income, borrower's repayment ability, and property value in foreclosure. Terms for commercial and multifamily mortgages vary, leading to a review of risks related to missed payments. Commercial and multifamily mortgages require professional appraisals to assess property value and borrower's repayment ability. Unlike single-family appraisals based on comparable sales, commercial and multifamily properties need a market analysis. Underwriting for these mortgages considers the debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and loan to value ratio (LTV) to evaluate cash flow and property value. A DSCR above 1.0 indicates sufficient cash flow to cover mortgage payments. The debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) measures the ability of a property to make mortgage payments, with a ratio above 1.0 indicating sufficient cash flow. Lenders may accept a DSCR below 1.0 for certain loans but require additional funds in a reserve account. The loan to value ratio (LTV) reflects the collateral available in case of default, with a lower LTV indicating a smaller loan on a more valuable property. Mortgage underwriting considers factors like fixed or floating interest rates to determine if the DSCR is adequate. The DSCR measures a property's ability to make mortgage payments, with a ratio above 1.0 indicating sufficient cash flow. Lenders may accept a DSCR below 1.0 for certain loans but require additional funds in a reserve account. The LTV reflects collateral available in case of default, with a lower LTV indicating a smaller loan on a more valuable property. Maximum LTVs for owner-occupied homes with FHA-insured mortgages is 96.5%, while \"conforming\" single-family mortgages above 80% LTV require credit enhancements like borrower-paid mortgage insurance. Multifamily and commercial mortgages do not have comparable maximums. The DSCR indicates the probability of default, while the LTV summarizes the loss severity in case of default."
