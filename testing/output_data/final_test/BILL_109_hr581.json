    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Free Flow of Information Act of 2005\" and outlines conditions for compelled disclosure. Conditions for compelled disclosure under the \"Free Flow of Information Act of 2005\" require a court to determine by clear and convincing evidence that all other avenues have been exhausted before compelling a covered person to testify or produce documents in a federal proceeding related to a criminal investigation or prosecution. The \"Free Flow of Information Act of 2005\" sets conditions for compelled disclosure, requiring clear and convincing evidence that all other avenues have been exhausted before compelling a covered person to testify or produce documents in a federal proceeding related to a criminal investigation or prosecution. Testimony or documents compelled must be essential to the investigation, prosecution, defense, or a dispositive issue of substantial importance in a non-criminal matter. The content of compelled testimony or documents should be limited to verifying published information and relevant surrounding circumstances, and narrowly tailored in subject matter and time period. SEC. 3. COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL INFORMATION. The provisions of section 2 do not apply to a request by a Federal entity for commercial or financial information unrelated to news dissemination by a covered person. SEC. 4. COMPELLED DISCLOSURE PROHIBITED. No Federal entity may compel a covered person to disclose the identity of a confidential source or any information leading to the discovery of such a source. SEC. 5. COMPELLED DISCLOSURE FROM THIRD PARTIES. Conditions for compelled disclosure under sections 2, 3, and 4 apply to testimony or documents related to business transactions between a third party and a covered person. This includes records held by telecommunications or internet service providers for business purposes. Prior to compelling testimony or document disclosure, the party seeking it must provide notice to the covered person involved in the business transaction. Subsection (a) requires notice and an opportunity to be heard before compelling testimony or disclosure from a third party. An exception allows for delaying notice if it poses a threat to a criminal investigation. SEC. 6. ACTIVITIES NOT CONSTITUTING A WAIVER. The publication or dissemination of any testimony or document sought under section 2 shall not waive the requirements of such section. The publication or dissemination of any testimony or document, identity, or information described in section 4 shall not waive the prohibition described in such section. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. The term \"covered person\" in this Act refers to entities that disseminate information through various means such as print, broadcast, electronic, or other methods. This includes publishers, broadcasters, news agencies, employees, contractors, and affiliates of such entities. The term \"third party\" in this Act refers to a person other than a covered person. It includes individuals who are not employees, contractors, or affiliates of entities that disseminate news or information."
