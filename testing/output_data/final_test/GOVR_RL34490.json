The enacted level was $258.47 million less than the requested $4.66 billion. Funding was initially at FY2008 levels until the act was passed. The House subcommittee marked up its version of the FY2009 legislative branch bill with a proposal of approximately $3.4 billion. The annual legislative branch appropriations bill usually contains two titles, with Title I including appropriations for various legislative branch agencies. Title II of the legislative branch appropriations bill contains general administrative provisions and appropriations for legislative branch entities. For example, the FY2003 Act included funds for the John C. Stennis Center for Public Service Training and Development and the Congressional Award Act. Sometimes a third title may be included for other provisions, such as the continuity of representation in the House of Representatives in \"extraordinary circumstances\" in the FY2006 Act. Prior to FY2003, the bill was structured differently with Title I focusing on Congressional Operations. Title II of the legislative branch appropriations bill includes budget authority for various agencies supporting Congress, such as the Botanic Garden, Library of Congress, Government Printing Office, and Government Accountability Office. This funding is separate from Title I, which covers direct support for Congress. The legislative branch appropriations bill historically included additional titles for capital improvements and special functions.
