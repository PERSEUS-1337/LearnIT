    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature aims to establish a green infrastructure program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in major projects funded with state funds by promoting low-emission products. California aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in major projects funded with state funds by promoting low-emission products. Energy-intensive and emissions-intensive products sourced from non-compliant facilities or transported long distances to job sites contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. Ignoring these emissions shifts the burden of reductions to other parts of the economy, placing additional strain on businesses and consumers. Acknowledging these emissions and implementing a procurement process for green products would benefit consumers and help meet California's climate energy goals by 2020. Executive Order B-30-15 by Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. requires state agencies to consider climate change in planning and investment decisions, using full life-cycle cost accounting for infrastructure investments. It also mandates that agencies prioritize climate preparedness and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, Section 10130 of the Public Contract Code defines energy-intensive and emissions-intensive products in infrastructure projects costing over $1 million, focusing on industries like cement manufacturing. The Department is required to report on greenhouse gas emissions associated with energy-intensive products like cement, flat glass, iron, and steel manufacturing. The report must consider emissions from manufacturing and transportation to project sites. The Department must report on greenhouse gas emissions from energy-intensive products like cement, flat glass, iron, and steel manufacturing. Starting January 1, 2018, procurement processes will prioritize products with the lowest emissions profile meeting state agency standards for quality or safety. The reporting requirement will be inactive as of January 1, 2021. The State Air Resources Board identifies energy-intensive, trade-exposed products like cement, flat glass, iron, and steel manufacturing. The University of California Regents must report on greenhouse gas emissions associated with these products by January 1, 2018. The University of California Regents must report on greenhouse gas emissions associated with energy-intensive, emissions-intensive products by January 1, 2018. This information will be incorporated into procurement processes to prioritize products with the lowest emissions profile. Additionally, a new section is added to the Public Contract Code regarding these requirements. Section 10727 of the Public Contract Code defines \"project\" as infrastructure costing $1 million or more and identifies \"energy-intensive\" and \"emissions-intensive\" products in specific industry sectors. The trustees are required to report on greenhouse gas emissions associated with these products by January 1, 2018, for projects under their jurisdiction. As of January 1, 2018, the trustees must include greenhouse gas emissions information for energy-intensive and emissions-intensive products in California State University procurement processes to prioritize products with the lowest emissions profile meeting state agency standards. The requirement for reporting on these products' emissions is inoperative after January 1, 2021."
