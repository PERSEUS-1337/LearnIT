The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to allow local educational agencies formed by consolidating school districts to elect eligibility and funding based on specific former districts. Eligible agencies must have applied for and been determined eligible under Public Law 874 for fiscal year 1994 or earlier. Hold-harmless amounts ensure agencies receive at least 85% of their previous funding levels. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 was amended to allow local educational agencies formed by consolidating school districts to elect eligibility and funding based on specific former districts. Eligible agencies must have applied for and been determined eligible under Public Law 874 for fiscal year 1994 or earlier. Hold-harmless amounts ensure agencies receive at least 85% of their previous funding levels through ratable reductions in payments to local educational agencies. If funds are insufficient to pay all eligible local educational agencies, payments will be reduced proportionally. Any additional funds will increase payments in the same manner they were reduced. SEC. 2. APPLICATIONS FOR INCREASED PAYMENTS. Payments for eligible school districts in South Dakota under the Act of September 30, 1950, are available for fiscal year 1994. The Secretary of Education will use a subgroup of comparable local educational agencies to calculate payments and contribution rates. School districts must apply to receive these payments. The school district must apply for payment within 30 days of the Act's enactment. Local educational agencies that received payments in 1994 are not required to return them to the Federal Government. SEC. 3. MAXIMUM PAYMENTS. The maximum amount that a local educational agency may receive under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is determined by the Secretary based on specific computations involving per-pupil expenditures. The Secretary calculates the amount a local educational agency may receive based on per-pupil expenditures and the number of students served. Payments received by the agency for the fiscal year are subtracted from this amount. Passed the Senate December 22, 1995. Attest: KELLY D. JOHNSTON, Secretary."
