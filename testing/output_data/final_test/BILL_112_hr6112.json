    "content": "The Employee Verification Act may be cited as the official title of this legislation. Congress finds that there were 11.5 million illegal immigrants in the US in 2011, with a high labor force participation rate. The E-Verify Program is mandatory for Federal contractors and employees, with over 350,000 employers currently using it. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled in Chamber of Commerce v. Janet Napolitano that entities entering contracts with the Federal Government may need to electronically verify employment eligibility. Federal contractors and recipients of federal funds are required to participate in the E-Verify program. Federal contractors and subcontractors must elect to participate in the E-Verify Program before receiving any payment under the contract. Compliance with the program's terms and conditions is mandatory. Federal contractors and subcontractors must participate in the E-Verify Program before receiving payment under the contract. The program applies to contractors who employ individuals and have been awarded a contract by the Federal Government for goods or services, as well as subcontractors who meet the same criteria. The Secretary of Homeland Security must ensure that the E-Verify Program is applied to all persons hired by federal contractors and subcontractors to perform work in the United States. This includes employees assigned to work on the contract and subcontractor employees directly engaged in the work. The exceptions to contracts covered under the E-Verify Program for federal contractors and subcontractors include contracts below the simplified acquisition threshold and contracts for commercially available off-the-shelf items or minor modifications. The E-Verify Program for federal contractors and subcontractors excludes contracts with a term of less than 120 days or contracts where all work is done outside the United States. Recipients of federal benefits must elect to participate in the E-Verify Program before receiving the benefit. The E-Verify Program applies to recipients of federal funds who employ individuals and have received a grant, loan, loan guarantee, or cooperative agreement from the Federal Government. The Secretary of Homeland Security ensures that the program is applied to all persons hired during the term of the funding. The amendment applies to recipients of federal funds who employ individuals under grants, loans, loan guarantees, or cooperative agreements for work within the United States. It is effective for contracts, grants, loans, loan guarantees, or cooperative agreements entered into, awarded, renewed, or extended.
