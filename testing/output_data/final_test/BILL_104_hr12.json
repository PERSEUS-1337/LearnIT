    "content": "The \"Family Farm Protection Act\" may be cited as the short title. It addresses the treatment of land under a qualified conservation easement. The \"Family Farm Protection Act\" addresses the estate tax treatment of land subject to a qualified conservation easement. If the executor elects, the value of such land (minus any debt) can be excluded from the gross estate. The \"Family Farm Protection Act\" allows for the exclusion of land under a conservation easement from the gross estate for estate tax purposes. The easement must meet specific criteria, including being located in a metropolitan area and owned by the decedent or their family for at least three years prior to death. The easement must also involve a qualified conservation contribution of a real property interest. The exclusion of land under a conservation easement from the gross estate for estate tax purposes is subject to certain conditions. The exclusion does not apply to the value of any development right retained by the donor in the conveyance of the easement. The tax on any retained development right is only imposed upon the disposition of the property, excluding gifts or devises. The tax on any retained development right is imposed on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the calendar year in which the disposition occurs. The term 'development right' refers to the right to establish or use any structure and surrounding land for commercial purposes not directly supportive of conservation. The election under this subsection applies to land subject to a qualified conservation easement. The election for a conservation easement must be made on the estate tax return and is irrevocable once made. The executor must calculate the potential estate tax due on any retained development right and file a Notice of Potential Estate Tax Due. The executor must report the tax computation on retained development rights and file the necessary notice as prescribed by the Secretary. Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code regarding basis of property acquired from a decedent apply to gross estates including land with qualified conservation easements. The executor must report tax computation on retained development rights and file necessary notice as prescribed by the Secretary. Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code apply to gross estates with qualified conservation easements granted after December 31, 1994. SEC. 3. GIFT TAX ON LAND SUBJECT TO A QUALIFIED CONSERVATION EASEMENT. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code exempts the transfer of land with a qualified conservation easement from gift tax. This applies to gifts made by donors and is effective for gifts of land with conservation easements. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code exempts gifts of land with qualified conservation easements from gift tax for taxable years ending after December 31, 1994. SEC. 4. EXCLUSION OF GAIN FROM SALE OF CERTAIN FARMLAND. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude gain from the sale of farmland restricted to farming use. The Internal Revenue Code excludes gain from the sale of farmland if there is a qualified covenant restricting its use to farming purposes. Farmland is defined as real property used for farming within the United States. A qualified covenant is an irrevocable agreement entered into by all owners of the farmland. The covenant applies to all owners of farmland, binding future owners as well. The use of farmland includes using it as the operator's principal residence. To qualify, owners must notify the Secretary and submit a copy of the covenant. The table of sections for the part is amended by replacing section 137 with a new entry. The amendments made by this section apply to covenants first recorded after December 31, 1994, in taxable years ending after that date."
