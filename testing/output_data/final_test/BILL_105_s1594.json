    "content": "The Act titled \"Digital Signature and Electronic Authentication Law (SEAL) of 1998\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 outlines the findings and purposes of the Act. Congress finds that technology has significantly impacted the operations of banks and financial institutions, affecting document management, fund transactions, and customer service. Financial transactions are increasingly conducted over electronic networks, raising concerns about verifying parties' identities and ensuring information security. Banks play a crucial role in facilitating financial transactions over electronic media like the Internet, ensuring secure information transmission among parties. Closed system transactions may involve agreements or system rules previously established by the parties. If system rules and agreements are valid under applicable law, electronic authentication can be used as per the terms and conditions. Electronic authentication is crucial for market-driven development and should not be prematurely regulated to avoid hindering technology use in financial transactions and inhibiting electronic commerce. Congress should enable a framework for banks to participate in electronic commerce without unnecessary regulation, with appropriate oversight. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System should consult on these matters. The Act aims to facilitate electronic commerce and banking by consulting with regulators, protecting consumer interests, and avoiding premature regulation that could hinder development and security.
