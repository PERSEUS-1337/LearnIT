    "content": "The United States is the largest foreign direct investor in the world, with foreign direct investment reaching $2.6 trillion by 2011. The U.S. economy is highly enmeshed with the global economy through direct investment, leading to important economic, political, and social interests in international policies. The U.S. treats foreign investors favorably and has been a leader in global efforts regarding direct investment over the past 50 years. The United States has led efforts internationally for reduced restrictions on foreign direct investment and equal treatment of foreign and domestic investors. Some Members have questioned this policy post-9/11, advocating for greater consideration of the impact of foreign investment on the economy and national security. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) reviews and investigates foreign investments in the country. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) oversees national security implications of foreign investment in the economy. Established in 1975, it gained more prominence in 1988 with the Exon-Florio provision granting the President discretionary authority to act on proposed investments. The President has the authority to suspend or prohibit foreign acquisitions that threaten national security if other laws are inadequate and credible evidence exists. CFIUS may not investigate further if no credible evidence is found. The President has almost unlimited power to take appropriate action in such cases. The President has almost unlimited authority to suspend or prohibit foreign acquisitions that threaten national security, with determinations not subject to judicial review. CFIUS focuses on transactions involving products or key technologies essential to the U.S. defense industrial base, implementing the law to protect national security. The Exon-Florio provision allows the President to implement measures to protect national security in foreign investments, while balancing public concerns and international obligations. Congress aimed to strengthen the President's authority in foreign investment policy and limit its own role, emphasizing the commercial nature of transactions free from political considerations. The Exon-Florio provision empowers the President to safeguard national security in foreign investments, guided by policy directives from the President. Foreign investors face restrictions in sectors like maritime, aircraft, banking, resources, and power to prevent foreign control for national defense reasons. The Exon-Florio process involves three steps to review foreign mergers, acquisitions, or takeovers for national security threats. CFIUS has specific timeframes for review and investigation, with the President having the authority to make final decisions. The term national security is not clearly defined, but each CFIUS member applies their agency's definition during the process. The Department of Defense has developed the National Industrial Security Program (NISP) to prevent foreign firms from gaining unauthorized access to critical technology and classified information through acquisitions of U.S. firms. This review process is separate from CFIUS and was strengthened by Congress in 2007 through the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007. Congress enhanced oversight capabilities of CFIUS by requiring greater reporting and increasing reporting requirements. The meaning of national security was expanded to include critical infrastructure and homeland security. The Director of National Intelligence must conduct reviews of investments posing a threat to national security. Additional factors are required for assessing foreign investments, including implications for critical infrastructure. CFIUS must investigate all foreign investment transactions involving entities owned or controlled by foreign governments. The ownership or control of a foreign entity by a foreign government is now under stricter scrutiny by the United States. This shift in policy places the burden of proof on firms owned by foreign governments to prove they do not pose a threat to national security. While the number of such transactions is small compared to total foreign investments, it has been increasing. In 2012, concerns arose over Chinese investments in the US, similar to past Japanese investments. The House Committee on Intelligence recommended CFIUS block acquisitions involving Huawei and ZTE due to security threats posed by Chinese telecommunications companies. Legislative proposals should expand CFIUS to include purchasing agreements involving Huawei and ZTE to address national security risks. Increased information sharing among private sector entities and an expanded role for CFIUS in purchasing agreements could help mitigate threats from telecommunications companies with nation-state ties. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission highlighted concerns over Chinese investments in critical infrastructure. The report raised concerns about economic distortions and national security risks from China's state-led economic growth. Recommendations included mandatory reviews for Chinese state-owned companies investing in the US and adding an economic benefit test to the national security test for CFIUS. Legislation could amend CFIUS to include an economic benefit test for Chinese investments in the US, extend jurisdiction to cover new industrial investments, and prohibit foreign investment in industries where the investor's government prohibits foreign investment. Notable Chinese investments in the US included Sany Group's wind farm project and Wanxiang's acquisition of A123 Systems Inc. In 2012, Ralls acquired assets from Terna Energy SA without reporting to CFIUS. The U.S. Navy objected to Ralls placing wind turbines near restricted airspace, leading to a full investigation. President Obama blocked the investment, citing national security concerns. The Ralls Corporation challenged the Obama Administration's decision to block their investment in an Oregon wind farm project, but the court dismissed the suit citing lack of jurisdiction. The court ruled that the President had broad authority to take appropriate action under the CFIUS statute, and rejected Ralls' argument of unfair treatment under the Due Process Clause. The court ruled that Ralls Corporation was treated unfairly under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, but lacked jurisdiction due to the CFIUS statute. Ralls' due process claim focused on access to evidence used in Presidential Determinations, which is classified information. Ralls has appealed the case. In contrast, China's Wanxiang Group received CFIUS approval to acquire A123 Systems for $257 million. Wanxiang Group outbid other buyers with a $257 million offer for A123 Systems, a US company. Concerns were raised by some Members of Congress and the Strategic Materials Advisory Council about the acquisition jeopardizing national energy security. A123 Systems had previously received a federal grant of nearly $250 million for clean energy, but half was never released. The company manufactures lithium-ion batteries for various vehicles. Congressional attitudes towards the Exon-Florio provision shifted after the 9/11 attacks and concerns over lack of responsiveness by the administration. After the 9/11 attacks, Congress passed the USA PATRIOT Act which defined \"critical infrastructure\" as vital systems and assets for national security. This included sectors like telecommunications. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is responsible for identifying critical infrastructure in the United States, including sectors like telecommunications, energy, financial services, water, and transportation. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 added key resources to the list of critical infrastructure, defining them as essential for the economy and government operations. DHS identified 17 sectors as critical infrastructure and assigned primary responsibility for their protection. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) designates critical infrastructure sectors to various Federal departments and agencies as Sector-Specific Agencies (SSAs). Critical Manufacturing was added as the 18th sector on the CI/KR list in 2008. Some policymakers argue that economic activities should be protected from foreign investment to maintain national security. Some policymakers argue that including critical infrastructure and homeland security in P.L. 110-49 did not change the focus of the Exon-Florio provision on investments affecting U.S. national defense. Congress and the Bush Administration clashed over CFIUS-approved transactions, revolving around issues of foreign control of U.S. firms, defining national security, and targeting economic activities for review. Concerns also arose about risks from foreign investments by firms owned or controlled by foreign governments post-9/11, highlighted by the Dubai Ports World case. There were differences between Congress and the Bush Administration over the operations of CFIUS and its objectives, particularly regarding foreign investment and national security post-9/11. Some Members of Congress felt CFIUS was not aligned with the broader view of economic national security. In early 2011, there were requests for the Obama Administration to support a recommendation by CFIUS to block a transaction. The Obama Administration supported a recommendation by CFIUS to block Huawei Technologies' acquisition of 3Leaf Systems over national security concerns. Huawei withdrew its acquisition attempt. A broader discussion on foreign investment's national economic security implications ensued, reflecting differing assessments and political convictions among Members of Congress and administrations."
