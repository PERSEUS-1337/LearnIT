    "content": "Efficient exploration in reinforcement learning is a challenge due to heteroscedasticity in returns. Information-Directed Sampling (IDS) is proposed as a solution, incorporating parametric uncertainty and observation noise. A novel approximation of IDS for deep Q-learning shows significant improvement in Atari games. In Reinforcement Learning (RL), agents aim to maximize rewards by balancing exploration and exploitation. Popular exploration strategies like -greedy focus on undirected exploration, while statistically-efficient methods like upper confidence bound (UCB) and Thompson sampling (TS) use uncertainty measures for exploration. In RL, exploration strategies like UCB and TS have been extended for large state-spaces, but struggle with heteroscedastic noise. IDS is proposed for efficient exploration in RL. The IDS framework is used for efficient exploration in RL by balancing regret and information gain. A novel RL algorithm based on IDS combines distributional RL and parameter uncertainty methods to account for heteroscedastic noise. Evaluation on Atari 2600 games shows significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art algorithms. Our approach outperforms other algorithms focusing on uncertainty modeling. We developed a tractable IDS algorithm for RL in large state spaces, inspired by exploration strategies like UCB and TS. TS, a Bayesian model-based approach, often yields better results than optimistic strategies. Extending TS to RL requires maintaining a balance between regret and information gain. In extending Thompson Sampling (TS) to Reinforcement Learning (RL), maintaining a distribution over Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is challenging. Bootstrapped DQN uses an ensemble of Q-functions to explore, while O'Donoghue et al. propose TS with an uncertainty Bellman equation for propagating uncertainty in Q-values. Additionally, they suggest using the Q-ensemble of Bootstrapped DQN to obtain confidence intervals for a UCB policy. The Q-ensemble of Bootstrapped DQN is used to approximate confidence intervals for a UCB policy. Various methods exist to approximate parametric posterior in neural networks, but distributional RL algorithms like Categorical DQN (C51) and Quantile Regression DQN (QR-DQN) directly approximate the distribution over Q-values. However, these methods do not utilize return distribution for exploration and use -greedy exploration. Implicit Quantile Networks (IQN) instead use a risk-sensitive policy based on a learned return distribution. Our method builds on previous approaches by combining return and parametric uncertainty for exploration in reinforcement learning. Unlike existing methods like C51 and QR-DQN, which use -greedy exploration, Implicit Quantile Networks (IQN) adopt a risk-sensitive policy based on a learned return distribution. Our method, based on Information-Directed Sampling (IDS), addresses parametric uncertainty and heteroscedasticity in return distribution. It extends IDS to finite MDPs, but previous approaches are impractical for large state spaces. The agent-environment interaction is modeled with a MDP (S, A, R, P, \u03b3), where policies map states to action distributions. The discounted return of action a in state s is a random variable Z \u03c0 (s, a) = \u221e t=0 \u03b3 t R(s t , a t ), with initial state s = s 0 and action a = a 0. The objective is to find an optimal policy \u03c0 * that maximizes the expected total discounted return. RL algorithms often use a point estimate of the Q-function, but this can lead to inefficiencies. Using uncertainty information can improve exploration efficiency. Parametric uncertainty arises from ambiguity over models, while intrinsic uncertainty is due to stochasticity in the environment. BID27 uses a Bootstrapped DQN with an ensemble of Q-functions to estimate parametric uncertainty. They train the network by diversifying the Q-ensemble through independent target heads and random initialization. The algorithm uses a categorical distribution to parameterize the return, with atom probabilities based on a softmax distribution. The Bellman update and parameterization have disjoint supports, requiring an additional step for the algorithm. In RL, heteroscedasticity in the return distribution Z depends on state and action. This can occur in various ways, such as the reward function variance depending on state or action. Even in deterministic environments, the observed return variance is affected by stochastic transitions. Partially Observable MDPs also exhibit heteroscedasticity due to states aliasing to the same observation. Value-based RL experiences heteroscedasticity as Bellman targets are based on an evolving policy \u03c0. Temporal Difference (TD) algorithms involve a standard observation model with a learning target generated based on the Bellman target. Heteroscedastic targets are not limited to TD learning methods and also occur in TD(\u03bb) and Monte-Carlo learning. Information-Directed Sampling (IDS) is a bandit algorithm that has been adapted to the frequentist framework. Information-Directed Sampling (IDS) is a bandit algorithm adapted to the frequentist framework, focusing on a single state MDP with a stochastic reward function. The algorithm uses a conservative regret estimate to choose actions and relies on an information gain function. The IDS policy in bandit algorithms is defined by a deterministic IDS, which balances regret and information gain at each time step. Different information-gain functions are introduced with a high-probability bound on cumulative regret. The overall regret bound for IDS matches the best known for the UCB policy for linear and kernelized reward functions. The information gain function I t (a) focuses on maximizing reward under heteroscedastic observation noise, with variance \u03c1(a) 2 explicitly accounting for noise variability. This strategy is advantageous in the Gaussian Process setting, modeling reward distributions with a multivariate Gaussian and positive definite kernel. In the context of deep RL, the IDS strategy is used to maximize reward under observation noise variance. It exploits kernel correlation to reduce uncertainty in high-noise regions with fewer samples. The regret definition captures the loss in return when selecting an action in a state rather than the optimal action. The IDS framework uses a conservative estimate of the Q-function uncertainty by employing neural networks as function approximators and computing confidence bounds with Bootstrapped DQN. This allows for defining a regret surrogate using confidence intervals with a scaling hyperparameter. The IDS framework uses neural networks to estimate Q-function uncertainty and compute confidence bounds with Bootstrapped DQN. This allows for defining a regret surrogate using confidence intervals with a scaling hyperparameter. To use the IDS strategy, the information gain function I_t needs to be computed based on variance estimates and noise distribution. The IDS framework uses neural networks to estimate Q-function uncertainty and compute confidence bounds with Bootstrapped DQN. This allows for defining a regret surrogate using confidence intervals with a scaling hyperparameter. The scale of the return distribution variance in RL can vary based on policy stochasticity, environment, and reward scaling, impacting information gain and exploration. To ensure stable performance across environments, a normalized variance computation is proposed to account for numerical differences and favor consistent risk-taking. The control algorithm in Algorithm 1 computes parametric uncertainty over Q(s, a) and distribution over returns Z(s, a) to minimize regret-information ratio \u03a8(s, a). Parametric uncertainty is estimated using the same training procedure and architecture as Bootstrapped DQN, splitting the DQN architecture into K bootstrap heads trained on the same data. Double DQN targets are used for training. To estimate Z(s, a), weights from the Bootstrapped DQN are shared. The output of the last convolutional layer is used as input for a separate head to estimate Z(s, a). This head is trained using C51 or QR-2. Gradients for distributional loss are not propagated in convolutional layers to isolate noise-sensitive exploration. The representation learned from the bootstrap branch is used for this head. Our method allows for deep exploration by extending uncertainty estimates over sequences of states. In contrast to intrinsic motivation methods, we do not augment the reward function with an exploration bonus. Experimental results on 55 Atari 2600 games show the effectiveness of our approach. Our method, DQN-IDS, extends uncertainty estimates over sequences of states for deep exploration in Atari games. We compare it to C51-IDS, which estimates Z(s, a) using C51. Both versions use the standard DQN architecture without recent improvements like Dueling DQN and prioritized replay. The code for our method can be found at https://github.com/nikonikolov/rltf/tree/ids-drl. C51 network BID4 is implemented on the last convolutional layer of the DQN-IDS architecture, utilizing a target network for Bellman updates with double DQN targets for bootstrap heads. Weights are updated using the Adam optimizer. The algorithm uses specific hyperparameters and a target update frequency. A lower bound on \u03c1(s, a) 2 is set for C51-IDS to prevent fixation on noiseless actions. The C51 network is implemented on the last convolutional layer of the DQN-IDS architecture, with specific hyperparameters and a target update frequency. A lower bound on \u03c1(s, a) 2 is set for C51-IDS to prevent fixation on noiseless actions. The strategy may degenerate as the noise variance of a single action goes to zero. Experiments without this lower bound showed a 23% difference in mean human-normalized score. Hyperparameters from C51 and Bootstrapped DQN are used, with a learning rate of \u03b1 = 0.00005, ADAM = 0.01/32, number of heads K = 10, number of atoms N = 51. Training procedure is similar to BID25, with no -greedy exploration. Episodes start with up to 30 random no-ops and the horizon is capped at 108K frames. Evaluation results are reported under the best agent protocol, with learning frozen every 1M training frames. The DQN-IDS outperforms Bootstrapped DQN by 200% by changing the exploration strategy to IDS. Additionally, DQN-IDS slightly outperforms C51, even though C51 benefits from distributional learning. C51-IDS outperforms C51 and QR-DQN, achieving slightly better results. C51-IDS outperforms C51 and QR-DQN, achieving better results and highlighting the importance of accounting for heteroscedastic noise. The method benefits from using QR-DQN for better approximation of the return distribution. Tuning for risk sensitivity can improve C51-IDS scores, as shown in several games. Our method extends frequentist Information-Directed Sampling to a practical RL exploration algorithm for efficient deep exploration in large state spaces. It demonstrates substantial gains on Atari games by accounting for heteroscedastic noise and utilizing return distribution with parametric uncertainty. Additionally, our evaluation results show the potential of IDS to outperform alternative strategies like Thompson Sampling in RL. Promising directions for future work are also identified. Our preliminary results suggest that combining IDS with continuous control RL methods like DDPG can lead to improvements. Future research directions include developing a computationally efficient version of randomized IDS and exploring alternative information gain functions. IDS is viewed as a design principle rather than a specific algorithm, with potential for further investigation.
