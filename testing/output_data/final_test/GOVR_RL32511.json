    "content": "In 2003, U.S. consumers purchased over $1 billion in prescription drugs from Canada, doubling from the previous year. Efforts to allow Americans to buy drugs from foreign sellers continued despite slower increases in 2004 and 2005. Many use online pharmacies or buy drugs when traveling abroad to countries like Canada or Mexico due to lower costs. Current law restricts the importation of prescription drugs to only manufacturers unless certified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to ensure safety and lower costs for consumers. The program aims to lower drug costs for U.S. consumers by allowing importation of prescription drugs. Many Americans and some Members of Congress want legislation to eliminate restrictions on imports due to price differences. The report focuses on recent legislative proposals to help consumers access safe and less expensive FDA-approved drugs from abroad. It discusses the domestic drug distribution system and Congress's handling of prescription drug importation. The report discusses the current situation of drug importation, including the upsurge in drug imports, state and local government initiatives, reactions from the drug industry and FDA, and legislative proposals. It examines issues related to drug safety, feasibility of a drug import program, and potential cost savings for U.S. consumers. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) has required drugs sold in the US to be safe since 1938, with additional requirements for effectiveness added in 1962. FDA oversees the approval, production, and distribution of prescription drugs to prevent unsafe or adulterated drugs from reaching consumers. Congressional and FDA actions have addressed drug importation by limiting imports, establishing exceptions, and attempting to broaden access. The FDA requires manufacturers to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs before approval. Production facilities must adhere to FDA-approved manufacturing processes and undergo rigorous inspections. Drugs are then distributed through FDA-registered wholesalers, with states licensing pharmacists, wholesalers, physicians, and dentists involved in the distribution process. The current distribution system is based on changes made in the 1980s. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 (PDMA, P.L. 100-293) banned the sale, trade, and purchase of drug samples, mandated storage, handling, and accounting standards for drug samples, and required drug wholesalers to be licensed by states. FDA regulations enforced a detailed \"chain of custody\" for pharmaceutical products to ensure safety and quality, allowing manufacturers to trace back suspected counterfeit shipments. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 enforced a detailed \"chain of custody\" for pharmaceutical products to trace back suspected counterfeit shipments. However, the law created a dilemma for secondary drug distributors who did not receive records or pedigree with the drugs they purchased, making it difficult to show a chain of custody. FDA delayed enforcement of a recordkeeping requirement due to concerns that it would drive many secondary distributors out of business. The FDA implemented a rule in 2006 for electronic pedigrees in the pharmaceutical industry. However, a court issued an injunction a week later. Members have tried to use the agriculture appropriations bill to bypass FDA restrictions on drug importation. The House bill would allow importation of drugs meeting FFDCA requirements, while the Senate bill does not have a similar provision. Supporters successfully applied a strategy to the Department of Homeland Security FY2007 appropriations bill, prohibiting CBP from preventing individuals from importing prescription drugs that comply with the FFDCA. The Senate Committee included Senator Dorgan's drug importation bill in the FTC reauthorization bill, but it did not progress further in Congress. The PDMA limits drug importation to manufacturers, requiring proof of FDA approval. The manufacturer must provide records showing the imported product is the same as an FDA-approved drug in the U.S., handled properly, and if needed, re-labeled for the U.S. market. The FDA and CBP have authority to detain products that may violate U.S. laws. The FDA has been lenient in enforcing restrictions on importing non-FDA-approved drugs for personal use, requiring individuals to affirm in writing that the drugs are for personal use and provide their treating physician's information. The FDA's personal use import policy allows individuals to import drugs for personal use with their treating physician's information. The policy aims to save FDA resources and permit medical treatments not available in the U.S. It was originally intended for compassionate use of drugs not sold in the U.S., but is now used by consumers seeking lower foreign prices. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection enforces the prohibition on prescription drug importation under the FFDCA. From November 2005 to October 2006, CBP detained prescription drugs entering U.S. international mail branches, but later stopped and referred imports to the FDA. The focus shifted to high-risk threats. The revised CBP policy allows individuals to personally carry a 90-day supply of prescription drugs from Canada that meet FFDCA requirements. The policy does not apply to mail shipments, imports from countries other than Canada, or controlled substances. The MEDS Act of 2000 authorized a program for pharmacists and drug wholesalers to import cheaper prescription drugs from foreign suppliers. The MEDS Act of 2000 authorized pharmacists and drug wholesalers to import cheaper prescription drugs from specific industrial countries, with the provision for immediate suspension in case of counterfeiting. However, the implementation was not carried out due to concerns about access to FDA-approved labeling by U.S. importers. The MEDS Act of 2000 allowed for the importation of cheaper prescription drugs from certain countries, but concerns about access to FDA-approved labeling led to its non-implementation. Secretary Tommy G. Thompson in 2001 also declined to implement the law, citing safety concerns and high costs associated with testing imported drugs. As a result, there is currently no legal program for importing prescription drugs other than by the manufacturer. The 108th Congress addressed consumer burden by replacing the MEDS Act of 2000 with the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, which requires certification from the HHS Secretary before implementing a prescription drug import program. Until then, drug imports are illegal unless done by the manufacturer. The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 prohibits pharmacists and wholesalers from importing prescription drugs, with exceptions if certified by the HHS Secretary. Regulations may allow importation from Canada and personal use imports with a 90-day supply. The Secretary can grant waivers for personal use imports from other countries. The Act also mandates a study on prescription drug importation into the US. The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 prohibits drug importation without HHS Secretary certification. The HHS Task Force on Drug Importation's report addressed this issue in 2004. The Secretary must certify safety and cost reduction for drug imports from Canada to be allowed. The current Secretary's refusal prevents the program from taking effect, despite significant price differences between US and Canadian drugs. Drug-price comparisons show that brand-name drug prices in the United States are about 70% higher than in Canada. Advocates for legalizing drug imports argue that U.S. consumers have been burdened with high prescription drug costs for too long, especially those without health insurance who pay higher retail prices. They believe it is unfair that consumers in other countries with national health plans have access to the same drugs at much lower prices. Advocates argue for legalizing drug imports to offer FDA-approved pharmaceuticals at lower prices for U.S. consumers. The trend of importing prescription drugs from foreign suppliers has shifted from individuals traveling to online mail-order pharmacies. IMS Health reports a slowdown in U.S. Internet drug purchases from Canada in 2005 and 2006. The rate of increase in U.S. Internet drug purchases from Canada was slowing down, attributed to factors like the new Medicare prescription drug benefit, the strong Canadian dollar, manufacturers restricting supply, and package seizures by U.S. border agents. States and municipalities are exploring ways to control prescription drug expenditures in their budgets through legislative, judicial, and administrative measures. In 2004, 51 bills and resolutions were introduced in 24 states and the District of Columbia regarding state importation of prescription drugs, mostly focusing on imports from Canada. This number decreased to 29 bills in 13 states in 2006. In 2004 and 2005, several states enacted laws to regulate prescription drug imports, with some governors signing bills into law. In 2006, California was the only state to enact such a law. Additionally, the Minnesota Attorney General investigated GlaxoSmithKline for potentially violating state anti-trust laws by blocking sales to Canadian pharmacies selling drugs to U.S. consumers. The Minnesota Attorney General is seeking court intervention to compel GlaxoSmithKline to release requested documents located in Canada and England. Some states are taking legal action to address pharmaceutical industry pricing practices, with Minnesota and Wisconsin directing consumers to Canadian sources. FDA opposes these activities, citing legal and feasibility concerns, warning of potential risks to consumers. Some states, like Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, Vermont, and Wisconsin, participate in the I-SaveRx program allowing consumers to buy prescription refills from licensed pharmacies in Canada and the UK. Cities, such as Springfield, Massachusetts, and Montgomery, Alabama, have also set up programs for purchasing drugs from Canada, resulting in significant cost savings. FDA has raised concerns about the legal and feasibility issues of these programs. In December 2003, Montgomery, Alabama, saved up to $500,000 by allowing city employees to buy drugs from Canada. Boston launched a pilot program in July 2004 for city employees to purchase prescription drugs from Canada. North Dakota proposed a project to import cheaper drugs from Canadian pharmacies, potentially saving $81 million annually. Senator Dorgan supports licensing Canadian pharmacies for this initiative. Illinois, Iowa, and New Hampshire have sought waivers under the MMA from HHS for drug importation programs. FDA and the drug industry oppose unlimited drug importation due to safety concerns, including the risk of counterfeit products. Members of the 110th Congress introduced drug importation bills: S. 242. In the first week of the 110th Congress, Members introduced drug importation bills: S. 242 and H.R. 380, the Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act of 2007. Members of the 109th Congress had also introduced similar bills, which were not reported. This report uses provisions from the 109th Congress bills in discussing the issues faced by the current Congress. The 110th Congress introduced drug importation bills, including the Vitter-Gutknecht, Gregg-Bradley, and Dorgan-Emerson bills. Senator Dorgan successfully added drug importation provisions to the Federal Trade Commission reauthorization bill. The 110th Congress introduced drug importation bills, including the Vitter-Gutknecht, Gregg-Bradley, and Dorgan-Emerson bills. Senator Dorgan successfully added drug importation provisions to the Federal Trade Commission reauthorization bill. (S. 1392) approved by the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, aims to balance the availability of imported prescription drugs for commercial and personal use while ensuring safety and effectiveness. The bills seek to reduce the financial burden of prescription drugs on U.S. consumers by amending Section 804 of the FFDCA and eliminating the provision requiring HHS Secretary certifications. The congressional debate on drug importation focuses on ensuring the safety and effectiveness of imported drugs for commercial and personal use. Health concerns revolve around product integrity and appropriate use, with opponents fearing an increase in the sale of adulterated or counterfeit drugs to U.S. consumers. The debate on drug importation revolves around concerns about the safety and integrity of imported drugs. Critics worry about the FDA's ability to ensure the authenticity of shipments, especially with the rise in imported drugs. There are fears of counterfeit pharmaceuticals entering the country, potentially disguised as FDA-approved drugs. Additionally, there are concerns about drugs being shipped to Canada and then to U.S. consumers, raising issues of unintentional safety risks. FDA also cautions about the labeling of some drugs not meeting U.S. regulations. The FDA cautions about the safety and effectiveness of imported drugs, highlighting concerns such as inadequate labeling, storage conditions, and manufacturing practices. These issues could lead to subpotent or ineffective drugs, potentially causing complications for patients. The FDA has options to address these threats without resorting to a total ban on drug importation. The safety and effectiveness of imported drugs are a concern for the FDA due to issues like inadequate labeling and manufacturing practices. To ensure drug safety for U.S. consumers, Congress and the FDA must decide which drugs can be imported, with most proposals requiring FDA approval for eligibility. This would prohibit the importation of biologics and controlled substances that do not meet U.S. standards. Imported pharmaceuticals must meet U.S. standards and have FDA approval for legal importation. Different bills have varying requirements for importation, with some mandating notification to the HHS Secretary for any differences from the FDA-approved U.S. label drug. Extensive information is needed to determine if a supplemental FDA application is necessary before marketing the drug. The Gregg-Bradley bills require imported drugs to be labeled as such and not mixed with FDA-approved drugs in U.S. pharmacies. This could create a two-tiered system with potential quality differences. Legislators may limit importation to countries with similar regulatory systems as the U.S. The Vitter-Gutknecht bills are the most inclusive, allowing importation from various countries including Australia, Canada, and members of the European Union. The Dorgan-Emerson bills differ from the Vitter-Gutknecht bills by excluding Israel, South Africa, and members of the European Economic Area that are not also members of the European Union, and for European Union countries, by adding a reference to their Annex to the Treaty of Accession that essentially disqualifies ten countries admitted to membership in May 2004. The Gregg-Bradley bills include Canada and allow the Secretary to designate as eligible any members of the European Union as of December 2003. Current law, as of December 2003, only includes Canada for personal-use drug importation, with the Secretary able to grant waivers for other countries. Procedures for verifying drug authenticity vary and may involve registration, testing, monitoring, inspections, packaging, labeling, recordkeeping, and penalties. Commercial participants must register with the FDA, providing detailed information about importers, exporters, and related facilities. The Vitter-Gutknecht bills specifically require exporters to register. The legislative proposals aim to establish registration requirements for exporters and importers of drugs to ensure regulatory enforcement and responsibility for consumer inquiries. Extensive recordkeeping of drug transactions is mandated to verify drug authenticity and safety. The legislative proposals require importers to maintain detailed tracking records, including chain-of-custody records for two years. This information aims to prevent counterfeit drugs from entering the market. The Dorgan-Emerson bills require detailed tracking records for imports to prevent counterfeit drugs. Customs and Border Protection checks all imported goods, referring FDA-regulated products for inspection. FDA reports enforcement challenges with monitoring drug imports. The FDA conducted an operation with CBP in courier hubs and mail centers, examining nearly 2,000 packages, mostly from Canada, with 87% containing FDA-regulated products. These included recalled drugs, foreign versions of FDA-approved drugs, and addictive controlled substances. The operation's methodology and conclusions lack detail, making it unclear if these products pose a health threat to U.S. consumers. Importing pharmaceutical products not approved by the FDA is illegal, as only FDA-approved drugs can be sold in the U.S. Imported drugs for personal use in the United States must be FDA-approved, properly labeled, and not adulterated. Different bills have varying requirements for certification and laboratory testing of drug authenticity. The FDA-approved manufactured product must have chain-of-custody documentation for every transfer until it reaches the importer. Enforcement includes physical monitoring of manufacturers, exporters, and importers, along with record-keeping. The Dorgan-Emerson bills mandate continuous on-site monitoring of facilities, access to records, verification of drug custody, and sampling for compliance. Periodic inspections may be allowed by the Secretary. The Secretary may allow periodic inspections of compliant businesses and authorize drug sampling to prevent importation of unsafe drugs. The Gregg-Bradley bills enable agreements with other agencies for enforcement activities, requiring training and reimbursement. Internet use complicates drug importation oversight. The Vitter-Gutknecht, Gregg-Bradley, and Dorgan-Emerson bills address Internet pharmacy procedures and regulations. The Gregg-Bradley bills specifically outline registration, posted information, prescriptions, and relationship to medical care for Internet pharmacies. The bills on Internet pharmacy regulations require specific professional services, advance notice of shipments, licensing fees, and liability for accepting advertising from unlicensed pharmacies. FDA would establish a fee system for enforcement costs. The Dorgan-Emerson bills mandate detailed information on pharmacist credentials and address accessibility on Internet sites. The Internet pharmacy regulations require accessible information on pharmacist credentials, address, and contact details. Dispensers must have a valid U.S. prescription and a qualifying medical relationship with the patient. Various bills in Congress aim to ensure the integrity of online drug purchases, with some search engines and companies taking steps to prevent illegal activities. The Gregg-Bradley bills aim to hold online advertising services accountable for promoting prescription drugs from unlicensed Internet pharmacies. They require regulations for a payment system to prevent illegal transactions and mandate the FDA to develop measures to identify unlawful online pharmacies. The Dorgan-Emerson bills propose regulations for online pharmacies to meet VIPPS certification standards. They also protect interactive computer service providers from liability for drug sales violations and direct the Secretary to review certifying entities. Additionally, they authorize appropriations for the Clearinghouse on Internet Prescribing to identify sites violating drug dispensing laws and aim to reduce risks of adulterated and counterfeit drugs. The HHS-appointed Counterfeit Drug Task Force recommended using RFID technology for tracking and tracing prescription drugs to combat counterfeiting. Critics argue that new packaging requirements may increase costs for consumers. RFID technology with unique serial numbers is being encouraged by the FDA to combat counterfeit drugs and improve inventory management. Drugmakers are cautiously considering adopting this technology due to its cost. Legislation is being proposed to require anti-tampering and anti-counterfeit packaging for medications from overseas. The Vitter-Gutknecht bills focus on extensive prescription drug packaging, while the Gregg-Bradley bills require prominent labeling with specific information for imported drugs. The FDA is pushing for the use of RFID technology to combat counterfeit drugs and improve inventory management. Legislation is being proposed to require anti-tampering and anti-counterfeit packaging for medications from overseas, with concerns about the cost and implementation timeline of these technological solutions. The FDA is concerned about patients buying medications online without a prescription, risking harmful drug interactions and self-diagnosis. The risk of negative outcomes such as harmful drug interactions, contraindications, allergic reactions, or improper dosing is potentially magnified when medications are used without adequate instruction and follow-up. Import programs should prevent unsupervised or inappropriate use of prescription drugs obtained online. Despite being technically illegal, many individuals, especially seniors, are importing prescription drugs. Congress declared in the MMA that the Secretary should use discretion when enforcing the current legal prohibition against persons importing drugs or devices. The MMA also added a requirement for the Secretary to certify the safety and cost savings of commercial importation sections before allowing FDA to grant waivers for personal use imports of FDA-approved prescription drugs from Canada. The Gregg-Bradley and Dorgan-Emerson bills allow individuals to import a 90-day supply of qualifying drugs with a valid prescription from a licensed pharmacy. The prescriptions must be marked to prevent duplication and must be accompanied by a copy of a valid prescription signed by a prescribing physician. The Gregg-Emerson bills require prescriptions for imported drugs to be cosigned by a physician in Canada or a permitted country. They also allow for compassionate use importation of drugs not FDA-approved for serious medical conditions. Overcoming obstacles like cost and industry response is crucial for a successful import policy. The FDA would need to develop oversight protocols for a drug import program to ensure safe and effective medications for consumers. The estimated cost of such a program could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars, potentially much greater than anticipated. The cost of implementing a prescription drug importation program could be much higher than expected. Funding options include fees charged to exporters and importers to cover inspection, recordkeeping, and quality control costs. Various bills propose different funding mechanisms, such as authorizing appropriations, exporter fees, and commercial importer fees to cover all program costs. The three bills propose fees linked to the total cost of the importation program, capped at 1% of drug prices. Fees would be collected from exporters and importers for administration purposes. Supporters believe this user fee system would provide resources for import policing, while critics argue it may deter small pharmacies from participating and lead to increased costs for consumers. Pharmaceutical companies oppose the proposed legislation. Pharmaceutical companies have opposed legislation permitting drug imports, citing safety concerns. Some companies have manipulated drug supply to Canada to circumvent the legislation's purpose. In 2004, the Minnesota Seniors Foundation filed a lawsuit against nine pharmaceutical companies for restricting drug supply to Canadian wholesalers. In response to concerns over drug supply manipulation by pharmaceutical companies, the Canadian International Pharmacy Association decided not to sign agreements with U.S. states and cities. The previous Canadian government proposed legislation to ban commercial exports of prescription drugs and regulate sales to foreign individuals. New bills are pending in Canada, with the current government waiting to take action. The Canadian government is waiting to act on potential drug supply threats. U.S. drug import programs could inadvertently raise drug prices in Canada. Proposed bills aim to restrict drug companies from controlling sales to foreign pharmacies, which some argue may be unconstitutional. The American Association of Retired Persons supports provisions in the Dorgan bill. The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) supports the Dorgan bill, believing it would hinder drug companies from limiting pharmaceutical supply to foreign pharmacies. Pharmaceutical companies may export drugs with different characteristics to avoid legal importation. The Vitter-Gutknecht and Dorgan-Emerson bills would make it illegal for manufacturers to produce drugs for distribution. The Dorgan-Emerson bills aim to prevent manufacturers from producing drugs with different characteristics for distribution in permitted countries to restrict importation. The bills include notification requirements and involve the FTC and state attorneys general. Concerns have been raised about potential impacts on industry investments in research and development. Industry spokespeople have not addressed these fears, suggesting that the policies could limit patient choices and hinder incentives for innovation in medicine. Some economists suggest that lost income could lead to lower investment in research and development of medicines for diseases like Alzheimer's, diabetes, heart ailments, and cancers. Implementing tax penalties to alter manufacturers' incentives is one approach, but current bills do not include such provisions. Importation provisions in the law face restrictions, and there are concerns about manufacturer resistance and patent holder rights. The interplay of patent law, international trade agreements, and concerns about drug cost may influence importation policy despite FDA's focus on drug safety. The U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement raised concerns about limiting drug importation, with Australia being a \"permitted country\" in some import bills. The agreement includes protections for patent rights. The U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement includes protections for patent rights, stating that imported drugs from Australia to the United States require permission from the U.S. patent holder. Pharmaceutical companies can control sales of their drugs within and outside the U.S. through contractual restrictions. The U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement includes provisions to protect patent rights for imported drugs from Australia to the United States. Australia subsidizes pharmaceutical costs through its Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, selecting the lowest priced brand for each drug and prohibiting export of subsidized drugs. This agreement may set a precedent for restricting imports, impacting the pricing and availability of U.S.-patented drugs. In a 2001 court case, the judge ruled that a company with a U.S. patent on a product retains its U.S. patent rights even if the product is sold abroad. This ruling could hinder the importation of drugs under proposed bills, as drug companies could sue importers for patent infringement. Foreign-made FDA-approved drugs account for about 40% of drugs sold in the U.S., making it challenging to implement legislative proposals to import drugs without addressing the patent issue. The Vitter-Gutknecht and Dorgan-Emerson bills aim to address this issue. The Vitter-Gutknecht and Dorgan-Emerson bills aim to reverse judicial precedent on U.S. patent rights for goods sold abroad. This would allow imported goods from authorized foreign sales by U.S. patent holders without patent infringement lawsuits. The Gregg-Bradley bills do not penalize pharmaceutical companies for discriminating against foreign pharmacies exporting drugs to the U.S. The bills raise questions on whether an import program would save money for U.S. consumers, increase access to lower-priced foreign drugs, and lower prices post-implementation. It is uncertain how changes in the law regarding drug import programs would impact long-term pharmaceutical prices for U.S. consumers. Proponents believe it would increase access to cheaper drugs and lower domestic prices, while critics argue it is unfeasible and may not result in savings for consumers. The success of an import program in reducing the financial burden on U.S. consumers is a complex issue. The debate over drug import programs and their impact on pharmaceutical prices for U.S. consumers is complex. Proponents believe it could lower prices, while critics argue it may not result in significant savings. Studies show that traders profit the most from parallel import trades, raising concerns about the effectiveness of such programs in benefiting consumers. The potential for cost savings to consumers is minimal due to additional costs incurred by intermediaries. The debate over drug import programs and their impact on pharmaceutical prices for U.S. consumers is complex. Proponents believe it could lower prices, while critics argue it may not result in significant savings. Studies show that traders profit the most from parallel import trades, raising concerns about the effectiveness of such programs in benefiting consumers. The potential for cost savings to consumers is minimal due to additional costs incurred by intermediaries. Estimates vary on the potential savings from importing drugs, with the CBO estimating a modest 1% reduction in total drug spending over 10 years, while others project significant savings for U.S. consumers. Representative Gutknecht estimated a 10-year savings of $630 billion by importing drugs, and other estimates suggest Americans could save $59.7 billion if purchasing all brand-name drugs at Canadian prices. Senator Dorgan successfully amended a bill to allow drug imports, highlighting the ongoing debate on the issue. The CBO estimated that drug importation provisions in a bill would lower U.S. spending on prescription drugs by $50 million over 10 years. An economic analysis challenges the expectation that drugmakers would cut supplies to Canada, suggesting potential savings for U.S. consumers. The authors anticipate that drug manufacturers would not cut supply to Canada, as the loss from lower U.S. prices would be balanced by gains from Canadian purchases. The pharmaceutical industry has not adjusted domestic prices to take advantage of the demand, unlike in Canada and Australia where government plays a key role in setting prices. As the U.S. adjusts its approach to international drug markets, other countries may follow suit. The high cost of prescription drugs affects consumers and healthcare spending, especially in the United States. Wealthier countries tend to have higher drug prices, reflecting buyers' sensitivity to price. The trend is towards more sophisticated drugs with complex dosing schedules, increasing overall healthcare costs. The new outpatient prescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries began in 2006, impacting drug costs for U.S. consumers. The government's increased role in paying for drugs may lead to a focus on cost, safety, and effectiveness. Congress has options to lower drug costs, such as promoting generics and disease management. The government can lower drug costs by promoting generics and disease management, providing research incentives, studying drug effectiveness, and implementing price controls. Canada is designated as the primary source for drug imports due to similar regulatory requirements as the United States. Health Canada and FDA operate similarly to ensure pharmaceutical product safety. FDA Commissioner McClellan stated in 2004 that Canadian drugs regulated by Health Canada are safe, but cross-border Internet pharmacies serving Americans raise concerns due to regulatory gaps between the two countries. Health Canada does not oversee drugs exported to the US, leading to safety concerns. On November 18, 2003, the United States and Canada signed a Memorandum of Understanding to share information on pharmacies exporting drugs, quality defects, new regulations, and post-market surveillance. Canadian pharmacies are regulated and require licenses to dispense prescription drugs. Some Canadian pharmacies operate as rogue entities, dispensing pharmaceuticals by mail without proper oversight. Canadian pharmacies may struggle to hire physicians to write prescriptions for U.S. patients due to insurance issues related to co-signing prescriptions without proper examination. Co-signing prescriptions for Americans seeking cheaper drugs is illegal in Canada and could lead to a lack of malpractice insurance coverage for physicians. The Canadian pharmaceutical market differs significantly from the U.S. market. The Canadian government negotiates bulk purchasing contracts for pharmaceutical products, regulates drug prices through the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board, and actively manages costs through various strategies such as international price comparisons and generic substitution. The Canadian pharmaceutical market utilizes price comparisons, reference pricing, substantial generic substitution, and pharmacy reimbursement policies."
