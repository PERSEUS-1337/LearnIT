    "content": "CHAPTER 4 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 introduces a new section on Future Math and Science Teacher Recruitment, with a short title and findings outlined in section 407A. The chapter is titled the `Recruit and Reward Future Math and Science Teachers of America Act of 2001'. Congress finds that US high school students rank low in science and math compared to other countries, with a significant percentage being taught by teachers who did not prepare in those fields. Over the next decade, more than 2,000,000 teachers will need to be hired, with a focus on placing highly qualified math and science teachers in their field of instruction. Proactive policies are needed to increase funding for teacher training, recruitment, and induction to ensure student learning is positively influenced by teachers' knowledge and skills. The purpose of this chapter is to provide grants for eligible institutions to offer 500 scholarships to outstanding students in teacher training programs focused on math and science for urban or rural secondary classrooms. $5,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2002 to 2004. Scholarship designation and selection criteria are outlined in section 407C. The National Math and Science Teacher Scholarships are designated for funds under this chapter. The Secretary of Education may award funds to qualifying institutions with graduate programs in teacher training on a competitive basis. Institutions can receive up to $100,000 per academic year. Eligibility is based on ranking in the top 25 percent of schools in the state for graduates passing the state teacher qualification assessment. The Secretary prioritizes eligible institutions based on specific criteria such as offering internship programs, mentoring for novice teachers, placing graduates in rural and urban schools, and maintaining high teacher retention rates. \"Individual scholarship eligibility under SEC. 407D.\" An individual eligible for a National Math and Science Teacher Scholarship must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, majoring in a science or math teacher training program at a top-ranked institution in the state. An eligible individual for a National Math and Science Teacher Scholarship must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident majoring in a science or math teacher training program at a top-ranked institution in the state, willing to teach math or science in a rural or urban public secondary school for at least 3 full academic years. The scholarship amount awarded by participating teacher training graduate programs is $10,000 per student per academic year, not exceeding the total cost of attendance. If funds are insufficient, the number of scholarships awarded may be reduced. The scholarship amount should not exceed the cost of attendance and will not be affected by other forms of federal student financial assistance. Recipients of the National Math and Science Teachers Scholarships must teach in urban or rural public secondary schools for at least 3 years. Failure to fulfill this agreement will result in repayment of the scholarship amount plus interest and fees. Exceptions to repayment provisions exist. An individual recipient of a Scholarship under this chapter shall not be considered in violation of the agreement if they are pursuing full-time math and science studies, serving in the armed forces for up to 3 years, temporarily disabled for up to 3 years, seeking but unable to find full-time employment for up to 12 months, or seeking but unable to find full-time employment as a math and science teacher for up to 27 months. The individual recipient of a Scholarship under this chapter may be exempt from the agreement if they are permanently totally disabled, as confirmed by a qualified physician. The Secretary of Education will report to Congress three years after funds are first available to evaluate the success of the National Math and Science Teacher Scholarships program in recruiting teachers for public secondary schools."
