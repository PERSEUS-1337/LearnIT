Public sector revenues decreased, leading to a 6.6% contraction in GDP in 2009. Despite expected growth in 2010, economists believe it will take time for Mexico's economy to recover fully. Structural weaknesses have made Mexico vulnerable to fluctuations in the U.S. economy, despite efforts like trade liberalization and privatization. Mexico's economy has structural weaknesses that hinder its growth and increase its dependence on the U.S. economy. The 111th Congress is interested in trade, economic conditions, migration, border issues, and counter-narcotics in Mexico. With a nominal GDP of $1.7 trillion in 2009, Mexico's economy is closely linked to the United States. Mexico's economy, with a GDP of $1.7 trillion in 2009, is the 11th largest globally and the second largest in Latin America. It has an open market economy with a strong export sector, but faced a sharp economic contraction of 6.6% in 2009 due to the global financial crisis and downturn in the U.S. economy. The Mexican peso depreciated by 25% against the dollar, leading to decreased exports to the United States and liquidity problems. Mexico's economy faced a sharp contraction in 2009 due to the global financial crisis and the H1N1 virus outbreak. Policy measures and prior economic performance helped the economy begin to recover, with estimates projecting 3-4% growth in 2010. The recovery is driven by an increase in external demand, particularly in manufacturing exports, while sectors dependent on domestic demand are struggling. The Economist Intelligence Unit projects GDP growth at 2.7% for 2011. Mexico's strong economic ties to the United States, post-NAFTA, have deepened its dependency on U.S. economic conditions. With 80% of exports destined for the U.S., any changes in U.S. demand significantly impact Mexico's economy. Mexico's exports heavily rely on the United States, leading to significant economic consequences in Mexican industrial sectors due to changes in U.S. demand. The recent downturn in the world economy caused a sharp decline in U.S.-Mexico trade, impacting GDP growth in Mexico. The Mexican economy has historically mirrored U.S. economic patterns with higher fluctuations in GDP growth rates. After a decline in GDP in 1995, Mexico experienced growth in the following years, but was hit hard by the U.S. economic slowdown in 2001. Improved economic conditions in the U.S. helped Mexico's economy recover, with real GDP growth reaching 4.0% in 2004. Mexico's trade policy shifted towards liberalization after the 1982 debt crisis, leading to negotiations for a free trade agreement with the United States in the late 1980s. The economy faced a financial crisis in 1995, prompting the government to abandon its fixed exchange rate policy. After the 1995 financial crisis, Mexico switched to a floating exchange rate regime, causing a 50% currency devaluation and a deep recession. The peso's depreciation boosted exports but raised import prices, impacting real income for the poor and middle class. The government took steps to restructure the economy and mitigate the crisis's effects on disadvantaged sectors. The United States and the International Monetary Fund provided Mexico with a $50 billion emergency financial support package to help the economy adjust quickly. Mexico implemented tight monetary and fiscal policies, including tax increases and budget cuts, to avoid defaulting on its debt. The global financial crisis of 2008 worsened the recession in the U.S. economy. The U.S. economic contraction in 2007 led to lower consumer demand, affecting Mexico's GDP growth, employment, manufacturing industry, and investor confidence. Mexico's high dependence on manufacturing exports to the U.S. caused the deepest recession in Latin America. Other Latin American countries also felt negative economic consequences, but to a lesser extent. In 2009, Mexico experienced a sharp decline in total trade with the world due to lower demand in the United States and decreased consumer demand domestically. Most Latin American countries were affected by the financial crisis, with El Salvador and Paraguay experiencing the deepest economic contractions in Central and South America, respectively. Despite the impact on economic growth, Latin American countries rebounded in 2010, except for Venezuela which faced a drop in real GDP growth. In 2009, Mexico's exports to all countries decreased by 21.5% to $229.6 billion, with imports also decreasing by 24.4% to $234.4 billion. Prior to the recession, Mexico had steady annual growth in exports, but the labor market conditions deteriorated, leading to a rise in unemployment. However, there was a rebound in export volumes in late 2009 and early 2010, with significant increases in exports to the United States. The economic crisis in Mexico led to a significant increase in unemployment, particularly in urban areas. Private consumption and retail sales fell as a result. The unemployment rate in the last quarter of 2009 was the highest in a decade, with large cities experiencing a rate of 7.6% compared to 3.7% in small communities. The informal sector, which includes low-paying jobs without benefits, may not be fully captured in government data on unemployment. Despite a peak in the unemployment rate in September 2009, private consumption continued to lag, and consumer confidence remained weak. The crisis has created a shortage of opportunities in the formal economy in Mexico. The economic crisis in Mexico led to a significant increase in unemployment, particularly in urban areas. The formal economy contracted, leading to a growing trend towards informality and self-employment. The informal sector nearly doubled in size in the third quarter of 2009 compared to 2008, with an estimated 39.3% of the Mexican workforce in the informal sector. This poses a social problem as workers in the informal sector lack social benefits like health coverage, retirement savings, and health insurance. The financial crisis in Mexico has negatively impacted young workers, leading to increased dropout rates from school. Unemployment among youths is a major concern for the government, as it may push them towards criminal activities or illegal migration. Approximately 700,000 young people dropped out of school last year, prompting efforts from the education program to target recent dropouts. The financial crisis in Mexico has led to increased dropout rates among young workers. Efforts are being made to target recent dropouts and reintegrate them into the education system. The decline in external demand has severely affected manufacturing industries, leading to job losses and a decrease in industrial production. Business and consumer confidence has weakened, putting pressure on consumption and investment. There are possibilities of further job losses in export-oriented assembly plants due to the downturn in demand. The growth rate of Mexico's industrial production declined significantly from 5.7% in 2006 to -10.1% in 2009. Despite challenges such as the economic crisis and increased violence along the U.S.-Mexico border, there is optimism for a recovery with projected growth rates of 4.1% in 2010 and 3.6% in 2011. Many export-oriented assembly plants, especially along the U.S.-Mexico border, have closed down, impacting job opportunities in cities like Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua. Ciudad Juarez, with a high concentration of export assembly plants, experienced significant job losses due to lower U.S. demand and drug-related violence. Manufacturing employment decreased by 22% from 2007 to 2009. Tijuana also saw a 21% decrease in employment during the same period. Despite an increase in the number of manufacturing plants, total employment in Mexico decreased by 14%. The country's economic recovery and stability will rely heavily on the oil industry. Mexico heavily relies on oil revenues, accounting for 30% to 40% of the government's fiscal revenues. However, oil production is rapidly declining, with analysts predicting a continued decrease in the coming years. Mexico is the seventh-largest oil producer globally and a significant source of U.S. oil imports. Pemex, Mexico's state oil company, reports a faster decline in output from the Cantarell oilfield than expected. This decline may lead Mexico to become an oil importer within a decade, as exports have been decreasing since 2006. Cantarell is Mexico's main offshore field, and its production is crucial for the country's oil industry. Production at Mexico's main offshore field, Cantarell, has been rapidly declining since its peak in 2004, reaching only 630,000 barrels per day in 2009. Nationally, Mexico produced 2.6 million barrels of oil per day in 2009, down from a record 3.4 million barrels per day in 2004. The Mexican government's heavy reliance on oil revenues has led to a lack of reinvestment in the oil company, Pemex. Any further decline in oil production could have significant fiscal implications, potentially requiring government spending cuts. The Mexican government may need to cut spending or increase taxes if oil output drops below 2 million b/d, impacting economic recovery. Reforms in 2008 allowed Pemex to create contracts with private companies, but experts believe more reforms are needed to attract foreign investment for deep-water exploration in the Gulf of Mexico. Mexico faces challenges in finding new, productive oil wells and lacks resources for investment in engineering capacity and exploration. Despite estimates of 50 billion barrels in the Gulf of Mexico's deeper waters, experts believe Mexico lacks the expertise, technology, and capital for oil exploration. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to Mexico dropped sharply in 2009 due to the global financial crisis, with total FDI flows decreasing by 42.5% from $24.3 billion in 2008 to $12.2 billion in 2009. Investment flows to Mexico fluctuated between 1999 and 2009, with the United States being the largest investor accounting for over 50% of cumulative investment flows. U.S. FDI in Mexico increased significantly after NAFTA's implementation, reaching $97.9 billion in 2009. Foreign investment in Mexico, particularly in manufacturing and financial services, saw fluctuations between 1999 and 2009. The U.S. was the largest investor, with FDI reaching $97.9 billion in 2009. Despite NAFTA's impact on investor confidence, much of the growth may have occurred due to Mexico's liberalization policies in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Manufacturing FDI decreased by 30% in 2009, while financial services FDI also saw a decline following the global financial crisis. In 2009, FDI flows in financial services decreased by 38% to $3.0 billion. Remittance inflows fell by 16.0% to $21.1 billion, mainly due to the global financial crisis and the U.S. economic slowdown affecting Mexican immigrants. Remittances are the second-highest source of foreign currency for Mexico after oil, with tourism revenues in third place. Mexico receives the largest amount of remittances in Latin America and the third-largest in the world. Many Mexican workers in the U.S. who send money back to their families work in sectors negatively impacted by the financial crisis. In 2008, approximately 239,000 immigrant Hispanics, with Mexicans making up 30%, lost jobs, mainly in construction. Remittances to Mexico fell significantly compared to other countries dependent on the U.S. economy. Despite declines in Central America and the Caribbean, remittances to Mexico are expected to grow by 5% in 2010. Annual remittances to Mexico increased from $8.9 billion to $25.1 billion between 2001 and 2008, showing a 182.0% growth rate. Annual remittances to Mexico increased from $8.9 billion to $25.1 billion between 2001 and 2008, showing a growth rate of 182.0%. The relationship between remittances to Mexico and U.S. economic growth is unclear, with the Mexican government attributing the 2009 decline to the global financial crisis. Remittances represent less than 4% of Mexico's GDP, but are crucial for the poorest communities. The financial crisis in Mexico has led to significant effects on poverty, with remittances being a vital lifeline for the poor. States experiencing drastic declines in remittances are at higher risk, impacting families who use the money for basic needs. A study estimates that poverty rates will increase by nearly four percentage points between 2008 and 2010, with the poorest households facing an average loss in income. Mexico has long struggled with poverty as a major economic challenge. Mexico has faced significant economic challenges, with poverty rates decreasing between 2000 and 2007 but increasing in 2008. Extreme poverty rose to 18% in 2008, especially prevalent in rural areas. Past economic reforms have helped modify macroeconomic policies and restore policy credibility since the 1995 currency crisis. The government of Mexico implemented measures such as a balanced budget rule, inflation targeting, and a floating exchange rate policy to stabilize inflation, reduce public debt, and lower current account deficits. These actions helped the country avoid financial stress during the 2008 global financial crisis. However, political analysts and economists believe that Mexico still needs significant political and economic structural reforms for long-term economic growth. The government's responses to the 2009 recession improved conditions in 2010 through the use of macroeconomic policies and targeted financial assistance. Mexico utilized various tools such as macroeconomic policies, targeted financial assistance, and interventions by the Central Bank to maintain liquidity and confidence in the economy. Collaborating with the U.S. Federal Reserve and IMF, Mexico secured credit lines but did not utilize them, leading to improved economic confidence. The government also implemented tax reforms in the FY2010 budget to offset revenue losses from declining oil production. Mexico faces the challenge of further tax system reforms to replace oil revenues with tax revenues, as its tax collection rate is currently low at 10% of GDP. Mexico has one of the lowest tax collection rates in Latin America, with tax revenues at only 10% of GDP. Economists agree that further tax reforms are needed to broaden the tax base and meet the country's social needs. The issue of monopolies and limited competition hinders Mexico's economic efficiency and productivity. Special interest groups in business and labor have impeded changes that would introduce more market forces into the economy, leading to high inequality and low growth. Reforms are necessary for Mexico to improve economic growth. The oil industry in Mexico is controlled by the federal government and the labor union, hindering its growth. Special interest groups resist change to protect their benefits and jobs, preventing reforms needed for economic improvement. The telecommunications sector in Mexico is dominated by Tel\u00e9fonos de M\u00e9xico, creating a lack of competition. Labor unions hold significant power in industries like energy, healthcare, and education, hindering economic progress. The National Teacher's Union in Mexico is the largest in Latin America and holds significant power in the education sector. President Calder\u00f3n proposed reforms in 2009 to address economic and political challenges, including measures to eliminate poverty, improve healthcare, and privatize parts of the state oil monopoly. Labor reform was also suggested to increase competition and economic growth. President Calder\u00f3n proposed labor, regulatory, and political reforms to increase competition and flexibility in the labor market, reduce government regulations, and enhance citizen participation in fighting organized crime. However, the likelihood of these proposals passing in the Mexican Congress is low due to controversy and opposition from major political parties. Without these structural reforms, Mexico's economic growth and development potential remain limited. Mexico faces significant challenges in increasing economic growth and reducing poverty rates. The population is showing signs of pushing for change, with much depending on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election. The country also grapples with escalating violence due to President Calder\u00f3n's campaign against organized crime and drug trafficking, impacting foreign investment flows. The costs associated with violence, investment losses, and drug abuse are estimated at $4.6 billion per year, hindering economic progress. The direct costs of violence in Mexico are estimated at $4.6 billion per year, or 0.5% of GDP. Indirect costs include large numbers of violence-related outward migration, impacting Mexico's potential growth rate. Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez has seen significant impacts, with 116,000 abandoned homes and a loss of 23.9% of formal jobs. Analysts suggest that increasing investor confidence is crucial to remain competitive amidst the anxiety and uncertainty caused by drug violence. The business environment in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez has been affected by border violence, leading to increased security measures in manufacturing plants. Some foreign investors have refrained from opening plants in Ju\u00e1rez since 2008, citing reasons such as the recession. The relationship between the United States and Mexico is crucial for issues like bilateral trade and border security. Mexican President Felipe Calder\u00f3n emphasized the need for increased cooperation during his state visit to Washington, DC in May 2010. Mexican President Felipe Calder\u00f3n emphasized the need for increased cooperation with the United States during his visit to Washington, DC in May 2010. President Barack Obama hosted a meeting where they discussed key bilateral issues, including economic competitiveness, social well-being, and citizen security. They highlighted mutual economic growth and vowed to enhance efforts for job creation, economic recovery, and inclusive prosperity in both countries. The leaders emphasized cooperation to enhance competitiveness through a Twenty-First Century Border, transportation cooperation, regulatory cooperation, and intellectual property rights protection. They also discussed human capital and immigration issues, with President Obama committed to immigration reform and President Calder\u00f3n focused on creating job and educational opportunities in Mexico. The economic relationship between the United States and Mexico is highly interdependent, with NAFTA playing a central role. The Mexican truck issue, a trade concern related to NAFTA, has been a point of contention. The United States refused to implement NAFTA's trucking provisions due to safety concerns, leading to objections from the Mexican government. The 111th Congress terminated a cross-border trucking pilot program initiated by the Bush Administration under the FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act (P.L. 111-8). The FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act terminated a trucking program, leading to a NAFTA arbitration filed by Mexico's trucking industry. Mexico alleges US violations of NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103 and failure to comply with a 2001 ruling. Mexico imposed tariffs on $2.4 billion worth of US products in retaliation. President Calder\u00f3n and President Obama discussed the impact of the trucking dispute on jobs, companies, and consumers in both countries. President Obama has pledged to work with Mexico to implement NAFTA trucking provisions. U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood announced the relaunch of the cross-border trucking program with Mexico. Mexico's declining oil production could impact the United States as a top supplier of crude petroleum oil. There is a possibility of reform measures in Mexico to allow foreign investment, creating opportunities for U.S. companies in drilling and exploration. Mexico's declining oil production could impact the United States as a top supplier of crude petroleum oil. Reform measures in Mexico may allow foreign investment, benefiting U.S. companies in drilling and exploration services. Proponents suggest closer regulatory cooperation and deepening economic ties between the two countries. Analysts believe addressing Mexico's economic challenges is crucial for reducing poverty and organized crime, emphasizing the importance of a prosperous and democratic Mexico for the United States. Suggestions include shifting focus from anti-narcotic efforts to immigration and energy reform, security concerns, and harmonization of relations. Opponents of further North American integration argue that trade liberalization under NAFTA has harmed the U.S. economy and led to job losses. Legislation was introduced in the 111th Congress for the U.S. to withdraw from NAFTA (H.R. 4759). This bill would require the president to notify Mexico. The bill (H.R. 4759) introduced in the 111th Congress calls for the U.S. withdrawal from NAFTA. Supporters argue that NAFTA has led to job losses, while opponents believe it has positive economic effects. Withdrawal could diminish trade and investment flows, hurting U.S. exports and causing job losses."
