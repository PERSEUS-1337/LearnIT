    "content": "The \"Protect Student Borrowers Act of 2015\" aims to make institutions of higher education share the risk of student loan defaults. This involves requiring institutions to provide rebates to the Department of Education for defaulted loans. The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to include institutional risk-sharing requirements for student loan defaults. Institutions of higher education must accept these requirements if applicable. Institutions with a participation rate of 25% or higher in a student loan program must make risk-sharing payments based on the volume of defaulted loans. If an institution's cohort default rate is 30% or higher, they must pay 20% of the total amount to the Secretary. Institutions with a participation rate of 25% or higher in a student loan program must make risk-sharing payments based on the volume of defaulted loans. If an institution's cohort default rate is between 25% and 30%, they must pay 15% of the total amount to the Secretary. Institutions with a participation rate of less than 20% for the most recent fiscal year must pay 10% of the total amount of defaulted loans, while those with a rate between 20% and 15% must pay 5% to the Secretary. The Secretary may waive or reduce risk-sharing payments for institutions with a student loan management plan approved by the Secretary. The risk-sharing payment for institutions is based on their cohort default rate, with a 15 percent payment for those with a higher rate and a 10 percent payment for those with a lower rate. The risk-sharing payment for institutions is determined by their cohort default rate, with a 5 percent payment for loans made to students in default. An institution can receive a waiver or reduced payment for subsequent years if satisfactory progress is shown in student loan management. The institution seeking a waiver or reduction of risk-sharing payment must develop and implement a student loan management plan. This plan includes analyzing risk factors for student loan defaults, providing individualized financial aid counseling, and implementing strategies to reduce default and delinquency rates. The Secretary may waive or reduce risk-sharing payments for institutions eligible under certain titles if they are making satisfactory progress in carrying out their student loan management plan. The Secretary may waive or reduce risk-sharing payments for eligible institutions based on satisfactory progress in their student loan management plan. Institutions cannot deny admission or financial aid to students perceived at risk for loan default. A fund is established in the Treasury for depositing risk-sharing payments collected. The Secretary can waive or reduce risk-sharing payments for eligible institutions based on progress in their student loan management plan. A fund is established in the Treasury for collecting payments, with 50% available for delinquency prevention contracts and the rest reserved for a Pell Grant fund to offset future funding shortfalls. The Secretary will implement the Pell Grant program for the 2014 cohort, including students entering repayment in fiscal year 2014. An annual report to Congress will detail institutions subject to risk-sharing payments, the required payments, and the collected amounts. The annual report to Congress will include a list of institutions receiving waivers or reductions in risk-sharing payments, along with details on the use of funds deposited from these payments. SEC. 4. CONTRACTS AND COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS. Contracts and cooperative agreements can be entered into for delinquency and default prevention and rehabilitation under the Higher Education Act of 1965. This includes programs for institutions with high default rates or serving at-risk student loan borrowers. The Higher Education Act of 1965 allows for contracts and agreements to address delinquency and default prevention, including programs for institutions with high default rates or at-risk student loan borrowers. This includes provisions for first-generation postsecondary education students, those without a high school diploma, or those who have rehabilitated a defaulted loan. The aim is to increase the number of borrowers successfully rehabilitating defaulted loans. SEC. 5. FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY. Amends Section 498(c)(1) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require institutions to meet all financial obligations, including risk-sharing payments, refunds, and repayments to the Secretary for incurred liabilities and debts."
