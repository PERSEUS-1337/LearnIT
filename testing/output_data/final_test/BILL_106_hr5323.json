    "content": "The \"Airport Medical Assistance Act of 2000\" may be cited as the short title. It includes a provision for automatic external defibrillators in airport terminals. The \"Airport Medical Assistance Act of 2000\" mandates the withdrawal of a previous notice and the implementation of regulations requiring automatic external defibrillators in airport terminals with over 100,000 annual enplanements. The Administrator must issue proposed regulations within 180 days and final regulations within 1 year of the Act's enactment. The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration must establish guidelines for automated external defibrillators in airport terminals, including information on operation by lay persons, number required based on airport size, placement considerations, and other relevant factors. Recommended procedures for implementing training programs are also included in the guidelines. The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration will establish guidelines for automated external defibrillators in airport terminals, including training programs, maintenance, coordination with emergency medical systems, and other relevant areas. The guidelines will be published in the Federal Register within one year of the Act's enactment. Good Samaritan protections for emergency use of automated external defibrillators at airports are outlined in Section 4 of the Act. Persons using AEDs at airports are immune from civil liability for any harm resulting from the device's use. Additionally, those who acquire the AED are also immune if they notify emergency personnel of its placement in a timely manner. The requirement for appropriate training in the use of AEDs does not apply if the person using the device was not expected to use it or if there was a significant time gap between their engagement and the harm occurrence. The immunity provided under this section does not apply if the harm was caused by willful misconduct, gross negligence, or conscious indifference to the victim's safety. State laws are superseded only if they do not provide immunity for civil liability in cases involving the use of AEDs. The immunity provided under this section applies to civil liability for using automated external defibrillator devices in emergency situations as defined by State law. SEC. 5. ELIGIBILITY FOR AIP FUNDING. Amends Section 47102(3)(B) of title 49, United States Code to include automatic external defibrillators as eligible for funding. In this Act, definitions for \"airport\" and \"automated external defibrillator\" are provided, with specific criteria outlined for the latter including commercial distribution, ability to recognize ventricular fibrillation, determine need for defibrillation, and deliver electrical shock. The term \"perceived medical emergency\" refers to situations where an individual's behavior indicates a life-threatening medical condition requiring immediate attention. The term \"person\" includes governmental entities."
