    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Healthy Local Policies for Schools Act of 2010\" or the \"HELP Schools Act of 2010.\" Congress finds that childhood obesity has tripled in the 30 years before the Act, with 12 million children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 being obese. Obesity-related diseases cost the US economy over $147 billion annually. Low physical activity and increased caloric intake contribute to this epidemic. Overweight adolescents have a high chance of becoming overweight adults, leading to chronic diseases, disability, and death. Children and adolescents are not meeting dietary recommendations and are underconsuming important food groups. Nutrition education and promotion in schools help support healthy eating behaviors, increase acceptance of healthy meals, enhance meal quality, and promote the development of local wellness policies. It is a critical component of health promotion and disease prevention programs. Research shows that school-based nutrition programs improve health, academic achievement, and overall well-being of students. However, many local wellness policies in the United States are underdeveloped and lack proper evaluation measures. The wellness policy of school districts may lack provisions for review and revision. A study found that 5-6% of students were in districts with funding for policy implementation. Current nutrition education for students lacks coordination, funding, and sustainability. Physical Activity Guidelines recommend 60 minutes of activity for children. Children spend significant time at school. Children spend a lot of time at school and need to be active to meet physical activity guidelines. However, only a small percentage of schools provide daily physical education, and some schools do not require any physical education at all. SEC. 3. LOCAL WELLNESS POLICIES. Section 5 of the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act is amended to focus on local wellness policies. The curr_chunk discusses the definitions of \"extended school day\" and \"local wellness policy\" in relation to educational agencies. It also outlines the requirements for local educational agencies to establish wellness policies under the HELP Schools Act of 2010. The Act of 2010 requires local educational agencies to strengthen their school wellness policies by setting goals for nutrition, physical education, and food marketing, with an implementation plan to achieve these goals. Guidelines for school meals must not be less restrictive than issued regulations. The Act of 2010 mandates local educational agencies to enhance school wellness policies by establishing nutrition guidelines for non-reimbursable school meals in compliance with Secretary's standards and measuring policy implementation transparency. The HELP Schools Act of 2010 requires local educational agencies to disseminate their local wellness policy, assessments, updates, and contact information to stakeholders. Agencies must make the policy and plan available at the start of the school year and assess implementation. Local educational agencies must assess the implementation of their wellness policy every 2 years after the enactment of the HELP Schools Act of 2010. The assessment should include compliance with the policy and comparison with model policies. Each local educational agency must designate a Local Wellness Policy Committee within 180 days of the HELP Schools Act of 2010. The Committee should assess progress towards wellness policy goals and make revisions as needed. The Local Wellness Policy Committee of each educational agency must include representatives from various stakeholders such as principals, teachers, parents, students, school food authority, school board, physical education program, and school health professionals. The Local Wellness Policy Committee includes representatives from stakeholders like principals, teachers, parents, students, school food authority, school board, and health professionals. The Committee may also include a registered dietitian, pediatrician, dentist, and local health department representatives. Each local educational agency determines the terms and conditions for Committee members and their duties include ensuring compliance with wellness policy requirements and integrating it with existing policies. The Local Wellness Policy Committee includes representatives from various stakeholders and is responsible for ensuring compliance with wellness policy requirements and integrating them with existing policies. The Secretary, in collaboration with other departments, provides technical assistance and outreach to assist local educational agencies in adopting effective wellness policies. The Secretary performs outreach to promote effective local wellness policies, providing technical assistance, including a hotline, online resources, trainings, model policies, and best practices recommended by Federal and State agencies and organizations. The guidance is for informational purposes only and not binding. The Secretary provides guidance for local wellness policies, offering technical assistance and resources. Funding of $1,000,000 is transferred annually to carry out the program. The Secretary, along with the CDC Director, will prepare a report on the local wellness policies' implementation and effectiveness. The report will analyze strengths and weaknesses compared to model policies and assess their impact on meeting requirements. The Secretary will submit a report to the Senate and House committees by January 1, 2014, detailing the findings of the study on local wellness policies' implementation and effectiveness. SEC. 4. REPEAL. Section 204 of the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 is repealed. SEC. 5. BUDGETARY EFFECTS. The budgetary effects of this Act shall be determined by reference to the latest statement for compliance with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010."
