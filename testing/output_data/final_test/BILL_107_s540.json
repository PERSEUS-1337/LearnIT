The \"Reserve Component Tax Assistance Act of 2001\" allows members of the Reserve Component of the Armed Forces to deduct certain trade or business expenses, regardless of whether they itemize deductions. The \"Reserve Component Tax Assistance Act of 2001\" allows members of the Reserve Component of the Armed Forces to deduct certain expenses related to their service, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2001. The \"Reserve Component Tax Assistance Act of 2001\" allows Reserve Component personnel to claim a credit for employment, added as section 45E to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Reserve Component Tax Assistance Act of 2001\" added section 45E to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, providing a reserve component employment credit for qualified employees and self-employed taxpayers. The employment credit is 50% of qualified compensation for periods of qualified reserve component duty. The employment credit is based on qualified compensation for employees participating in qualified reserve component duty. Qualified compensation is contingent on the employee's presence for work and would be deductible from gross income under section 162(a)(1). The employment credit is for qualified compensation for employees on reserve duty, not classified as vacation, sick leave, or other nonspecific pay. A qualified employee must have worked for the taxpayer for 21 days before reserve duty and be a member of the Ready Reserve of a US Armed Force. The self-employment credit for qualified self-employed taxpayers is 50% of the excess of their average daily self-employment income over the average daily military pay and allowances received while on qualified reserve component duty. The average daily self-employment income for a self-employed taxpayer is calculated by dividing their self-employment income for the year by the difference between 365 and the number of days spent on qualified reserve component duty. The average daily military pay and allowances are also considered in this calculation. The term 'allowances' refers to the amount paid to a taxpayer for military pay and allowances during the taxable year on account of participation in qualified reserve component duty. A 'qualified self-employed taxpayer' is someone with net earnings from self-employment for the year and is a member of the Ready Reserve of a reserve component of the US Armed Forces. The employment credit provided in this section is in addition to any deduction allowable for compensation paid to a qualified employee during reserve duty. The maximum credit for the taxable year is $7,500 in total and $2,000 per qualified employee. The limitations for members of a controlled group are treated as one taxpayer and allocated as prescribed by the Secretary. All persons treated as a single employer under specific sections are considered part of a controlled group. No credit is allowed for failure to comply with employment or reemployment rights of reserve components of the armed forces. The tax credit is disallowed for taxpayers under a final order related to a violation of chapter 43 of title 38 of the United States Code, and for the two succeeding taxable years. Additionally, no credit is allowed for individuals called to active duty for training under specific provisions of the United States Code. The tax credit is disallowed for individuals under final orders related to violations of specific sections of the United States Code. This includes disallowance for active duty training and specific reserve component duties as defined in the Code. Military pay and allowances are defined in relation to the Armed Forces of the United States. The reservist's military orders designate qualified reserve component duty in support of a contingency operation as defined in the United States Code. Participation in this duty excludes engaging in normal employment or self-employment activities unless on authorized leave. The reservist is prohibited from engaging in normal employment or self-employment activities during qualified reserve component duty, except when on authorized leave. Rules similar to those in section 52 apply for this purpose. Additionally, a conforming amendment is made to the Internal Revenue Code regarding the reserve component employment credit. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include the reserve component employment credit under section 45E(a). A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. The reserve component employment credit under section 45E is effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2001."
