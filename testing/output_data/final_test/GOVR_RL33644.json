    "content": "The federal government provides grants for family planning services through the Family Planning Program, Title X of the Public Health Service Act. Title X, enacted in 1970, is the only federal program solely dedicated to family planning and related preventive health services. Other programs like Medicaid also finance family planning services. In FY2015, Medicaid accounted for 75% of U.S. public family planning expenditures, while Title X accounted for 10%. Title X, administered by the Office of Population Affairs (OPA) under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), receives funding through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). Although authorization expired in FY1985, the program continues to be funded through appropriations bills. OPA administers project grants for family planning services, personnel training, and service delivery improvement research, with 90% of funds used for clinical services. Title X, administered by the Office of Population Affairs (OPA) under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), funds family planning services including contraceptive services, infertility services, cancer screening, STD and HIV prevention education, and counseling. OPA emphasizes providing services without coercion and respecting individuals' beliefs. Additionally, OPA supports integrating HIV-prevention services in family planning clinics and offers supplemental grants for implementing CDC's recommendations for HIV testing. Services are also available for males. Title X services offered to males include condoms, education and counseling, STD testing and treatment, HIV testing, and, in some cases, vasectomy services. Priority is given to low-income individuals, with fees based on income levels. In 2015, Title X-funded clinics served 4.018 million clients, mainly low-income women and adolescents. Title X-funded clinics served 4.018 million clients in 2015, with 10% being male and 66% having incomes at or below the federal poverty guidelines. 61% of clients relied on Title X clinics as their main source of healthcare. In 2015, 48% of clients were uninsured. The number of clients served in 2015 was lower compared to previous years, with reasons including reduced funding from various sources. Funding challenges and staffing shortages have impacted family planning projects, leading to increased costs for services and infrastructure. Grantees attribute decreased demand to factors such as ACA insurance coverage expansions, increased use of LARC, and recent clinical guideline changes. In 2015, there were 91 Title X family planning services grantees, including state, local, and nonprofit organizations. Title X grantees can provide services directly or subaward funds. Title X provided services through 3,951 clinics in the US and territories. Family planning training grants are used for staff training and career development. Family planning training grants are utilized to train staff and enhance the career development of paraprofessionals. Training is conducted through national training centers, producing resources on various topics. Title X program funding is discretionary and controlled by annual appropriations acts, with $286.479 million provided in FY2017. For more information on Title X, visit https://www.hhs.gov/opa/title-x-family-planning. In FY2018, the President's budget request includes $286.479 million for Title X, the same as FY2017. The House-reported FY2018 Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations bill would provide no funding for the Title X program in FY2018. As of now, an FY2018 Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations bill has not been introduced in the Senate. The FY2017 act continued previous years' requirements for Title X funds, including restrictions on spending for abortions. The Weldon amendment in FY2017 appropriations prohibits funding to entities that discriminate against healthcare providers who do not offer abortion services. This conflicts with regulations requiring Title X projects to provide information and counseling on pregnancy options. President Trump's FY2018 budget includes $286.479 million for Title X, maintaining previous restrictions on the use of funds for abortion. The proposed funding level aims to support family planning services for 4 million clients. OPA plans to award 90% of available Title X funds. OPA intends to allocate 90% of Title X funds for family planning services, including chlamydia screening, cervical tissue abnormalities screening, preconception care, infertility services, pregnancy testing, contraceptive provision, and counseling. FY2018 goals aim to prevent unintended pregnancies, increase the use of long-acting reversible contraception, and reduce infertility through chlamydia screening. The target cost per client served is $336.69, with plans to support a Family Planning Delivery System Improvement Center. The Justification outlines plans to address Zika virus and other reproductive health issues at Title X service sites. It mentions encouraging clinics to use electronic health records and improve financial sustainability. H.R. 3358 proposed no funding for the Title X program in FY2018. The bill restricts funds from being used for Title X of the PHS Act and prohibits funds from going to entities that provide abortions, except in cases of rape, incest, or danger to the mother's life. The bill restricts funds from going to entities that provide abortions, except in cases of rape, incest, or danger to the mother's life. Total federal Title X grants exceeding $23 million in FY2016 would no longer apply to entities that certify they will no longer perform or fund abortions. The HHS Secretary would seek repayment if the certification is violated. Section 529 of H.R. 3358 does not mention Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) but could potentially prohibit funds from Medicaid and other HHS programs going to PPFA and its affiliates. The Make America Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act, 2018 includes provisions to restrict federal funds from going to Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) and its affiliates unless they certify they will not perform abortions, except in cases of rape, incest, or danger to the mother's life. The bill also includes restrictions on Title X grants exceeding $23 million in FY2016 for entities that provide abortions. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) evaluated the Title X program in 2009, emphasizing the importance of family planning in reducing unintended pregnancies and improving maternal and infant health. They recommended federal support for family planning to achieve these goals. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommended increasing funding and improving management of the Title X program to reduce abortion rates through appropriate contraception use. They suggested updating program guidelines to be evidence-based, noting unnecessary requirements for pelvic and breast exams for adolescents. In response, the Office of Family Planning released new guidelines in April 2014 based on systematic reviews and recommendations from organizations like the CDC. The Office of Family Planning released new guidelines in April 2014 based on literature reviews and recommendations from various organizations. The guidelines state that pelvic exams and clinical breast exams are not routinely needed for contraception, but may be recommended for certain cases. The guidelines are supported by empirical evidence and aim to improve clinical practice. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) has provisions impacting Title X clinics, increasing access to health insurance and requiring coverage of contraceptive services without cost-sharing. This could help free up funds historically spent on serving the uninsured. The ACA expands Medicaid coverage for low-income individuals and offers family planning services. It also allows young adults to stay on their parents' insurance until age 26 and provides subsidies for private health plans through exchanges. The ACA expands Medicaid coverage and offers family planning services. Exchange plans must include essential community providers like Title X projects. The individual mandate requires most individuals to have health insurance. OPA's FY2017 Program Priorities include demonstrating Title X clinics' ability to bill Medicaid and private insurance. Project plans should show evidence of contracts with insurance plans, ability to enroll clients in private insurance and Medicaid, and report on clients assisted and enrolled. In 2015, 79% of Title X clinics had contracts to bill Medicaid plans and 69% had contracts to bill private health insurance plans. Title X clinics also provide enrollment assistance to clients eligible for Medicaid or exchange plans under ACA. OPA awarded grants to help clinics enroll uninsured clients in health coverage. The Obama Administration expected clinics to increase revenue by raising the proportion of clients with health insurance and billing third parties. Title X supporters argue the program is still necessary under the ACA. Title X program supports activities not covered by Medicaid or private insurance, including training clinicians and staff salaries. It also provides patient education, community outreach, and infrastructure support. Advocates argue that Medicaid and private insurance do not fully cover the cost of care, and family planning services will still be needed despite ACA expansions. Despite ACA's health coverage expansions, there is still a demand for safety net providers like Title X clinics that serve underserved populations. ACA requires most private health plans to cover preventive services for women without cost-sharing, including FDA-approved contraceptive methods. Some individuals may still seek family planning services privately due to confidentiality concerns. The Title X program provides counseling and access to a broad range of contraceptive options, including long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC). The Family Planning Annual Report shows an increase in insurance coverage rates among Title X clients, with 50% having health insurance in 2015 compared to 43% in 2014. In 2015, Title X clinics received increased private third-party payer revenues of $104.0 million, up from $95.1 million in 2014 and $69.2 million in 2013. The number of Title X clients served in 2015 was 3% lower than in 2014 and 12% lower than in 2013. The decrease in demand may be due to ACA coverage expansions and increased LARC use. Female Title X clients using hormonal implants or intrauterine devices increased by 11% in 2015 compared to 2014, 16% compared to 2013, and 50% higher overall. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has impacted the Title X program by increasing Medicaid rebate percentages for drug makers, leading to larger discounts for Title X clinics. This resulted in more revenue from drug sales. ACA also boosted funding for teen pregnancy prevention, health care workforce programs, and community health centers. The Health and Human Services (HHS) contracted with the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to advise on family planning, reproductive health, and Title X in health reform. Additionally, the Office of Population Affairs (OPA) awarded research funding for data analysis in FY2014. The Trump Administration may use the executive branch to change ACA regulations, guidance, or enforcement activities, including addressing conscience-based objections to certain women's preventive services. Legislation has also been introduced to amend, repeal, or replace some or all of the ACA. During the 115th Congress, various legislative proposals such as the American Health Care Act (AHCA) and Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA) were considered as replacements for the ACA. These proposals indirectly impact programs like Title X. The AHCA and BCRA legislative proposals would potentially impact Title X programs by affecting insurance status, Medicaid enrollment, and revenue sources. Medicaid accounted for 40% of Title X projects' total revenues in 2015, while Title X funds accounted for 19%. Federal regulations require Title X projects to have some revenues from non-Title X sources. The AHCA, BCRA, ORRA, and HCFA proposals would restrict federal Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood for one year, affecting Title X clinics' revenues. The legislation would provide an additional $422 million for the Community Health Center Fund, which some health centers could use for family planning services. In 2015, 26% of Title X clinics also participated in the Health Center program. Title X clinics reported that 1% of their family planning project revenues came from programs administered by BPHC. Executive and legislative actions could impact Title X in the future, with potential consequences being unclear. Grantees can provide family planning services directly or subaward funds to other entities. OPA issued a final rule in December 2016 regarding compliance with Title X requirements for selecting subrecipients. The final rule issued by OPA in December 2016 regarding compliance with Title X requirements for selecting subrecipients was nullified by P.L. 115-23 on April 13, 2017. The rule would have applied to grantees making subawards for Title X services but was overturned under the Congressional Review Act. The rule issued by OPA in December 2016 regarding Title X subrecipient selection was nullified by P.L. 115-23. This nullification means the rule is considered to have never taken effect, and HHS is prohibited from reissuing a similar rule. Some states had enacted laws to limit Title X participation by certain providers, such as prohibiting subawards to abortion providers or prioritizing certain types of providers for funding. The nullified rule by OPA in December 2016 regarding Title X subrecipient selection aimed to reduce uncertainty and improve access to services for Title X priority populations. It would have limited grantee criteria for restricting entities from Title X subawards to ensure compliance and continuity of services. The OPA released a final rule in July 2000 regarding Title X funds and abortion services in family planning projects. The rule revoked the \"gag rule\" and updated regulations to allow for the provision of abortion-related information. Critics argued that the rule violated conscience rights and restricted states' discretion in administering Title X funds. The July 3, 2000, rule amended 42 C.F.R. \u00a759.5 to require family planning projects receiving Title X funds to offer pregnant women information and counseling on prenatal care, infant care, adoption, and pregnancy termination. Projects must provide neutral, factual information and counseling on all options, including referral upon request. Federal funds are monitored to ensure they are not used for abortion services. Title X grantee activities must be separate from abortion services, with safeguards in place to ensure compliance. Financial audits and program reviews are conducted to maintain this separation. The number of Title X clinics providing abortions through non-Title X activities is unclear. In 2015, the Guttmacher Institute surveyed 535 publicly funded family planning clinics, with 10% of Title X funded clinics offering abortions separately. In 2004, HHS surveyed 86 Title X grantees, with 9 indicating that some clinic sites provided abortions with nonfederal funds. Title X supporters argue that family planning reduces unintended pregnancies, thereby reducing abortion. HHS estimates that Title X services helped avert 901,838 unintended pregnancies in FY2015, and the Guttmacher Institute estimates that Title X services helped avert 822,300 unintended pregnancies in calendar year 2015. Clinics receiving Title X funds helped avert 277,800 abortions in 2015, including 54,500 abortions among teens. On the other hand, Title X critics argue that federal funds should be withheld from organizations like PPFA that perform abortions. Critics argue that federal funding for nonabortion activities by organizations like Planned Parenthood indirectly supports abortion services. They also believe that funding Title X implies approval of nonmarital sexual activity among teens. Supporters of the program advocate for expanding Title X to reduce unintended pregnancies and abortions. The Guttmacher Institute estimates that expanding Title X family planning services could reduce unintended teen pregnancies and lower the U.S. teen pregnancy rate. Supporters argue that the U.S. has a higher teen pregnancy rate due to inconsistent contraceptive use and suggest that recent declines in teen birth rates are linked to changes in contraceptive use. Title X providers are required to encourage family participation for minors seeking family planning services while maintaining confidentiality. Confidentiality is crucial for minors seeking Title X family planning services. Providers must offer confidential services to adolescents and adhere to state laws regarding reporting of abuse. Written consent from parents is not required, and staff cannot inform parents before or after services are provided. Maintaining confidentiality is essential for adolescents to feel comfortable accessing and using these services. Multiple professional medical associations emphasize the importance of providing confidential services to adolescents, encouraging communication between adolescents and their parents or guardians about sexual and reproductive health. Educational materials and programs can help parents talk about sex and share their values with their child. Joint discussions can address family values and expectations about dating, relationships, and sexual behavior. Title X providers must comply with state notification and reporting laws on child abuse, molestation, sexual abuse, rape, or incest for minors receiving confidential services. Title X clinics provide confidential services to minors, including those with insurance who prefer not to use it due to confidentiality concerns. A study found that 4% of family planning visits were by clients who did not want to use their insurance, with 44% citing confidentiality concerns. Of those, 39% were under 18 years old. Title X clinics often do not bill health insurers to maintain confidentiality. Program requirements state that unemancipated minors seeking confidential services must be considered based on their own resources. Program requirements state that discounts for unemancipated minors receiving confidential services must be based on the minor's income. Supporters argue that parental notification requirements could deter adolescents from seeking family planning services, increasing their risk of pregnancy or STDs. Critics believe confidentiality rules can impede parents' right to oversee their children's healthcare. Some critics also oppose discounts for minors regardless of parents' income, as Title X aims to assist low-income families. PPFA operates through a national office and 56 affiliates with around 600 local health centers. Affiliates can receive funds from HHS or other Title X grantees. In 2015, Planned Parenthood clinics served 41% of female Title X clients despite making up only 13% of Title X clinics. A Government Accountability Office report in FY2012 showed that HHS provided $18.67 million directly to PPFA affiliates through the Title X program. These funds did not include money that reached Planned Parenthood indirectly through subgrants or other organizations. PPFA affiliates' expenditures of Title X funds were also detailed in the report. The report detailed Planned Parenthood affiliates' expenditures of Title X funds, with most expenditures identified through audit reports submitted to comply with OMB requirements. In FY2012, $64.35 million was spent from the Title X program, and the CBO estimated an annual $60 million received by PPFA and its affiliates through Title X."
