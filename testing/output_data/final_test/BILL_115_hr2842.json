    "content": "The Act is named the \"Accelerating Individuals into the Workforce Act.\" It includes demonstration projects to support subsidized employment for TANF recipients entering the workforce. Section 403 of the Social Security Act is amended to include grants for subsidized employment demonstration projects, specifically for programs offering registered apprenticeships to help low-income individuals enter and maintain employment in high-demand industries. States must apply for these grants and meet specific requirements set by the Secretary. States applying for grants under this subsection must describe how wage subsidies will be provided, the duration and amount of the subsidies, recruitment of employers, retention of employment after the subsidy ends, coordination with other efforts to help low-income individuals. The State must describe how it will coordinate subsidized employment with other federal programs to help low-income individuals complete education and training programs and enter the workforce. The project can pay up to 50% of an eligible recipient's wages for a maximum of 12 months, as long as the total federal funds used do not exceed that percentage. An eligible recipient is someone receiving state assistance or a noncustodial parent of a minor. The program provides subsidized job opportunities for noncustodial parents of minors who are unemployed and have income below 200 percent of the poverty line. The state must ensure no displacement in the subsidized job program funded under this grant. The subsidized job program funded under this subsection prohibits displacement of regular employees and requires a grievance procedure for resolving complaints. The subsidized job program funded under this subsection prohibits displacement of regular employees and requires a grievance procedure for resolving complaints of alleged violations. No preemption of state or local laws providing greater employee protection is allowed. States receiving funds must submit reports on subsidized employment matching individuals' training and work experience. The State must report on their subsidized employment program, detailing the structure of activities, policies for nondisplacement and grievance procedures, and the percentage of eligible recipients who received subsidies. The State must report on the subsidized employment program, including details on recipients in unsubsidized employment after the subsidy ends, their earnings, and concurrent receipt of other benefits. The Secretary will evaluate the program. The Secretary will conduct a high-quality evaluation of the demonstration project, analyzing its impact on eligible recipients who received additional training during subsidized employment. Evaluators must have experience in rigorous program evaluations, including randomized controlled trials. The evaluation of a demonstration project will use experimental designs like randomized controlled trials for strong causal inferences. Results will be published on the Department of Health and Human Services website, and recommendations will be submitted to Congress on increasing employment and retention. The Senate recommends ways to improve employment, retention, and advancement for individuals receiving state program assistance, including additional training and addressing rural and tribal employment challenges. $100,000,000 is reserved for this purpose in fiscal year 2018. In fiscal year 2018, $100,000,000 is reserved to fund career pathway programs that offer services defined in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. 15 percent of the reserved amounts will be used for this purpose, and funds provided to a State must be expended within the fiscal year or the following fiscal year. The amendment made by this Act will be effective on October 1, 2017."
