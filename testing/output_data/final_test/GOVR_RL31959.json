    "content": "The Senate Foreign Relations Committee ordered reported S. 2144, the Foreign Affairs Authorization Act, FY2005, authorizing about $16.9 billion for foreign assistance programs. It includes policy initiatives like the Radiological Terrorism Security Act and the Global Pathogen Surveillance Act. This is the first broad foreign assistance authorization act since 1985. Since 1985, Congress has debated foreign aid legislation annually or biennially, leading to broader discussions on U.S. foreign policy. Controversy and disagreements between branches of government have marked these debates. In the absence of final passage, more narrowly focused foreign aid bills like the SEED Act (1989) and the FREEDOM Support Act (1992) have been approved. The lack of Administration support for foreign aid has been a recurring issue. The lack of Administration support for foreign aid bills has hindered their enactment over the past 18 years. Despite efforts to rewrite the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the executive branch has often opposed or not encouraged broad foreign assistance measures. As a result, foreign assistance legislation has been primarily included in annual Foreign Operations appropriation bills, which have played a significant role in shaping foreign aid and broader foreign policy initiatives over the past 19 years. Since the end of the Cold War, Foreign Operations appropriations have been crucial in modifying aid policy and resource allocation priorities. Legislation authorizing U.S. participation in multilateral development bank replenishments has been included in these measures. The President has used foreign aid as a tool in the global war on terrorism since September 11, 2001, with the help of appropriation bills. The Millennium Challenge Corporation was authorized through the FY2004 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. Congress has also used appropriation measures to impose restrictions on the Administration's management of foreign assistance. The Foreign Relations Committee reported a bill to reinforce its role in foreign assistance policy making, not to rewrite existing legislation. The bill aimed to provide authorization for program appropriations in FY2004 and update selected provisions to reflect current policy. Senator Lugar planned a more comprehensive effort in the future to revamp foreign aid laws. The Senate debated foreign aid authorizing legislation in 2003, with S. 2144 continuing efforts for an omnibus foreign policy bill for FY2005. The House approved companion legislation, H.R. 1950, addressing State Department operations and security assistance. Division B of S. 1161 includes FY2005 authorizations and updates existing foreign aid authorities. Title XXIII is the Radiological Terrorism Security Act and Title XXIV is the Global Pathogen Surveillance Act. Title XV includes provisions related to Africa and Latin America, including additional aid for Haiti. S. 2144 authorizes about $16.9 billion for foreign assistance programs, aligning closely with annual Foreign Operations appropriations. The total for foreign aid is $182 million less than proposed by the Administration, with the savings redirected to State Department and other international affairs programs. S. 2144 authorizes $16.9 billion for foreign assistance programs, with funding increases for various initiatives including child survival, health programs, international HIV/AIDS activities, development assistance, aid to the former Soviet Union, East European assistance, and Nonproliferation, Anti-Terrorism, Demining, and Related Assistance programs. The Senate bill S. 2144 authorizes $16.9 billion for foreign assistance programs, with adjustments for a 0.59% rescission required by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2004. It includes funds from the FY2003 supplemental and a reduction of $500 million for the Millennium Challenge Account. The total amounts authorized in S. 2144 align with the overall international affairs spending approved in the FY2005 Budget Resolution. The President's foreign policy budget request is increased to $32.33 billion in discretionary spending. The Senate bill S. 2144 authorizes $16.9 billion for foreign assistance programs, with adjustments for a 0.59% rescission required by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2004. It includes funds from the FY2003 supplemental and a reduction of $500 million for the Millennium Challenge Account. The total amounts authorized in S. 2144 align with the overall international affairs spending approved in the FY2005 Budget Resolution. The President's foreign policy budget request is increased to $32.33 billion in discretionary spending. Floor amendments by Senators Lugar, Durbin, and Dewine added $1.83 billion to the Committee-reported level, intended for higher resources for HIV/AIDS, aid to Haiti, and filling funding gaps throughout the international affairs budget. Title XXII of Division B of S. 2144 includes 35 sections, incorporating legislative items from annual appropriations and updating existing provisions. The legislation S. 2144 updates authorities related to foreign assistance, including waivers, debt prohibitions, and arms sales thresholds. It extends a waiver for Pakistan aid restrictions and addresses the threat of terrorist use of radiological dispersal devices. The United States focuses on studying and planning responses to terrorist use of radiological dispersal devices (RDDs). Section 2304 authorizes assistance to other countries in developing national response plans and training first responders for RDD attacks. Section 2303 requires reports on preparations to detect and mitigate radiological attacks on U.S. diplomatic missions abroad. Title XXIV of S. 2144, The Global Pathogen Surveillance Act, authorizes $35 million for FY2005 to enhance developing nations' capability to detect, identify, and contain infectious disease outbreaks. The legislation was first introduced in 2002 and emphasizes the need for a global surveillance system to track the spread of diseases like SARS. The importance of a global surveillance system to detect and track the spread of infectious diseases worldwide is crucial. Public health experts see SARS as part of the growing threat of infectious diseases, driven by various factors. International trade and travel facilitate rapid pathogen spread, making global surveillance essential to contain microbial threats before they escalate into pandemics. Key components include trained epidemiologists and modern laboratories. The Global Pathogen Surveillance Act aims to enhance global infectious disease surveillance by promoting the development of a network of trained epidemiologists, fully-equipped laboratories, and a public health communications infrastructure. Developing nations often lack the necessary resources to detect emerging pathogens and track disease patterns, highlighting the need for a stronger global surveillance system. The Global Pathogen Surveillance Act aims to support developing nations by providing training for public health officials, in-country and in the United States, and assistance to purchase necessary laboratory and communication equipment for disease surveillance. The Global Pathogen Surveillance Act authorizes funding of $35 million in FY2005 for the expansion of CDC facilities overseas, assignment of public health officials to diplomatic missions, and enhancing WHO's surveillance capabilities. The funds will be drawn from the NADR Programs account, with $25 million allocated for training public health officials. The legislation allocates funds for various purposes including training public health officials, assisting developing nations, expanding U.S. government labs overseas, and supporting WHO and regional health networks. Representative Kirk introduced the Global Pathogen Surveillance Act in the House. Division B of S. 2144 addresses specific country and regional foreign policy issues. Title XXV of the legislation addresses specific country and regional foreign policy issues, including support for the Congo Forest Basin Partnership in Africa, programs in Ethiopia to promote independent media, and efforts to establish accountability for human rights abuses in Central Africa since 1993. The Secretary of State would be required to report on U.S. actions taken in this regard within six months of enactment. The provision authorizes up to $12 million for justice and reconciliation mechanisms in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Burundi, and Uganda. It also authorizes the African Contingency Operations Training and Assistance Program (ACOTA) with eligibility criteria for country participation. Additionally, $15 million is authorized for FY2005 for ACOTA programs. The provision places conditions on military financing and training funds for Indonesia. The provision places conditions on military financing and training funds for Indonesia, requiring certification from the President regarding steps taken to investigate and prosecute those responsible for an attack on U.S. citizens. India is added to the list of focus countries for the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative, with a significant portion of the program's funding directed towards countries with the worst epidemic. Additionally, there is a sense of Congress that adequate security is necessary for free and fair Afghan elections. The provision authorizes assistance to Haiti and expands efforts to register women for Afghan elections. It also adds 14 Caribbean nations to the list eligible for HIV/AIDS assistance. The U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS Act focuses on specific countries for U.S. programs. The Senate rejected an amendment to add Caribbean nations to the list of priority countries for HIV/AIDS assistance. Congress directed the Administration to name a 15th country outside of Africa and the Caribbean to the focus list, but the Administration has not complied yet. Additionally, an amendment was made to prevent new expropriation claims against the Nicaraguan government from influencing U.S. decisions on foreign aid sanctions. Nicaragua is subject to aid restrictions due to unsettled expropriation claims, but waivers are granted annually for foreign policy reasons. Section 2511 aims to set a deadline for new expropriation claims. Supporters highlight President Bolanos' efforts to address economic and corruption issues, urging continued American support while emphasizing Nicaragua's responsibility to settle pre-Bolanos expropriation claims. The legislation would authorize the Secretary of State to establish a deadline for submission of any new expropriation claims. The legislation aims to establish a deadline for submission of new expropriation claims prior to January 9, 2002. It includes provisions for debt reduction in Iraq, protection of women's rights, support for the Middle East Partnership Initiative, and the creation of a Middle East Foundation. The Middle East Foundation, established in 2002, aims to promote democratic and economic reforms in the region. It operates similarly to the Asia Foundation and Eurasia Foundation, issuing grants to non-governmental entities in the Middle East to support MEPI goals. Title XXV also includes technical changes to executive branch reporting requirements and repeals outdated sections of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961."
