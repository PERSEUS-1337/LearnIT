    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Medicare Value and Quality Act of 2003\". The House findings emphasize the need to reward healthcare providers for delivering high-quality, cost-effective care to Medicare beneficiaries. The Journal of the American Medical Association has published quality indicators related to this issue. The cost of healthcare is influenced by physician services, ordering behavior, and hospital payments under the Medicare program. The original Medicare fee-for-service program lacks a mechanism to pay for interventions aimed at improving quality of care for beneficiaries in each state, influenced by physician and hospital practice patterns. SEC. 3. TO ENCOURAGE THE PROVISION OF HIGH-QUALITY, COST-EFFECTIVE INPATIENT HOSPITAL SERVICES. The purpose of this section is to incentivize hospitals in states providing high-quality and cost-effective healthcare to Medicare beneficiaries. Congress aims to encourage states to deliver quality healthcare and create incentives for Medicare to recognize the value of purchased services. The Secretary will establish a mechanism to provide economic incentives within six months of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will provide economic incentives to inpatient hospital services delivering high-quality, cost-effective healthcare. This includes a 5 percent bonus payment to top-performing states and measurements that consider quality of care and resource consumption. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality will establish a methodology for awarding bonus payments to inpatient hospital services in states providing high-quality, cost-effective healthcare to Medicare beneficiaries. The methodology for awarding bonus payments to inpatient hospital services will be based on rank and performance on Medicare quality indicators published in JAMA and cost rankings from CMS annual reports. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services under the Medicare Act for inpatient hospital services."
