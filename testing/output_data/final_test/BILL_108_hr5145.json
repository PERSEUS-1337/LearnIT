    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Fish and Wildlife Policy Fellowship Program Act of 2004\". The Congress finds that nearly one-third of the US population participates in wildlife-related recreation annually, contributing significantly to the economy. In 2001, fishing and hunting had economic impacts of $116 billion and $68 billion, respectively, creating around 1 million jobs. Over $1 billion is dedicated to university programs and agencies supporting natural living resources. The National Sea Grant John A. Knauss Fellowship has been successful in promoting stewardship of the Nation's natural marine and coastal resources since 1979, with over 528 marine scientists awarded fellowships. Many fellows continue to serve as marine policy professionals in various sectors. Currently, there is no formal mechanism to secure individuals with expertise in freshwater and anadromous fisheries, wildlife, or conservation biology within the Federal Government and Congress. Establishing such a mechanism would enhance stewardship of the Nation's fish and wildlife. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and the term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF FISH AND WILDLIFE POLICY FELLOWSHIPS. The Secretary will award fellowships to graduate and post-graduate students studying freshwater and anadromous fish, wildlife, conservation management, or biology. The objectives include providing opportunities for participation in the policy process and offering expertise in fish and wildlife management to aid in conservation efforts. The Secretary will award fellowships for a maximum of 1 year to graduate and post-graduate students studying freshwater and anadromous fish, wildlife, conservation management, or biology. Efforts will be made to ensure equal access for minority and economically disadvantaged students. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress every 2 years on these efforts. The Director will administer fellowships for graduate and post-graduate students studying freshwater and anadromous fish, wildlife, conservation management, or biology. $1,400,000 is authorized for each fiscal year 2005 through 2009, with a limitation of 5% for administrative costs."
