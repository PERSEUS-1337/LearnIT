    "content": "The \"Private Student Loan Debt Swap Act of 2009\" aims to establish a program for eligible borrowers to refinance their private education debt with more affordable loans mirroring Federal direct loans. This Act introduces a temporary private education loan refinancing program under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Secretary will implement a Private Education Loan Debt Swap program to refinance private education loans for eligible borrowers. Funds will be available for refinancing loans under this program, following the definition of a private education loan as per the Truth in Lending Act. Eligibility for loan refinancing includes being eligible for private education loan refinancing since July 1, 1994. The Private Education Loan Debt Swap program allows eligible individuals who incurred private education loans after July 1, 1994, to refinance their loans if they are not enrolled at least half-time in an eligible institution and remain indebted on at least one private education loan eligible for refinancing. The Private Education Loan Debt Swap program allows eligible individuals to refinance their private education loans if they meet certain criteria, including not being in default on any loans and having made consecutive payments on the loan to be refinanced. Eligibility also includes having been eligible for a Federal PLUS Loan for graduate or professional enrollment and having incurred at least one private education loan during that period. The Debt Swap Loan Program allows eligible individuals to refinance private education loans if they meet specific criteria, including making consecutive payments on the loan to be refinanced, having no adverse credit history, and not having previously refinanced under this program. The program applies to loans incurred between July 1, 1994, and July 1, 2010. The Debt Swap Loan Program allows eligible individuals to refinance private education loans incurred between July 1, 1994, and July 1, 2010. The maximum amount that can be refinanced is based on the sum of unpaid principal, accrued interest, and late charges of all eligible private education loans. The Debt Swap Loan Program allows individuals to refinance private education loans incurred between July 1, 1994, and July 1, 2010. The maximum amount that can be refinanced is based on the sum of unpaid principal, accrued interest, and late charges of all eligible private education loans. For loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2008, undergraduate and graduate students can receive loan amounts under specific sections, with deductions for previous borrowings. The Debt Swap Loan Program allows individuals to refinance private education loans incurred between July 1, 1994, and July 1, 2010. The interest rate for refinanced loans is based on the type of loan an individual has, with repayment terms mirroring Federal Direct Consolidation Loans. The authority to refinance private education loans under this subsection expires on July 1, 2011, or 1 year after certification by the Secretary to Congress that the debt swap loan program is fully operational. The Secretary will provide a standard application and promissory note for loans made under this section. Loan proceeds will be paid directly to the holder of the private education loan being refinanced to discharge or reduce the borrower's debt. The Secretary will conduct a national awareness campaign on refinancing private education loans, highlighting the benefits of Federal student loan programs compared to private loans. Additionally, information on repayment options, loan forgiveness, low interest rates, and other benefits will be provided. The Secretary will report annually to Congress on the volume and repayment status of private education loans refinanced under this section."
