    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Decrease Unsafe Toxins Act.\" The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 establishes safety requirements for children's products, including the reduction or elimination of lead, phthalates, and certain flame retardants. A study found that over 80 percent of children's cushioned products tested contained at least one flame retardant chemical. Children in the United States have high levels of toxic flame retardants in their bodies, which have been linked to cancer, immune, and endocrine disruption, developmental impairment, birth defects, and reproductive dysfunction. Flame retardants are associated with reduced IQ, hyperactivity, reduced fertility, birth defects, and hormonal changes, especially in infants and children. Children are exposed to flame retardants through ingestion of contaminated dust via hand-to-mouth contact. Flame retardant chemicals in children's cushioned products are unnecessary as they do not provide measurable fire safety benefits. Strollers, infant carriers, and nursing pillows have been exempt from California's Flammability Standard since 2010. The revision of California's Flammability Standard exempts 17 more baby and infant products due to the State agency's belief that they do not pose a significant fire hazard. Banning flame retardant chemicals in children's products would reduce health risks without compromising fire safety. The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 is amended to ban flame retardant chemicals in the resilient filling materials of children's products. The Decrease Unsafe Toxins Act prohibits children's cushioned products manufactured with over 1,000 parts per million flame retardant chemicals in the filling material. These products are considered banned hazardous substances under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act. The Decrease Unsafe Toxins Act bans children's cushioned products with high levels of flame retardant chemicals, including highchair pads, infant swings, bassinets, and playards. The Act defines flame retardant chemicals as organohalogen or organophosphorous compounds. The Decrease Unsafe Toxins Act prohibits the use of flame retardant chemicals in resilient filling materials in children's products."
