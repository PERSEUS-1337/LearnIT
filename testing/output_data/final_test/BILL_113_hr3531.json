    "content": "The \"Creating Access to Rehabilitation for Every Senior (CARES) Act of 2013\" eliminates the Medicare 3-day prior hospitalization requirement for coverage of skilled nursing facility services in qualified skilled nursing facilities. The CARES Act of 2013 eliminates the 3-day prior hospitalization requirement for coverage of extended care services in qualified skilled nursing facilities under the Social Security Act. The provisions for extended care services in qualified skilled nursing facilities under the Social Security Act include various requirements such as sections 1814(a)(2) and (6), subsections (b)(2) and (e), and sections 1861(v)(1)(G)(i), (2)(A), and (3), 1861(y), 1862(a)(18), 1866(a)(1)(H)(ii)(I), 1883(d) and (f), and 1888(e). The term 'qualified skilled nursing facility' refers to a facility with a rating of 3 or more stars under the Medicare Nursing Home Compare program and not under a quality-of-care corporate integrity agreement. The Secretary may waive ratings requirement for skilled nursing facilities to ensure access to extended care services in underserved areas. The determination is based on information from the Inspector General's website. The Secretary may waive ratings requirement for skilled nursing facilities in underserved areas. A grace period is provided for facilities to improve ratings before disqualification. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission will study the cost and impact of a provision regarding skilled nursing facilities' disqualification, with a report due by June 1, 2016."
