The Palestine Liberation Organization, led by Yasser Arafat, failed to uphold promises made in the Oslo Accords for a peaceful resolution of the conflict and renunciation of terrorism. Arafat also neglected to maintain law and order in the West Bank and Gaza, leading to ongoing acts of terrorism. Yasser Arafat has failed to offer credible security guarantees to Israeli and Palestinian peoples, violated peace commitments by purchasing offensive weaponry from Iran, and is directly responsible for the murder of innocent Israelis since 2000. He has also been implicated in funding terrorists behind homicide bombings in Israel. Failure to adequately respond to end the homicide bombings complicates the resolution of the conflict in the region. The statement of Congress is outlined in Section 3. The sense of Congress is that the US should urge an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Palestinians, the surrender of Palestinian extremists wanted for assassination, and condemnation of terrorism by Yasser Arafat and the PLO. The Congress supports the President's efforts, in conjunction with Israel, Arab states, and the international community, to achieve peace in the region by condemning terrorism, confiscating weapons, ending financial support for terrorism, and urging Arab nations to stop funding terrorist operations. SEC. 4. IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS. The text prohibits visas for members of the Palestine Liberation Organization and Palestinian Authority, with a waiver option for national security interests. It also mandates the downgrading of the PLO office in the United States. The text prohibits the establishment of a Palestinian information office in the US, except for the Permanent Observer Mission of Palestine at the UN. It also restricts the functions of any PLO or Palestinian Authority office in the US. The Secretary of State must impose travel restrictions on the Senior PLO Representative at the UN. The Secretary of State must impose travel restrictions on the senior official of the Permanent Observer Mission of Palestine at the United Nations, similar to those imposed on officials from the Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The President is required to freeze the assets of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority in the United States, with exceptions for certain functions and travel purposes. The President is required to freeze the assets of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority in the United States, with exceptions for certain functions and travel purposes. The President must freeze the assets of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority in the US, with exceptions for specific functions and travel purposes. Additionally, a report on PLO terrorist activities is required. Within 30 days of enactment, the President must report acts of terrorism by the Palestinian Authority or PLO to Congress. The report will determine if they should be designated as terrorist organizations. The President can waive these requirements if deemed in the national interest. The President can waive reporting acts of terrorism by the Palestinian Authority or PLO to Congress if it is in the national security interest of the United States. The waiver must be reported to the appropriate congressional committees. The sanctions imposed by this Act will continue until the President determines and reports to the appropriate congressional committees that the conditions justifying the sanctions no longer exist. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" refers to specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives."
