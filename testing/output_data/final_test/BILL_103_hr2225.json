    "content": "The \"Highway Construction Private Investment Act of 1993\" allows for the inclusion of the Interstate System in the toll road program and sets minimum obligations for privately financed toll facilities. Section 129 of title 23, United States Code, is amended to require each State to enter into contracts with private entities to finance toll facilities, with obligations equal to or exceeding the State's apportionment amount for each fiscal year. The apportionment amount for each fiscal year is determined as a percentage of the funds allocated to the State under various sections of the transportation act, starting at 15% in 1994 and increasing to 25% in 1996 and beyond. The Secretary may withhold funds from apportionment if a State fails to enter into contracts requiring private persons to obligate an amount equal to or exceeding the State's apportionment for the fiscal year. The Secretary may withhold funds from apportionment if a State fails to enter into contracts requiring private persons to obligate an amount equal to or exceeding the State's apportionment for the fiscal year. The difference between the aggregate apportionment amount and the amount required to be obligated under such contracts will be withheld proportionately from each of the apportionments to the State. This withheld amount will be treated as obligation authority for Federal-aid highways and highway safety construction programs. The Secretary may withhold funds from apportionment if a State fails to enter into contracts requiring private persons to obligate an amount equal to or exceeding the State's apportionment for the fiscal year. The obligation authority corresponding to funds withheld from apportionment shall be distributed to the State if good faith efforts were made to enter into contracts as described. The Secretary may withhold funds from apportionment if a State fails to enter into contracts requiring private persons to obligate an amount equal to or exceeding the State's apportionment for the fiscal year. If a State demonstrates good faith efforts to enter into such contracts, the withheld funds will be apportioned back to the State. If a State fails to make good faith efforts to enter into contracts requiring private persons to obligate funds equal to or exceeding the State's apportionment, the Secretary will reapportion the withheld funds among States that met contract requirements in the previous fiscal year. This reapportionment must be completed by November 10 of the fiscal year. The formula for determining the amount of funds withheld from apportionment is based on the difference between the actual amount obligated by private persons in contracts with the state in the previous fiscal year and the state's apportionment amount for that year. The Secretary transfers apportioned amounts to a State's surface transportation program under certain limitations. Subsections (d)(1) and (d)(2) of section 133 do not apply to the transferred amounts. The Secretary transfers apportioned amounts to a State's surface transportation program under limitations, excluding subsections (d)(1) and (d)(2). Subsections (d)(2) and (d)(3) are referenced."
