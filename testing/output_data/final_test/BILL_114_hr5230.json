    "content": "The \"Anti-Pyramid Promotional Scheme Act of 2016\" prohibits the establishment, operation, or promotion of pyramid schemes. Violations are considered unfair or deceptive practices under the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Federal Trade Commission enforces this prohibition. The Act defines \"appropriate inventory repurchase agreement\" as a program where a plan repurchases inventory from a participant upon termination, based on reasonable terms. \"Commercially reasonable terms\" refer to repurchasing current inventory. The Act defines \"reasonable terms\" as repurchasing current and marketable inventory within 12 months at not less than 90% of the original net cost to the participant. \"Compensation\" refers to any payment or financial benefits within the plan. \"Consideration\" includes payment of money or purchase of a product, but excludes certain types of purchases. The term \"current and marketable\" refers to inventory that is unopened, unused, and within its reasonable shelf-life period, or represents the unexpired portion of any contract. It does not include inventory clearly described to the participant prior to purchase. Inventory refers to goods and services, including promotional material, sales aids, and kits that participants are required to purchase. Inventory loading occurs when participants are encouraged to buy an excessive amount. Participants are individuals who join the plan or operation. A pyramid promotional scheme involves compensating participants primarily for recruiting others into the plan rather than selling products to ultimate users. Ultimate users are non-participants or participants who buy products for personal use, not just to qualify for more compensation. SEC. 4. LIMITATIONS.\n\nThis Act does not limit the authority of Federal officials to take action against pyramid promotional schemes for violations of Federal law, including the Federal Trade Commission Act. It also does not allow for a defense in enforcement actions if the focus of the scheme is on selling additional franchises or if it includes repurchase agreement inventory loading programs."
