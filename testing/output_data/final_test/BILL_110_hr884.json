The Congress recognizes the importance of technology in combating terrorism and implementing homeland security strategies. The US and its allies in the global war on terrorism aim to collaborate on research, development, and testing of equipment and technologies to detect, prevent, respond to, and recover from acts of terrorism. Certain allies like Israel, the UK, Canada, Australia, and Singapore have expertise in homeland security. The United States and its allies in the global war on terrorism have a successful history of collaboration in defense, agriculture, and telecommunications. Sharing technological expertise will benefit in combating domestic and international terrorism.
