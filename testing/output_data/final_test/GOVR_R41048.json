    "content": "In the 2010 census, the total population of the United States was counted, including U.S. citizens, lawfully present aliens, and unauthorized aliens. There is a debate on whether aliens, especially those unlawfully in the country, should be excluded from the census count due to concerns about apportioning House seats and determining voting districts. The question arises whether excluding aliens would require amending federal census statutes or the Constitution, which mandates a decennial census to enumerate the whole number of persons in the U.S. for apportioning House seats among states. The Census Bureau counts the total resident population of the states, including citizens and aliens, at their \"usual residence.\" Congress has delegated this responsibility to the Secretary of Commerce and the Bureau of the Census. The Commerce Secretary has discretion to collect information on citizenship status, although it is not a legal requirement. The Commerce Secretary has discretion to collect information on citizenship status through the American Community Survey (ACS), which historically has not consistently included questions on citizenship. Previous censuses included categories for foreigners not naturalized and place of birth. Congress has considered legislation to exclude aliens from the census for apportioning House seats. No legislation has been introduced in the 112th Congress regarding the exclusion of aliens from census data for House apportionment. The issue may arise in future decennial censuses and apportionments if the presence of unauthorized aliens in the United States remains unresolved. Legislation from the 111th Congress may serve as a model for future legislation on this issue. Several bills were introduced to amend federal census statutes regarding the treatment of unauthorized aliens. The Fairness in Representation Act would have required respondents to indicate their citizenship or lawful presence on census forms, with adjustments made to prevent unauthorized aliens from being counted for House seat apportionment. An amendment by Senator Vitter would have cut off funding for the census unless questions on U.S. citizenship and immigration status were included. The proposed amendment in H.J.Res. 11 aimed to only count U.S. citizens in the apportionment calculation, but it was ruled non-germane. On the other hand, the Every Person Counts Act (H.R. 3855) sought to prohibit asking about U.S. citizenship or immigration status in the census. These bills address the issue of how to handle unauthorized aliens in the census. The legislation raises questions about its constitutionality regarding the census. Congress may require the Commerce Secretary to collect citizenship information, but the inclusion or exclusion of aliens in the census count depends on constitutional requirements. Some are concerned about the impact on aliens, especially regarding citizenship and immigration status questions. Some are concerned about including aliens in census data for apportioning House seats and voting districts. Constitutional issues may arise if aliens are excluded by statute, as the term \"persons\" likely includes unauthorized aliens. Any proposal to exclude unauthorized aliens may require a constitutional amendment. The term \"persons/people\" in the Constitution has been interpreted to include corporations in certain contexts. The question arises whether it refers only to U.S. citizens for apportioning House seats. It appears that \"persons\" is not limited to \"citizens,\" as the Framers used both terms separately. Courts have generally held that aliens are included in the term \"persons.\" The term \"persons/people\" in the Constitution includes aliens, including unauthorized aliens, for apportionment purposes. Some argue against including certain aliens due to their legal or voting status, but historically, individuals without voting rights have been counted. Additionally, some states have allowed aliens to vote under specific conditions. The inclusion of slaves in apportionment despite limited rights suggests a broad interpretation of the term \"persons.\" The Framers' intent behind the Apportionment Clause language was to be broadly inclusive, as seen in the inclusion of slaves and the specification of excluding \"Indians not taxed.\" The term \"persons\" was understood to encompass all individuals within a state, regardless of legal status. The debates surrounding the Apportionment Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment support the conclusion that \"persons\" was meant to be broadly interpreted. The term \"persons\" in the Apportionment Clause includes free citizens and all individuals considered \"inhabitants.\" Congress chose \"persons\" over \"citizens\" to avoid opposition from states with large alien populations and to prevent inequalities in taxation. The term was also chosen because aliens could vote in some states. Congress has considered excluding aliens from apportionment calculations on multiple occasions. Some Members have suggested excluding aliens from apportionment calculations, arguing it may require a constitutional amendment. Congress has the authority to grant citizenship but may not have the power to exclude certain groups from being considered \"persons.\" Alternatively, Congress could argue its broad authority over the census, apportionment, and immigration allows it to exclude undocumented aliens from the count. The argument revolves around counting aliens, particularly undocumented aliens, for apportionment purposes and its impact on voting power. The Supreme Court's decision in Wesberry v. Sanders requires equal population in congressional districts, but this standard may not apply to interstate apportionment. Each state must have at least one House district, leading to disparities in voting power among states. The Supreme Court's Wesberry standard aims for equal voter representation in state districting decisions, but it is not feasible on a national scale due to varying district sizes among states. While historical census data included questions about citizenship, there is no requirement to exclude aliens for apportionment purposes. The U.S. Constitution does not mandate the exclusion of aliens from the census count, and states have the discretion to choose data for redistricting within their borders. Federal courts have ruled that states are not obligated to use federal census data for redistricting purposes. In cases where state legislatures did not use federal census data for redistricting, courts have upheld or invalidated the use of alternative data. The Supreme Court in Kirkpatrick v. Preisler allowed for projected population figures if accurate, but emphasized that federal census data is the best available. The Court found fault with Missouri's redistricting plan for not justifying its methodology. In Burns v. Richardson, the Supreme Court ruled that states are not required to use total population figures from the federal census for state legislative redistricting. The Court acknowledged that total population may not always be the appropriate basis for redistricting plans, as seen in Hawaii's use of registered voters for redistricting the state senate. The Court emphasized that redistricting plans must satisfy the Equal Protection Clause. The Supreme Court ruled in Burns v. Richardson that states are not required to use total population figures for state legislative redistricting. Hawaii's unique situation with tourists and military personnel led to the use of registered voters for redistricting the state senate, deemed consistent with the Equal Protection Clause. The Court in Burns v. Richardson ruled that states are not obligated to use total population figures for state legislative redistricting. The ruling does not establish the validity of using alternate figures, but they must be justified as the best available data or justified by specific circumstances. The Supreme Court has not addressed the constitutionality of using total population versus voting population for intrastate redistricting, especially in cases where it results in disparities in voter strength. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that redistricting based on total population, not voting population, would be unconstitutional. Justice Thomas dissented in Chen v. City of Houston, arguing that the decision should be left to the legislative process. States can use data other than the census for redistricting if it is the best available data. States can use data other than the census for redistricting if it is the best available data. State laws determine the use of official federal decennial census data in redistricting processes, with some states lacking statutory procedures for congressional redistricting. In such cases, state legislatures may conduct congressional redistricting on an ad hoc basis, allowing for the use of alternative data if not explicitly required by state laws. The federal government may release two official sets of data for redistricting purposes, one for House of Representatives apportionment and the other for other uses. State laws referencing official federal decennial census data may be interpreted differently, with a majority of the Court linking it to apportionment data. State legislative activity has increased regarding the use of federal decennial census data for intrastate redistricting. Congress could potentially play a role in determining the data to be used by states for redistricting. Congress has the authority to establish guidelines for redistricting under Article I, Section 2, clause 1. Congress has the authority to establish guidelines for redistricting using federal decennial census data for intrastate redistricting. The Constitution requires a decennial census to determine the \"whole number of persons\" in the United States for apportioning House seats among states. The Constitution requires a decennial census to determine the \"whole number of persons\" in the United States for apportioning House seats among states. Legislation has been considered to exclude individuals, including aliens, from the census count for apportionment purposes. Some Members of Congress have considered excluding aliens from the census count for apportionment, citing historical references to support their argument. The early censuses, starting from 1790, included categories for free white males, free white females, other free persons, and slaves. The 1820 census was the first to include a subcategory for \"foreigners not naturalized,\" indicating that aliens were included in the count. In 1866, Congress considered amendments to limit the census to voters or citizens in the context of civil rights amendments after the Civil War. The Fourteenth Amendment revised the apportionment clause, requiring the counting of all persons in each state, excluding untaxed Indians. The proposal aimed to reduce a state's population count for apportionment if male citizens were disenfranchised for reasons other than participating in the Confederate rebellion or a crime. This was to prevent former slave states from disenfranchising African Americans. Another proposal suggested counting all persons except those denied civil or political rights based on race or color. Some versions included Indians not taxed, while others excluded them. These proposals were part of civil rights amendments after the Civil War. The proposal to amend constitutional requirements for apportionment and the census aimed to count only voters in each state to prevent former slave states from disenfranchising African Americans. However, critics argued that this approach would penalize states by not including aliens/non-citizens in the census count, depart from the original census clause, and potentially cheapen suffrage. Various proposals suggested excluding disenfranchised former Confederate rebels from the count, while others debated including them. The Fourteenth Amendment proposals aimed to prevent former slave states from disenfranchising African Americans by counting only voters in each state. The issue of counting aliens in the census for apportionment of the House of Representatives was contentious in the late 1920s and early 1930s, leading to the incomplete decennial apportionment after the 1920 census. The apportionment of the House of Representatives was never completed after the breakdown in the process. Congress legislated a formula for allocating Representatives among states, eliminating partisan negotiations. There was debate on amending the Constitution to exclude aliens from census data for apportionment, but a 1929 Senate opinion found no constitutional authority for this exclusion. The opinion on the meaning of \"persons\" in the Census Clause concluded that aliens were always included. The Fourteenth Amendment's reference to excluding untaxed Indians would be unnecessary if \"persons\" only meant citizens. Attempts to exclude aliens through statute or constitutional amendment were deemed unconstitutional. In 1940, a question arose about counting unlawfully present aliens in the census for apportionment. In the late 1970s and 1980s, Congress considered immigration legislation that led to the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, legalizing certain unauthorized aliens and strengthening immigration laws. There were debates on excluding aliens from the census, including unauthorized aliens, with proposals related to legalization. Some Members proposed excluding unauthorized aliens from the census to assess the impact of legalization. A legislative proposal in the late 1980s aimed to prohibit including illegal aliens in the census for House of Representatives apportionment, but it was not enacted. The House conferees objected to a Senate provision in the CJS appropriations bill, leading to its removal. The House floor debate on instructions to the conferees was reminiscent of debates in the 111th Congress."
