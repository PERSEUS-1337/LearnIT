    "content": "Seq2SQL is a deep neural network that translates natural language questions into SQL queries by leveraging rewards from query execution. It simplifies the generation problem by using the structure of SQL to prune the query space. The model outperforms existing methods on the WikiSQL dataset, which contains a large number of hand-annotated examples. Seq2SQL, a deep neural network, outperforms a state-of-the-art semantic parser in translating natural language questions to SQL queries. It improves execution accuracy from 35.9% to 59.4% and logical form accuracy from 23.4% to 48.3%. This technology is crucial for accessing relational databases, which store vast amounts of information for applications like medical records, financial markets, and customer relations management. Seq2SQL is a deep neural network that translates natural language questions to SQL queries. It uses policy-based reinforcement learning to generate query conditions and achieves state-of-the-art results. WikiSQL, a corpus of annotated instances, is released for training and testing. WikiSQL is a dataset containing 24241 HTML tables from Wikipedia, larger than previous semantic parsing datasets. It includes tables in raw JSON format and a SQL database. Seq2SQL outperforms other models on WikiSQL, generating SQL queries from natural language questions and table schema. The Seq2SQL model outperforms other models on WikiSQL by generating SQL queries from natural language questions and table schema. The augmented pointer network model limits the output space of the generated sequence to improve performance without using hand-engineered grammar. The augmented pointer network model improves Seq2SQL performance by limiting the output space for generating SQL queries from natural language questions and table schema. It uses a sequence of column names, question, and SQL vocabulary to produce the SQL query. The input sequence x is defined as the concatenation of column names, question, and SQL vocabulary. The network encodes x using a bidirectional LSTM network and applies a pointer network to the input encodings. The decoder network uses a unidirectional LSTM to generate query tokens during each decoding step. The decoder network, using a unidirectional LSTM, generates query tokens based on the input sequence. It produces a scalar attention score for each position of the input sequence, selecting the token with the highest score as the next token in the SQL query. The SQL query typically consists of three components: the aggregation operator (e.g., COUNT), the SELECT column(s) (e.g., Engine), and the WHERE clause. The augmented pointer network solves the SQL generation problem but does not fully utilize the SQL structure. Seq2SQL has three parts corresponding to the aggregation operator, SELECT column, and WHERE clause. The network classifies aggregation operations, selects a column from the input table, and generates query conditions using a pointer network. The first two components are supervised using cross entropy loss, while the third component is trained using policy gradient to handle the unordered nature of query conditions. This structure allows Seq2SQL to efficiently generate SQL queries. The aggregation operation in Seq2SQL depends on the question, with the correct operator determined by the question asked. The process involves computing scalar attention scores for each token in the input sequence, normalizing the scores to produce a distribution over input encodings, and then calculating the input representation. The aggregation operations include COUNT, MIN, MAX, and NULL, with scores computed accordingly. The aggregation operation in Seq2SQL involves computing \u03b1 agg using a multi-layer perceptron on input representation \u03ba agg, applying softmax to get \u03b2 agg, and using cross entropy loss L agg. Column selection depends on the question, with column prediction solved using a pointer. Column representations are produced by encoding each column name with LSTM. The representation for a particular column is computed using encoder states. A separate input representation is constructed for the question. A multi-layer perceptron is used to compute scores for each column, normalized with a softmax function. The SELECT network is trained using cross entropy loss. The WHERE clause can be trained using a pointer decoder. The WHERE clause in query generation can be trained using reinforcement learning to optimize the expected correctness of the execution result, addressing the limitation of using cross entropy loss due to query conditions being interchangeable. Sampling from the output distribution is used instead of teacher forcing to generate the next token. The model samples from the output distribution to generate SQL queries, which are then executed against the database to obtain a reward. The reward is based on the correctness of the query execution result. The policy gradient for optimizing the WHERE clause in query generation is derived, considering the probability of choosing each token during the generation process. The model uses a single Monte-Carlo sample to approximate the expected gradient for training. The total gradient is the sum of gradients from cross entropy loss in predicting the SELECT column, aggregation operation, and policy learning. WikiSQL is the largest hand-annotated semantic parsing dataset, containing tables, SQL queries, and natural language questions. The WikiSQL dataset presents a unique challenge due to the large number of tables and realistic data extracted from the web. Data is collected through crowd-sourcing on Amazon Mechanical Turk in two phases to ensure validity and complexity.

The dataset is divided into train, dev, and test splits, with each table present in exactly one split. The WikiSQL dataset includes tables, paraphrases, SQL queries, and natural utterances. Evaluation is done using execution accuracy and logical form accuracy metrics. Acc ex measures the number of correct query results, while Acc lf evaluates exact string matches with the ground truth query. Both metrics are used due to potential discrepancies in query construction. The dataset is tokenized using Stanford CoreNLP, with normalized tokens used for training. GloVe word embeddings and character n-gram embeddings are utilized. Networks are trained for a maximum of 300 epochs with early stopping. ADAM is used for training and dropout for regularization. Recurrent layers have a hidden size of 200 units. PyTorch 1 is used for implementation. The Seq2SQL model is trained using PyTorch 1, with the WHERE clause initially supervised via teacher forcing before reinforcement learning.

Training with reinforcement learning based on query executions on a database further improves performance, particularly in generating higher quality WHERE clauses compared to the baseline. The Seq2SQL model's performance on WikiSQL is improved by introducing a classifier for aggregation and training with policy-based RL. This results in higher quality WHERE clauses and correct query order, as shown in Table 3 of the Appendix. Seq2SQL, when trained with RL, generates more accurate WHERE clauses compared to Seq2SQL without RL. Semantic parsing in question answering involves parsing natural language questions into logical forms for execution on a knowledge graph. Other approaches in semantic parsing include learning parsers without annotated logical forms using conversational logs, demonstrations, distant supervision, and question-answer pairs. BID21 proposes the floating parser to generalize to unseen web tables on the WikiTableQuestions task, addressing the single-schema limitation in semantic parsing systems. Previous systems were designed for closed-domain datasets like GeoQuery and ATIS, while Overnight dataset uses crowdsourcing for natural language question, logical form pairs. WikiTableQuestions BID21 is a dataset of question and answers extracted from Wikipedia tables, focusing on QA over noisy web tables. Unlike WikiSQL, it does not provide logical forms.
