    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Medicare Adult Day Services Alternative Act of 2001\". Congress recognizes the importance of adult day care services for seniors and their caregivers, with over 22 million families in the US providing care for aging or ailing seniors. Nearly 75 percent of caregivers are women who juggle multiple responsibilities. The average loss of income for caregivers is $659,130 in wages, pension, and benefits. The loss in productivity for US businesses ranges from $11-29 billion annually. Adult day care centers offer continuity of care and community for seniors and caregivers, with services like transportation, meals, personal care, and counseling available nationwide. The need for quality senior care options is increasing with the aging baby boomer generation, emphasizing the urgency to address these issues now. SEC. 3. COVERAGE OF SUBSTITUTE ADULT DAY CARE SERVICES UNDER MEDICARE. This section amends the Social Security Act to include substitute adult day care services as a defined benefit under Medicare. \"Substitute Adult Day Care Services added as a defined benefit under Medicare.\" The term 'substitute adult day care services' refers to services provided by an adult day care facility as part of a plan that replaces some services provided by a home health agency. These services include supervised activities, meals, and other items specified in the plan. A medication management program in an adult day care facility aims to minimize unnecessary use of prescription drugs and adverse events from drug interactions. The facility provides skilled nursing and therapeutic services either directly or through a home health agency. A home health agency must meet quality standards and provide specified items and services. An adult day care facility can include a home health agency that offers services through a licensed adult day-care program. The Secretary may waive the surety bond requirement for agencies providing a comparable bond under State law. References to home health agencies for substitute adult day care services are deemed to be adult day care facilities. Payment rates for substitute adult day care services are determined by the Secretary. The Secretary estimates payments for home health services, with a limit on substitute adult day care services. Monitoring of Medicare expenditures for substitute adult day care services starts in 2003. The Secretary will compare expenditures for home health services, including substitute adult day care services, to estimated expenditures if certain provisions had not been enacted under the Social Security Act. If expenditures exceed the estimated amount, a reduction in payment rate may be required for home health services under the Medicare Program. The Secretary will adjust payment rates for adult day care facilities under the Medicare Program if total expenditures for home health services exceed the estimated amount without certain provisions. Effective January 1, 2002, these adjustments will apply to items and services provided."
