The definitions in this section include terms like CSA (community-supported agriculture), nonprofit organization, Program (referring to the Community-Supported Agriculture Promotion Program), and underserved community. The Secretary shall establish the 'Community-Supported Agriculture Promotion Program' to assist underserved communities with limited access to healthy foods, high rates of diet-related diseases, hunger, or poverty. The Program aims to improve existing CSAs, develop new ones, support agricultural producers economically, and enhance consumer relationships. The Community-Supported Agriculture Promotion Program aims to enhance consumer-producer relationships, encourage consumer interest in CSA participation, and support the development of innovative delivery programs and multifarm CSAs. Eligible entities can receive assistance for these purposes. The Community-Supported Agriculture Promotion Program provides grants to eligible entities such as nonprofit organizations, extension service programs, agricultural producers, government entities, public benefit corporations, and others designated by the Secretary. The Secretary establishes criteria to evaluate proposed projects, with a preference for public entities and nonprofit organizations. The Community-Supported Agriculture Promotion Program provides grants for financial and technical assistance to CSAs from family-operated farms, expanding into underserved communities, supporting CSAs operated by veterans, and developing innovative delivery programs to increase consumer interest. Funding comes from the Commodity Credit Corporation. The Secretary shall allocate funding for the Community-Supported Agriculture Promotion Program as follows: $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2012, $12,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2013 to 2015, and $15,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2016 to 2018.
