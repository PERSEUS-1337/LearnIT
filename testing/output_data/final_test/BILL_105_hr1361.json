The Congress finds systematic human rights abuses by the Government of Turkey in 1996, including torture and excessive use of force. Various human rights organizations have also documented these abuses. The Government of Turkey has been accused of extensive human rights abuses, including torture and extrajudicial killings. These actions violate international human rights agreements, and the government has also denied the civil and human rights of its Kurdish citizens. Turkey's actions include destroying Kurdish villages and uprooting millions of Kurds, illegally occupying Cyprus, blocking humanitarian aid to Armenia, restricting Christian communities, and facing reduced foreign assistance in 1997. Turkey's foreign assistance was reduced to $22,000,000 due to its human rights record and hostile policies towards neighbors. The Government of Turkey has rejected any US assistance tied to its human rights record. Restrictions on assistance for the Government of Turkey due to human rights record and hostile policies towards neighbors. Restrictions on assistance for the Government of Turkey in fiscal year 1998 unless significant progress is made in allowing human rights monitoring organizations and recognizing Kurdish rights. The Government of Turkey is required to respect the civil, cultural, and human rights of its Kurdish citizens, cease military operations against Kurdish civilians, and work towards a peaceful resolution of the Kurdish issue. Additionally, Turkey must demilitarize Cyprus, withdraw Turkish military forces from Cyprus, and support a settlement for the Republic of Cyprus based on democratic principles and the protection of minority and human rights. The Government of Turkey has lifted its blockade on US and international aid to Armenia, stopped restrictions on Christian churches and schools, and provided protection against violence and vandalism. The Secretary of State is required to submit a report to Congress documenting these actions."
