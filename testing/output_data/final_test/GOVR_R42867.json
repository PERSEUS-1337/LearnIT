    "content": "On January 20 of each year following a presidential election, the President-elect is sworn in at the U.S. Capitol. The inauguration ceremony is a National Security Special Event (NSSE) due to safety concerns, with the United States Secret Service (USSS) responsible for security. The USSS is the primary federal entity responsible for NSSE security during presidential inaugurations. Other agencies like USCP, MPD, and USPP also assist in security. Congress appropriates funds for inauguration security, usually from the USSS general NSSE account. In some cases, supplemental appropriations are provided to reimburse local jurisdictions for related activities. Congress also conducts oversight hearings on security operations. During presidential inaugurations, the USSS is responsible for security operations. Congressional oversight hearings are conducted to review and improve these operations. Criticism of past security practices has led to concerns, such as issues during President Obama's 2009 inauguration. Senator Feinstein called for a review, which was completed by the DHS Office of Inspector General. The report focused on security adequacy and Secret Service's after-action review. Recommendations were made for the USSS to address identified areas. The report recommended that the USSS address areas identified for improvement in its after-action review, including security planning, communications technology, and logistics for off-site staging. The DHS IG did not review the 2013 inauguration due to reported successful security operations. The report discusses potential policy issues related to inauguration security operations and appropriations. Options are provided for congressional consideration for future inauguration security planning, based on various factors including oversight of law enforcement entities and hosting the swearing-in ceremony. Congress may wish to consider past criticisms of inauguration security operations and appropriations. Presidential inauguration ceremonies in DC are designated as NSSE by DHS due to their unique nature as gatherings of the American government's leadership. The USSS is responsible for securing public inaugural events designated as NSSE by DHS. Inaugural events include the swearing-in ceremony, inaugural luncheon, parade, and balls held at the U.S. Capitol. Special security operations are required for all these events. Inaugurations are designated as National Special Security Events (NSSEs) due to their importance, the presence of national leadership, and the public nature of the ceremony. NSSE designation factors include anticipated attendance by U.S. officials and foreign dignitaries, event size, and significance. NSSEs were created in 1998 by President Clinton to address counter-terrorism programs and enhance security for events like the 2017 inauguration. PDD 62 addressed terrorist apprehension, transportation security, emergency response, and cybersecurity. USSS was designated as the lead agency for security at national events. Other lead agencies for counter terrorism included FEMA, DOD, FBI, and HHS. Congress enacted the Presidential Threat Protection Act of 2000, authorizing USSS to plan security for special events. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary designates events of national significance as National Special Security Events (NSSEs), with the Secret Service (USSS) leading security operations. The goal is to create a safe environment for the public, event participants, protectees, and dignitaries. The USSS's Major Events Division (MED) plans and coordinates NSSE security. USSS's Major Events Division (MED) is responsible for planning and coordinating NSSE security with other federal, state, and local agencies. This includes advance planning, venue and air space security, training, communications, and security credentialing. NSSE security is implemented through a unified command model involving various agencies, ensuring successful event conclusion without major incidents. The NSSE operational plans include security measures such as fencing, barricades, accreditation badges, K-9 teams, and other technologies. DHS prepositions various emergency response teams and stockpiles for consequence management. Specific teams are tailored for each event based on unique characteristics, coordination with other entities, and available resources. USSS also provides training seminars for law enforcement officials on managing security and reducing vulnerabilities related to terrorism. The seminars focus on security at major events, including inauguration planning with law enforcement entities such as USCP, MPD, USPP, FBI, and Virginia State. The security border for the inauguration is expanded to downtown Washington, DC, and the National Mall. Meetings are convened to discuss strategies and lessons learned from past NSSEs. Inauguration security planning involves multiple law enforcement agencies such as DC (MPD), US Park Police (USPP), FBI, Virginia State Police, Maryland State Police, and others. The Law Enforcement Executive Steering Committee (ESC) and operational subcommittees focus on securing the event. FBI leads intelligence and counterterrorism efforts, while FEMA coordinates emergency response. Security measures include physical screening of the audience and protection of officials. Additional federal law enforcement agencies provide personnel for past inaugurations. During past inaugurations, DHS and federal law enforcement agencies provided personnel and equipment, including screening magnetometers. USSS received security assistance from 30,000 law enforcement officers for inaugural events. USSS partnered with JCCIC and PIC for logistics and security planning. USSS uses seating plans and audience size projections for security planning. An NSSE Executive Steering Committee coordinated 2017 inauguration planning. The committee overseeing inauguration security includes various agencies such as the U.S. Secret Service, FBI, FEMA, DC Fire Department, National Guard, and others. These agencies do not receive specific account-level appropriations for security. Inauguration security costs are typically included in regular fiscal year planning and budget requests, with additional funds appropriated by Congress for reimbursement of expenses. Limited appropriations for security operations hinder substantive policy analysis on inauguration costs. Congress has allocated funds for inauguration security since 2001. Since 2001, Congress has allocated funds for inauguration security costs, ranging from $6 million in 2001 to $22 million in 2009. In 2013, $9.8 million was allocated, and in 2017, $19.995 million was allocated for security and emergency planning in the District of Columbia. Additionally, $4.2 million was directly appropriated to the National Park Service for security and visitor safety activities related to the Presidential Inauguration. The National Park Service receives funds for security and visitor safety activities during Presidential Inaugural Ceremonies. In addition to direct appropriations, funds from the Department of Homeland Security are used for inauguration security operations. Appropriations for National Special Security Events (NSSEs) remained consistent at $1 million per year for the 2001, 2005, and 2009 inaugurations. Additional appropriations were provided in FY2005 and FY2009. Reimbursements for inauguration security activities could also come from the Department of Defense and other appropriations acts. Funds could be allocated for NSSE security cost reimbursements to state and local governments based on FEMA Administrator's recommendation. Potential amounts for 2017 inauguration security costs are undetermined. Congressional interest in inauguration security may be influenced by various factors including appropriating funds, oversight of law enforcement entities, hosting the swearing-in ceremony, and post-9/11 security operations. Past criticisms of inauguration security operations and funding should be considered by Congress. No major issues were identified for the 2013 inauguration security. In the past, there have been criticisms of inauguration security operations, with the 2009 inauguration being generally positive but with some issues. The main criticism was the inability of some ticketed attendees to access viewing areas due to communication and crowd management problems. A joint investigation made 38 recommendations to improve security operations, including enhancing real-time communication. No major issues were identified for the 2013 inauguration security. The report recommended improving real-time communication between security officials and the public. Criticisms from campaign donors included lax security measures at the inauguration, such as VIPs not being asked for identification and mingling with non-screened attendees. Congress has options to address future security operations, including better coordination among law enforcement entities. Congress may need to address issues identified in past presidential inaugurations, such as weaknesses in crowd management and law enforcement communications. The USSS should provide detailed briefings to the JCCIC before the inauguration to ensure these issues are resolved. Regular updates on security planning would be provided to the JCCIC by the USSS to ensure the safety of protectees. To enhance inauguration security and protect designated individuals, Congress could amend the Presidential Threat Protection Act of 2000 to address security operations for presidential inaugurations. This could involve requiring specific USSS inauguration security operations to address past criticisms and future concerns. Increased coordination among federal, state, and local law enforcement could be achieved by outlining required USSS inauguration activities in statute. Alternatively, Congress could refine USSS NSSE authority instead of specifying actions for presidential inaugurations, potentially avoiding the need for additional legislation for other NSSEs. The DHS IG's review of the 2009 presidential inauguration found that security operations were adequate, coordinated with other law enforcement entities, and improved for future events. Congress may not need to make significant changes to USSS security practices based on this report. Congress may consider oversight hearings and investigations to ensure effective protection by the USSS at inaugurations and other NSSEs. Options for funding inauguration security include supplemental federal appropriations, targeted appropriations, or privately raised funds. Creating a disaster-relief type grant program could be one approach for covering security costs. One option proposed is to establish a disaster-relief grant program for local jurisdictions to apply for assistance during National Special Security Events (NSSEs) declared by the USSS. This program would help offset costs associated with providing event security. Reimbursements for security services could be standardized based on FEMA's protocols. Local governments often seek reimbursement for security expenses during presidential and vice-presidential visits, such as providing ambulance and paramedic services for motorcades. The Northern Lakes Fire Protection District provided ambulance and paramedic services for the Vice President's motorcade, seeking reimbursement for overtime costs and standby expenses. Establishing a standard reimbursement plan for presidential travel or NSSEs could incentivize state and local jurisdictions to provide services. However, opponents raise concerns about evaluating requests and allocating limited funds for reimbursement. The quadrennial inauguration poses unique challenges for the National Capital Region, as providing reimbursement to every local jurisdiction for security expenses could be expensive. NSSE appropriations have been consistent since 2001, limiting congressional oversight on inauguration security expenses. Congress could provide additional appropriations for inauguration activities during inaugural years to address this issue. Providing additional appropriations for inauguration security during inaugural years may require Congress to designate funds specifically for this purpose. Congress has not typically allocated specific funds for inauguration security in the past, but including legislative language in future appropriations bills could allow for closer monitoring of spending on inauguration security. Congress could designate funds specifically for inauguration security to allow for closer monitoring of spending. However, providing detailed instructions may limit choices for security agencies and raise concerns about disclosing security arrangements. The current system allows the USSS flexibility in spending, with private sources like the PIC covering costs for some events. Congress could require private entities to partially or fully cover security costs for certain events, such as ticketed inaugural balls. Requiring private funding for inauguration security could reduce government appropriations but may lead to security liabilities if funds are insufficient. The USSS is responsible for security at NSSE events, including presidential inaugurations. The USSS is the lead federal agency responsible for security operations at NSSE events, including presidential inaugurations. Security operations for the 2009 inauguration were criticized, leading to investigations and reviews by Congress, DHS IG, and USSS. Congressional oversight and funding appropriations play a role in ensuring safe and secure inaugurations. Coordination among federal, state, and local law enforcement entities is crucial for successful security measures."
