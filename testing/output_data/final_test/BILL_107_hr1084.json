Section 24 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act is amended to include a new subsection (d) regarding the registration of Canadian pesticides by states. A Canadian pesticide is defined as one registered for use in Canada, similar in composition to a domestic pesticide, and registered by the same entity or an affiliate in Canada. The term 'comparable domestic pesticide' refers to a pesticide registered under section 3 of the Act, not under suspension or subject to cancellation, used as a basis for comparison in determinations required under section 24(d)(4) of the Act. The authority to register Canadian pesticides is subject to specific criteria, including being registered for use on the site of application, not under interim administrative review, without sales limitations or production caps, and not classified as a restricted use pesticide. \"A State may register a Canadian pesticide for distribution and use within the State if it complies with specific criteria, is consistent with the Act's purposes, and has not been previously denied by the Administrator. The registration authorizes distribution and is considered a registration under section 3 of the Act.\" \"A person or State may seek registration of a Canadian pesticide under specific requirements, including demonstrating its similarity to a domestic pesticide and submitting approved labels.\" The registration of a Canadian pesticide in the US requires obtaining the confidential formula, proving similarity to a domestic pesticide, and ensuring compliance with federal regulations on residue tolerances for food and feed use. To register a Canadian pesticide in the US, the applicant must obtain a label approved by the Administrator that duplicates relevant statements from the approved labeling of a comparable domestic pesticide, identifies the state where the product may be used, and complies with federal regulations on residue tolerances for food and feed use. To register a Canadian pesticide in the US, the applicant must obtain a label approved by the Administrator that duplicates relevant statements from the approved labeling of a comparable domestic pesticide, identifies the state where the product may be used, prohibits sale and use outside the identified state, includes a statement indicating unlawful use in a manner inconsistent with approved labeling, and identifies the establishment number where the approved labeling will be affixed. The Administrator must be notified of a State's registration issuance, including details like the effective date, formula statement, and approved labeling. If the Administrator disapproves the registration within 90 days, it will not be effective. The Administrator can disapprove a State's registration of a Canadian pesticide if deemed necessary. The registration of Canadian pesticides by a State must comply with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Containers must bear the Administrator-approved label, securely attached and the only visible label. The original Canadian label must be preserved underneath. The registrant must prepare approved labels for Canadian pesticides and oversee labeling at registered establishments. Establishments solely for labeling are exempt from reporting requirements. The Administrator can revoke registration if necessary. If a Canadian pesticide is found to be different from a domestic pesticide, the Administrator can issue an emergency order to revoke its registration. This order can immediately stop the sale, distribution, and use of the Canadian pesticide. The registrant may be required to purchase and dispose of any remaining product. A hearing can be requested within 10 days, but if not, the order becomes final without judicial review. If a State is unable to control Canadian pesticides properly, the Administrator can suspend its authority to register them. Judicial review can only be sought after a final revocation order is issued following a hearing. If a State fails to control Canadian pesticides, the Administrator can suspend its authority to register them. The Administrator must notify the State before the suspension and provide reasons for it. The Administrator can suspend a State's authority to register Canadian pesticides if they fail to control them. The State must be notified and given an opportunity to respond within 30 days before the suspension. No monetary damages can be claimed against a State acting as a registering agency for injuries resulting from the use of a product registered by the State. The Administrator may disclose necessary information to a State seeking to register a Canadian pesticide, if the State certifies it can make required determinations. No tort actions can be maintained in Federal court against a registrant for damages from product adulteration if they had no knowledge of it. The State must maintain confidentiality of trade secrets provided by the Administrator under this subsection. Registrants of comparable domestic pesticides must provide necessary information to a State seeking to register a Canadian pesticide if the State can keep the information confidential. The registrant of a comparable domestic pesticide must provide necessary information to the State within 15 days of a written request. Failure to do so may result in a penalty assessed by the Administrator based on the difference in cost between the domestic and Canadian pesticide application. The registrant of a comparable domestic pesticide must provide necessary information to the State within 15 days of a written request. Failure to do so may result in a penalty assessed by the Administrator. The penalty hearing will determine if the registrant failed to provide timely information and the amount of the penalty. State employees disclosing privileged information will face penalties as per section 10(f) of the Act. The registration of a Canadian pesticide under this subsection exempts the State or registrant from data compensation. The registrant of a comparable domestic pesticide must notify the Administrator of any formulation changes at least 30 days before sale or distribution. The registrant of a comparable domestic pesticide must submit a confidential statement of formula for the new formulation to the Administrator. Failure to do so may result in a suspension of the registration for at least one year. If a hearing is requested, it will be conducted to resolve the matter. The registrant must provide a confidential statement of formula for a new pesticide formulation. Failure to do so may lead to registration suspension. A hearing will determine if notice and statement submission requirements were met. Amendments specify conditions for Administrator action."
