    "content": "The introduction of invasive animal and plant species can lead to economic, ecologic, and cultural losses, including reduced agricultural output, degradation of waterways and landscapes. The estimated aggregate economic costs from selected invasive species in the United States is $127 billion annually, excluding costs for human diseases. Based on estimated economic costs, the largest cost of invasive species in the United States is damage to agricultural crop and livestock production, totaling nearly $65 billion annually. This includes costs associated with agricultural crop weeds, crop plant pathogens, livestock diseases, weeds in pastures, and plant pathogens and pests in forests. Individual estimates of the costs of selected invasive species are highlighted, but these estimates do not consider potential offsetting benefits. The estimates for overstating the cost of damages from invasive species do not consider offsetting benefits, indirect losses, or nonmarket welfare losses. There is a lack of comprehensive legislation for invasive species treatment, with current laws being fragmented and not addressing broad problems across industries and habitats. Coordination among federal agencies is lacking, and laws are often tailored to individual species or specific ecosystems. Existing laws that affect non-native species introduction, prevention, and control vary in their intended purpose and effectiveness. While some laws specifically address invasive species, others only peripherally touch on the issue. Agencies often lack the authority to eradicate invasive species, except on federally managed lands, which undermines the effectiveness of control programs. Laws related to agriculture, a well-established industry in North America, tend to be more developed in addressing the risks posed by non-native species. The patchwork of laws protecting against invasive species is more developed for agriculture compared to other industries. There are two regulatory approaches: one based on specific species and another based on pathways of introduction. Additional information on these approaches can be found in related reports. The laws are listed by year of enactment, with a summary provided in Appendix A. This report focuses on U.S. laws addressing invasive or non-native species, including federal laws like NEPA and state laws restricting transport or possession of invasive species. It does not cover all laws but highlights key provisions related to invasive species management. The Organic Administration Act of 1897 and the Lacey Act of 1900 provide authority to the U.S. Forest Service and address illegal wildlife trade to protect species at risk and prevent importing injurious species. The injurious species provision (18 U.S.C. \u00a742) prohibits the import and shipment of certain listed living creatures and their eggs, excluding non-native animals like vertebrates, crustaceans, and mollusks. The act's broad definition of harm extends to wildlife resources, potentially allowing for the exclusion of any non-native vertebrate, crustacean, or mollusk. The Lacey Act prohibits the import and shipment of certain non-native species, with the list of banned species subject to amendment. Permits may be issued for specific purposes. Violation of the act is a Class B misdemeanor with penalties of jail time and fines. The list of injurious wildlife can be found on the FWS website. Laws that list banned species are known as \"black list\" laws. The Lacey Act was primarily a white list law, banning all species except those on an approved list. In 1949, it became a black list law, only banning listed species. This approach limits the usefulness of the statute when new potential invaders are discovered. The Lacey Act prohibits the import, export, transport, sale, or purchase of invasive species. The Virus-Serum-Toxin Act authorizes USDA to regulate veterinary biological products. The Virus-Serum-Toxin Act, enacted in 1913, allows USDA to regulate veterinary biological products for animal disease treatment. This includes vaccines, bacterins, sera, and diagnostic antigens. The law prohibits the shipment of harmful or non-compliant products in interstate and intrastate commerce. USDA's Animal Plant Health Inspection Service administers activities under this law. The Animal Damage Control Act of 1931 is the primary statute under which USDA operates its Wildlife Services program, giving APHIS wide authority to control damage caused by invasive species to agriculture. This includes addressing problems caused by species such as the brown tree snake, nutria, European starlings, and monk parakeets. The Animal Damage Control Act of 1931 gives APHIS authority to control damage caused by wildlife to agricultural interests. The program aims to protect various crops, livestock, buildings, aircraft, and public health from wildlife-related issues. Control methods include providing advice on preventive measures and using lethal means to control predatory animals. The Animal Damage Control Act of 1931 authorizes APHIS to manage damage caused by wildlife to agricultural interests through lethal means. APHIS collaborates with various agencies to protect natural resources from invasive species. USDA's NRCS operates Plant Materials Centers for plant development and distribution. The NRCS provides plants and vegetation management technologies for erosion control, water conservation, and wildlife habitat on nonfederal lands. They offer technical assistance for installing structures and land management practices. USDA programs also assist livestock and crop producers in protecting soil, water, and natural resources, including addressing invasive species concerns. The efforts focus on prevention, control, and restoration of invasive species. The Federal Seed Act of 1939 requires accurate labeling and purity standards for seeds in commerce, prohibits importation of adulterated seeds, and regulates interstate and foreign commerce in seeds. It works in conjunction with the Plant Protection Act to regulate imports of agricultural seed containing noxious weed seeds. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1970 established a national policy to protect the environment. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1970 (NEPA) established a policy to protect the environment. Federal agencies must comply with NEPA, consider environmental impacts, and involve the public in decision-making. NEPA requires agencies to prepare an environmental impact statement for actions significantly affecting the environment. It applies to federal actions financed, assisted, conducted, regulated, or approved by federal agencies, including projects to control invasive species. Invasive species actions subject to NEPA include BLM's Weed Management Program. NEPA does not prohibit introducing non-native species but requires identifying environmental requirements. The NEPA process involves identifying environmental requirements for proposed actions and documenting outside agency reviews. The Endangered Species Act focuses on protecting endangered species and their habitats, potentially limiting actions involving invasive species that may harm listed species. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is a major argument against the introduction or expansion of aquaculture that may harm protected Pacific salmon. Similarly, the ESA could provide protection against the introduction of non-native mountain goats that could threaten listed plants. ESA is jointly administered by the Departments of the Interior and Commerce, and requires consultation with FWS or NMFS for actions that may jeopardize listed species. The Federal Noxious Weed Act of 1974 was largely replaced by the Plant Protection Act, but a key section still requires federal agencies to manage noxious weeds on their lands. This provision, introduced in the 1990 farm bill, amended the Act to mandate noxious weed management. The 1990 farm bill amended the Federal Noxious Weed Act to require federal agencies to establish and fund noxious weed management programs. It also allows cooperative agreements with state agencies for managing undesirable plant species near federal lands, with joint leadership from the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior. The Federal Interagency Committee for Management of Noxious and Exotic Weeds (FICMNEW) was created in 1994 to coordinate noxious weed priorities among federal agencies. The U.S. Forest Service conducts research activities under the Act (16 U.S.C. \u00a71604) related to invasive species, natural resource protection, and conservation. Funding for range betterment and weed control on National Forest System rangelands is provided under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 and the Public Rangelands Improvement Act of 1978. Grants and cooperative agreements are authorized for research partnerships with universities, industry, and other entities. The Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978 allows USDA's Forest Service to enter into cooperative agreements to control and manage invasive species on federal and nonfederal lands. This includes activities related to insect infestations, disease conditions affecting trees, and support for good forest management practices. Financial assistance is provided for maintaining healthy timber ecosystems and preventing the incursion of invasive species on privately owned nonindustrial forestlands. The USDA's Forest Service supports international forestry activities to prevent and control invasive species on privately owned nonindustrial forestlands. The Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 established a federal program to prevent the introduction and spread of aquatic nuisance species. The Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 mandated a Great Lakes ballast water management program to prevent the introduction and spread of aquatic nuisance species. It established civil and criminal penalties for violations and directed ships to undertake high seas ballast exchange or alternative measures approved by the Coast Guard. The Act also created the Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force, co-chaired by FWS and NOAA, to implement its provisions. The Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990, also known as NANPCA, authorizes state governors to submit management plans for technical and financial assistance. It encourages negotiations with foreign countries to prevent aquatic nuisance species and directs research on environmentally sound control of zebra mussels. NANPCA also reauthorizes the National Sea Grant College Program Act, focusing on marine and coastal systems, including aquatic invasive species in the Great Lakes. The National Invasive Species Act of 1996 (NISA) amended NANPCA to create a national ballast management program to prevent the introduction and spread of nonindigenous species into U.S. waters, focusing on aquatic invasive species in the Great Lakes. NISA cites concerns about invasive aquatic species like the zebra mussel and the Eurasian ruffe. The National Invasive Species Act of 1996 (NISA) addressed the introduction and spread of invasive species in U.S. waters, focusing on aquatic species like the zebra mussel, Eurasian ruffe, mitten crab, green crab, brown mussel, shellfish pathogens, and various vegetation species. NISA also promoted negotiations with foreign governments for an international program to prevent invasive species in ballast water. The Coast Guard was required to assess the effectiveness of shoreside ballast water facilities and conduct studies in various water bodies of national significance. The National Invasive Species Act of 1996 (NISA) established penalties for violations related to aquatic nuisance species and funded research on prevention and control in significant water bodies. The Alien Species Prevention and Enforcement Act of 1992 (ASPEA) defines nonmailable plant pests and injurious animals, prohibiting their shipment through the U.S. mail. The Alien Species Prevention and Enforcement Act of 1992 (ASPEA) prohibits the shipment of nonmailable plant pests and injurious animals through the U.S. mail. ASPEA is administered by the U.S. Postal Service and may lead to prosecutions for shipping prohibited species. The Wild Bird Conservation Act of 1992 focuses on conserving wild birds imported into the country, which may indirectly reduce imports of non-native parasites and diseases that could harm native bird populations. The Hawaii Tropical Forest Recovery Act of 1992 amended the International Forestry Cooperation Act to address issues in native Hawaiian forests caused by non-native invasive species. The law allows the USDA's Forest Service to develop programs to protect native species and establish biological control agents. The Plant Protection Act of 2000 (PPA) is the primary federal law governing plant pests in foreign and interstate commerce, covering agricultural commodities, plants, biological control organisms, and other pathways for moving pests. It consolidated several plant quarantine authorities and established a task force to develop an action plan for managing non-native invasive species. The Plant Protection Act of 2000 (PPA) authorizes APHIS to cooperate with states and others to prevent the spread of invasive pests and diseases. It allows APHIS to restrict the movement of plants, plant products, and pests, inspect foreign plant imports, and quarantine infested areas. These authorities are administered by APHIS in collaboration with state departments of agriculture. The Plant Protection Act of 2000 (PPA) grants USDA the authority to implement measures to exclude alien pests and prevent the spread of new pests. This includes inspections, quarantines, treatments, and destruction. USDA can develop lists of allowed and prohibited organisms and goods, certify U.S. agricultural exports, and regulate biological control agents. The law encourages biological control of pests and invasive species and imposes civil and criminal penalties. USDA can transfer funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation to implement these measures. The Plant Protection Act of 2000 grants USDA the authority to control plant pests, transfer funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation, and regulate biological control agents. USDA can also declare emergencies to control pests and compensate growers for losses. States can petition for exceptions to federal rules and request restrictions beyond APHIS requirements. The Animal Health Protection Act of 2002 governs federal laws on plant pests. The Animal Health Protection Act of 2002 (AHPA) is the primary federal law that gives USDA's APHIS broad authority to detect, control, or eradicate pests or diseases of livestock or poultry. It consolidates various animal quarantine laws and authorizes USDA to prohibit or restrict the import or export of animals to prevent the spread of diseases. USDA can hold, seize, treat, or destroy animals and limit the movement of invasive species. The Animal Health Protection Act of 2002 (AHPA) authorizes USDA to control invasive animal species, provide emergency fund transfers, and enter agreements with foreign governments. It also requires compensation for destroyed animals based on fair market value and allows USDA to transfer funds for emergency control programs. The Noxious Weed Control and Eradication Act of 2004 amended the Plant Protection Act to establish a grant program for weed management entities to control harmful weeds on public and private lands. The Noxious Weed Control and Eradication Act of 2004 amended the Plant Protection Act to establish a grant program for weed management entities to control harmful, invasive weeds on public and private lands. The law also authorizes USDA to enter into cooperative agreements with weed management entities to fund weed eradication activities and enable rapid response to outbreaks of noxious weeds. Additionally, then-President Clinton signed Executive Order 13112 on Invasive Species in 1999 to prevent the introduction of invasive species and minimize their impacts through better coordination of federal agency efforts. The Executive Order 13112 on Invasive Species directs federal agencies to address invasive species concerns and refrain from actions likely to increase invasive species problems. The National Invasive Species Council (NISC) provides leadership, coordination, and oversight of federal agency activities to minimize the risk of harm caused by invasive species. NISC also promotes international cooperation, monitors invasive species impacts, and encourages information-sharing on invasive species. The National Invasive Species Council oversees federal efforts to prevent, eradicate, and control invasive species. Federal agencies and interagency efforts address invasive species concerns, with some agencies dedicating a substantial portion of their workload to this issue. However, there is a lack of focused efforts to control the exports of U.S. species that could become harmful in other countries. Appendix A provides a summary of federal agencies and laws governing invasive species. In FY2016, the U.S. government spent an estimated $2.3 billion across federal agencies to prevent, control, and eradicate invasive species domestically, with the Department of Agriculture receiving the bulk of funding at nearly $1.2 billion. The data on federal funding for invasive species activities in FY2012, as reported by NISC, may be inconsistent due to unclear criteria used by agencies. The Department of Agriculture received the majority of federal funding for invasive species activities in FY2016, totaling nearly $1.2 billion (53% of total funds). The Department of Homeland Security received about $0.8 billion (33% of total funding) for border protection and security activities. The remaining funds, approximately $0.3 billion (14% of total funding), were allocated to various agencies at the Departments of Interior, Commerce, and Defense, as well as other independent agencies. The budget data is compiled by NISC as part of the Invasive Species Interagency Performance-Based Budget (Crosscut) to improve coordination and cooperation among federal agencies on invasive species activities. Various interagency committees have been established to address invasive species concerns and promote cooperation among federal agencies. These committees focus on specific ecosystems or species groups, but there may be duplicative efforts and redundancies in their jurisdictions. Unlike federal agencies with legal authority and funding for invasive species activities, interagency committees lack the authority and funding to implement programs effectively. The National Invasive Species Council (NISC) was established in 1999 by Executive Order 13112 to coordinate federal invasive species actions. NISC is co-chaired by the Secretaries of the Interior, Agriculture, and Commerce, with membership from other federal agencies. NISC works with federal and nonfederal groups to address invasive species issues at the national level. The National Invasive Species Council (NISC) was established in 1999 to coordinate federal actions on invasive species. NISC's duties include preparing a national invasive species management plan, overseeing implementation of Executive Order 13112, and promoting cooperation among federal agencies to monitor invasive species impacts. The National Invasive Species Council (NISC) was established in 1999 to coordinate federal actions on invasive species. In 2001, NISC released its first national invasive species management plan, recommending goals for management and research needs. The plan focused on prevention, early detection, rapid response, and control. NISC completed a review of Executive Order 13112 in 2005 and established the National Invasive Species Information Center (NISIC) website. The National Invasive Species Information Center (NISIC) was established by USDA's National Agricultural Library as a reference gateway for information on invasive species. NISC released management plans in 2008 and 2016, focusing on goals such as prevention, early detection, control, restoration, and collaboration. The 2016 plan includes priority action items for federal efforts. The Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force (ANSTF) was established in 1991 to implement the National Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act (NANPCA). ANSTF consists of 25 members, including federal agency representatives like EPA, Coast Guard, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The task force aims to coordinate government efforts related to nonindigenous aquatic species in the United States. The Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force (ANSTF) includes federal agency representatives like EPA, Coast Guard, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, along with other members. ANSTF manages state and interstate plans for nonindigenous aquatic species, conducts a public awareness campaign called \"Stop Aquatic Hitchhikers,\" and coordinates regional efforts through six panels. The Federal Interagency Committee for Management of Noxious and Exotic Weeds (FICMNEW) was established in 1994 to address invasive plant management on federal lands and provide technical assistance on private lands. Composed of representatives from 16 federal agencies, FICMNEW collaborates with the National Invasive Species Council (NISC) to implement Executive Order 13122 and coordinate efforts to prevent and control invasive plants. The Invasive Terrestrial Animals and Pathogens (ITAP) is a federal group housed at USDA to coordinate sharing of technical information for managing invasive species. Established in 2004, ITAP's mission is to support networking and information sharing among federal agencies involved in invasive species research and management. Other partners include various federal departments and agencies. The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is the primary agency responsible for preventing the entry of invasive plant and animal pests into the United States. They have the authority to prohibit, inspect, treat, quarantine, and require mitigation measures for plant and animal species, as well as regulate the importation/exportation of veterinary biological products. APHIS plays a crucial role in protecting U.S. agriculture from domestic and foreign pests and diseases. APHIS regulates animals and animal products to prevent diseases in the U.S. They also regulate plants and plant products to restrict imports. The agency addresses concerns related to invasive plant and animal species through various programs and efforts. APHIS conducts various activities through its regional and state offices, the National Wildlife Research Center, and national programs targeting plant pest concerns and invasive species harmful to agriculture. The agency administers the Plant Epidemiology and Risk Analysis Laboratory (PERAL) for pest risk analysis and provides scientific support for policy-making on phytosanitary issues. Wildlife Services target introduced and invasive animal species like brown tree snakes, Gambian rats, and feral pigs. Veterinary Services include the National Animal Health Laboratory Network for disease prevention. The National Animal Health Laboratory Network, part of APHIS, offers diagnostic services for animal diseases like foot and mouth disease and avian influenza. Control methods for predatory animals involve lethal means like hunting and trapping. The agency also provides advice on preventative measures and publishes annual Program Data Reports on wildlife damage management activities. APHIS collaborates with various agencies to protect natural resources from wildlife damage, including non-native species like nutria, European starlings, and monk parakeets. They also monitor and control the brown tree snake. The agency administers the Plant Health Protection Act and the Animal Health Protection Act, along with other laws related to invasive species. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) administers USDA's Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) for conservation benefits, including weed control and invasive species. The primary statute governing FSA relating to invasive species are provisions regarding CRP. The Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) provides invasive species technical assistance to foreign countries. The Forest Service manages invasive activities on 193 million acres of National Forests and grasslands, with programs to prevent, control, and eradicate invasive species. This includes monitoring for newly introduced species and restoring ecosystems damaged by invasive plants, insects, or pathogens in the National Forest System. The Forest Service manages invasive species on 193 million acres of National Forests and grasslands, including monitoring, prevention, control, and eradication efforts. Activities include responding to threats from non-native invasive species, establishing management areas, developing manuals and handbooks, implementing Early Detection and Rapid Response initiatives, providing training and funding, and managing data and records. The Forest Service conducts research on invasive plant species and harmful non-native invasive insects to support restoration efforts and control various non-native species across different regions. This includes managing invasive species such as kudzu, yellow starthistle, spotted knapweed, and Asian longhorned beetle, among others. The Forest Service conducts research on tree diseases and works to develop genetically resistant trees. They collaborate with state agencies, private landowners, and tribal governments on prevention and control activities. Laws governing Forest Service programs related to invasive species include the Organic Administration Act, Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act, and others. The USDA's Research, Education, and Economics agencies, including ARS, ERS, and NIFA, support research on invasive species. ARS plays a key role in pest management and invasive species research through its domestic and foreign laboratories, providing support to other agencies and state governments. Foreign laboratories support other agencies, organizations, and state governments in activities related to invasive species, including maintaining overseas biological control laboratories and quarantine facilities, conducting host-specificity testing for biological control agents, and implementing area-wide pest management programs using biologically-based methods to reduce chemical pesticide use. Public outreach and educational initiatives are also managed through the National Invasive Species Information Center website. The USDA's research agencies, such as ARS and ERS, focus on developing biologically-based methods to reduce chemical pesticide use and managing invasive species. ERS conducts economic research on invasive species management, while ARS works on detecting, identifying, and controlling plant and animal diseases. The ERS focuses on national decision-making regarding invasive species affecting USDA programs, while NIFA distributes federal funds to support research and extension programs at land grant colleges. NIFA does not conduct research but funds programs at the state and local level through competitive grant programs. NIFA supports two national plant and animal diagnostic laboratory networks to detect and report pathogens of national interest. They also provide training to state university diagnostic laboratories and support activities in IPM, pesticide use, pest management, and biological control of weeds. Additionally, NIFA funds state-level research on invasive species and extension programs for farmers and landowners to adopt environmentally safe controls. The NRCS provides technical assistance on conservation practices for agricultural land. The NRCS promotes conservation planning and provides assistance to farmers for adopting conservation practices on agricultural land, including controlling invasive species through farmland conservation programs. They develop Conservation Practice Standards and operate Plant Materials Centers nationwide. The NRCS operates Plant Materials Centers nationwide to provide seed stock of plants for conservation practices, including using native plants for restoration and controlling weeds. They support the PLANTS Database to identify beneficial plants for specific locations and list invasive species to avoid planting. Laws governing NRCS activities related to invasive species include the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) plays a key role in coordinating prevention, detection, response, control, and monitoring programs for invasive species. They support research on the effects of aquatic invasive species and provide technical assistance to regions and states. NOAA sub-agencies are involved in prevention and control activities, including monitoring coastal areas. NOAA's Sea Grant programs focus on marine systems and the Great Lakes to address threats from invasive species through research, education, and outreach. GLERL targets prevention and control of aquatic organisms, particularly in ship ballast, to minimize ecological and economic impacts of species invasions. GLERL leads investigations on invasive species impacts in the Great Lakes ecosystem, focusing on zebra mussels and other invaders. The program supports research on non-native invasive species biology, ecosystem impacts, control options, prevention efforts, and cost-benefit analysis. Additionally, GLERL funded a Nationwide Zebra Mussel Training Initiative to provide technical services and knowledge base to inland states. NOAA's primary law for addressing invasive species is the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act. The Department of Defense manages invasive species on military installations in accordance with individual plans. The goals include prevention, control, and restoration using native plants. The Armed Forces Pest Management Board coordinates activities to prevent the spread of invasive species, including the brown tree snake and noxious weeds. DOD is also working on joint regulations with EPA to set national standards for marine pollution control devices on armed forces vessels. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers supports invasive species efforts by preventing or reducing their establishment at projects through funding and project planning. They also have specific programs like the Aquatic Plant Control Program and the Aquatic Nuisance Species Research Program. Regulatory activities and other programs within USACE also consider invasive species. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers administers programs to control invasive species, including the Aquatic Nuisance Species Research Program and the Removal of Aquatic Growth Program. Congress has authorized specific projects, such as the construction of electric barriers to prevent Asian river carp encroachment in the Great Lakes. Congress authorized USACE to study and control Asian river carp in the Great Lakes area. They also conducted a larger study on preventing the transfer of aquatic nuisance species between the Great Lakes and Mississippi River basin. Invasive species can harm ecosystems and human health, with some pathogens infecting humans exclusively. Various agencies like CDC, NIH, and NISC work on zoonotic diseases and bioterrorism preparedness. NISC agencies, including NPS, NOAA, USDA, EPA, and DoD, conduct zoonotic disease surveillance. The Coast Guard, under a national ballast water management program mandated by NISA, works to prevent the introduction of nonindigenous aquatic species into US waters. Performance standards for treatment, testing protocols, and experimental technologies are part of the program implemented in 1999. The final rule was promulgated in March 2012 to ensure aquatic nuisance species are controlled. The Coast Guard implements a national ballast water management program to prevent the introduction of nonindigenous aquatic species into US waters. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is responsible for securing the border and enforcing U.S. laws and regulations. CBP guards land and coastal borders, as well as maritime borders in partnership with the Coast Guard. CBP works with various agencies to enforce laws on invasive species, wildlife trafficking, and plant and animal regulations at U.S. ports of entry. They detain imported or exported products for inspection and support the removal of invasive plants that hinder border surveillance. CBP's agriculture specialists prevent the entry of harmful pests and diseases, addressing emerging threats in agro- and bioterrorism. ICE, under DHS, focuses on promoting homeland security and public safety through enforcing federal laws related to border control, customs, trade, and immigration. They work to control and eradicate outbreaks of animal/zoonotic diseases and invasive plant pests as part of FEMA's Emergency Support Function. ICE works with federal agencies to enforce U.S. trade laws, including those against illegal wildlife trafficking. DOI manages land and water, addressing invasive species. BIA protects Indian trust assets and manages non-native invasive species on Indian lands. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) manages invasive species on Indian lands and supports resource protection through the Noxious Weed Control program. BIA cooperates in DOI's Invasive Species Crosscut Initiative and participates in various Area Invasive Plant Initiatives. The BIA funds tribal projects in these initiatives, while the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) focuses on controlling non-native plants on the 250 million acres it manages. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) primarily focuses on controlling non-native plants on the 250 million acres it manages in western states and Alaska. BLM works with partners to reduce the spread of invasive species, detect new invasions early, and prevent the need for expensive treatments. BLM's action plan outlines its strategy to prevent and control the spread of noxious weeds on public lands, with goals similar to the National Invasive Species Council (NISC). Additionally, BLM collaborates with states for education and cooperative efforts to manage exotic weeds and maintains a research relationship with USDA agencies. BLM is also responsible for managing populations of wild horses and burros with legally protected status. APHIS, Wildlife Services program, regulates animal pests on BLM land, including native (coyotes) and non-native species (Eurasian collared doves). BLM requires non-native plant species on grazing lands only when native species are insufficient. Bureau of Reclamation focuses on pests in aquatic systems like reservoirs and rivers, including tamarisk, hydrilla, Eurasian watermilfoil, giant salvinia, quagga and zebra mussels, and Asian river clams causing water loss and navigation issues. The agency uses biological control agents and pesticides to control pests causing loss of irrigation water, blocked waterways, and navigation issues. Ongoing projects focus on eradicating or controlling invasive species like mussels and weeds, using grass carp and herbicide meters. They also map the movement of invasive species and work with partners to identify and control weeds in western states. Research and development efforts prioritize mitigating the effects of zebra and quagga mussels. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) prioritizes research on mitigating the effects of zebra and quagga mussels. They collaborate with various agencies and Mexican officials to address cross-border weed infestations. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is authorized to prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species, enforce laws on injurious wildlife species, and work with other federal agencies and state governments to prevent the entry of invasive species. Several grant programs support states, territories, and tribes in managing invasive species. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) allocates funds for wildlife and habitat management in the National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS). Many refuges spend budgets on controlling invasive species like feral pigs, Burmese pythons, melaleuca, tamarisk, and purple loosestrife. FWS minimizes pesticide and herbicide use and has Invasive Species Strike Teams to respond to new infestations quickly. The agency also has authority under wildlife protection statutes to protect domestic ecosystems. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) has broad authority under wildlife protection statutes like the ESA to protect domestic ecosystems. This authority allows the agency to act if a proposed introduction or activity may harm a protected species. FWS spends on harmful non-native species in various programs, including fisheries, endangered species, habitat conservation, refuge operations, and international affairs. The primary laws governing FWS's role in addressing invasive species are the Lacey Act. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) plays a key role in addressing invasive species through research and support for resource managers. Their program focuses on early detection, monitoring, understanding ecology, and developing prevention methods. USGS has focused on highly invasive species in the Great Lakes, eastern waterways, wetlands, riparian ecosystems, and Hawaii. The USGS manages databases for invasive species in various ecosystems, including lakes, waterways, wetlands, and rangelands. They also initiated the National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII) to gather information on biological resources and invasive species, but the program was terminated in 2012 due to budgetary concerns. The program for controlling non-native invasive species on National Park Service lands was terminated in January 2012. NPS uses an IPM approach and has specific programs for managing exotic species, such as the Lionfish Response Plan and targeting quagga and zebra mussels in 54 park units. Some National Park Service units have regulations to prevent the spread of invasive species like zebra mussels. NPS prohibits the use of certain bait fish in designated waters to control the introduction of invasive species. The National Park Service uses Exotic Plant Management Teams (EPMTs) to respond to invasive plants in parks where scientific data supports non-native species introduction and park management plans do not require their elimination. EPMTs inventory and treat acres for exotic plant infestations, with reported success in eliminating invasive species at Haleakala National Park. The Exotic Plant Management Teams (EPMTs) have successfully eliminated two invasive plant species at Haleakala National Park and all exotic plants at Loggerhead Key in Dry Tortugas National Park. They also focus on controlling salt cedar at Lake Mead National Recreation Area and train personnel from other federal agencies. The EPMTs have partnered with various entities such as National Wildlife Refuges, the Navajo Nation, and the Nature Conservancy. The primary laws governing NPS's role in addressing invasive species include the National Park System Organic Act, Endangered Species Act, Noxious Weed Control and Eradication Act, Plant Protection Act, and National Invasive Species Act. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) regulates coal mining in the United States under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA), addressing invasive species in mine reclamation areas. OSM regulations permit the use of introduced species in revegetation, subject to approval. OSM regulations require permittees to establish permanent vegetative cover using native or introduced species for coal mining reclamation. Introduced species can be used for quick stabilization but must be compatible with the area's plant and animal species. OSM promotes the use of native species over introduced species for reforestation of disturbed lands. The State Department plays a role in developing U.S. foreign policy on invasive species, participating in international agreements and projects to address invasive species prevention and management. They collaborate with federal agencies, states, tribes, NGOs, and the private sector. The Department of Transportation also has a policy on invasive species, focusing on coordination with other federal agencies and international organizations. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) collaborates with international organizations like the International Maritime Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization to prevent the spread of invasive species. They work with USDA to control wildlife hazards at airports, conduct research on screening baggage and passengers, and protect native species at FAA facilities nationwide. FAA also played a key role in involving ICAO in addressing invasive species in civil aviation. Civil aviation is a significant pathway for introducing invasive species, and ICAO urges member states to use national civil aviation authorities to reduce this risk. The Federal Highway Administration oversees federally funded highway projects to prevent the spread of invasive species, providing guidance on vegetation management to state departments of transportation. FHWA encourages states to assess invasive species during the NEPA process and offers technical support for vegetation management. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) collaborates with other federal agencies to control invasive species on rail corridors, reducing the risk of spreading diseases like karnal bunt. The Department of the Treasury advises on international economic policies, trade, investment, and development programs. The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) leads efforts on Executive Order 13112 and chairs the Asian Carp Regional Coordinating Committee to protect the Great Lakes from Asian carp. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) developed a white paper on the Executive Order, and the Committee on Environment, Natural Resources, and Sustainability (CENRS) coordinates interagency policy and research on environmental issues. The Committee on Environment, Natural Resources, and Sustainability (CENRS) focuses on coordination of environment, natural resources, and sustainability policy, research, and development both domestically and internationally. Invasive species are a key research priority for CENRS, with representatives from various federal agencies serving on the committee. Executive Order 13112 directs the National Invasive Species Council (NISC) to collaborate with CENRS. The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) is responsible for developing and coordinating U.S. international trade policies, leading trade negotiations, and reviewing potential environmental impacts of trade agreements. The USTR leads U.S. negotiations with other countries on trade agreements and multilateral agreements addressing health concerns. USAID provides assistance to developing countries, ensuring programs do not introduce invasive species. EPA is a member of NISC and implements invasive species management plans. EPA conducts research and implements invasive species management plans, focusing on prevention, early detection, control, and international cooperation. Efforts are coordinated from regional offices surrounding the Great Lakes and in the Northeast, collaborating with Canadian environmental managers. Public awareness programs on invasive species risks are being developed, sponsored by estuarine management groups and administered by EPA. EPA also administers environmental laws related to invasive species. The EPA oversees federal registration of pesticides under the FIFRA and implements the CWA to protect U.S. waters from invasive species. They are also working with DoD to set national discharge standards for armed forces vessels. EPA conducts research for early detection of invasive species. The EPA conducts research on early detection of non-native invasive species and develops methodologies for environmental monitoring programs. They evaluate ecological indicators for surface waters and study the effects of non-native species on wetland restoration. The National Science Foundation funds research on invasive species and their ecological roles. EPA scientists collaborate with regional staff to assess potential impacts of invasive species in NEPA assessments. The Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC) conducts research on invasive species in coastal ecosystems, focusing on patterns of ballast-water delivery, susceptibility of marine communities, and species transfer associated with shipping. They collaborate with the U.S. Coast Guard to manage ballast water delivery and document alien species invasions in Chesapeake Bay. The Smithsonian Institution conducts research on invasive species in coastal ecosystems, focusing on patterns of ballast-water delivery and species transfer associated with shipping. They collaborate with the U.S. Coast Guard to manage ballast water delivery and document alien species invasions in Chesapeake Bay."
