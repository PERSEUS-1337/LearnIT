It spans over 12,500 square miles across four states and provides clean drinking water to over 15 million people, including half of New York City's supply. The most significant threat to the Delaware River Basin's drinking water supply is forest clearing in the Upper Basin, leading to habitat loss and degradation for almost 180 special status species. The Basin provides habitat for over 200 fish species, including unique species like sturgeon, eastern oyster, and red knots. Current oyster landings in the Delaware Bay have decreased due to polluted water and disease, impacting recreational fisheries and the ecosystem. The Delaware Bay is a crucial shorebird migration site with a large concentration of shorebirds. The Basin has significant wetlands and forest cover, providing essential ecosystem services. However, the natural landscape is at risk of degradation due to ongoing development, leading to increased pollution in rivers and streams. The Delaware River, the longest undammed river in the east, is also part of this ecosystem. The Delaware River is the longest undammed river east of the Mississippi and a critical component of the National Wild and Scenic River System in the Northeast. Management of water volume in the Basin is crucial for flood mitigation and habitat for fish and wildlife. The governors of Delaware, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania have called for natural flood control measures after major floods since 2004. The Delaware River Port Complex is the largest freshwater port in the world, with the Port of Philadelphia handling the largest volume of international tonnage and 70 percent of the oil shipped to the east coast. The Port of Wilmington on the Delaware River is the busiest terminal, handling over 400 vessels annually and 4,000,000 tons of cargo. The Delaware Estuary is one of the largest in the National Estuary Program, with the Partnership for the Delaware Estuary working to improve its environmental health. The Delaware River Basin Commission oversees water resource management projects and activities. The Delaware River Basin Restoration Program aims to support restoration and protection funding mechanisms at various levels to complement existing State and Federal agency programs in the Basin. Funding for these important water resources management projects should continue to be prioritized.

The Delaware River Basin Restoration Program defines key terms such as Basin, Director, Foundation, Grant Program, and Program. These definitions clarify the roles and entities involved in the restoration and protection funding efforts in the Delaware Basin. The Delaware River Basin Restoration Program defines key terms such as Secretary and Service, clarifying roles in restoration efforts. The Delaware River Basin Restoration Program establishes the program. The Secretary shall establish the Delaware River Basin Restoration Program, working with various organizations to identify and prioritize restoration activities, adopt a shared plan, establish a Grant Program, and provide technical assistance. The Director shall consult with Federal agencies, Basin States, the Partnership for the Delaware Estuary, the Delaware River Basin Commission, fish and wildlife joint venture partnerships, and other public agencies and organizations to establish the Program. The Program aims to coordinate restoration and protection activities in the Basin among Federal agencies, State, local, and regional entities, and conservation partners. It includes sustaining and enhancing habitat restoration, water quality improvements, water management, flood control, and public access opportunities. The Program aims to coordinate restoration and protection activities in the Basin among Federal agencies, State, local, and regional entities, and conservation partners. It includes sustaining and enhancing habitat restoration, water quality improvements, water management, flood control, and public access opportunities. The program also provides competitive grants and technical assistance for restoration and protection activities in the Basin, prioritizing activities with multiple benefits like habitat, water quality, and flood protection. The Program provides grants and assistance for restoration and protection activities in the Basin, prioritizing projects with multiple benefits like habitat, water quality, and flood protection. The Delaware River Basin Restoration Program establishes a grant program to provide funding for activities that restore or protect fish and wildlife habitats, improve water quality, and manage water volume and flooding. Criteria for the grant program are developed to ensure that funded activities address these purposes. The Delaware River Basin Restoration Program establishes a grant program to fund activities that restore habitats, improve water quality, and manage water volume and flooding. The program includes cost-sharing requirements and allows for the administration by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation or another qualified organization. The Director may provide technical assistance to other entities to carry out the purposes of the Grant Program. Amounts received by the Foundation shall be subject to specific provisions. Authorization of Appropriations: The Secretary is authorized to receive $5,000,000 annually from 2011 to 2016 to implement the Act, with at least 75 percent allocated to the Grant Program and technical assistance.
