    "title": "AB 1706",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 3003 of the Government Code is amended to state that an elected officer in California will forfeit their office if convicted of a crime under the federal or California Stolen Valor Act involving a fraudulent claim of being a veteran or member of the Armed Forces to gain benefits. The term \"district\" is defined as any state agency formed for local governmental functions. Any person who fraudulently represents themselves as a veteran or ex-serviceman in connection with soliciting aid or selling property is guilty of a misdemeanor. \"Tangible benefit\" includes financial remuneration, influencing court proceedings, elections, or military service benefits from a governmental entity. Any person who falsely claims to be a veteran or wears military decorations to obtain benefits is guilty of a misdemeanor, unless they are a veteran themselves. Any person who forges military documentation or misrepresents themselves as a member of the Armed Forces to obtain benefits is guilty of a misdemeanor. This includes using falsified military identification for personal gain. Any person who knowingly misrepresents themselves as a member or veteran of the Armed Forces for business promotion or employment advantage by wearing unauthorized military uniform or decoration is guilty of a misdemeanor. This does not apply to face-to-face solicitations involving less than $10. The California Stolen Valor Act defines \"military decoration\" and \"tangible benefit\" for the purpose of prohibiting misrepresentation as a member or veteran of the Armed Forces for personal gain. The California Stolen Valor Act defines terms related to misrepresentation as a member or veteran of the Armed Forces for personal gain, without requiring reimbursement for costs incurred by local agencies or school districts."
