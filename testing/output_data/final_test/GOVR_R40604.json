They may be classified based on organizational units or distinct skill sets they possess, such as scientific and engineering workforce. These categories are often referred to as \"functional workforces\" or \"occupations.\" Employees in federal agencies can be categorized in various ways, such as by how they are hired and paid, or by their specific skills and occupations. This fragmentation is also seen in the science and engineering workforce, which can be classified by agency, work activity, education, age, and region, influencing federal employment policies. The National Science Foundation (NSF) provides data on the federal S&E workforce, categorized by major occupational group and primary work activity. The largest number of scientists work in computer and mathematical sciences, while engineers are mostly in the \"other engineers\" category. Federal scientists and engineers are primarily involved in research and development activities across various federal agencies. Table 3 shows the number of federal scientists and engineers employed by agency, with the Department of Defense having the highest number. Table 4 indicates that most federal S&Es have a bachelor's degree. In Table 5, the South Atlantic region has the highest concentration of scientists and engineers in the United States. The Pacific region has the next highest number of federal scientists and engineers, with the lowest numbers in the West North Central and New England areas. Concerns about the federal S&T workforce include demand in the labor market, salary competitiveness with the private sector, U.S. citizenship requirements, and an aging workforce. High demand for specific S&T expertise can lead to increased private sector salaries and hiring speed, making it challenging for the federal government to compete. The number of S&T workers in the U.S. has increased, posing challenges for the federal government to compete for employment. The workforce in S&T occupations grew at a 6.8% annual rate from 1950-2000, reaching 5.5 million employees in 2000. Economic downturns have influenced workforce demand, leading to fluctuations in S&E occupation employment. The growth of S&T workers in the U.S. has outpaced all workers, with S&E occupation employment leveling off in some fields. S&E fields have seen faster employment growth than domestic degree production, with a higher annual growth rate from 1980-2000. The marketplace responded to the difference between degree and occupation growth by employing individuals in S&E occupations without S&E degrees or foreign S&E workers. Future demand for S&T workers is uncertain, but BLS estimates show growth in health care practitioners, computer and mathematical occupations, architecture and engineering, and life, physical, and social sciences. The federal government may not offer competitive salaries to scientists and engineers compared to the private sector, especially for those with PhD degrees. U.S. citizenship requirements can also make it challenging for federal agencies to fill positions in fields related to national defense and security. The 2004 Rand Science and Technology Policy Institute found that there is not a shortage of STEM-trained citizens eligible for security clearance, despite concerns in national defense and homeland security fields. Enrollment of U.S. citizens in graduate science and engineering programs has not kept pace with foreign students. In 2005-2006, U.S. citizen and permanent resident enrollment increased slightly. Graduate enrollment in fields like computer science and physical sciences decreased. Foreign students earned half or more of PhD degrees in certain fields, limiting recent PhD graduates available for federal agency employment. Federal agencies prioritize hiring U.S. citizens, but non-citizens may be hired in specific circumstances. Federal agencies prioritize hiring U.S. citizens and permanent residents, but non-citizens may be considered in certain situations. Agencies must adhere to immigration laws, appropriations act bans, and executive order restrictions when hiring non-citizens. The aging workforce is a significant issue, with a majority of federal scientists and engineers being over the age of 45. The federal science and engineering workforce is aging, with a majority over 45 years old. Some agencies have high turnover rates and are taking initiatives to recruit new employees, especially in mission-critical occupational categories. The DOC has initiatives to recruit patent examiners at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The federal civil service system has become fragmented in recent decades. The Pendleton Act of 1883 and the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 are key laws related to the federal government's S&T workforce. These laws guide Congress in legislating on related topics. The Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) and other federal personnel-related laws address the balance between granting flexibility for hiring and pay while preventing potential abuse. Congress has historically granted flexibility for expedited hiring and higher pay rates to achieve public policy objectives, but also remains cautious of unaccountable flexibility that could lead to abuse. These laws aim to ensure that hiring and pay decisions are based on merit and the achievement of public policy objectives. The Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (FEPCA) and other laws provide government-wide authorities for federal agencies to recruit and retain highly qualified S&T workforce. These authorities include appointment of high-level scientific and professional personnel, demonstration projects, critical pay authority, and direct hire authority. Congress authorized the Secretaries of War and the Navy after World War II to establish compensation for highly paid positions in the professional and scientific service. The Senior Professional Performance Act of 2008 established a new pay system for scientific or professional employees above the GS-15 level. The Scientific or Professional (ST) personnel system covers high-level research and development positions in various sciences. The authority to allocate these positions among agencies is codified in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3104. In the late 1970s, proposals for new approaches to personnel management were considered as part of the Civil Service Reform Act. The Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) in the late 1970s focused on new approaches to personnel management, with the Administration seeking new statutory authority for pilot testing management techniques. Congress, however, enacted only a limited version due to concerns about undermining the merit system. The CSRA's provisions related to \"Personnel Research Programs and Demonstration Projects\" in Chapter 47 of Title 5 are relevant to the federal S&T workforce. Some demonstration projects, known as \"demos,\" were authorized by OPM and made permanent by Congress. Some demonstration projects authorized by Congress have been made permanent, such as the U.S. Navy's \"China Lake\" demo and a project at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Other active projects include those at the Department of Commerce and Department of Defense laboratories. Congress has also authorized pilot programs aimed at revitalizing the civilian acquisition workforce of DOD. The Secretary of Defense was authorized to conduct three-year pilot programs to revitalize DOD laboratories and test centers. The programs focused on improving relationships with universities and private sector entities, experimenting with human capital innovations, and implementing initiatives to enhance hiring practices. However, only 4 out of 178 proposed initiatives were implemented, with low implementation due to challenges in human capital initiatives. The GAO found that many proposed human capital initiatives required waiving Title 5 provisions, which DOD lawyers believed they did not have the authority to do. DOD's response was the National Security Personnel System (NSPS), which was not yet passed by Congress but would allow waivers. OPM now provides information on demonstration projects on its website. Subsequent years saw an increase in agency-specific S&T workforce authorities and changes in executive-branch-wide authorities relevant to S&T. CSRA expanded authority under the Intergovernmental Mobility Program, allowing temporary assignment of personnel between the federal government and other organizations. This authority, often referred to as the IPA, is used by agencies like the NSF to enhance their S&E workforces. IPAs, known as rotators, are considered federal employees while working at agencies but remain employees of their home institutions. IPAs, or rotators, are federal employees working at NSF but remain employees of their home institutions. They are not paid directly by NSF and receive reimbursement for salary, benefits, per diem, relocation expenses, and lost income. Initial assignments can be up to two years and may be part-time, full-time, or intermittent, extendable up to four years with approval. After completion, IPAs are expected not to be employed by NSF for at least one year. NSF rotators are expected to not be employed by NSF for at least one year after their IPA assignment. They assume responsibilities similar to permanent staff, including leading the merit review process and managing awards. The NSF Academy provides training activities for new rotators and permanent staff. FEPCA included provisions for new pay authority for \"critical positions.\" OPM may grant authority to fix the rate of basic pay for critical positions in an agency. FEPCA included provisions for new pay authority for \"critical positions\" in an agency, allowing for higher rates of pay up to the level I of the Executive Schedule with the President's approval. These positions require high expertise and are crucial to the agency's mission, as seen in the retention issues faced by NIH research scientists due to low pay compared to nonfederal alternatives. OPM's guidance aligns with congressional intent, as expressed in a House report accompanying the legislation. The House report highlighted retention issues among research scientists at NIH due to low pay compared to nonfederal options. FEPCA authorized recruitment, relocation, and retention incentives known as the \"three Rs\" to attract experts in various fields. These incentives allow for payments of up to 25% of an employee's annual pay under certain conditions, with OPM approval for higher rates. FEPCA allows for retention incentives to retain employees with unique qualifications or special agency needs. OPM can establish special pay rates for specific positions to address recruitment or retention challenges. For example, patent examiners and attorneys at the Patent and Trademark Office have received special pay rates. Additionally, provisions in the Homeland Security Act of 2002 allowed for hiring after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Provisions in the Homeland Security Act of 2002 allowed for hiring individuals without certain Title 5 provisions. Direct hire authority requires public notice and OPM approval for critical hiring needs. OPM maintains online resources and a list of positions granted permission to use this authority. Agency-specific statutory authorities in the 1990s provided additional flexibility. In the 1990s, agency-specific statutory authorities provided flexibility in hiring and paying federal S&T workforce. Agencies may choose to use these authorities, and changes can be made through various mechanisms. Examples include IRS and NASA receiving critical pay authority, influenced by flexibilities within DOD. In the 1990s, agency-specific statutory authorities provided flexibility in hiring and paying federal S&T workforce. DARPA received statutory authority in 1998, followed by the establishment of HSARPA in 2002. NSPS was authorized in 2004 for DOD's human resources management system. In the 1990s, agency-specific statutory authorities provided flexibility in hiring and paying federal S&T workforce. DARPA received statutory authority in 1998, followed by the establishment of HSARPA in 2002. NSPS was authorized in 2004 for DOD's human resources management system. A provision codified as 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 9903 applied flexibilities similar to DARPA's personnel provisions DOD-wide. In 2006, the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act established BARDA with personnel provisions piggybacked on DOD's authority. The America COMPETES Act established ARPA-E within DOE, providing hiring and pay flexibility for the agency's director. In 1990, the National Research Council (NRC) prepared a report on recruiting and retaining the federal S&T workforce. The report identified barriers and proposed mechanisms to reduce them. The 1990 National Research Council report identified barriers to recruiting and retaining federal scientists and engineers. It suggested various scenarios for science and engineering activity within federal agencies, including demonstration projects and contracting out work to overcome recruitment and retention challenges. A follow-up report in 1993 discussed recruiting requirements, civil service system challenges, federal pay reform, and evaluating the effectiveness of the current system. The 1993 report recommends implementing pay reform provisions to address pay inequities and reward superior performance among federal employees, including scientists and engineers. OPM should decentralize FEPCA authorities and flexibilities within departments and agencies to ensure effective administration of the S&E workforce. The 1993 report recommends implementing pay reform provisions to address pay inequities and reward superior performance among federal employees, including scientists and engineers. Each federal agency with a science and engineering workforce should develop a comprehensive action plan with assistance from OPM to improve recruitment, retention, and utilization of scientists and engineers. A new interagency committee on federal scientific and engineering personnel should be established to evaluate and recommend personnel policies and develop model strategies for program evaluation. The 1993 report recommends pay reform to address inequities and reward performance among federal employees, including scientists and engineers. Agencies should develop action plans with OPM to improve recruitment and retention. An interagency committee should evaluate personnel policies and develop strategies for program evaluation. Congress and the executive branch should collaborate on civil service system changes beyond pay flexibility. RAND STPI prepared a report on the federal workforce in 2004. The curr_chunk provides an overview of the federal workforce, highlighting the use of workforce incentives to attract and retain high-quality STEM workers. It also mentions that a significant proportion of STEM workers on federal projects are employed by private-sector contractors, allowing for flexibility in workforce size and characteristics. The curr_chunk discusses proposed mechanisms to attract and retain STEM workers in the national workforce, focusing on filling the pipeline and shaping the workforce through educational and immigration policies, as well as federal agency initiatives. Examples include NASA offering hiring bonuses and the NIH repaying student loans for health researchers. The analysis by STPI found that current federal initiatives prioritize filling the pipeline. The report by STPI found that federal initiatives prioritize filling the pipeline for STEM workers. A Jason committee report to DOD highlighted the lack of recognition for science and engineering personnel within the military, recommending enhanced recruitment and retention policies. The Jason report recommends that DOD establish a research corps within each Service to enhance professionalism, training, career paths, and visibility for S&T personnel. Congress is concerned about human resource management issues for S&T personnel and may evaluate the federal government's ability to recruit and retain them. The federal government's experience with statutory authorities can inform Congress's deliberations on modifying recruitment of scientific, engineering, and technical personnel. Congress may consider agency-specific or executive-branch-wide approaches to address recruitment and retention issues. Collaboration with entities like OPM, CHCO Council, OSTP, and OMB could be leveraged to galvanize action by agencies. Tools to galvanize action by agencies, OPM, and OMB might be pursued through requirements for strategic planning, coordination, evaluation, and reporting. Concerns have been raised about OPM's oversight of agency use of flexibilities. Short-term appointments may not be suitable for building a long-term workforce. Several recruitment programs have short durations, which may deter potential recruits despite higher compensation rates. Some programs are limited in scope and may not be suitable for recruiting a large number of individuals. There is uncertainty about the effectiveness of various recruitment mechanisms in achieving employment goals. Agencies face challenges in hiring despite these programs, which target both entry-level and senior employees with different incentives. OPM Director John Berry plans to pursue significant recruitment efforts. OPM Director John Berry plans to reform the civil service system in Title 5, including a pay for performance system, to address concerns about the federal pay system. The three-pronged strategy aims to create fair performance appraisal, develop training for promotion, and establish salary parity with the private sector. The Obama Administration has taken actions related to federal S&E personnel, such as halting the expansion of DOD's National Security Personnel System. The draft energy research and development bill proposed by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources would provide the Department of Energy (DOE) with direct hire, critical pay, and rehire authority for a period of two years, in line with merit principles and public notice requirements. This authority was originally held by the Atomic Energy Commission and later transferred to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) but not the DOE. The draft energy research and development bill proposed by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources would provide the DOE with critical pay authority to hire highly skilled individuals for key positions. This includes rehiring retired employees for mission critical roles without impacting their retirement annuity. The draft energy research and development bill proposed by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources would provide critical pay authority to hire skilled individuals for key positions in managing large, technically complicated energy-related efforts, ensuring continuity of knowledge transfer."
