Congress finds that trees and forests are crucial for the health of the Chesapeake Bay watershed, which is losing forest land to urbanization at a rapid pace. The Forest Service plays a key role in supporting forest conservation efforts, but current programs are insufficient to meet Chesapeake Bay forest goals. The Act aims to enhance cooperative efforts to protect and manage forests in the region. The Act aims to protect, restore, and manage forests in the Chesapeake Bay watershed to contribute to the goals of the Chesapeake Bay Agreement.

This includes promoting forest stewardship, accelerating riparian forest buffer restoration, developing projects and partnerships, and enhancing public understanding of forest value. The Secretary will implement a Chesapeake Bay watershed forestry program to enhance public understanding of forest value, conduct research for forest restoration, and contribute to the goals of the Chesapeake Bay Agreement. An office within the Forest Service will be maintained for the program, with a designated Coordinator responsible for providing grants and technical assistance for forest restoration and protection in the Chesapeake Bay. The Forest Service will collaborate with other agencies to restore and protect forests in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, ensuring water quality and sustaining watershed health.

The Secretary provides grants to implement forest conservation, restoration, and watershed management plans, including outreach to private landowners. Communication and education programs aim to raise awareness of the value of trees and forests in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Community-based partnerships focus on these initiatives. The program focuses on expanding urban tree canopy, restoring or protecting forest land, integrating Forest Service programs for watershed restoration, providing forest resource data for watershed management, enhancing upland forest health for water quality, and conducting inventory assessment for environmental change. Funds are allocated for Chesapeake Bay watershed foresters. The program allocates funds for Chesapeake Bay watershed foresters to work with the Coordinator on activities and projects. The Secretary will conduct a study on urban and rural forests in the watershed, evaluating forest sustainability, threats, loss, fragmentation, and identifying areas for restoration or protection.
