    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission is established to oversee various mental health programs in California, replacing the previous advisory committee. It consists of 17 voting members including the Attorney General and the Superintendent of Public Instruction or their designees. The Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission includes the Superintendent of Public Instruction or designee, the Chairperson of the Senate Health and Human Services Committee or selected member, and the Chairperson of the Assembly Health Committee or selected member. The Governor appoints various individuals to the Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission, including those with personal or family experience with mental illness. Members serve without compensation but are reimbursed for expenses. The Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission members serve staggered three-year terms. The commission meets quarterly in public, can hire staff, and establish advisory committees. The Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission can establish technical advisory committees, employ necessary strategies, enter into contracts, and obtain data from relevant state entities for oversight and evaluation of projects supported by Mental Health Services Act funds. The Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission participates in decision-making processes, develops strategies to combat stigma, advises the Governor or Legislature on improving mental health care, and can refer critical issues to the State Department of Health Care Services. The Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission collaborates with various entities to provide technical assistance for the Mental Health Services Act. They work with the State Department of Health Care Services and the California Mental Health Planning Council to design a joint plan for evaluating client outcomes in the mental health system. The California Health and Human Services Agency leads this effort. The Legislature finds that this act aligns with the Mental Health Services Act."
