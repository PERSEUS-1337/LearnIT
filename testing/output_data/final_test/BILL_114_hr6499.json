    "content": "The \"Second Chance for Ex-Offenders Act of 2016\" allows for the expungement of criminal records for certain nonviolent offenders under a new subchapter d in Chapter 229 of title 18, United States Code. The \"Second Chance for Ex-Offenders Act of 2016\" permits the expungement of criminal records for nonviolent offenders meeting specific criteria outlined in the new subchapter of Chapter 229 of title 18, United States Code. This includes defining nonviolent offenses and setting requirements for expungement eligibility. To be eligible for expungement under the \"Second Chance for Ex-Offenders Act of 2016,\" individuals must meet specific criteria, including never being convicted of a violent offense, fulfilling all court sentence requirements, remaining free from substance abuse for at least one year, and being rehabilitated to the satisfaction of the court. Sec. 3633 outlines the procedure for expungement, allowing individuals to file a petition in the court where the conviction occurred. The United States Attorney may provide recommendations within 60 days. The court can order expungement after considering the petition. The court rules on the petition for expungement after considering evidence from the petitioner and the Government. The court weighs the petitioner's interests against justice and public safety. An expungement order restores the individual to their pre-arrest status. Expungement does not disqualify the individual or require statements. Upon expungement of a criminal record, the individual is not required to disclose the conviction and it will not disqualify them from any lawful activity. Failure to disclose the arrest or criminal proceedings will not result in perjury or false statement charges. All official records related to the arrest are sealed upon expungement. Upon expungement of a criminal record, all official records related to the arrest, criminal proceedings, and results are sealed or expunged. The Department of Justice may maintain a nonpublic index of expunged records for law enforcement purposes. The Department of Justice maintains a nonpublic index of expunged records for law enforcement purposes, which is only accessible to authorized personnel for specific purposes. These records can be disclosed to the accused or their designated agent, prosecutors, law enforcement agencies, courts, agencies responsible for issuing gun licenses, and prospective employers. Any prospective city, State, or Federal employer or agency involved in investigating or prosecuting under criminal or civil statutes, including employers of police or peace officers, must be provided with a copy of all records obtained and given an opportunity to explain. Punishment for improper disclosure is outlined. The expunged records will be restored as public records and can be used in court proceedings if the individual is convicted of a new offense. Improper disclosure of expunged information is punishable by fine or imprisonment. Expungement provisions in the Act apply to individuals convicted of an offense before, on, or after the enactment date."
