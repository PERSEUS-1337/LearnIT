    "content": "One of the distinguishing aspects of human language is its compositionality, allowing us to describe complex environments with limited vocabulary. Neural network agents can learn to communicate in a structured language based on disentangled input. In this work, agents are trained to develop visual perception from raw image pixels and communicate with discrete symbols in an image description game. The obverter technique is used for training, where agents generate messages to maximize their understanding. Through qualitative analysis and visualization, it is shown that agents can develop a compositional language from raw image pixels. In this study, agents can develop a compositional language from raw image pixels, demonstrating the ability to communicate with humans in natural language. The use of deep learning has enabled significant progress in natural language processing tasks, but supervised methods have limitations in communication beyond predicting the next word. The essence of communication goes beyond statistical associations between symbols, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive approach. The study explores teaching machines to communicate by giving them specific tasks and encouraging them to learn on their own. Recent works have shown communication between neural network agents using single discrete symbols or continuous values. This approach aims to develop a compositional language from raw image pixels for communication with humans in natural language. In recent studies, neural agents were trained to communicate using grounded, compositional language. Unlike previous works, this study focuses on training agents to develop visual perception from raw image pixels and learn to communicate with discrete symbols simultaneously. This setup presents greater challenges as visual understanding and discrete communication have to be induced from scratch in parallel. Training artificial agents to disentangle raw image pixels and communicate in compositional language simultaneously using the obverter technique. The technique motivates agents to generate messages that maximize their understanding, allowing them to learn to perceive color and shape without explicit guidance. The agents learn to disentangle color and shape from raw image input without explicit supervision, developing a compositional language through the image description game. This milestone towards AGI involves learning neural networks to create new concepts by composing disentangled representations of visual scenes. In the two-person image description game, the speaker describes an image using colors and shapes, while the listener must determine if they are seeing the same object. The game allows for extensive analysis with full control of the experiment. The two-person image description game involves a speaker describing an image using colors and shapes, while the listener determines if they see the same object. Synthetic images are generated using Mujoco physics simulator, depicting objects in various colors and shapes. Each image shows a single object with 100 variations for each of the 40 object types. The speaker and listener in the image description game are given different images of the same object type, making it difficult for agents to rely on pixel-specific information. The agent model architecture includes a visual module, language module, and decision module. Previous works assumed agents had access to the true intention of the speaker. The agent model architecture includes a visual module, language module, and decision module. The model uses no other signal than whether the listener made a correct decision. A convolutional neural network and a single RNN (GRU) are used for processing images and generating/consuming messages. The model architecture includes a visual module, language module, and decision module. The image and message embeddings are concatenated and processed by fully-connected layers to make a decision. The obverter technique is inspired by communication and language evolution studies, rooted in the theory of mind. The obverter technique aims to optimize communication by assuming that the listener's mind works similarly to the speaker's. The teacher selects symbols that maximize understanding, using RNN hidden layers to convert images to embeddings.

The obverter technique ensures self-consistency by using one RNN for speaking and listening. Message generation can be more exploratory by sampling characters proportionally to \u0177. The technique follows the principle of least effort by stopping symbol generation when \u0177 reaches a threshold. This approach helps in discovering optimal communication languages for complex tasks. During research, randomly sampling object pairs led to agents focusing only on colors and ignoring shapes. When the teacher's object is fixed, the learner can correctly decide for 36 out of 40 possible object types based on color alone, resulting in 90% accuracy. The accuracy plateaued between 0.9 and 0.92 during training, with messages being similar for objects of the same color. When constructing a mini-batch of images, 25% were object pairs of the same color and shape, 30% had the same shape but different colors, and 20% had the same color but different shapes. The remaining 25% were randomly picked object pairs. A larger vocabulary and longer message length helped achieve high communication accuracy more easily, but made messages more challenging to analyze for compositional patterns. The vocabulary size and maximum message length used were 5 and 20 respectively, similar to previous studies. The emergence of complex communication, discussed in previous studies, should be a main consideration for future efforts. Details on hyperparameters are in Appendix E. This section analyzes convergence behavior during training and the compositionality of language developed by agents. Compositional language relies on the structure and meanings of expressions. Evaluating inter-agent communication focuses on grammar and zero-shot performance. These aspects are essential for studying the compositional nature of artificial communication. The study evaluates the structure of communication in artificial agents by analyzing the evolution of messages during training. It aims to derive a grammar for expressing colors and shapes and test zero-shot capabilities. Visual embeddings are examined to understand how agents recognize colors and shapes. Training progress is visualized in graphs showing accuracy, loss, message length, distinctness, perplexities, and Jaccard similarity of messages. During training, the agents' convergence behavior was analyzed by calculating training accuracy, message distinctness, and perplexities. Every 10 rounds, both agents generated 1,000 message pairs for object types, with Jaccard similarity also calculated between their messages. The average number of distinct messages used to describe a single object type was determined. During training, the agents' convergence behavior was analyzed by calculating training accuracy, message distinctness, and perplexities. Jaccard similarity between agents' messages was calculated for each object type and averaged. Initially, the listener always perceived a different object than the speaker, with accuracy at 0.75. However, after 7,000 rounds, accuracy exceeded 0.9. Loss was negatively correlated with accuracy until round 15,000, where it fluctuated. Lower loss led to clearer communication and better zero-shot performance. Fluctuations in loss indicated training instability for future work. Message distinctness started near 0, showing agents generated the same message for all object types. After round 7,000, message distinctness and length peaked but then decreased. Perplexities and Jaccard similarity fluctuated initially but became negatively correlated later on, indicating consistent and similar messaging between agents. Performance was excellent in rounds 7,000 to 8,000 in terms of loss and accuracy, but perplexity remained a key indicator of communication structure. In rounds 7,000 to 8,000, agents showed excellent performance in terms of loss and accuracy, but had high perplexity and low Jaccard similarity. This behavior resembled early stages of language evolution where words had meanings but no structure. The language became more structured over time as agents settled on a common language. In round 6, agents begin to communicate more efficiently, with higher training accuracy than round 40. However, both agents assign many names to a single object type, focusing on pixel-level differences. Messages for the same object type are different, with high perplexity making it hard to capture the grammar. Jaccard similarity shows agents generate completely different messages for the same object type. In round 16,760, agents share a narrow set of names for each object type, with names following a pattern based on color and shape. The messages in this round can be decomposed into shape and color specifications. The agents use specific strings to specify shapes and colors, with some irregularities in color descriptions. Despite some exceptions, the messages show evidence that the agents learned to recognize color and shape from raw pixel input. The agents learned to compose messages describing images by mapping colors and shapes to prefixes and suffixes. Communication accuracy for each object type is detailed in Appendix F, with examples in Appendix G. Five novel objects were described during the test phase to assess compositional language learning. Agents chosen from round 19,980 showed high accuracy and Jaccard similarity. TAB4 displays potential message decomposition by the agents.

Agents chosen from round 19,980 showed high accuracy and Jaccard similarity. TAB4 shows a potential decomposition of the messages used by the agents, with clear structure in communication observed. Testing with held-out objects was conducted to assess communication accuracy, with results shown in Table 4. The agents successfully communicated with novel objects, showing high accuracy even with unfamiliar items. Communication accuracy was lower for held-out objects, attributed to the complexity of grammar and message structure. Objects described without certain prefixes and suffixes performed better overall. The emerged language in this work, trained using the obverter technique, showed strong adherence to a well-defined grammar. Through qualitative analysis and the zero-shot test, it was demonstrated that the agents could successfully describe novel objects following a similar grammar, meeting the necessary conditions for compositional communication. The emerged language in this study displayed properties consistent with compositional languages. The definition of compositional language remains debatable, and there is no reliable way to quantify it mathematically. To encourage further research, a quantitatively measurable definition of compositionality is proposed, viewing it as a spectrum rather than a binary concept. The text discusses the importance of defining compositional language and suggests future directions for research, such as observing the emergence of compositional language among multiple agents and training agents to consider context. In BID3, neural agents were trained to develop a structured language using disentangled meaning vectors as input. Subject and predicate vectors were used to compose 100 meaning vectors, with each digit in the subject vector representing different roles. Twenty neural agents with vanilla RNNs were used in the experiment. The hidden vector h's size was 10, same as the meaning vector m, to treat h as the agent's understanding of m. In each training round, a single learner and ten teachers were randomly chosen. Teachers generate messages using the obverter technique, aiming to minimize the mean squared error between h and m. Strong patterns were found in the messages used by the agents after training. The agents were able to successfully communicate using a shared language even with held-out meaning vectors, but the messages did not show as strong compositional patterns as in the non-zero-shot case. The obverter technique encourages the agents to use a structured language. The obverter technique encourages agents to use a shared language with a single RNN for speaking and listening, unlike other RL-based works where agents have separate components for message generation and consumption. This separation is due to different input/output requirements for generating and consuming messages. In the obverter technique, agents use a shared language with a single component for both message generation and consumption, ensuring internal consistency. Unlike RL-based works where agents have separate components for these processes, the obverter approach guarantees that messages make sense to the agent itself. The obverter technique in agent communication involves agents converging on a common language by taking turns as listener and speaker, leading to the emergence of a self-consistent shared language. This approach is motivated by the theory of mind and resembles the human language acquisition process. However, all agents must have identical model architectures for this technique to work effectively. The obverter technique in agent communication involves agents converging on a common language through a self-consistent shared language. RL-based approaches have separate modules for speaking and listening, making it a robust tool for general tasks. Combining the strengths of both approaches could enable communication in more complex tasks. The implementation used TensorFlow and the Sonnet library with an eight-layer convolutional neural network and 32 filters. The study utilized an eight-layer convolutional neural network with 32 filters and ReLU activation. Batch normalization was applied, bias parameters were omitted. The fully connected layer had 256 dimensions with ReLU activation. A single layer GRU was used for the language module with a hidden layer size of 64. A two-layer feedforward neural network reduced dimensionality to 128 and generated a scalar value with sigmoid activation. Model parameters were randomly initialized for both agents. The study utilized an eight-layer convolutional neural network with ReLU activation. Model parameters were randomly initialized for both agents. The training process involves rounds where teacher/learner roles are changed, and each round consists of multiple games where learner's model parameters are updated based on messages generated by the teacher. Learner's parameters are updated to minimize cross entropy loss. After a predefined number of games, roles are switched between the two agents. Accuracy for each object type was tested in a separate round with 1,600 total object pairs. The study tested the accuracy of communication between agents using 1,600 object pairs. The average accuracy was 95.4%, with only 88 pairs having accuracy below 0.8. Accuracy varied based on the object type, with objects described with less overlapping messages having higher accuracy. For example, a yellow box was communicated with 98% accuracy, while a gray box was communicated with 93% accuracy due to overlapping descriptions with other objects. The speaker and listener in the study use a blue box and various objects. The listener's belief changes with each symbol consumed, often jumping between 0 and 1 due to small message differences. Similar messages can cause confusion, like blue box and blue cylinder. Different objects can also share the same message. The study shows that the listener can confuse objects with similar messages, such as the blue box and cyan cylinder. This confusion can lead to occasional losses in the game. The agents prioritize winning the game while minimizing message generation effort. The visual module of the agents is analyzed to understand how they process object information. In a separate test with agents from round 19,980, communication accuracy for each object type was assessed. Agents were given 1,600 object pairs tested 10 times. Average accuracy was 94.73%, with 103 pairs having accuracy below 0.8. Objects with less overlapping messages had higher accuracy. Agent0's efficient description of a new object was discussed. The communication accuracy of agents was tested with different object types. Agent0 efficiently described a new object, leading to successful communication. The debate arose on whether certain descriptions were as compositional as others."
