    "content": "Title III, Part A of the ESEA provides formula grants to states for LEP and immigrant students. Funds are reserved for national activities, Native American schools, and outlying areas. State grants are based on the state's share of LEP and immigrant students, with higher weight given to LEP students. Grants cannot be less than $500,000, and Puerto Rico's grant has a cap. Title III, Part A of the ESEA provides formula grants to states for LEP and immigrant students. Grants cannot be less than $500,000, and Puerto Rico's grant has a cap of 0.5% of the total available for state distribution. The number of LEP and immigrant students is determined using ACS data or the number of children assessed for English proficiency under Title I of the ESEA. ED has been using ACS data for state allocations since FY2005, with grants based on data from two years prior. ED does not use state data due to perceived incompleteness. The Education Department (ED) uses ACS data for state allocations of grants for LEP and immigrant students, as state data is considered incomplete. The LEP student count is based on those aged 5 to 21 who speak a language other than English at home and have limited English proficiency. The number of immigrant students is based on individuals aged 3 to 21 who entered the US in the past two years. These criteria were developed for the 1980 census to comply with legislation such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Education Department uses ACS data for state grants for LEP and immigrant students, based on criteria developed for the 1980 census to comply with legislation like the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Tables 1 and 2 show LEP and immigrant student counts used for grant amounts in FY2005-2007. States saw varying changes in LEP student numbers, with examples like Arizona and Texas experiencing fluctuations. The number of LEP students in different states fluctuated over the years, with significant changes in student counts in some states like Arkansas. Despite variations in immigrant student counts, similar patterns were observed across years. State-reported data includes total LEP students and those receiving services. The National Clearinghouse for English Language Acquisition and Language Instruction Educational Programs (NCELA) uses state-provided data to count LEP students enrolled. Data is collected on total LEP students and those receiving services, including Title III and non-Title III services. The Common Core of Data (CCD) collects data on students receiving LEP services, not limited to Title III services. The Common Core of Data (CCD) collects data on LEP students receiving services, excluding those not receiving services. The most recent CCD data is from the 2004-2005 school year. Another data source is the biennial report on Title III performance, with the first report covering 2002-2004 and the upcoming report expected to include counts of LEP students served in Title III programs and the total number of LEP students in the state. The forthcoming second biennial report includes data from annual CSPRs on LEP student counts compared between NCELA and CCD data for 2002-2005 school years. NCELA data is more complete than CCD data, but in some states, NCELA counts are lower than CCD counts, contrary to expectations. The NCELA count in several states is significantly different from the CCD count, with variations exceeding 20% in some cases. Discrepancies exist between the data from different school years, raising concerns about how LEP student counts are conducted by states. The NCELA and CCD data from 2003-2004 were compared to the biennial report data, showing discrepancies in LEP student counts among different sources. The biennial report data only include LEP students receiving Title III services, while NCELA data is the most comprehensive count. Variations in counts raise questions about the consistency of LEP student counts within states and from year to year. The biennial report data for Arkansas and California showed higher LEP student counts compared to CCD counts in Alabama and Arizona, as well as higher than NCELA count in Arizona. This raises concerns about the accuracy of state-level LEP student counts for grant allocations. Immigrant student counts are primarily sourced from the Title III biennial report, with limited data available. Table 4 provides immigrant student counts for the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 school years. The section compares LEP and immigrant student counts between ACS data and state data for the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 school years. It discusses data limitations, differences in student counts, and analyzes estimated FY2007 state grants using both data sources. Comparisons were made with state data from different school years to ensure accuracy in grant allocations. The NCELA data for the 2004-2005 school year provided a more complete count of total LEP student enrollment compared to CCD data. The NCELA data includes LEP student population, while ACS data is collected through a sample survey with native and non-native English speakers. Immigrant student counts are limited, with the latest available data from the 2003-2004 school year. The state-reported immigrant data were taken from a different year than the 2005 ACS data, leading to discrepancies in student counts and estimated state grants. Tables show significant differences in LEP and immigrant student counts between the two datasets, with California reporting almost 500,000 more LEP students than the ACS data. Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, and Utah also reported discrepancies in student counts. Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, and Utah reported significant discrepancies in LEP student counts compared to the 2005 ACS data. On the other hand, Georgia, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania would have lower student counts if state data were used instead. Alaska would see the largest percentage increase in LEP students, while California would have the largest increase in numbers but with a lower percentage increase. West Virginia, Mississippi, Ohio, and Pennsylvania would experience the largest percentage decreases in LEP student enrollment if state data were utilized. In terms of immigrant student counts, Florida would see the largest increase, followed by New York, Illinois, and California. The largest decreases would be in Texas, Maryland, and Michigan. North Dakota would experience the largest percentage increase, while Wyoming would have the greatest decrease. Using state data instead of ACS data to calculate FY2007 grant amounts would result in changes for most states. California's grant amount would increase by $34.2 million (20.2%), while Florida, Utah, and New Mexico would also see substantial increases. Northeast states would generally experience reductions in grant amounts. Using state data instead of ACS data to calculate FY2007 grant amounts would result in changes for most states. Increases would range from $20,000 in South Dakota to $34.2 million in California, with New York experiencing the largest loss of funds. The use of either the ACS or state data for calculating Title III state grants has drawbacks, including issues specific to counting LEP students. The section discusses issues with using ACS data to allocate state grants, highlighting problems with counting LEP students and recent immigrant students. Concerns include data accuracy due to subjective responses and lack of research on how well ACS data represent the LEP student population. Inconsistencies in responses were found during data quality checks by the Census Bureau. The ACS data may not accurately represent the population of LEP students, which could impact the distribution of state grants. State-reported data also have issues, such as missing or incomplete information, and not assessing all LEP students. This could lead to inaccuracies in determining the number of students eligible for grants. The Education Department found inconsistencies in state-reported data on LEP students, with vague instructions leading to varied interpretations. Clarifications were promised for future reports to improve data accuracy. The Education Department found inconsistencies in state-reported data on LEP students, with vague instructions leading to varied interpretations. Clarifications were promised for future reports to improve data accuracy. However, the completeness of these data remains uncertain, as different methodologies are used to identify LEP students, leading to variations in screening methods among states. Some states use classroom observations to identify students for screening, but there are issues with immigrant student counts reported by states. State officials question the reliability of collected data, as schools cannot directly ask students about their immigrant status. Determining recent immigrant status can be complicated without prior school documentation. Over-reporting may occur if grants are based on state-reported data. The use of data, possibly through the CSPRs, may create a perverse incentive for states to over-report the number of LEP and immigrant students to gain additional federal funds. The accuracy of ACS or state data in determining funding allocation for Title III eligible students is still uncertain, as ED has not established criteria for choosing the most accurate data source. Complex analysis will be needed to determine the relative accuracy of these data sources. One option to improve the accuracy of determining state grants for LEP and recent immigrant students is to have the National Academy of Sciences conduct a study on the methodology used for ACS data. This study would also explore alternative indicators and the reliability of the data. Developing a formula based on both ACS data and state-reported data could improve accuracy in determining state grants for LEP and immigrant students. This strategy could involve averaging student counts from each source, requiring comparable data from both. Another option is to average LEP and immigrant student counts from the last two or three years of ACS data to reduce volatility."
