    "content": "The Act is known as the Children and Media Research Advancement Act or the CAMRA Act. Congress recognizes the impact of electronic media on children's development, as evidenced by the Children's Television Act of 1990 and the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Hearings have been held to study the effects of violent media on children's health, necessitating behavioral and social science research for policy decisions. There are gaps in knowledge regarding the impact of electronic media, especially interactive digital media, on children's healthy development. Early screen usage by babies and toddlers and the psychological effects of high definition interactive media on child and adolescent viewers are not well understood. Studies show that children who watch educational TV shows during preschool years are more successful in school later on, regardless of other environmental factors. The early stages of childhood are crucial for development, with various factors like household income, parent's education, and intelligence playing a role. Media exposure is increasingly shaping children's social and physical environments. Research on the impact of sexual messages in the media on children's attitudes and behaviors is limited, despite growing concerns about HIV infection. In 2001, a study group found little research on children's exposure to Internet pornography and its impact on development. Developing a research program to track media habits of young children and families over time is crucial for understanding the effects of media on physical, cognitive, social, and emotional development. The lack of centralized research efforts on the impact of media on children and adolescents hinders valuable findings. Establishing a well-coordinated research program is necessary to provide evidence for implementing electronic media literacy initiatives. The Act aims to enable the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development to study the impact of electronic media on children and adolescents' development and provide Congress with research findings. The Act enables research on the impact of electronic media on children and adolescents' development. The Director of the Institute will collaborate with the National Academy of Science to establish an independent panel of experts to review the impact of electronic media on youth development in cognitive areas such as language development and problem-solving skills. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of media use on children and adolescents in various areas such as cognitive skills, physical development, and socio-behavioral aspects. It also mentions the creation of a research agenda by the National Academy of Sciences panel. The Secretary will conduct initial pilot projects to study the impact of media exposure on cognitive and social development in infancy and childhood, as well as childhood and adolescent obesity. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development will fund additional research on the role of electronic media in children and adolescents after reviewing the panel's findings. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development will fund research on the impact of electronic media on children and adolescents' cognitive, physical, and socio-behavioral development. Eligible entities must submit an application to receive a grant for research activities. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development will fund research on the effects of media on children and adolescents. Entities receiving grants must conduct research on various electronic mass media platforms and submit reports to the Director within 12 months. The panel must submit a report to the Director of the Institute by a certain date. The Director will then prepare a report for Congress summarizing the research findings in a way that is understandable to the general public and placing the evidence in context with other scientific knowledge on the same topics. The panel will discuss the role of media on children and adolescents, make recommendations based on scientific evidence, and authorize appropriations for fiscal years 2006-2010."
