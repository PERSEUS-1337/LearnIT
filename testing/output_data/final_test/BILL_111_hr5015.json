    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds that military operations in Afghanistan have cost over $200 billion in deficit spending since 2001. Given current deficits and proposed budget cuts, future war expenditures should not add to the deficit and must avoid waste, fraud, and abuse. Transparency and accountability standards must be upheld for all operations in Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, one in five soldiers has reported psychological problems. The US needs a comprehensive strategy to counter the global threat posed by al Qaeda and its affiliates in various regions. A massive military presence in Afghanistan may hinder efforts to combat al Qaeda globally. The US should reduce troop levels and transition to a sustainable counterterrorism policy. President Obama announced the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan on December 1, 2009. The United States will begin withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in July 2011, while remaining committed to providing long-term support for the country's economic, diplomatic, and political development. Support will also continue for women's rights, education, and leadership. The 2009 presidential election in Afghanistan was marred by fraud and corruption, with the lack of legitimacy being identified as a major threat by Admiral Michael Mullen. General McChrystal has acknowledged that the lack of legitimacy in the Afghanistan government is a major issue that the United States Armed Forces cannot solve. This lack of legitimacy is exacerbated by partnerships with \"polarizing and predatory\" powerbrokers, including within the Afghan National Security Forces. SEC. 2. PLAN FOR THE SAFE, ORDERLY, AND EXPEDITIOUS REDEPLOYMENT OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES FROM AFGHANISTAN. The President must submit a plan for the redeployment of US Armed Forces from Afghanistan by January 1, 2011, or 90 days after the enactment of the Act. Updates on the plan must be provided every 90 days. Recommendations on contractor oversight are required within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, in consultation with the Inspector General of the Department of Defense and the Inspector General of the Department of State, must issue recommendations to increase oversight of contractors with a history of waste, fraud, or abuse in Afghanistan. They must also report on the status of efforts by the Department of Defense and the Department of State to implement existing oversight recommendations. The United States aims to reduce reliance on security contractors responsible for civilian deaths in Afghanistan and on non-Afghan National Security Forces armed groups."
