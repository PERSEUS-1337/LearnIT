    "content": "The text chunk is about the comprehensive armed forces policy on prevention and response to hazing involving members of the armed forces. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with other military departments, is tasked with developing a uniform definition of hazing for the Armed Forces to be included in the Uniform Code of Military Justice. This definition should encompass any situation where a member of the Armed Forces experiences cruelty, humiliation, harm, harassment, or deprivation of rights by another member. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with other military departments, is required to develop a comprehensive policy on the prevention and response to hazing in the Armed Forces, considering recommendations from various reports and the Comptroller General. The policy on hazing in the Armed Forces must align with a comprehensive definition and include a centralized database for collecting information on hazing incidents involving military members. Homeland Security regulations require a database to record hazing complaints in the Armed Forces, including details like the nature of the hazing, victim and offender information, branch and division involved, and actions taken for resolution. The implementation plan for a database to record hazing complaints in the Armed Forces must be submitted to congressional committees within 90 days of the Act's enactment. Additionally, a report on the database's relation to the defense incident-based reporting system should be submitted within 180 days. The Defense Incident-Based Reporting System status and its relation to the database will be described in a report to be completed within 15 months. An annual congressional report will be developed using the database, with reports due by January 15 each year. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security must submit a report to congressional committees on hazing incidents in the Armed Forces each year. The report includes an assessment of the effectiveness of prevention and response policies, as well as data on the number of hazing incidents by race, gender, and Armed Force. The Comptroller General of the United States is required to submit a report on hazing prevention policies and incident tracking in the Armed Forces, including officer cadet schools and military academies. The report will evaluate the definition of hazing and include details on the race, gender, and Armed Force of victims and offenders, as well as actions taken to address hazing incidents. The report on hazing prevention policies in the Armed Forces will include an evaluation of the definition of hazing, criteria and methods for tracking incidents, assessment of hazing scope, policies, training, actions taken to mitigate incidents, and effectiveness of training and policies. The report will evaluate the number of hazing incidents in the Armed Forces over the last five years, actions taken to address them, proposed additional measures by the Secretary of Defense and Homeland Security, and recommendations for improving hazing prevention programs. The curr_chunk defines the designated congressional committees related to hazing within the Armed Forces."
