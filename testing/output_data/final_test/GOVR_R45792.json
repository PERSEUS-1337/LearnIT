    "content": "Legislators and regulators are concerned about the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs used for \"off-label purposes.\" Recent incidents involving ketamine and Seroquel highlight these concerns. Ketamine is being used off-label to treat depression and migraines without FDA review of clinical data. Astra Zeneca settled a case for promoting Seroquel for unapproved uses. The state of Texas filed a complaint against a company for promoting a drug for off-label use in children, despite FDA approval for adult use. This case is part of a trend of settlements involving off-label promotions by drug companies since 2000. To address concerns about off-label use, Congress is exploring questions about drug labeling, off-label use, risks and benefits, and potential legislative options. FDA approval is required for marketing prescription drugs in the US. To obtain FDA approval, a drug manufacturer must demonstrate safety, effectiveness, and pass FDA inspection for its manufacturing plant. FDA also approves the drug's labeling, specifying its use for a particular disease or condition. Off-label use occurs when a physician prescribes a drug for reasons not specified in FDA approval and labeling. FDA regulates the drug and manufacturer, while states regulate clinicians and pharmacies. Off-label drug use is common in medical practice, with studies showing varying rates of prescriptions for off-label uses. In a 2006 study, 21% of prescriptions were written for off-label uses, with 27% backed by strong scientific support. A 2016 Canadian study found an overall rate of 12% of prescriptions for off-label uses, varying by therapeutic class. Research has shown that over half of oncology drug use is off-label. Research has shown that over half of oncology drug use is off-label, with 56% of compendium-accepted uses being off-label. The history of drug labeling dates back to 1906 when Congress required sellers to disclose alcohol or opium content on labels. Today, drug labeling goes beyond the pharmacy sticker on the vial. The FDA regulations require detailed labeling on drug products for safe and effective use, including black-box warnings. Labeling is crucial for providing safety and effectiveness information to clinicians and is published in references like the Physician's Desk Reference. Off-label prescribing can be based on clinical expertise, cost considerations, or alternative treatment approaches. While it may become accepted practice, the safety and effectiveness of off-label drug use are often unknown without proper clinical trials and analysis. Off-label drug use involves prescribing medications for unapproved uses, such as different doses or patient populations. FDA-approved drugs are often used off-label, supported by clinical evidence or listed in drug compendia for Medicare coverage. Congress grants FDA authority to regulate drug market access to protect public health. The FDA regulates drug market access to protect public health by approving drugs for specific uses based on evidence of safety and effectiveness. FDA-approved labeling helps clinicians and manufacturers, and sponsors receive market protection for new drugs or uses. Payors benefit from this regulatory exclusivity. Off-label use of drugs can benefit patients, especially in rare diseases where approved drugs for other indications are used in clinical practice. Manufacturers may not invest in trials for small patient groups, leading to limited studies on safety and effectiveness. Once off-label uses are established, manufacturers rarely conduct studies to verify their efficacy. Off-label drug use can be beneficial for patients, especially in rare diseases. Funding for studies on safety and effectiveness can be difficult to obtain. A study found more adverse events with off-label prescriptions compared to on-label ones, but off-label use with strong scientific evidence had similar rates of adverse events as on-label uses. The increased risk of adverse events was seen in off-label uses without strong scientific evidence. Manufacturers benefit from off-label sales but risk losing market to competitors with FDA approval. Researchers face challenges in assessing off-label safety and effectiveness due to limited data. Drug companies argue regulations hinder sharing information on off-label uses. FDA held a meeting in 2016 to discuss off-label use concerns. In 2016, FDA held a public meeting on off-label uses of medical products. In June 2018, FDA issued final guidances on medical product communications, including unapproved uses. FDA differentiates audiences for information presentation, focusing on clinical audience in product labeling. FDA requires information to be understandable by individual clinicians lacking statistical skills to evaluate manufacturers' claims. The FDA guidance emphasizes the importance of payors and formulary committees in evaluating manufacturers' claims. It also highlights the potential harm of sharing information about off-label use, as it may undermine government interests related to health and safety. The FDA guidance emphasizes the importance of evaluating manufacturers' claims to prevent harm, protect against fraud, and develop appropriate instructions for medical products. Congress has developed a system to ensure drugs meet safety and effectiveness standards through labeling, which bridges regulated drugs and their clinical use. Congress and the FDA use labeling to reduce risks associated with off-label use. Congress and the FDA have taken various actions to enhance drug labeling, addressing content, directions for use, advertising regulations, research incentives, Medicare coverage criteria, and benefit-risk information. Manufacturers seek flexibility in providing information to decision-making entities. Congress has eased restrictions on promotional activities. In 2016, the FDA allowed drug and device manufacturers to provide health care economic information to payors, with a requirement to disclose any material differences from approved labeling. Congress considered bills to expand manufacturer's ability to provide information on off-label uses, such as H.R. 2026 (115th Congress) which aimed to allow the provision of scientific information to payors. H.R. 2026 aimed to allow the provision of scientific information to payors, with support from Subcommittee Chair Michael Burgess. However, then-Ranking Member Frank Pallone, Jr. expressed concerns about off-label use potentially undermining FDA's approval process. Off-label use presents opportunities and risks to various stakeholders. The 116th Congress may consider actions regarding off-label prescriptions, including disclosure to patients about off-label drug use and requiring prescribers to inform patients about the off-label use. The 116th Congress may consider actions regarding off-label prescriptions, including disclosure to patients about off-label drug use and requiring prescribers to inform patients about the off-label use. Congress lacks adequate information on the scope and details of off-label drug prescribing due to the absence of reasons for medication use noted on prescriptions. This hinders data collection and availability for regulatory purposes. Congress may consider actions regarding off-label prescriptions, including disclosing reasons for medication use on prescriptions to enable focused analysis of off-label uses and establishing confidential registries for monitoring off-label prescribing. Manufacturers could disseminate information about off-label drug use to clinicians and entities influencing prescribing decisions. Congress could allow manufacturers to share information about off-label uses they have developed, subject to limitations and reporting requirements. This could include sharing clinical analyses with coverage decision-makers and at conferences. Oversight is needed due to the high percentage of off-label prescriptions, and Congress could direct the GAO to study the impact of off-label use on various stakeholders. Congress could direct the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to study the extent of off-label use in government-provided and funded care, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to contract with experts to study the costs and rewards of off-label prescriptions, and FDA and the Federal Trade Commission to investigate drugs with high off-label prescription percentages or sales. Pricing differences between drugs like Avastin and Lucentis could introduce new elements for study. The pricing difference between Avastin and Lucentis, both made by the same manufacturer with the same active ingredient, is significant. Many ophthalmologists use the lower priced Avastin for macular degeneration treatment, despite it being an off-label use. Congress could require a study on the relationship between pricing, access, prescribing, and patient safety. Reimbursement decisions by entities like CMS and private insurers influence drug prescriptions. Congress could direct the HHS Secretary to study coverage decisions for off-label drug uses or form a task force with CMS, FDA, insurers, and patient groups to recommend actions. Encouraging payors to require evidence for off-label uses and exploring alternative paths for adding indications to drug labels may help address the widespread off-label use issue. The widespread off-label use of drugs suggests the current model is not effective. Congress could assign responsibility and funding to NIH and PCORI for safety evaluations or require manufacturers to fund studies for off-label uses. The FDA regulations emphasize research transparency. Congress could consider requiring or encouraging prospective posting of the designs and statistical plans of studies of off-label uses, as well as public reporting of studies of off-label use to improve research transparency and clinical guidance. Professional societies and clinical groups can issue guidelines and recommend best practices to supplement information available to prescribers. The United States and other countries are addressing the implications of off-label use through measures like reimbursement guidance and professional standards. Congress could review actions taken by the European Union and other regulatory bodies to recommend legislative or administrative actions. Concerns over off-label use intersect with issues like direct-to-consumer advertising and promotion to clinicians. Off-label use impacts FDA regulation of drugs, affecting research, innovation, transparency, patents, pricing, and access. Changes in laws can have benefits and drawbacks. FDA's initiative for legacy drugs aims to ensure safety and effectiveness, enabling sponsors to conduct trials, obtain regulatory exclusivity, and raise prices for new branded products. The FDA approved a new drug, Makena, for preventing preterm delivery at a price of $30,000 for a 20-week course, significantly higher than the previous cost. Another example is Daraprim, an old antiparasitic drug whose price was raised from $14 to $750 per tablet, creating barriers to patient access and threatening health. Actions to limit off-label prescribing could reduce safety risks and economic costs but may hinder clinical exploration. Incentives for clinical trials to add indications to drug labels could help disseminate information but may also impact generic drug availability and increase costs for patients. Discussions on proposed restrictions may mirror debates on the right-to-try movement for terminally ill patients. The Goldwater Institute supports off-label drug use and aims to reduce government intervention in individual choices. Concerns arise over the lack of scientific evidence for a third of off-label prescriptions. Policy debates center on balancing individual freedom with public safety in drug use. Regulators and legislators continue to grapple with where to draw the line on off-label drug use."
