    "content": "Several bills in the 111th Congress would require new automobile manufacturers formed after bankruptcy with U.S. government assistance to take on obligations from agreements with auto dealers. Chrysler Group LLC and General Motors Company, formed with federal aid, purchased assets from bankrupt automakers Chrysler LLC and General Motors Corporation. Old Chrysler and Old GM, now referred to by new names, are still in bankruptcy despite media reports suggesting otherwise. Both companies rejected contracts with some dealers as part of their bankruptcy proceedings. Prior to filing for bankruptcy, Old GM informed a third of its dealers that their contracts would not be renewed in 2010. Dealers were offered wind-down agreements to prevent contract rejection under section 363 in case of bankruptcy. In December 2008, auto manufacturers had to submit viability plans by February 2009, which were rejected in March 2009 by the Auto Task Force. The rejection included the acceleration of steps like dealership closures, approved by bankruptcy courts for GM and Chrysler. New Chrysler and New GM did not assume contracts of rejected dealers but did assume wind-down agreements. Reduction of dealerships is seen as necessary for the new manufacturers' viability, despite dealer objections. Some rejected Chrysler and GM dealers question the necessity of dealership network reductions for New Chrysler and New GM's success. Concerns include short wind-down timeframes, objections to contractual terms, and Congress responding with hearings and legislative proposals. Bills like H.R. 2743 and S. 1304 aim to renew obligations from Old Chrysler and Old GM to their dealers, assigning them to the new manufacturers. Another bill, H.R. 2796, has similar requirements without specifying the auto manufacturers. The bills H.R. 2796 and an amendment to H.R. 3170 address concerns regarding auto manufacturers with federal government interests, potentially not applying to New Chrysler or New GM. Constitutional concerns raised by these bills will be discussed. The bills H.R. 2796 and an amendment to H.R. 3170 raise constitutional concerns regarding auto manufacturers with federal government interests, specifically related to the Bankruptcy Clause, substantive due process, Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause, and breach of implied contract. Congress's power to enact bankruptcy laws is derived from Article I, \u00a7 8, clause 4 of the U.S. Constitution. The Supreme Court found a law violated the uniformity requirement of the Bankruptcy Clause in Railway Labor Executives' Association v. Gibbons. The case involved a legislative response to a pending bankruptcy case involving the Rock Island and Pacific Railroad Company. The bankruptcy court determined that a statutory requirement for \"a fair arrangement\" was not necessary in cases of total, systemwide abandonment of a railroad. Three days before the court's order prohibiting payment from the debtor's assets, Congress enacted the Rock Island Railroad Transition and Employee Assistance Act (RITA), requiring up to $75 million in benefits for Rock Island employees. The U.S. Supreme Court later ruled that the labor provisions of RITA, amended by the Staggers Act of 1980, violated the Bankruptcy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the labor provisions of RITA, amended by the Staggers Act of 1980, violated the Bankruptcy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, as Congress's power under the Bankruptcy Clause involves adjusting a failing debtor's obligations and distributing their property among creditors. The Court emphasized the need for uniformity in such exercises of Congress's bankruptcy power. The U.S. Supreme Court found that RITA's labor provisions, amended by the Staggers Act of 1980, violated the Bankruptcy Clause of the U.S. Constitution due to lack of uniformity in addressing the bankruptcy of a specific railroad, rather than a broader class of debtors. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that RITA's labor provisions, amended by the Staggers Act of 1980, violated the Bankruptcy Clause by prioritizing employees' claims over other unsecured creditors. Justice Marshall disagreed with the Court's rationale, questioning the need for uniformity in laws affecting multiple debtors. He argued that Congress can enact specific laws for individual debtors if it serves a national interest. In Gibbons, Justice Marshall concluded that Congress had not justified enacting provisions applicable to only one named debtor, Old Chrysler and Old GM. The legislative history showed the law was designed to protect employees from bankruptcy effects. Current legislative proposals are in response to concerns of dealers losing their livelihoods due to actions of Old Chrysler and Old GM. The losses incurred by dealers due to actions of Old Chrysler and Old GM are challenging, as state laws protecting dealers were not applicable in bankruptcy. Bankruptcy law allowed for easy termination of dealership agreements, preempting state franchise laws. The bankruptcy court's approval is required for rejection of executory contracts, with a low burden of business judgment. New corporate entities not in bankruptcy may be regulated under different constitutional authority, such as Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce. If legislation governs debtor-creditor relationships and debt adjustment, Bankruptcy Clause analysis may apply. If legislation governs debtor-creditor relationships and debt adjustment, Bankruptcy Clause analysis may apply. Factors suggesting that the proposals are bankruptcy laws include termination of agreements during bankruptcies, dealers as unsecured creditors, assets sold in bankruptcy proceedings, and formation of new entities due to bankruptcies. This legislation could be seen as benefiting specific creditors in a bankruptcy case, raising questions about uniformity requirements. There is little relevant case law to predict how a court might resolve this issue. The proposed legislation raises concerns about uniformity in bankruptcy cases, particularly regarding the obligations of Old GM and Old Chrysler towards dealers. H.R. 2743 and S. 1304 aim to protect dealers' economic rights during bankruptcy proceedings involving these companies. The bills H.R. 2796 and H.R. 3170 aim to restore economic rights to automobile dealerships affected by the bankruptcies of Old Chrysler and Old GM, ensuring that their contracts are honored as they existed before the bankruptcy filings. The bills aim to restore rights to Old GM dealerships that entered into \"wind-down\" agreements after June 1, 2009, reversing the effects of court-approved rejections of dealership agreements in bankruptcy. This could impact asset distribution to creditors. The bills aim to restore rights to Old GM dealerships that entered into \"wind-down\" agreements after June 1, 2009, reversing court-approved rejections of dealership agreements in bankruptcy. This could affect the distribution of assets from debtors to other creditors. The provisions of the bills may be subject to scrutiny for meeting the uniformity requirements of the Bankruptcy Clause, particularly sections introduced by Congressman LaTourette regarding automobile manufacturers with federal government interests. The provisions in the bills aim to restore rights to Old GM dealerships that entered into \"wind-down\" agreements after June 1, 2009, potentially affecting asset distribution in bankruptcy. The sections introduced by Congressman LaTourette regarding automobile manufacturers with federal government interests may face scrutiny for meeting the uniformity requirements of the Bankruptcy Clause. The language of the provisions is prospective and may not necessarily apply to Old Chrysler and Old GM. The language of the provisions is prospective and may not necessarily apply to Old Chrysler and Old GM. However, other automakers with federal government interests could be affected if they enter bankruptcy. The provisions could benefit one class of claimants by allowing them to extend their franchise agreements to a new entity that purchased the assets of the debtor. The provisions could benefit claimants by allowing them to transfer franchise agreements to a new entity, potentially affecting the value available to claimants from the bankruptcy estate. This could lead to a situation where Old Chrysler and Old GM may not be able to honor the terms of the agreements, resulting in post-petition claims for breach by dealerships. The dealerships may assert post-petition claims for breach, potentially as administrative expenses, altering the relationship among claimants. Congress responding to specific bankruptcies with multiple debtors raises uncertainty on whether it meets the uniformity requirement. Unlike previous cases, the bills in question involve only two debtors currently in bankruptcy. The two debtors named in the bills are the only automakers in bankruptcy. The Railroad Reorganization Act of 1973 operated uniformly, focusing on railroad reorganizations in the Northeast. The bills may face legal challenges in court regarding the uniformity requirement of the Bankruptcy Clause. Comparisons to previous cases suggest potential legal issues if the bills are enacted. The national interest must justify Congress' failure to apply bankruptcy laws uniformly to all debtors, such as in the case of automakers in bankruptcy. The bill aims to protect Federal Government assets and ensure the viability of automobile manufacturers with government ownership or loans. Justice Marshall's opinion on uniformity in bankruptcy law is not precedential, and it remains unclear if national interest can establish uniformity in such cases. The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment requires just compensation when property is \"taken\" by the United States. The question arises whether bills requiring automakers in bankruptcy to accept or initiate dealer agreements cause a \"taking\" of property interests. No takings issue arises with voluntary actions by firms. At least three types of property interests may be involved in this context. The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment requires just compensation when property is \"taken\" by the United States. Bills requiring automakers in bankruptcy to accept or initiate dealer agreements may involve property interests recognized for Takings Clause purposes. These interests could be the basis for takings claims, including money paid for costs related to dealership contracts, assets of post-bankruptcy firms, and equity and creditor interests in such firms. The forced divestment of money may not be deemed a taking according to Supreme Court justices and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment requires just compensation when property is \"taken\" by the United States. Bills requiring automakers in bankruptcy to accept or initiate dealer agreements may involve property interests recognized for Takings Clause purposes. These interests could be the basis for takings claims, including money paid for costs related to dealership contracts, assets of post-bankruptcy firms, and equity and creditor interests in such firms. The forced divestment of money may not be deemed a taking according to Supreme Court justices and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Moreover, any costs to new manufacturing companies resulting from forced contracts would be considered \"consequential damages,\" not covered under the Takings Clause. Regulatory taking claims could be based on the diminished value of the reformed company's assets if it cannot function profitably under unwanted dealer agreements. The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment requires just compensation for property \"taken\" by the United States. Claims related to unwanted dealer agreements in bankruptcy may involve property interests recognized for Takings Clause purposes, such as costs related to dealership contracts, assets of post-bankruptcy firms, and equity and creditor interests. The economic impact threshold for such claims is high, and any non-profitability from these agreements could erode the value of corporate stock or creditor rights over time. Claims could be brought by individual stockholders or creditors, similar to a past case involving a rail transportation crisis and reorganization. The sole stockholder of Penn Central, the largest railroad in reorganization, sued for an \"erosion taking\" due to congressional legislation inhibiting the abandonment of unprofitable rail lines. The Supreme Court hinted at recognizing this claim's viability, but it would need to meet a high economic-impact threshold. A similar claim by owners or creditors of reformed auto manufacturers would likely face similar challenges. The Supreme Court considered a takings challenge based on congressional legislation inhibiting the abandonment of unprofitable rail lines, suggesting that the \"character of the government action\" factor may weigh in favor of a taking. However, a facial takings claim based solely on the terms of the bills without considering the circumstances of the plaintiff is deemed an uphill battle. The court may find a taking if forced reinstatement of dealer agreements benefits the government, but the ad hoc nature of analysis makes generalization difficult. Substantive due process concerns government measures that violate fundamental traditions, with varying standards set by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court applies varying standards of judicial review based on the context, with a low standard for economic government actions. Economic legislation is rarely found to violate substantive due process since the 1930s. Deference is given to economic legislation, even when applied retroactively. The Supreme Court defers to economic legislation, especially when applied retroactively, as long as there is a legitimate legislative purpose. However, coercing New Chrysler and New GM into contracts with specified terms and parties is unprecedented and raises concerns about substantive due process. The possibility that forced contracts with specified terms and parties might violate substantive due process, as seen in United States v. Winstar, raises concerns about the application of such legislation to New GM and New Chrysler. In 1983, the FSLIC sought buyers for failing savings and loan institutions. Private investors formed Winstar Corporation to acquire Windom Federal Savings and Loan Association. The merger plan included capital contributions and recognition of supervisory goodwill. Despite approval from the Bank Board, the FIRREA in 1989 restricted thrifts' use of supervisory goodwill. The United States Claims Court found that FIRREA constituted a breach of the agreement between Winstar, the Bank Board, and the FSLIC. The Court rejected the government's invocation of the sovereign acts doctrine, holding that the government could be held liable for damages based on breach of contract. The Supreme Court also found the federal government responsible for damages but could not agree on the reasoning behind the decision. The Supreme Court found the government responsible for damages based on breach of contract. Justice Souter concluded that the government had contracted to allow thrifts to use supervisory goodwill for capital requirements. The unmistakability doctrine was deemed inapplicable, and the sovereign acts doctrine was rejected. Justice Souter held that the government's actions did not incidentally impair contract performance. The Supreme Court held that the government's actions impacting contract performance made the sovereign acts defense unavailable. Justice Scalia disagreed on the application of the unmistakability doctrine, stating it is a presumption that can be overcome if the government promises not to interfere with the contract. The Supreme Court ruled that the government's actions affecting contract performance eliminated the sovereign acts defense. Justice Scalia argued against the unmistakability doctrine, suggesting it can be overcome if the government commits not to intervene in the contract. The application of Winstar to the New GM and New Chrysler is uncertain due to the lack of a specific agreement regarding government requirements on terminated dealer contracts. The federal government encouraged Old GM and Old Chrysler to reduce the number of dealerships as a condition for receiving assistance. Approval of asset sales in bankruptcy included federal money infusion into New Chrysler and New GM, with expectations to avoid statutory and contractual obligations. The Assistance Agreement in Winstar explicitly conditions the purchase of assets by New GM or Chrysler on forbearance from the United States to reinstitute dealer agreements. Without explicit contractual relations, a challenge to the proposals may rely on the theory of an implied contract between the United States and the new corporate entities, which could be a more challenging burden than if explicit promises were made. The proposal's potential contract breach would depend on the evaluation of specific facts, including whether the treatment of New GM and New Chrysler constituted a contract with the government. The question of burden of losses and obligations under the terminated dealership agreements would also need to be addressed. Justice Scalia's analysis questions if the legislative proposals would nullify the contract's subject matter. The legislative proposals could breach contracts with the government, potentially making the federal government liable for damages resulting from dealer agreements with New GM and New Chrysler before bankruptcy."
