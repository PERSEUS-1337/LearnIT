Numerous bipartisan commissions and study groups have called for dialogue and engagement with Iran to achieve US strategic interests in the Middle East. Implementing strategies to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons is crucial. Establishing diplomatic dialogue with Iran and deepening relationships with the Iranian people would enhance stability and security in the Persian Gulf region by reducing the threat of nuclear weapons proliferation. The Iraq Study Group Report emphasizes the mutual interest in preventing chaos in the region, urging the US to engage in diplomatic dialogue with Iran. The Government of Iran's nuclear program is dispersed throughout the country, making military action difficult and ineffective. Eliminating Iran's nuclear capacity could backfire by increasing their desire for a nuclear deterrent and fueling nationalist sentiments. This would lead to drastic immediate consequences, loss of life, and long-term instability, contrary to US interests in the region. The ongoing efforts of the IAEA and UN sanctions offer a path to steer Iran's nuclear program peacefully, with US leadership. Iran is a decade away from acquiring nuclear weapon capabilities, according to US intelligence reports. Iran is at least three years away from developing a nuclear weapon, assuming no setbacks during development. Congress believes that full relations with Iran require safeguards against nuclear weaponization and an end to support for terrorist groups, without being preconditions for dialogue. Previous military force authorizations do not apply to Iran or its nuclear program. The United States policy is not to engage in preemptive war against Iran without an imminent threat and in accordance with international and domestic laws. No funds can be used for covert actions or military operations against Iran without congressional authorization and in compliance with legal requirements."
