    "content": "Since 1790, Congress has shown interest in promoting manufacturing independence, following President George Washington's remarks. Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton proposed measures like import duties and patents to strengthen the sector. Congress adopted high import tariffs and patent protection, shaping the manufacturing landscape in the early days of the country. In the early days of the country, Secretary of the Treasury Tench Coxe provided nationwide statistics on manufacturing in 1810, estimating the value of goods produced at $127.7 million. He believed the actual value could be $172.8 million with omitted goods included. Coxe also noted $25.9 million of goods of questionable manufacturing nature, like pot ashes used for soap and glass production. Manufacturing processes have evolved over time, but the challenges remain. The scale of manufacturing has changed over the centuries, making it difficult to determine the domestic content of goods. Special government attention to domestic manufacturing is justified for reasons such as employment, national security, and productivity growth. Manufacturing is a key source of economic growth and productivity. The manufacturing sector is crucial for economic growth and productivity. It involves the transformation of materials into new products and includes activities like research, design, marketing, and logistics that contribute to value creation and employment. The manufacturing sector involves services like research, design, marketing, logistics, and software development. Nonphysical inputs can be produced in-house or purchased from other firms. Case studies help understand the supply chains for final goods. For example, Nokia's N95 mobile phone had final assembly costs of only 2% of the sales price, with the value of physical inputs being less than intellectual property and in-house services. The value of embedded software is a significant and growing part of many manufactured products, such as pacemakers, washing machines, cars, and airplanes. Semiconductor manufacturers are shifting focus from hardware to software in their products. Premium class cars now run on 100 million lines of software code, indicating a substantial portion of their value is created by software. The value of software code in manufactured products is increasing, with a significant portion of a car's value being attributed to coders. A study predicts that software providers will profit more as autonomous vehicles become more prevalent. The OECD estimates that services in the US manufacturing sector contributed one-third of the total value added in 2011, with varying shares among industries. The difficulty of defining manufacturing activity and identifying manufacturing work has direct implications for efforts to encourage manufacturing in the United States as a matter of U.S. government policy. The national identity of manufactured products has been a matter of congressional concern since at least the 1930s, with regulations requiring imported goods to be marked with the country of origin. In regulations, U.S. Customs and Border Protection defines a good's \"country of origin\" as the country of manufacture, production, or growth. If a substantial transformation occurs in another country, that country may be considered the country of origin. CBP applies tests to determine the country of origin, with the last country of production being the default. The Tariff Act assumes each product has a single country of origin, and the determination of whether a product is American-made is binary. The determination of whether a product is American-made is binary; it is either made in the United States or imported. This poses challenges with global value chains used by manufacturers to combine components from multiple countries into a single product. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has authority over claims that products are U.S.-made since 1987, focusing on where the product is put together or completed. The FTC enforces rules on products claimed to be made in the United States, requiring them to be \"all or virtually all made in the United States.\" The determination considers the percentage of total manufacturing costs attributable to U.S. costs.

President Trump's executive order directs agencies to maximize the use of materials produced in the U.S., specifically iron and steel products with all manufacturing processes occurring in the U.S. The Buy American Act of 1933 requires federal agencies to procure only manufactured articles, materials, and supplies made in the United States, with specific provisions on physical transformation locations. President Trump's memorandum directs the use of U.S.-produced materials in new pipelines and repairs, excluding foreign-made steel and iron products. The Buy American Act requires federal agencies to purchase only items made in the U.S., with exceptions. Courts define manufacturing as involving physical changes, excluding testing and packaging. Service inputs are not covered by the law. Products can be considered U.S.-made even if design and engineering work was done outside the country. The Buy American Act requires federal agencies to purchase only U.S.-made items, with exceptions. The executive order established a more restrictive standard for iron and steel products, requiring all manufacturing processes to occur in the United States for compliance. This change affects how steel products are deemed U.S.-made under the Buy American Act. The Buy American Act requires federal agencies to purchase U.S.-made items, with exceptions. A more restrictive standard for iron and steel products, requiring all manufacturing processes to occur in the United States, has been established. This affects how steel products are considered U.S.-made under the Buy American Act, particularly in federally funded transportation projects. The Buy America requirements mandate that iron and steel used in manufacturing must be melted and poured in the United States. Waivers can be granted in certain situations, but the goal is to maximize the use of goods produced in the U.S. Different agencies enforce varying provisions, such as the Federal Highway Administration not requiring U.S.-made products for highways and bridges except for those made of iron and steel. The Federal Transit Administration generally requires that all manufactured end products for public transportation projects be produced in the U.S., with a minimum of 60% domestic components for transit vehicles to be compliant. The Buy America requirements mandate that for vehicles to be considered compliant, over 60% of components must be of domestic origin, and final assembly must be in the United States. FTA grants waivers for certain products like microprocessors, computers, and software. The value of U.S. services in a product is not considered in determining if it is manufactured in the U.S. The Berry Amendment and other laws require the Department of Defense (DOD) to procure U.S.-made products, including food, clothing, tents, fiber products, and specialty metals for aircraft, missiles, ships, tanks, and weapons. Exceptions apply to these procurement restrictions. Since FY1996, defense appropriations acts have limited DOD to buying ball and roller bearings from domestic sources. DOD uses a two-part test to determine if a product is domestic: it must be manufactured in the US, and at least 50% of components must come from the US or qualifying countries. However, regulations do not always consider important sources of value, such as intellectual property for products like supercomputers. The Jones Act requires all waterborne shipping within the US to be carried by US-built vessels. Coast Guard regulations define US-built as having major components fabricated and assembled in the US. The Tariff Act prohibits imports that harm US industries. The US International Trade Commission investigates imports benefiting from foreign subsidies. The US International Trade Commission investigates imports that may cause material injury to a US industry, potentially leading to higher duties if unfair trading practices are found. The Tariff Act limits the ITC's ability to consider the impact of imports on domestic producers of similar products. The Tariff Act severely limits the ITC's ability to consider the impact of imports on domestic producers. Labor productivity in the manufacturing sector has been growing rapidly, leading to fewer employees needed for production. Despite a 7% increase in production workers since 2010, economists predict a decline in production employment. Economists predict a decline in production employment due to new production methods and automation in manufacturing. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects employment declines in manufacturing production occupations, with similar trends in other countries. Nonphysical inputs into manufactured goods are expected to grow, impacting the share of employment related to production. Collaboration among workers is common in the design process of products. The design process of a product involves collaboration among workers in multiple countries, with firms not always tracking the work share in each location. Encouraging domestic production may have motivations beyond employment and value added, such as national security concerns. Policymakers face challenges in designing effective government policies to maximize domestic employment and value added, as the location of physical transformation becomes less important over time. Encouraging domestic production may have motivations beyond employment and value added, such as national security concerns. Domestic content requirements can raise the cost of goods procured under federally funded contracts, reducing procurement volume and potentially affecting employment in nonmanufacturing industries."
