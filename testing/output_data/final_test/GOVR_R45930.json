    "content": "Many Members of Congress are interested in U.N. peacekeeping operations in Africa, which are crucial for U.S. policy towards the continent. The United States, as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, plays a key role in funding these operations. This report provides an overview of active U.N. peacekeeping missions in Africa, their mandates, budgets, challenges, and U.S. policy towards each mission. The U.N. Support Office in Somalia (UNSOS) supports the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM). The United Nations conducts 14 peacekeeping operations worldwide, with seven in Africa. The United Nations conducts 14 peacekeeping operations worldwide, with seven in Africa, including MINUSCA, MINUSMA, UNISFA, UNMISS, MONUSCO, UNAMID, and MINURSO. These operations represent the evolution of U.N. peacekeeping since its inception in 1948. The United Nations conducts 14 peacekeeping operations worldwide, with seven in Africa, including MINUSCA, MINUSMA, UNISFA, UNMISS, MONUSCO, UNAMID, and MINURSO. These operations represent the evolution of U.N. peacekeeping since its establishment in the Middle East in 1948. U.N. peacekeeping has shifted towards operations in complex and insecure environments where there may be no peace to keep, requiring peacekeepers to protect civilians, extend state authority, disarm rebel groups, work with humanitarian actors, restore the rule of law, and monitor human rights. Security Council members vote to adopt resolutions establishing and renewing peacekeeping missions, specifying mandates, timeframes, troop ceilings, and funding levels. The United Nations authorizes troop ceilings and funding levels for peacekeeping missions, with the U.N. General Assembly creating special accounts funded by member states. The latest U.S. peacekeeping assessment is 27.89%, with other top contributors including China, Japan, Germany, and France. The approved U.N. budget for the 2019/2020 peacekeeping fiscal year is $6.51 billion, with nearly 75% designated for missions in Africa. Peacekeepers are provided voluntarily by U.N. members. Some experts and observers have expressed concern about funding shortages for U.N. peacekeeping operations, especially in Africa, and their impact on effectiveness. U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres highlighted cash constraints in peacekeeping missions due to member state payment patterns, arrears, and budget methodologies. These issues have led to cash shortages and delays. Some cash shortages and delays in reimbursements to troop contributing countries have impacted U.N. peacekeeping operations. Secretary-General Guterres proposed reforms to address these issues, with the effectiveness of these efforts still uncertain. Congress authorizes U.S. contributions to peacekeeping, with ongoing interest from some Members in oversight and legislation. Some Members have shown ongoing interest in ensuring efficient use of U.S. funding for U.N. peacekeeping operations. Congress has debated the level and impact of funding, setting a 25% cap in 1995 to address high assessments. Shortfalls in funding have been covered by raising the cap temporarily through appropriations measures. The United States has accumulated over $700 million in cap-related arrears for U.N. peacekeeping missions since FY2017. The Trump Administration has allowed for the application of peacekeeping credits up to a 25% cap, but has not raised the cap since FY2016. Congress has debated funding levels for U.N. peacekeeping operations, setting a 25% cap in 1995 to address high assessments. The United States has voted for the renewal and funding of existing U.N. peacekeeping operations, while also being critical of overall and Africa-specific U.N. peacekeeping activities. The Administration's FY2020 budget proposed a 27% reduction in funding for U.N. peacekeeping operations, emphasizing the need for missions to be more efficient and effective. The State Department's Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI) provides funding for African troop and police contributors through training and equipment on a voluntary basis. The State Department's Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI) provides funding for African troop and police contributors through training and equipment. U.S. support for U.N. peacekeeping operations in Africa has fluctuated over time, with backing for new operations in the Central African Republic and Mali during the Obama Administration. France, a fellow permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, has urged the U.S. to support these operations. During the Trump Administration, there have been no formal proposals for new U.N.-conducted operations in Africa. Policy debates continue on U.N. peacekeeping in Africa, particularly on fulfilling mandates for civilian protection in missions like MONUSCO and MINUSCA. The U.N. peacekeeping missions in Africa face challenges in civilian protection due to ongoing conflicts and logistical issues. Some experts question the effectiveness of these operations in preventing mass atrocities. U.S. support for MINUSCA was aimed at preventing further atrocities in CAR, but achieving this goal has been difficult. In Mali, militias have carried out civilian massacres in areas not previously under MINUSMA's mandate. The role of U.N. peacekeeping operations in Africa involves navigating challenges in working with host governments, balancing the pursuit of positive relations with maintaining neutrality. Missions in countries like CAR, DRC, and Mali aim to support state authority while also facilitating peace talks between governments and rebel groups, despite facing obstructions and threats from government forces in Sudan and South Sudan. Some policymakers question the role of U.N. peacekeeping operations in addressing transnational terrorism in Africa, particularly in Mali. Despite calls for MINUSMA to conduct counterterrorism operations, the Security Council has not mandated it. Concerns also exist regarding sexual exploitation and abuse by U.N. peacekeepers, which has drawn interest from members of Congress. Members of Congress are concerned about sexual abuse and exploitation by U.N. peacekeepers, especially in MONUSCO and MINUSCA. Congress has enacted provisions to address the issue, such as prohibiting U.N. peacekeeping funding unless effective prevention policies are in place. There is debate over the reliance on African countries for military personnel in U.N. peacekeeping operations in Africa. African troop contributors to U.N. peacekeeping operations in Africa often have capacity shortfalls and poor adherence to human rights standards. Examples include abuse of minors by peacekeepers from Republic of Congo and DRC in CAR, and repatriation of Burundi's police contingent due to abuses. Top troop contributors in Mali, the deadliest environment for peacekeepers, include Burkina Faso, Chad, Senegal, and Togo. Some countries may use their contributions to deflect international criticism of their domestic political conditions. African-led regional stabilization operations face challenges in funding and sustainability, with African organizations often unable to finance interventions. AMISOM in Somalia is the only African-led mission supported by U.N. funding. Donor governments may be hesitant to provide long-term funding for such operations. The U.N. and AU have proposed using assessed contributions to fund regional missions, but the U.S. has preferred voluntary funding. The AU has sought U.N. assessed contributions for its operations. U.N. peacekeeping operations in Africa are discussed in reverse chronological order, starting with MINUSCA in CAR established in 2014 in response to a crisis. The crisis in CAR began in 2013 with a rebel coalition seizing control, leading to ethnic cleansing. MINUSCA was established in 2014 to address the conflict, with rebel groups still controlling most of the countryside. A peace accord signed in 2019 aims to bring stability, while MINUSCA's mandate includes protecting civilians and supporting the peace process. MINUSCA's mandate includes assisting the peace process, protecting humanitarian aid delivery, and maintaining law and order through temporary measures. The mission has used its authority to detain militia leaders, impacting local security dynamics. Despite some improvements, challenges such as limited domestic security force capacity hinder stabilization efforts. MINUSCA's military operations and civilian-led peacebuilding support have contributed to security gains in parts of the country, but the mission is not authorized to eliminate armed groups. U.N. sanctions monitors criticized a joint operation in 2018. In 2018, U.N. sanctions monitors criticized a failed joint operation by MINUSCA and local security forces in the \"PK5\" enclave of Bangui, leading to intercommunal tensions and deadly clashes. MINUSCA faces operational capacity shortfalls due to various issues, including force protection challenges with 35 personnel killed in \"malicious acts.\" Continued violence has fueled local frustrations with MINUSCA's perceived ineffectiveness. MINUSCA's perceived ineffectiveness and a sexual abuse scandal have led to hostility towards the organization. Demonstrators protested alleged killings of civilians in a troubled joint operation in the PK5 enclave. The Obama Administration initially supported MINUSCA to prevent mass atrocities in CAR, and the Trump Administration has maintained support, backing a troop ceiling increase in 2017. The State Department's FY2020 budget request projects the role and size of MINUSCA will likely continue. The State Department's FY2020 budget request projects that MINUSCA's role and size will likely remain unchanged until the government can fully protect civilians and prevent violence in Mali. MINUSMA was established by the Security Council in 2013 after state institutions collapsed due to various conflicts in the country. France intervened militarily to free northern towns from Islamist control, leading to the transition to a U.N.-conducted operation. MINUSMA was mandated to support Mali's transitional authorities in stabilizing key population centers, extending state authority, preparing for elections, protecting civilians and U.N. personnel, promoting human rights, and supporting humanitarian aid. The mission prioritized civilian protection and the implementation of a peace accord between the government and northern armed groups. However, as of mid-2019, the peace agreement remains largely unimplemented, while the Islamist insurgency has expanded into previously government-controlled areas. Since 2017, civilian massacres in central Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger have raised alarm, attributed to state security forces and ethnically based militias. MINUSMA's mandate includes protecting civilians, reducing intercommunal violence, and reestablishing state authority in Mali. Western contingents from Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden are part of the mission. MINUSMA, the deadliest U.N. peacekeeping operation, has seen 126 personnel killed in \"malicious acts,\" with African contingents bearing the majority of fatalities. In 2013, debates centered on authorizing the mission in the face of threats from terrorist organizations. Countries like Burkina Faso, Chad, Senegal, Togo, Bangladesh, and Egypt contribute significant troop numbers to MINUSMA. MINUSMA was not explicitly mandated for counterterrorism operations. France maintains troops in Mali to target terrorist cells, with U.S. logistical support. African leaders, supported by France, call for U.N. funding for the G5 Sahel joint force. U.N. Secretary-General proposes a support office for the G5 Sahel force. Successive U.S. Administrations have been involved in these efforts. UNISFA was authorized by the U.N. Security Council in 2011 to provide logistics and sustainment to a G5 Sahel force. The mission's mandate initially focused on Abyei, a contested border territory between Sudan and South Sudan. It was later expanded to support broader border security arrangements between the two countries, including the establishment of a Joint Border Verification and Monitoring Mechanism. The signatories agreed to establish UNISFA to monitor the Sudan-South Sudan border, defusing tensions in Abyei. The final status of Abyei remains unresolved, pending negotiations between Sudan and South Sudan. The political transition in Sudan may impact the situation in Abyei. UNISFA's troop presence was reduced to 2,965 by October 2019. UNISFA's policing function has been limited by Sudan's visa issuance for police personnel. The force, mostly Ethiopian, was established in 2011 to demilitarize Abyei. There have been 36 fatalities, with recent attacks causing concerns. The U.N. Security Council has urged for a temporary local administration in Abyei. The absence of this, along with armed elements, leads to humanitarian needs. UNISFA helps maintain law and order in Abyei, reduces intercommunal conflict, confiscates weapons, and facilitates mine clearance. However, its human rights monitoring mandate remains unoperational due to visa issues. Sudanese restrictions and funding shortfalls limit its humanitarian aid efforts. Sudan and South Sudan have made limited progress in establishing border security through the JBVMM. The United States has historically prioritized peace between Sudan and South Sudan, with recent progress reflecting warming relations. In mid-2011, the Obama Administration condemned Sudan's military control of Abyei, leading to the deployment of UNISFA as a deterrent to conflict. While relations have improved, instability in South Sudan and Sudan's Southern Kordofan state pose risks, and Sudan's political transition adds uncertainty. UNMISS, the U.N.'s second largest peacekeeping mission, was established in 2011 to consolidate peace and security in South Sudan after decades of war. However, the outbreak of internal conflict in 2013 fundamentally changed the mission's focus and relationship with the region. The internal conflict in December 2013 changed UNMISS's mission and its relationship with the host government. The war, now in its sixth year, has displaced over 4 million people and resulted in over 380,000 deaths. The UN Security Council expanded the mission to 7,000 troops and 900 police. The mandate was modified to focus on strict impartiality, protecting civilians, monitoring human rights abuses, and facilitating aid. The Security Council increased UNMISS's force size and added tasks to support the peace agreement after the warring sides signed a deal in August 2015. A new Transitional Government of National Unity was formed in April 2016 but collapsed in July 2016, leading to the resumption of war. To create safe conditions for the opposition to return to the capital and revive the peace deal, the Security Council authorized an increase in UNMISS's troop ceiling, including a Regional Protection Force with up to 4,000 troops from East African countries. The RPF's tasks included providing security in and around Juba. The conflict in South Sudan led to tens of thousands of civilians seeking shelter at UNMISS bases, including Protection of Civilian sites. Living conditions at these sites do not meet refugee camp standards, and UNMISS struggles to protect civilians within and around the bases, limiting its ability to protect civilians and humanitarian workers elsewhere. Despite facing access restrictions and bureaucratic obstruction, UNMISS has played a crucial role in protecting thousands of civilians in South Sudan. The mission's relations with the government have been tense, with instances of anti-U.N. sentiment and attacks on U.N. bases resulting in casualties among civilians and staff. So far, 14 peacekeepers have been killed in malicious acts, and two U.N. helicopters have been shot down, one by the army. The role of government forces in violence against civilians complicates UNMISS's civilian protection mandate. South Sudan's warring factions signed a peace deal in 2018, but its implementation is behind schedule. The ceasefire has reduced fighting in most areas, but clashes continue in some regions. The UN reports ongoing conflict-related sexual violence and targeted attacks on civilians in South Sudan despite a peace deal signed in 2018. International pressure, including from the United States, is seen as crucial to prevent a return to full-scale war. UNAMID, established in 2007 with a larger force than its predecessor AMIS, has a Chapter VII mandate for peacekeeping efforts. UNAMID, established in 2007 with a Chapter VII mandate, is a hybrid peacekeeping operation in Sudan with a U.N. chain of command. It faced challenges due to government obstruction and has been criticized as a mission set up to fail. Observers have questioned UNAMID's credibility due to allegations of self-censorship on state-backed crimes and understating violence levels. In 2009, the outgoing head declared the war in Darfur over, despite ongoing violence, drawing concern. In 2013, the mission's spokesperson resigned, accusing UNAMID of a \"conspiracy of silence\" and underreporting attacks by Sudanese forces. The Bashir government restricted UNAMID's movements, impeding humanitarian operations in rebel-held areas like Jebel Marra. The UNAMID mission in Darfur has faced challenges including bureaucratic delays, equipment shortages, and a hostile environment. There have been over 270 fatalities, with 73 attributed to malicious acts. The lack of deterrents against attacks on peacekeepers and aid workers has been a concern, with no sanctions imposed since 2006. The United States has not designated individuals under its Darfur sanctions regime since 2007. The Security Council has gradually reduced UNAMID's mandate and mission in Darfur since 2014, transferring tasks to the U.N. country team. Despite limited resources, the country team struggles to take on new responsibilities. Pressure from Sudan's government led to a troop reduction in 2017, criticized for reflecting a false narrative about Darfur's war ending. Some experts attribute the decision to \"Darfur fatigue\" in the West and political pressure to cut peacekeeping budgets. The mission's exit, set for June 30, 2020, is contingent on security conditions and progress on specified benchmarks.

The mission's exit is set for June 30, 2020, contingent on security conditions and progress on specified benchmarks. Recent U.N. reporting gives a mixed picture of the security situation in Darfur, with conditions described as \"lawlessness and criminality, aggravated by a protracted humanitarian crisis, continued human rights violations, and the lack of development.\" The U.N. Secretary-General's report in April 2019 highlighted the relatively stable security situation in Darfur, except for ongoing clashes in Jebel Marra. Rebels fleeing to Libya to regroup for potential return to Sudan were mentioned. Intercommunal violence, attacks on civilians, and abuses by government forces were noted as hindrances to lasting peace. Over 1.7 million people remain internally displaced in Darfur, with 340,000 refugees in Chad. Following President Bashir's ousting, a U.N.-AU assessment team observed increased violence in IDP camps.

Over 1.7 million people remain internally displaced in Darfur, with 340,000 refugees in Chad. Following President Bashir's ousting, a U.N.-AU assessment team observed increased violence in IDP camps. The team suggested that Darfur had evolved into a post-conflict setting, supporting the gradual transition of the mission from peacekeeping to peacebuilding. However, security conditions for U.N. and aid operations in Darfur worsened in mid-2019, with incidents of looting and vandalism reported. Most of the facilities closed by UNAMID as part of its drawdown have been occupied by state security forces. In mid-2019, most facilities closed by UNAMID in Darfur were taken over by state security forces, particularly the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The RSF, known for human rights abuses, demanded control of remaining UNAMID bases, which was initially rejected by the AU. The human rights situation in Darfur deteriorated, with increased reports of violence and abuses. The AU Peace and Security Council noted a drastic change in security and political developments contributing to the worsening situation in Darfur. Amnesty International warns against closing UNAMID in Darfur, stating it would endanger thousands of lives. The UN Security Council voted to pause the drawdown until October 31, with troops and police remaining in Darfur. RSF commander Hemeti, a powerful figure in Darfur, has been seeking to expand control in the region. Since Bashir's ouster, RSF forces led by Hemeti have been implicated in killing Darfuri civilians. Hemeti now holds a senior position in Sudan's transitional government, raising concerns about his influence on peace prospects. The new prime minister prioritizes making peace with insurgent groups. Discussions are underway on the future of U.N. peacekeepers in Darfur, considering a follow-on mechanism to UNAMID. MONUSCO, the largest U.N. peacekeeping operation, was established in response to conflict in the DRC. MONUSCO, the largest U.N. peacekeeping operation, succeeded MONUC in the DRC after a formal post-conflict transitional period. Its mandate includes protecting civilians, extending state authority in eastern DRC, supporting demobilization of rebel combatants, and providing logistics support for the Ebola response. U.S. citizen David Gressly leads the U.N. Emergency Ebola Response Coordinator in the outbreak zone. Since 2013, the Security Council has authorized an intervention brigade within MONUSCO to disarm rebel groups in the DRC. However, the brigade's activities have been limited by troop contributors' national security interests and capacity gaps. Human rights groups criticize MONUSCO for failing to protect civilians from armed group attacks due to various factors like competing tasks and logistical challenges. The MONUSCO mission in the DRC faces challenges such as logistical issues, lack of capacity, and political will among troop contributors. There are concerns about state actors' involvement in violence and limited commitment to stability. MONUSCO personnel have been implicated in sexual abuse. Political violence and new conflicts have strained the mission, along with potential links between armed groups in the DRC and the Islamic State. The Obama Administration preserved troop levels during election periods, while the Trump Administration later secured a decrease in troops. The Trump Administration secured a decrease in MONUSCO's troop ceiling, citing support for a \"corrupt\" government in Kinshasa. Despite calls for caution from the U.N. Secretary-General, the Security Council did not adopt a troop ceiling decrease in 2018 or 2019. In March 2019, the Security Council extended MONUSCO's mandate and troop ceiling for nine months, calling for an independent strategic review and an \"exit strategy.\" The State Department's FY2020 budget request suggests a potential drawdown of MONUSCO forces in FY2020. The FY2020 budget request anticipates a reduction in MONUSCO forces as the DRC government takes on more security responsibilities. Morocco claims sovereignty over Western Sahara, while the Polisario Front seeks independence. MINURSO was established in 1991 to oversee a cease-fire agreement between Morocco and the Polisario. The Security Council has maintained MINURSO to observe the 1991 ceasefire in Western Sahara. Efforts to advance a referendum or other resolution options have not been successful due to lack of backing from Morocco, the Polisario, or the Security Council. Talks without preconditions are called for to achieve a mutually acceptable resolution, with Morocco offering autonomy under its sovereignty and the Polisario seeking a referendum on independence. Military tensions escalated in 2016 and 2017. Military tensions escalated in 2016 and 2017 as Moroccan and Polisario forces entered the demilitarized \"buffer zone.\" MINURSO's uniformed component consists almost entirely of unarmed military observers. In 2013, U.S. diplomats supported adding human rights monitoring to the mission's mandate, which Morocco opposed, leading to the expulsion of U.S. military personnel. Morocco also expelled MINURSO civilian staff in response to remarks by the U.N. Secretary-General. Maintaining MINURSO is seen as a small price to prevent renewed conflict. The Trump Administration supports U.N.-facilitated talks on Western Sahara and has shortened MINURSO's mandate renewals. Former National Security Advisor John Bolton advocated for international pressure on Morocco. Talks were held in 2018 and 2019, but no clear progress was made towards a settlement. In 2019, official representatives of Morocco and the Polisario met, but no breakthrough was announced. In May 2019, K\u00c3\u00b6hler resigned due to health reasons, adding uncertainty to the political process. Congressional deliberations on U.N. peacekeeping operations and funding cuts coincide with potential changes to missions in Mali, Darfur, and DRC. The Senate Appropriations Committee report highlights the challenges of weak governance and conflict in Africa, the Middle East, and Central and South America leading to unprecedented population movements of refugees and IDPs. The report also mentions the struggle of the UN and other entities to address this global emergency due to insufficient donor support. Congress is urged to consider how U.N. peacekeeping operations in Africa align with U.S. foreign policy priorities and the impact of U.S. funding decisions on peacekeeping missions. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of U.S. funding decisions on peacekeeping missions in Africa and the role of other donors in responding to security crises in the region."
