The Congress finds that NATO invited European countries to participate in the Partnership for Peace program, reaffirming the Alliance's openness to membership for other European states contributing to security in the North Atlantic area. The political and economic transformation of formerly communist-ruled countries in Europe has been ongoing since 1989. Countries like Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia have made significant progress towards establishing democratic institutions, free market economies, and the rule of law. Since 1989, countries in Europe like Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia have made progress in establishing democratic institutions, free market economies, and the rule of law. They now have control of their armed forces after the fall of their previous communist governments. The Congress acknowledges the progress made by European countries in establishing democratic institutions, free market economies, and the rule of law since 1989. The Congress commends NATO leaders for keeping membership open to European countries emerging from communist domination and supports the eventual expansion of NATO. Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia are expected to uphold NATO principles and contribute to security by January 10, 1999, with the goal of becoming full NATO members by that date if they maintain progress towards democratic institutions and free market economies. The United States, NATO, and other member nations should provide assistance for Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia to transition to full NATO membership by January 10, 1999.
