    "content": "SECTION 1. CLARIFICATION OF AUTHORITY. The Act defining the exterior boundary of the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation in Utah is amended to authorize the State of Utah to relinquish certain mineral lands for the benefit of the Ute Indian Tribe. The Act allows the State of Utah to relinquish certain mineral lands for the Ute Indian Tribe's benefit, with the condition that the Secretary of the Interior reserves an overriding interest in the mineral estate. The State of Utah can receive 50 percent of bonus bids, rental payments, a 6.25 percent royalty on oil and gas production, and a 50 percent royalty on other mineral production from leases or authorizations. The State of Utah reserves an overriding interest in mineral lands relinquished to the United States, entitling it to 50 percent of bonus bids and rental payments for mineral development. The United States receives 50 percent of rental payments for mineral leases, a 6.25 percent royalty on oil and gas production, and a royalty on other mineral production. There is no obligation for either the United States or the State to develop oil and gas resources where the other party retains an interest. The Secretary of the Interior can enter cooperative agreements with the State and the Ute Indian Tribe to facilitate land conveyance and administration of reserved interests. The overriding interests reserved by the Secretary and the State will automatically terminate 30 years after enactment."
