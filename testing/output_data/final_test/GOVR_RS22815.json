It provided grants to small and medium-sized firms for projects with transformational potential in critical national areas. NIST published the final rule for TIP on June 25, 2008. The Technology Innovation Program (TIP) at NIST, established to support innovation in the US through high-risk research, announced awards for new research projects in advanced sensing technologies for infrastructure monitoring. Grants of up to $3 million for individual projects and up to $9 million for collaborative ventures were awarded through a competitive, merit-based process. $42.5 million in federal funds were expected to be matched by $45.7 million in private sector support. In December 2009, NIST announced twenty more awards totaling almost $71.0 million in financing with approximately $145.7 million in funding from other sources. Thirteen projects were for monitoring and inspection of civil infrastructure, four for advanced repair, eleven for process scale up of advanced materials, and one for predictive modeling. In December 2010, nine additional projects in various areas received awards of more than $22 million, with federal funding expected to be matched by $24 million in private sector support. No new TIP projects were funded in FY2011. In FY2011, no new TIP projects were funded. The $44.8 million allocated in P.L. 112-10 was for ongoing TIP and ATP projects. There was no funding for TIP in FY2012. The Technology Innovation Program replaced the Advanced Technology Program and received $65.2 million in FY2008. The FY2009 budget did not include support for TIP. In FY2009, TIP was funded at FY2008 levels through March 6, 2009, with $65.0 million provided by P.L. 111-8. For FY2010, TIP received $69.9 million, a 7.5% increase over the previous year. In FY2011, the Administration's budget included $79.9 million for TIP, a 14.3% increase over FY2010. In FY2011, TIP funding faced challenges with proposed cuts from the Senate Committee on Appropriations and the House, resulting in a final appropriation of $44.8 million, a significant decrease from previous years. The FY2012 budget did not allocate any funding for TIP, despite the Administration's proposal of $75.0 million. The Technology Innovation Program (TIP) replaced the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) and received no funding in the FY2012 budget despite the Administration's proposal of $75.0 million. ATP was established to foster cooperation between the public and private sectors in industrial technology development. The ATP provided seed funding to single companies or industry-led consortia for developing pre-competitive technologies with broad applications. Awards were based on technical and business merit, with a focus on market potential. Funding was limited to $2 million over three years for individual firms, with large firms required to cover at least 60% of project costs. Joint ventures could receive up to five years of financing, with the private sector contributing over 50% of funding. The ATP grant program provided funding to companies for developing pre-competitive technologies with broad applications. Over 800 projects were funded, with a significant portion being joint ventures. Approximately $1.6 billion in federal funds were matched by $1.5 billion from the private sector, with small businesses leading the way. Financing for ATP was a contentious issue before the program was terminated. The Technology Innovation Program (TIP) replaced the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) amidst debate over government funding for research. Opponents criticized ATP as \"corporate welfare,\" while supporters argued it helped small businesses develop crucial technologies. TIP was designed to focus on small and medium-sized companies in response to a changing global innovation environment. The Technology Innovation Program (TIP) focuses on small and medium-sized companies, acknowledging universities' role in innovation. TIP differs from the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) in that it limited financial support to small and medium-sized businesses, while ATP grants were available to companies of any size. Joint ventures in ATP required two separately owned for-profit firms, while TIP allowed for joint ventures with two for-profit companies. The Advanced Technology Program (ATP) allowed for joint ventures involving small or medium-sized firms and universities, with no funding limits and no cost-sharing requirements for small and medium-sized companies. In contrast, the Technology Innovation Program (TIP) limited joint venture funding to $9 million over five years, with a 50% cost-sharing requirement for eligible small and medium-sized businesses. The Advisory Board for ATP included industry representatives and federal officials. The Technology Innovation Program (TIP) awarded grants for work in areas of \"Critical National Need\" identified by NIST. Input was solicited from various organizations to determine grant recipients, with a focus on civil infrastructure, manufacturing, robotics, networks, energy, and healthcare. The termination of the Advanced Technology Program and other technology development efforts reflects a shift away from direct federal financing of private sector R&D. Critics view these actions as government interference in the marketplace, favoring measures to create a better investment environment for industry innovation. Legislation has established laws, programs, and policies to support technological advancement through indirect and direct means. The government has implemented laws, programs, and policies to promote technology advancement in the private sector through indirect and direct measures. This includes incentives like tax credits and changes to antitrust laws, as well as federal funding for programs like TIP and the Small Business Innovation Research Program. Critics argue that these actions interfere with the marketplace, while proponents believe they contribute to national security. The debate over the government's role in commercial technology development has been reignited with the elimination of ATP and the creation and subsequent termination of TIP. Advocates argue for less federal involvement in promoting commercial technology development, favoring market mechanisms over agency discretion. Supporters of direct methods believe in focusing on promising technologies with industry support and government matching funds. The government is seen as a catalyst for cooperation to drive technological progress for economic growth and a high standard of living. The debate continues on the best approach to achieve this goal. Critics debate the effectiveness of ATP and TIP, arguing that federal agency involvement may lead to the selection of proposals over truly important technologies. Proponents defend the programs as market-driven, requiring industry collaboration and rigorous business reviews. The recent elimination of ATP and TIP suggests Congress may not support this approach. The recent elimination of ATP and TIP suggests that Congress may not support this approach at this time."
