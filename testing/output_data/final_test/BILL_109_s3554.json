    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Alternative Diesel Standard Act of 2006\" and it pertains to the alternative diesel fuel content of diesel. Congress finds that the renewable fuel program under the Clean Air Act requires entities in the petroleum sector to blend renewable fuels into motor vehicle fuel, with a small percentage of the gasoline motor pool totaling nearly 140 billion gallons. The Clean Air Act requires blending renewable fuels into motor vehicle fuel, with a small percentage requirement that excludes the 40,000,000,000-gallon diesel motor pool. Additionally, a new Alternative Diesel Fuel Program for the diesel motor pool is defined as biodiesel and blending components derived from alternative fuel. The Alternative Diesel Fuel Program includes diesel fuel substitutes produced from animal fat, plant oil, recycled yellow grease, single-cell or microbial oil, thermal depolymerization, thermochemical conversion, coal-to-liquid processes with carbon sequestration, and diesel-ethanol blends with at least 7 percent ethanol. The Administrator will promulgate regulations to ensure that diesel sold in the US contains the required volume of alternative diesel fuel, excluding noncontiguous States or territories. Regulations under clause (i) will include compliance provisions for refineries, blenders, distributors, and importers to meet the requirements. These regulations will not restrict where alternative diesel fuel can be used or impose a per-gallon obligation. The Administrator must promulgate regulations for the percentage of alternative diesel fuel in the diesel motor pool sold to consumers in the US. If regulations are not issued, the percentage for 2008 will be 0.6%. The applicable volume for calendar years 2008 through 2015 will be determined according to a specified table. The applicable volume of alternative diesel fuel in the diesel motor pool will increase annually from 250 million gallons in 2008 to 2,000 million gallons in 2015. For calendar year 2016 and beyond, the volume will be determined by regulations. The Administrator, in coordination with the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Energy, will determine the annual volume of alternative diesel fuel based on a review of the program's implementation from 2008 to 2015. This review includes assessing the impact on the environment, air quality, energy security, job creation, and rural economic development, as well as estimating future production rates of alternative diesel fuels for blending. The Administrator, in coordination with the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Energy, will determine the annual volume of alternative diesel fuel for blending based on estimated sales or introduction into commerce. The minimum applicable volume for each calendar year is calculated by multiplying the estimated gallons of diesel with a specified ratio. The Administrator, in coordination with the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Energy, will determine the annual volume of alternative diesel fuel for blending based on estimated sales or introduction into commerce. The minimum applicable volume for each calendar year is calculated by multiplying the estimated gallons of diesel with a specified ratio. The Energy Information Administration provides estimates of diesel sales for upcoming years. The Administrator, in coordination with the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Energy, determines the alternative diesel fuel obligation for each calendar year to meet specific requirements. This obligation is published in the Federal Register by November 30 for the following year, applicable to refineries. The alternative diesel fuel obligation for each calendar year is determined by the Administrator in coordination with the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Energy. This obligation, applicable to refineries, blenders, and importers, is expressed as a volume percentage of diesel sold in the United States and consists of a single applicable percentage for all categories of persons. Adjustments are made to prevent redundant imposition. The regulations allow for the generation and use of credits by those who refine, blend, or import diesel with more alternative fuel than required. These credits can be used for compliance with regulations or transferred to others. The regulations allow for the generation and use of credits for those unable to generate or purchase sufficient credits, allowing them to carry forward a credit generated in a previous year. The Administrator may waive the alternative diesel fuel requirement based on a petition from one or more States, after public notice. The Administrator can waive the alternative diesel fuel requirement if it would severely harm the economy or environment, or if there is an inadequate domestic supply of alternative fuel. Petitions for waivers must be approved or disapproved within 90 days. Waivers can be terminated except in certain circumstances. The Administrator can extend a waiver under certain circumstances. Penalties and enforcement under the Clean Air Act are amended to include new provisions. Technical amendments are made to Section 211 of the Clean Air Act, including changes to subsections (i)(4), (k)(10), (n), and (t)(1). Subsections (r) and (s) are redesignated as (s) and (t) respectively."
