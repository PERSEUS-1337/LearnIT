    "content": "The child nutrition programs, administered by the USDA's Food and Nutrition Service, support meals and snacks for children in various institutional settings across the U.S. These programs provide federal aid to state agencies for distribution to eligible children, distinguishing them from other federal nutrition assistance programs like SNAP and WIC. The child nutrition programs, established in 1946 with the National School Lunch Act, have evolved over the years to include various programs like SMP, SBP, CACFP, SFSP, and FFVP. These programs aim to improve nutrition for children in different settings beyond just schools. The child nutrition programs, authorized under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, aim to improve children's nutrition and support U.S. agriculture. Congressional jurisdiction over these programs is typically exercised by the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee and the House Education and Labor Committee. Congress periodically amends and reauthorizes the child nutrition programs' authorizing laws. The child nutrition programs were most recently reauthorized by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. The 114th Congress did not complete a 2016 child nutrition reauthorization, but the 116th Congress has announced plans to work on it. This report provides an overview of child nutrition programs' funding and details on each program's administration, eligibility rules, nutritional requirements, and recent policy. Child nutrition programs require an appropriation of funding due to benefit and eligibility criteria. Funding is considered mandatory but needs to be allocated separately. These programs are known as \"appropriated entitlements\" or \"appropriated mandatories.\" If funds are not allocated, entitled recipients may have legal recourse. The spending for child nutrition programs is open-ended with no specified limit on beneficiaries or benefits. Child nutrition programs require funding for benefits and eligibility criteria. Spending fluctuates based on meals served and reimbursement rates. Appropriated mandatory funding in FY2020 totaled $23.6 billion, with $13.5 billion transferred from Section 32 funds. Funding streams include per-meal cash reimbursements, commodity assistance, and administrative funds. In FY2020, child nutrition programs received $23.6 billion in funding, with $13.5 billion transferred from Section 32 funds. Funding is primarily in the form of per-meal cash reimbursements, with rates adjusted annually for inflation. Meals served must meet federal nutritional requirements to qualify for reimbursement, with higher rates for meals served to lower-income children. Child nutrition programs receive reimbursement rates based on different criteria, with schools in high-poverty areas getting an extra 36 cents per meal in the SBP program. FNS distributes per-meal reimbursements to state agencies, which then distribute them to schools and institutions. Daily meal counts must be recorded and monthly reports submitted to receive reimbursement. Participating institutions can use federal funds for various food service operations. Reimbursement rates for each program are detailed, with an example provided for NSLP in Table 3. Federal support for child nutrition programs includes USDA-purchased commodity foods (\"USDA Foods\") and cash in lieu of commodities. States, schools, and institutions receive entitlement commodity assistance for NSLP and CACFP, with a per-meal commodity reimbursement rate. Commodity assistance is not part of SBP funding but can be used for school breakfasts. A smaller amount of commodity assistance is also provided for certain institutions in SFSP. Entitlement commodity funds are used to select commodities from a USDA Foods catalog. Entitlement commodity funds are used by institutions to select commodities from a USDA Foods catalog, with USDA purchasing and distributing the foods to schools. Schools and state agencies can choose to receive commodity assistance in cash form, totaling nearly $1.5 billion in FY2019. Child nutrition programs can also receive bonus commodities purchased by USDA to support the agricultural economy. In FY2019, there was an increase in bonus commodities distributed to child nutrition programs. State agencies receive federal funds for program administration expenses, with a minimum requirement of 1.5% of federal expenditures on various programs. States can allocate these funds among different child nutrition programs as needed. Additionally, states receive separate administrative payments through SFSP totaling at least 2.5%. States receive separate administrative payments through SFSP that equal at least 2.5% of their summer meal aid. Schools and institutions can use per-meal reimbursements to cover administrative costs. In CACFP, institutions overseeing day care homes receive monthly payments for administrative expenses. Some child nutrition programs have mandatory funding, while others are funded on a discretionary basis. Federal subsidies may not cover the full cost of these programs. Child nutrition programs receive funds from various sources, including federal subsidies, participants, states, school districts, and local governments. The National School Lunch Program (NSLP) has a cost-sharing requirement for states, with an annual contribution of around $200 million from all states combined. A study found that 63% of school food service revenues came from federal funds, 30% from student payments, and 6% from state and local funds. The National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP) provide federal support for meals served in schools nationwide. Schools receive cash reimbursements for meals that meet nutritional requirements, with the largest subsidies for free and reduced-price meals. Schools can also provide afterschool snacks, summer meals, and snacks through the programs. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 made changes to school meals programs, requiring USDA to update nutrition standards and create new requirements for foods sold in NSLP and SBP schools. Approximately 91% of public schools participate in NSLP, with some states mandating school lunch and breakfast programs. Some states also provide state funding for school meals programs. Schools not participating in federal programs may operate locally funded meal programs. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 implemented new requirements for foods sold in NSLP and SBP schools. The Community Eligibility Provision allows eligible schools to offer free meals to all students. NSLP and SBP are separate programs but share many requirements. Participation in SBP is lower due to early arrival requirements. School meals programs are typically managed by school districts. The school meal programs are operated by \"school food authorities,\" which are typically food service departments within school districts. Local educational agencies, such as school boards, also play a role in administering the programs. State departments of education oversee the programs at the state level. The federal government oversees the distribution of reimbursements to school food authorities and administers school meal programs through guidance and technical assistance. Students in participating schools can buy meals, but eligibility rules apply for free or reduced-price meals. Children can be certified for free or reduced-price school meals through income eligibility or categorical eligibility pathways. Schools verify a sample of household applications annually for accuracy. Reimbursements are provided to school food authorities based on certification status. School food authorities must adhere to federal guidelines for setting prices of paid meals, with eligibility for free or reduced-price meals based on household income falling within specific ranges. Free meals are for households at or below 130% of the federal poverty guidelines, while reduced-price meals are for households above 130% and up to 185% of the guidelines. Income limits are updated annually for inflation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The income limits for free and reduced-price school meals are updated annually for inflation. Parents or guardians must complete an application including household income and size to determine eligibility. Children can also qualify for free meals through categorical eligibility. Children can qualify for free lunches and breakfasts through categorical eligibility, which includes being in a household receiving benefits from programs like SNAP, FDPIR, or TANF, enrolled in Head Start, in foster care, a migrant, a runaway, or homeless. Categorical eligibility can be determined through a household application or direct certification. In the 1980s, school meals with SNAP and TANF started, allowing schools to use categorical eligibility to streamline certification processes. Direct certification automatically certifies children for free meals based on their status in a program without a household application. States must conduct direct certification for SNAP and have the option for other programs. The 2004 child nutrition reauthorization act required states to conduct direct certification with SNAP for free school meals, with 92% of children in SNAP households directly certified as of school year 2016-2017. The HHFKA expanded direct certification, including a demonstration project to test direct certification with Medicaid. The law funded performance incentive grants for high-performing states and authorized corrective action plans for low-performing states in direct certification activities. Each fall, districts verify a sample of approved household applications, focusing on \"error-prone\" applications. Verification is not required for children directly certified for free or reduced-price meals. Many districts use \"direct verification\" to match data from other low-income programs for verification activities. School food authorities must verify household income information provided on applications, and eligibility status may change as a result. Reimbursements for meals served are submitted to the state agency and adjusted annually for inflation. In school year 2019-2020, NSLP and SBP reimbursement rates are adjusted for inflation annually. School food authorities receive higher reimbursements for meals meeting certain criteria, such as compliance with federal nutrition standards and serving a certain percentage of free or reduced-price lunches. Cash reimbursements can be used to support various aspects of the school food service operation. The federal cash reimbursements for school meals must go into a nonprofit school food service account subject to federal regulations. A School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study found that the average cost of producing a reimbursable lunch was $3.81, exceeding the federal reimbursement of $3.32. When including unreported costs, the total cost was $6.02. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act authorized the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) for schools with an identified student percentage (ISP) of at least 40% to offer free meals to all enrolled students. Schools must operate both NSLP and SBP and opt-in to CEP. FNS piloted CEP in various states before expanding it nationwide in 2014-2015. Eligible schools, groups, and districts may participate in CEP. The Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) allows groups of schools or entire school districts with an identified student percentage (ISP) of at least 40% to offer free meals to all enrolled students. Schools must operate both NSLP and SBP and opt-in to CEP. Local educational agencies have until June 30 of each year to notify USDA of participating schools. Nearly 28,500 schools participated in CEP in the 2018-2019 school year. The ISP is multiplied by 1.6 to estimate the proportion of students eligible for free or reduced-price meals, with meals reimbursed at different rates. The Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) allows schools with an identified student percentage (ISP) of at least 40% to offer free meals to all enrolled students. Schools can receive reimbursement at different rates based on their ISP, with the option to recalculate it every four years. CEP aims to reduce paperwork and provide more free meals, but its financial benefits depend on the proportion of identified students. Schools can opt out of CEP at any time. Provisions 1, 2, and 3 offer alternative certification and reimbursement procedures for schools, groups, and districts. These options aim to reduce paperwork for administrators and families. Provision 1 allows schools with high proportions of eligible students to determine free meal eligibility for two years. Provision 2 and 3 are open to all schools and require some household applications. Schools may choose to participate in these options based on financial considerations. Provision 2 and Provision 3 require schools to provide free meals to all students and make eligibility determinations in the first year of a four-year period. Schools are reimbursed over a four-year period under Provision 2, while Provision 3 provides the same level of federal assistance over the next three years. Nutritional requirements for school meals have evolved over time, with changes in the most recent child nutrition reauthorization. The HHFKA in 2010 mandated USDA to update school meal nutrition standards based on recommendations from the National Academies of Sciences. Schools complying with the updated standards received a bonus reimbursement. The 2012 standards increased servings of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and meats/meat alternates in school meals. The USDA implemented new nutrition standards for school meals in 2012-2013, focusing on increasing fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while limiting calories, sodium, and trans fats. Schools faced challenges in implementing the standards, leading to adjustments in whole grain, sodium, and milk requirements through appropriations acts and USDA rulemaking. As of 2019-2020, schools are operating under revised regulations published in December 2018. The regulations amended by FNS in December 2018 allow flavored 1% milk, require 50% whole grain-rich grains in school meals, and delay stricter sodium limits. States and school districts can add nutritional requirements as long as they meet federal standards. The HHFKA also set nutrition standards for competitive foods sold in schools, like vending machines and concession stands, without federal reimbursement. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) set nutrition standards for competitive foods sold in schools, such as vending machines and concession stands, without federal reimbursement. The standards require certain primary ingredients, whole-grain compliance, and limits on calories, sugar, sodium, and fat. The final rule, published in July 2016, maintained these standards with minor changes. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) established nutrition standards for competitive foods sold in schools, including limits on calories, sugar, sodium, and fat. Schools must comply with these standards, which also restrict the sale of certain beverages. Fundraisers held outside of school hours or selling food not intended for consumption on campus are exempt from these rules. States and school districts can implement stricter policies if desired. The 2004 child nutrition reauthorization law (P.L. 108-265) required local educational agencies to implement local school wellness policies with nutritional guidelines for foods sold in schools. These policies must include goals for nutrition and physical activity, nutrition standards meeting federal guidelines, and an implementation plan. Input from various stakeholders is necessary for developing these policies. The section discusses food procurement for school meals programs, including the purchase of foods using federal reimbursements or school district funds. School food authorities must adhere to federal procurement rules and a \"Buy American\" requirement when buying food for school meals. The \"Buy American\" requirement mandates schools to buy domestic commodities for school meals programs. Schools can purchase local foods if they meet procurement regulations. School food authorities can prepare meals themselves or contract with a food service management company. Compliance with nutrition standards and oversight is necessary. Foods must meet health and safety standards for storage and preparation. Schools participating in school meals programs must adhere to state or local food safety standards, including obtaining inspections at least twice a year. Leftover food sharing is allowed if it meets safety standards. Lunches and breakfasts are typically consumed onsite, with schools providing around 20 minutes for breakfast and 25-30 minutes for lunch. Alternative breakfast service models, such as breakfast in the classroom, are becoming more common. Alternative models of breakfast service like breakfast in the classroom and grab-and-go carts have been increasingly adopted to boost participation in the School Breakfast Program. A 2018 survey by the School Nutrition Association found that over half of school districts offered both traditional cafeteria lines and alternative breakfast options. The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) provides federal reimbursements for meals served in various child care centers and adult day care centers nationwide. The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) provides cash reimbursements for meals and snacks served to children ages 12 and under, disabled individuals, and elderly adults. It also supports free meals for children ages 18 and under in emergency shelters and afterschool programs in low-income areas. CACFP offers reimbursements for up to two meals and one snack or one meal and two snacks per participant daily. Additionally, federal aid may include commodity assistance, cash in lieu of commodities, and funds for administrative costs. Eligibility and funding rules vary for centers and day care homes overseen by sponsoring organizations. Day care homes and centers must comply with government standards and CACFP nutrition guidelines. Sponsoring organizations oversee day care homes, handle financial and administrative tasks, conduct audits, and distribute federal reimbursements. Centers can operate independently or under a sponsor, while day care homes must have a sponsor. Sponsors can be public, nonprofit, or for-profit institutions. Independent centers manage their own administrative tasks. In CACFP, day care homes are required to have a sponsor organization that receives federal payments based on the number of homes they oversee. Sponsors can also receive a portion of meal reimbursements. State agencies like the department of education or health distribute funds and oversee sponsor organizations and centers. FNS provides guidance and regulations to states and providers. Eligible institutions can participate as centers. Eligible institutions for the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) include public or private nonprofit organizations providing nonresidential child care or adult day care, private for-profit organizations with low-income participants, and emergency shelters for homeless families. Income eligibility rules are similar to school meals programs. CACFP centers have specific reimbursement rates for meals (40 cents for lunch/supper, 30 cents for breakfast, 15 cents for snacks) and use categorical eligibility criteria. Adults can also be eligible based on participation in certain assistance programs. Reimbursement rates for meals are similar to SBP and NSLP rates, with larger subsidies for free/reduced-price meals. CACFP offers flexibilities for meal tracking and reimbursement claims compared to school meal programs. CACFP centers have specific reimbursement rates for meals and use categorical eligibility criteria. Adults can also be eligible based on participation in certain assistance programs. Centers are less likely to collect meal payments and may incorporate meal costs into tuition. Day care homes that meet child care standards can participate in CACFP and receive a set reimbursement rate for every meal served. Homes in low-income areas or with low-income providers receive a higher reimbursement rate. Day care homes in low-income areas or operated by low-income providers can receive a higher Tier I reimbursement rate under CACFP. Homes that do not qualify for Tier I rates receive Tier II rates but can seek Tier I subsidies for individual low-income children. Meal costs can be included in tuition for day care homes, and federal rules prohibit separate meal charges. The HHFKA required updates to CACFP's meal patterns, which were revised by USDA in 2017. The USDA revised meal patterns for meals and snacks served in centers and day care homes in 2017. The new patterns aligned nutrition standards for preschool-aged children, eliminated juice for infants, increased whole grains, fruits, and vegetables for older children and adults, limited milk to unflavored 1% and fat-free varieties, and prohibited deep-fried foods. Additionally, potable water must be available throughout the day. Flavored 1% milk was allowed for children ages six and older in CACFP starting in the 2018-2019 school year. Institutions participating in CACFP may prepare their own meals or contract with a food service management company. They must adhere to procurement regulations and receive USDA Foods. Meals must meet health and safety standards, with annual food safety inspections required. Family-style meal service is encouraged. The Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) and Seamless Summer Option offer federal reimbursements for summer meals, with SFSP open to various organizations and Seamless Summer Option specifically for school food authorities. The Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) provides federal aid to school food authorities and other organizations serving meals to children in the summer. It offers per-meal cash reimbursements and commodity foods, serving around 2.7 million children annually at 46,600 meal sites. SFSP is similar to CACFP but focuses on summer meals and is administered by sponsor organizations at the local level. The Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) requires sponsors to operate meal sites at various locations like schools, parks, and churches. Participation is limited to areas with poor economic conditions where at least 50% of children are eligible for free and reduced-price school meals. Eligible sponsors include nonprofit organizations, school food authorities, government entities, summer camps, and colleges. Eligible sponsors for the Summer Food Service Program must provide year-round services to the community and be prioritized based on successful program performance, with school food authorities having the highest priority. Sponsors are responsible for selecting and monitoring meal sites, with a focus on rural areas. Meal sites distribute meals to children and track meal servings for reimbursement. Some sponsors may also serve as meal sites. The Summer Food Service Program in 2015 had sponsors like school food authorities and nonprofit organizations, with meal sites at schools, recreation centers, and parks/playgrounds. State agencies oversee sponsors, distribute funds, and conduct reviews. FNS provides guidance and assistance to states and institutions. Sponsors must provide food services for children in economically disadvantaged areas, except camps. SFSP regulations establish eligibility rules for meal sites in economically disadvantaged areas. Open sites serve all children in the community, while closed enrolled sites only serve enrolled children who qualify for free or reduced-price school meals. Sponsors receive reimbursement for meals served at open sites, and at least 50% of children must qualify for free or reduced-price meals at both types of sites. Camps in the SFSP do not have to demonstrate a certain percentage of children meeting free and reduced-price eligibility standards. They determine eligibility based on income and categorical criteria like NSLP and SBP. Camps receive reimbursement for up to three meals or two meals and one snack per eligible child daily. They are not required to serve meals for free to all. National Youth Sports Program (NYSP) sites, including those run by the National Collegiate Athletic Association, qualify for SFSP based on area eligibility data. Sponsors of NYSP sites serve meals free to all enrolled children and receive reimbursement for all meals served. Migrant sites predominantly serve migrant children and follow the same eligibility and reimbursement rules as open sites, with the potential to receive reimbursement for up to three meals or two meals and one snack per child daily. The SFSP reimbursement rate is divided into operating and administrative costs, with higher administrative reimbursements for sponsors of rural and self-preparation sites. Meals and snacks served must meet federal nutrition standards, and sponsors can use funds for any allowable program cost. Child nutrition programs like SFSP have nutrition standards prescribed by the Secretary based on research. These standards include minimum servings of fruits, vegetables, meats, breads, and milk. Unlike other programs, SFSP has no limits on calories, fats, or milk varieties. Meals must be consumed onsite, with specific timing requirements. Participants can choose to follow NSLP and/or SBP standards. The Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) sponsors must comply with local health regulations. School food authorities can offer summer meals through the Seamless Summer Option, allowing them to use NSLP/SBP requirements. Reimbursement rates are slightly lower in the Seamless Summer Option. Beginning in summer 2011, USDA has operated Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer for Children (Summer EBT) demonstration projects in limited states and Indian Tribal Organizations, providing electronic food benefits to households with children eligible for free or reduced-price school meals. Participants may receive $30 or $60 per month on an EBT card, with states and jurisdictions able to administer the project through SNAP or WIC. Summer EBT projects, funded by the FY2010 appropriations law, have shown promising results in reducing food insecurity and improving nutrient intake. Grantees in previous years include various states and nations. In FY2019, FNS prioritized states that had not participated before, statewide projects, and projects that could operate efficiently. In FY2019, the Special Milk Program (SMP) subsidized milk in approximately 3,000 institutions, including schools and child care centers. Participating institutions provide free milk to children, with exemptions from congregate feeding requirements for outdoor meal sites in hot weather. Schools may administer SMP for pre-kindergartners and kindergartners in part-day sessions without access to other meal programs. In the Special Milk Program (SMP), institutions provide free or subsidized milk to children, with reimbursement based on different options chosen by the institutions. USDA updated nutritional requirements for milk served in SMP, including unflavored whole milk for one-year-olds, unflavored low-fat or fat-free milk for children ages 2-5, and flavored/unflavored low-fat or fat-free milk for children ages six and older. Non-dairy milk substitutes are reimbursable for medical or special dietary needs. In 2017, USDA changed milk requirements for six-year-olds in SMP to include flavored low fat (1%) milk. CACFP and NSLP provide federal support for snacks and meals in after-school programs, with CACFP reimbursing for one snack and one meal per child daily, while NSLP reimburses for snacks only. Reimbursement rates for CACFP At-Risk Afterschool meals/snacks and NSLP afterschool snacks are the same. The At-Risk Afterschool program, established in 1994 and available nationwide through the HHFKA, follows similar eligibility rules as CACFP centers. Providers must be in areas where at least 50% of children qualify for free or reduced-price meals. The program offers one snack and one meal per child daily, meeting federal nutrition standards, and operates after school, on weekends, holidays, and breaks. Unlike traditional CACFP, At-Risk Afterschool is not limited to children under 12. The CACFP At-Risk Afterschool component serves children up to age 18, with a daily average of 2.2 million children in FY2019. The NSLP Afterschool Snack option allows schools to receive federal reimbursement for providing one snack per child daily in eligible afterschool programs, with structured and supervised activities required. Schools can offer free snacks to all children if at least 50% are eligible for free and reduced-price meals. The NSLP Afterschool Snack component provides free snacks to children based on household income eligibility, serving 1.2 million children daily in FY2019. The Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program offers grants for fresh snacks in selected elementary schools, prioritizing those with high proportions of students eligible for free or reduced-price meals. The Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP) offers grants for fresh snacks in selected elementary schools with high proportions of students eligible for free or reduced-price meals. Schools must participate in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) to receive a FFVP grant, with annual per-student grant amounts set by states. FFVP is funded by a mandatory transfer of funds from Section 32, with an initial allocation of $150 million for the 2011-2012 school year. In FY2019, approximately $171.5 million in FFVP funds were allocated to states. FFVP was created as a pilot project by the 2002 farm bill and has been amended over time by farm bills and child nutrition reauthorization acts. The Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP) was initially created as a pilot project by the 2002 farm bill and has since been amended by subsequent farm bills and child nutrition reauthorization acts. The 2004 child nutrition reauthorization act made the program permanent, while the 2008 farm bill expanded mandatory funding for FFVP. The 2014 farm bill provided funding for a demonstration project to test offering frozen, canned, and dried fruits and vegetables in the program. Additional initiatives and activities supported by federal child nutrition laws include studies, evaluations, training, technology improvements, and food safety initiatives. The Farm to School Grant Program, authorized by the HHFKA, aims to bring locally produced foods into school cafeterias to enhance child nutrition. It includes grants with annual funding of $5 million awarded on a competitive basis to improve schools' access to locally produced foods. The Institute of Child Nutrition provides technical assistance, instruction, and materials for nutrition and food service professionals and other local administrators of child nutrition programs. It receives $5 million a year in mandatory funding and is currently located at the University of Mississippi. The Team Nutrition initiative supports nutrition education and promotion initiatives, including grants for state agencies to improve school meal quality. The HealthierUS Schools Challenge is a voluntary certification initiative recognizing schools promoting nutrition and physical activity. Various CRS reports and resources provide information on child nutrition programs and legislation. The Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 provided federal aid for school lunches, building on existing local programs started by charitable organizations to feed hungry children. The program received a combination of private, local, and state funding. The federal government became involved in school lunch programs during the Great Depression to feed hungry children and support the farm economy. Federal aid was provided in the form of cafeteria equipment and labor, with loans from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and employment sponsorship from the Works Progress Administration. Federal food support for school lunches began in 1935 through the Act of August 24, 1935. During the Great Depression, the federal government provided aid for school lunch programs to feed hungry children and support the farm economy. This aid included cafeteria equipment, labor, and loans from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. In 1935, federal food support for school lunches began, leading to the first federal regulations for school lunch programs. The availability of federal aid led to a rapid increase in the number of school lunch programs, but aid declined in 1943 due to surplus commodities being diverted to feed U.S. armed forces in World War II. Congress then provided the first cash assistance of $50 million in Section 32. In the midst of declining aid, Congress provided the first cash assistance of $50 million for a school milk and lunch program in the 1944 Department of Agriculture Appropriation Act. This marked a shift in the lunch program, allowing schools to purchase their own foods. The National School Lunch Act was enacted in 1946, authorizing appropriations for the National School Lunch Program. The National School Lunch Act of 1946 required schools to provide free or reduced-price lunches to students in need. Funding was based on the number of school-aged children and states had to match federal funds. Cash assistance couldn't be used for cafeteria equipment, with separate funds allocated for that purpose. In 1962, P.L. 87-823 changed the funding formula for the National School Lunch Program to be based on the number of school lunches served in the state in the preceding school year. Special assistance for schools in poor economic areas was also authorized, but not funded until 1966. In the 1970s, changes to the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) included extending special assistance to all participating schools, reducing state matching requirements, and establishing national eligibility guidelines based on federal poverty levels. Additionally, the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 expanded federal child nutrition efforts beyond school lunches by authorizing the Special Milk Program. The Nutrition Act of 1966 authorized the Special Milk Program (SMP) and the School Breakfast Program (SBP) as a pilot program. The SMP provided reimbursements for milk in schools and other nonprofit institutions. Then-Secretary of Agriculture Orville L. Freeman testified that the proposals would broaden child nutrition programs based on 20 years of experience with the National School Lunch Act. The Child Nutrition Act of 1966 authorized the School Breakfast Program (SBP) for two fiscal years, prioritizing funds for schools in need. The Act also allowed higher reimbursements for schools with severe need, specifying that breakfasts meet nutritional requirements prescribed by the Secretary. The Child Nutrition Act of 1966 authorized the School Breakfast Program (SBP) to provide free or reduced-price meals to children in need. In 1968, the Special Food Service Program for Children (SFSPC) was introduced to fund meals in summer and child care settings. In 1975, SFSPC was split into the Child Care Food Program (CCFP) and the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP), with CCFP open to public and nonprofit institutions meeting child care standards. SFSP continued to focus on institutions in low-income areas. The Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1980 and 1981 resulted in significant budget cuts to child nutrition programs, reducing funding by $1.4 billion (25%) collectively. The cuts included lowering reimbursement rates and eliminating commodity assistance for breakfast. The Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1980 and 1981 led to budget cuts for child nutrition programs, including changes to eligibility criteria, meal charges, and program participation. The law restricted eligibility for reduced-price and free meals, increased meal charges, and excluded certain schools from the Special Milk Program. Additionally, it limited participation in the Child and Adult Care Food Program to children ages 12 and under, reduced reimbursable meals, and eliminated equipment assistance for school meals. In the late 1980s and 1990s, child nutrition programs were expanded with new policies, including start-up grants for school breakfast programs, expansion of CCFP to adult day care centers, and funding for afterschool snacks. A policy change in 1986 allowed automatic eligibility for free meals for children in SNAP and TANF households, with direct certification for free meals without household applications in 1989. In the late 1980s and 1990s, policies focused on improving program integrity in child nutrition programs. The 1989 child nutrition reauthorization required standardized reviews of school food authorities' administration. The Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000 aimed to enhance program integrity in CACFP through more frequent site visits and eligibility restrictions for nonprofit institutions. The 2004 child nutrition reauthorization (P.L. 108-265) focused on program integrity by setting sample sizes for application reviews, targeting \"error-prone\" applications, and authorizing automatic verification processes. It also required additional administrative reviews for high-risk school food authorities and expanded free school meals to new categories of children. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 expanded school meals to include foster children and allowed direct certification for them. It also introduced a pilot project for direct certification of children in Medicaid households for free and reduced-price meals. Additionally, it created the Community Eligibility Provision for eligible schools to provide free meals to all students. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 mandated updates to nutrition standards for school meals and CACFP, aligning them with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. This included regulations for all foods sold on school campuses during the school day. Subsequent changes have been made by USDA and Congress, sparking ongoing debate in the programs."
