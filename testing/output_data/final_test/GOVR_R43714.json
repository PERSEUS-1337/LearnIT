Former Attorney General Eric Holder highlighted the prevalence of trade-secret theft, stating that companies either know they've been compromised or will soon find out. Globalization has been identified as a key factor contributing to the rise in trade secret theft incidents. Trade-secret theft is a significant issue for multinational companies expanding overseas, as it exposes their valuable intellectual property to risk. Congressional interest in addressing trade secret theft and economic espionage is evident through legislative activity in the 114th Congress. The report provides an overview of trade secret protection laws, including the pending legislation Defend Trade Secrets Act (S. 1890). Trade secrets are valuable business information protected from theft and espionage, consisting of confidential, commercially valuable information. Trade secrets are valuable business information protected through confidentiality agreements and concealment measures. Factors considered in determining if information qualifies as a trade secret include its extent of knowledge outside the company, efforts to guard secrecy, value to the company and competitors, and resources invested in its development. The U.S. Supreme Court has set standards for protecting trade secrets, requiring novelty and inventiveness. Companies can have a property interest in trade secrets, but the extent of protection depends on how well the owner safeguards the information. Trade secret protection is crucial for maintaining the confidentiality of valuable business information that provides an economic advantage. This protection can apply to a wide range of proprietary information such as customer lists, production methods, marketing strategies, and chemical formulae. Trade secrets can last indefinitely as long as they remain confidential, but once disclosed, their protected status is lost permanently. Trade secrets are crucial for maintaining confidentiality of valuable business information. Once a trade secret is lost, it cannot be retrieved. Disclosures to third parties for specific reasons do not waive protections if secrecy measures were taken. Misappropriation can occur through improper acquisition, breach of confidence, or using the secret with knowledge of improper acquisition. Misappropriation of a trade secret can lead to legal action, including injunctions and compensation for damages. Reverse engineering is not considered improper if done independently. Intellectual property covers various intangible assets. Intellectual property encompasses original artistic and literary works, symbols distinguishing goods and services, inventions, and confidential business information. Federal law grants exclusive rights to owners of patents, trademarks, and copyrights, allowing them to enforce these rights through lawsuits in federal court for infringement. Owners of patents, trademarks, and copyrights can enforce their rights through lawsuits in federal court. The U.S. Department of Justice may criminally prosecute severe violators to impose harsher penalties. Trade secrets are primarily governed by state law, limiting legal recourse for owners when their rights are violated. They can file civil lawsuits, but do not have a private right of action in federal court for trade secret theft. Trade secret law provides inventors with proprietary rights to technologies, processes, designs, or formulas that may not meet patent standards. Unlike patents, trade secrets have no expiration date and are easier, quicker, and cheaper to obtain. Companies may choose trade secret protection over patents due to these advantages. Obtaining a patent is a lengthy and expensive process that involves the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office. However, trade secret law provides incentives for innovation in areas where patents may not reach, encouraging companies to develop valuable information that may not be patentable. Trade secrets offer advantages such as no expiration date and quicker, cheaper protection compared to patents. Trade secret law, unlike other forms of intellectual property, originated in state court opinions in the 19th century. It evolved from common law torts and legal rules governing employment relationships. The American Law Institute published a treatise on trade secret law in 1939. The American Law Institute (ALI) published the \"Restatement of Torts\" in 1939, which included sections on trade secrets. The ALI later addressed trade secrets in its 1993 \"Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition.\" The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Law (NCCUSL) issued the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA) in 1979, aiming to codify trade secrets protection. The NCCUSL drafts statutes for states to adopt, lacking direct legislative authority. Federal trade secret protection was established in the mid-1990s with the Economic Espionage Act of 1996. Trade secrets are primarily protected under state law through common law tort actions or specific state statutes like the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA). The Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA) has been adopted by 47 states and the District of Columbia, with some variations in state laws from the original model text. These laws define key terms, provide injunctive and monetary relief for misappropriation of trade secrets, and some states even criminalize the theft of trade secrets. However, differences between state laws and the UTSA can lead to varying standards in trade secret cases according to a Senate Judiciary Committee report. State laws and the UTSA can have a significant impact on trade secret cases, affecting burden of proof, rights of innocent parties, scope of protectable information, and measures to maintain secrecy. The Trade Secrets Act, enacted in 1948, applies to federal government employees and contractors, with penalties including removal from office, fines, and imprisonment. The Economic Espionage Act of 1996 (EEA) was enacted by Congress to address concerns over international and domestic economic espionage against U.S. businesses. It aims to protect trade secrets from theft, as companies invest billions in research and development that could be compromised by competitors stealing their secrets. Foreign nations and corporations have been implicated in seeking to gain a competitive advantage through trade secret theft. Foreign nations and corporations have been increasingly using espionage to steal American economic secrets, including trade secrets. The Economic Espionage Act defines two criminal offenses related to trade secret theft for the benefit of a foreign entity or another party. To trigger action under the EEA, the information must qualify as a trade secret, which is broadly defined to include various types of information. The Economic Espionage Act (EEA) defines trade secrets as valuable information that is kept secret and has independent economic value. The EEA's \"economic espionage\" provision punishes those who steal trade secrets for the benefit of a foreign government. Misappropriation must be done knowingly, with the offender aware of the value of the information taken. The EEA's \"economic espionage\" provision punishes those who steal trade secrets for the benefit of a foreign government. Misappropriation must be done knowingly, with the offender aware of the value of the information taken. The \"benefit\" derived from foreign espionage includes economic, reputational, strategic, or tactical benefits. A \"foreign instrumentality\" is an entity substantially owned, controlled, sponsored, commanded, managed, or dominated by a foreign government. A foreign corporation engaging in espionage without evidence of government sponsorship may not be prosecuted under Section 1831. Individuals or organizations engaging in theft of trade secrets, even without intent to benefit a foreign entity, could be liable under Section 1832. The EEA's Section 1832 prohibits theft of trade secrets without the need to benefit a foreign entity, unlike Section 1831 which focuses on economic espionage for foreign governments. Section 1832 requires the theft to economically benefit someone other than the owner of the trade secret. Section 1831 of the EEA broadly encompasses misappropriation for any purpose, including non-economic benefits, while Section 1832 focuses on theft of trade secrets to benefit someone other than the owner. Establishing intent to cause injury to the trade secret owner does not require proving malice, but rather awareness of causing disadvantage. Prosecuting economic espionage under Section 1831 is challenging due to proving theft intended to benefit a foreign government. The EEA allows for substantial penalties for economic espionage and theft of trade secrets, with fines up to $5 million and imprisonment up to 15 years for individuals. Corporations found guilty can face fines of $10 million or three times the value of the stolen trade secret. Prosecuting these cases may depend on the availability of foreign evidence, diplomatic concerns, and the presence of classified information. The Economic Espionage Act (EEA) imposes severe penalties for theft of trade secrets, with fines up to $5 million and imprisonment up to 15 years for individuals. Organizations can face fines of up to $10 million or three times the value of the stolen trade secret. Offenders must pay restitution to victims and forfeit any property used in the offense. Protective measures are required to preserve the confidentiality of trade secrets during legal proceedings. The Economic Espionage Act (EEA) imposes severe penalties for theft of trade secrets, with fines up to $5 million and imprisonment up to 15 years for individuals. Organizations can face fines of up to $10 million or three times the value of the stolen trade secret. The EEA allows the Attorney General to bring a civil action to obtain \"appropriate injunctive relief\" against any violation of the EEA provisions regarding the protection of trade secrets. However, it does not provide victims of trade secret theft with a private civil cause of action. Trade secret violations that occur domestically and internationally may be subject to prosecution. The Economic Espionage Act (EEA) allows for criminal prosecution of trade secret violations domestically and internationally. The EEA applies overseas if the offender is a U.S. citizen, an act is committed within the U.S., or if an organization is organized under U.S. law. There are exceptions for lawful activities conducted by a governmental entity of the United States. The Economic Espionage Act (EEA) prohibits certain activities related to trade secrets, with exceptions for lawful government activities and reporting suspected criminal activity to law enforcement. It does not preempt other civil or criminal remedies for trade secret misappropriation. The United States has strong laws protecting trade secrets, including the Economic Espionage Act (EEA). Federal prosecutors can also bring criminal charges under other laws such as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the National Stolen Property Act, and the federal wire fraud statute. This legal regime is more robust compared to many other countries. The protection of trade secrets is stronger in the United States compared to many other countries. Weak laws and enforcement practices in countries like China, Brazil, Russia, and India can diminish a company's ability to protect its trade secrets globally. The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) sets minimum standards for trade secret protection among WTO signatory states. TRIPS sets minimum standards for protecting undisclosed information, including trade secrets, among WTO members. Article 39 of TRIPS requires members to safeguard undisclosed information from unauthorized use in a manner contrary to honest commercial practices. Article 39 of TRIPS defines \"undisclosed information\" as secret information with commercial value that has been kept confidential. Unlike the federal Economic Espionage Act, TRIPS lacks specificity in defining what constitutes a trade secret, leaving room for broad or narrow interpretation. The TRIPS agreement lacks specificity in defining trade secrets, leading to broad interpretations by WTO members. Article 39 mandates protection against acquisition or use of trade secrets contrary to honest commercial practices, creating inconsistencies in trade secret laws across countries. Despite this, TRIPS marks the first multilateral treaty to address trade secret protection, requiring member nations to enact laws similar to U.S. trade secret law. The TRIPS Agreement requires member nations to enact laws similar to U.S. trade secret law. The WTO can resolve disputes related to trade secret violations, but such cases are rare. Senator Schumer urged the USTR to initiate a case against China for cyber espionage. The letter argues that Chinese policies sanctioning cyber espionage violate the TRIPS agreement, which requires WTO members to protect trade secrets. The USTR has not filed a WTO complaint against China for this issue. The US has FTAs with TRIPS-plus agreements that provide higher levels of intellectual property protection, including trade secret protection. The economic impact of trade secret theft in the US is estimated to be between 1% to 3% of the Gross Domestic Product. Challenges in calculating the exact value include delayed detection of theft and reluctance to report security breaches due to potential reputation and stock price damage. Trade secret theft can harm a company's reputation and stock prices, and accusing a foreign entity of theft may offend potential customers or partners. It is difficult to measure the value of sensitive information, with estimates of economic espionage losses ranging widely. In most trade secret cases, the alleged misappropriator is known to the owner, such as a current or former employee. In its October 2011 report to Congress, ONCIX warned about the growing threat of foreign entities stealing US technological and economic information, particularly through the use of digital technology. The report emphasized the need for trade secret owners to focus on protecting their secrets from unscrupulous employees and business partners. Cyberspace enables foreign collectors to quickly gather vast amounts of information through various methods like exploiting computer networks or sending sensitive data via email. While cyber-enabled trade secret theft is a concern, actors still rely on physical means like recruiting insiders. Motivations for theft vary from personal gain to advancing national interests. China and Russia are noted for being aggressive in this area. According to ONCIX, China and Russia are aggressive collectors of sensitive U.S. economic information. Chinese actors are the most active in economic espionage. U.S. firms lost $1.1 billion in 2009 due to Chinese trade secret theft. China was involved in 17 out of 20 criminal prosecutions brought by the U.S. Department of Justice between 2009 and 2013. Enforcement of trade secret laws at the state level is the responsibility of the trade secret owner through civil suits for remedies like injunctive relief and damages. The federal government has laws against trade secret theft, with the FBI's Economic Espionage Unit investigating offenses under the Economic Espionage Act. The Department of Justice can prosecute cases of trade secret theft, and the Attorney General can bring civil actions for injunctive relief. However, there is no private federal cause of action for trade secret misappropriation. The White House issued a report in February 2013 outlining a strategy to combat the theft of U.S. trade secrets, highlighting the negative consequences such as loss of intellectual property, harm to innovation and competitiveness, and national security risks. The report includes five action items for improved coordination within the U.S. government to protect trade secrets. The White House's strategy to combat trade secret theft includes diplomatic efforts, promoting best practices in private industry, enhancing law enforcement operations, improving legislation, and conducting public education and outreach. The USTR conducts annual reviews of foreign countries' intellectual property policies, including a \"Special 301\" Report identifying countries with inadequate IP protection. The 2013 report highlighted the issue of trade secret theft in China and urged trading partners to strengthen protection measures. Overseas trade secret theft has negative consequences for companies. The USTR is working to improve trade secret protection in countries involved in the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. Some TPP countries lack laws criminalizing trade secret misappropriation, which hinders companies from forming joint ventures and making global supply chain investments. The penalties for trade secret misappropriation vary among countries, with some lacking sufficient deterrents. In the TPP jurisdictions, low criminal penalties are concerning as they may not deter thieves. The TTIP negotiations also show disparities in trade secret protection, with the EU lacking a harmonized legal system. Federal law has not kept pace with technological innovation, leading to increased trade secret theft. The lack of a federal civil cause of action for trade secret misappropriation is a major deficiency in U.S. trade secret law. Without this, U.S. companies struggle to protect their trade secret assets in a global economy. Criminal law punishes the defendant, but compensating the victim is difficult compared to civil law. The limitations of the Economic Espionage Act (EEA) in prosecuting individuals and entities outside the U.S. have led to few cases being prosecuted under the law since 1996. Some suggest adopting a federal trade secret law to create uniform standards nationwide. Senator Coons and Representative Nadler advocate for a federal trade secret law to establish uniform standards nationwide, addressing the current inconsistencies in state trade secret laws. They argue that federal courts are better equipped to handle cross-state disputes and protect U.S. corporate trade secrets in a global economy. A federal trade secret law is proposed to address the inefficiencies of state laws in cases of trade secret theft that cross state or international borders. The limited jurisdiction of state courts makes it difficult to enforce orders quickly, hindering the protection of company secrets. Advocates argue that trade secrets should have the same legal protections as patents, copyrights, and trademarks, allowing owners to file lawsuits in federal court for damages and injunctions against infringers. At the federal level, trade secret owners lack a similar right to enforce their rights compared to other intellectual property assets. Advocates propose a federal civil remedy for trade secret misappropriation, allowing federal courts to issue ex parte orders to seize stolen trade secrets in specific circumstances. Safeguards are necessary to prevent abuse of this process, including damages for wrongful seizure and protection of seized information. The United States lacks a federal civil statute to protect trade secrets, leading to inconsistent cooperation from international jurisdictions. Proponents advocate for a federal trade secret remedy, while some oppose federalizing trade secret law due to concerns about additional burdens on the federal judiciary. The Trade Secrets Committee of the AIPLA advised against federalization in 2007, citing commonalities among state trade secret laws based on the Uniform Trade Secrets Act. The AIPLA previously advised against federalizing trade secret law due to concerns about burdening the federal judiciary. However, in April 2013, AIPLA changed its position in response to increased foreign trade secret theft. The President of AIPLA called for a federal civil remedy for international trade secret theft due to the rise in foreign theft. Law school professors oppose the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2015, fearing it may harm innovation and economic growth. The letter, signed by law professors, argues against the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2015, stating it is unnecessary and could harm economic growth. They believe existing state laws are sufficient to protect trade secrets and highlight the potential costs of a federal law. An attorney points out the lack of provision preempting state laws as a potential issue with the DTSA. The DTSA is criticized for not preempting state trade secret laws, leading to a cluttered legal landscape with potential for duplicative causes of action. The introduction of federal civil trade secret remedy legislation may result in increased length and cost of trade secret litigation, as federal courts lack established jurisprudence. This could lead to less uniformity in trade secret doctrine. Two bills, S. 1890 and H.R. 3326 (DTSA), have been introduced in Congress to address trade secret misappropriation. The DTSA bills, S. 1890 and H.R. 3326, aim to create a federal civil trade secret remedy. S. 1890 has progressed through legislative activities, passing the Senate and House Judiciary Committee. It establishes a private cause of action for trade secret owners to sue misappropriators in federal courts. The DTSA would amend the EEA to allow trade secret owners to bring civil actions for misappropriation related to interstate or foreign commerce. It includes definitions of \"misappropriation\" and \"improper means\" similar to the Uniform Trade Secrets Act and allows for civil ex parte orders in exceptional cases to seize property to prevent dissemination of the trade secret. The DTSA includes detailed requirements for granting seizure orders to prevent trade secret misappropriation, with a focus on preventing immediate harm and balancing the interests of all parties involved. The DTSA includes requirements for seizure orders to prevent trade secret misappropriation, focusing on preventing harm and balancing interests. Seizure orders must meet specific criteria and include findings of fact, narrow seizure of property, minimize business interruption, set a hearing date, and require applicant to provide information. The DTSA requires parties to consent to a new date, provide adequate security for damages, and allows for court custody of seized materials. It provides relief for wrongful seizures similar to the Trademark Act of 1946, including damages and attorney's fees. The DTSA also allows for civil remedies for trade secret misappropriation. The DTSA allows for various remedies for trade secret misappropriation, including injunctive relief, damages, punitive damages, and attorney's fees. Evidence of actual or threatened misappropriation is required for a court to issue an injunction. Employment relationships cannot be prevented by injunctive relief, and conditions on employment must comply with applicable state laws. The DTSA establishes remedies for trade secret misappropriation, including injunctive relief, damages, punitive damages, and attorney's fees. It also sets a three-year statute of limitations for civil action and includes a provision to prevent preemption of other laws or modification of existing rules."
