    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 42010 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to impose a prepaid MTS surcharge on each prepaid consumer in California starting January 1, 2016. The surcharge is collected by sellers at the time of each retail transaction as a percentage of the sales price. This surcharge replaces charges from the Emergency Telephone Users Surcharge Act and Public Utilities Commission for prepaid mobile telephony services. The surcharge rate is calculated annually by the board by November 1 each year. The board is required to post the combined total of prepaid MTS surcharge rates and local charges for each local jurisdiction on its website by December 1 each year. This combined rate applies to all retail transactions starting April 1 of the following year. The board must post accurate prepaid MTS surcharge rates and local charges for each jurisdiction by December 1 annually. If a local agency notifies the board of an inaccurate rate or decreased local charge, a recalculated rate will be posted, effective the first day of the following calendar quarter. Starting January 1, 2016, certain notification and implementation requirements for prepaid mobile telephony services will no longer apply. The board must post individual rates for Public Utilities Commission surcharges, emergency telephone users surcharge, and local charges on its website. Sellers can rely on this information for collecting and remitting prepaid MTS surcharges and local charges. All prepaid MTS surcharges and local charges collected by sellers must be remitted to the board, except for certain retained amounts. Lifeline service providers selling prepaid mobile telephony services directly to customers must remit the surcharge to the board, minus any applicable exemptions. A seller, whether direct or not, can deduct and retain 2 percent of prepaid MTS surcharge and local charges collected from consumers. Direct sellers must remit the surcharge and charges to the board, minus any exemptions. Direct sellers must remit the prepaid MTS surcharge and local charges to the Public Utilities Commission, which will deposit the funds into universal service funds and the Utilities Reimbursement Account. The prepaid MTS surcharge, including the emergency telephone users surcharge, must be remitted to the board for retail transactions with prepaid consumers in the state. The amount remitted will be deposited into the State Emergency Telephone Number Account in the General Fund. Local charges must be remitted to the local jurisdiction or agency separately from other taxes or charges. Direct sellers must use amounts posted by the board to determine remittance to the Public Utilities Commission and local entities. Prepaid MTS providers must offer consumers the option to make additional payments at retail locations or online. The combined prepaid MTS surcharge and local charges must be separately stated on an invoice or disclosed electronically to the consumer at the time of the transaction. The prepaid MTS surcharge and local charges collected by a seller from a prepaid consumer constitute debts owed by the seller to the state and local jurisdiction for collection and payment purposes. A seller can refund any excess prepaid MTS surcharge and local charges to a prepaid consumer, even if the surcharge has already been paid to the board. The seller may also repay the amount of the surcharge paid along with the refund. Every prepaid mobile telephony consumer in the state is responsible for the prepaid MTS surcharge and local charges until paid to the state. Payment to a registered seller relieves the consumer from further liability. Unremitted surcharges and local charges become debts owed to the state. Sellers are not obligated to enforce collection of these charges. The state can take legal action to enforce the collection of surcharges and local charges imposed on prepaid mobile telephony consumers. A credit can be allowed against prepaid MTS surcharge and local charges for prepaid mobile telephony consumers if they have paid certain fees in other states or jurisdictions. The credit must not exceed the prepaid charges and should be apportioned accordingly. A seller can be relieved from collecting the prepaid MTS surcharge if the accounts on which the surcharge is imposed are found to be worthless and charged off for income tax purposes. The seller can deduct the amount charged off on their return and if any of the accounts are later collected, the collected amount must be included in the next return filed. The board can establish rules regarding uncollected or worthless accounts for fair administration. Section 42014 of the Revenue and Taxation Code defines retail transactions in the state based on point-of-sale or known-address criteria. The board can establish rules for uncollected or worthless accounts. Retail transactions in the state are defined based on point-of-sale or known-address criteria. If the prepaid consumer's address is known to be in the state or provided during the transaction, it will be deemed a known-address transaction in the state if the mobile number is associated with a location in the state. For retail transactions in the state, the location is determined based on point-of-sale or known-address criteria. The consumption of prepaid mobile telephony service is presumed to be at the location of the transaction. A seller relying on board-provided information for prepaid MTS surcharge collection is not liable for additional charges or required to refund collected amounts to consumers. For known-address transactions, sellers can collect prepaid MTS surcharge and local charges based on the consumer's ZIP Code without liability for additional charges or refunds to consumers. Every seller, except those exempt from collecting prepaid MTS surcharge and local charges, must register with the board. Sellers can voluntarily register to collect and remit the surcharge even if they meet the de minimis sales threshold. The board will establish a registration method similar to the seller's permit process under the Sales and Use Tax Law. Applications for registration must include business name, location, and other required information. An application for registration with the board must be authenticated as prescribed, including business details and other necessary information."
