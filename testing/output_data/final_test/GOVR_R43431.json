    "content": "The House and Senate Agriculture Committees have jurisdiction over forestry and national forests, while national forests from the public domain fall under the House Natural Resources Committee and the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Past farm bills have addressed forestry, and standalone forestry legislation has also passed through the agriculture committees. These committees have had a significant impact on federal forestry activities, including the oversight of key legislation such as the Forest and Rangelands Renewable Resources Planning Act and the National Forest Management Act. The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 (HFRA) was referred to and reported by the agriculture committees, which also have jurisdiction over forestry research and assistance programs. These programs, including forest management, forestry research, and forestry assistance, are key branches of USDA's Forest Service. Forestry assistance is governed by the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978 (CFAA), while forestry research is governed by the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Research Act of 1978. Congress considered an omnibus farm bill with a forestry title for nearly three years. The 2014 farm bill, signed into law in February 2014, repealed, created, modified, and reauthorized several forestry programs. The House and Senate bills passed in September 2013, with a conference agreement reached in January 2014. The 2014 farm bill repealed, created, modified, and reauthorized forestry programs, including repealing programs not funded for several years. The 2014 farm bill repealed programs such as the Land Enhancement Program, forestry scholarships to Hispanic-serving institutions, and a watershed assistance program for tribes. It also included provisions to repeal the Watershed Forestry Assistance Program and the Cooperative National Forest Products Marketing Program. Additionally, the bill reauthorized several forestry programs through FY2018. Section 8201 of the 2014 farm bill reauthorizes $5 million annually for the Rural Revitalization Technologies Program. Section 8202 reauthorizes the Office of International Forestry. Section 8203 eliminates mandatory funding for the Healthy Forest Reserve Program but authorizes $12 million annually. The bill also has provisions affecting the management of the National Forest System, primarily by amending HFRA. The 2014 farm bill includes provisions amending HFRA to expedite planning and project implementation for the National Forest System. It reauthorizes programs for streamlining timber sale and restoration projects, but differs in adopted provisions between House and Senate bills. Some provisions may also apply to federal land managed by the Bureau of Land Management. The 2014 farm bill modifies administrative appeals requirements for land and resource management planning in the National Forest System. It repeals the Appeals Reform Act and replaces it with a pre-decisional objection process. Certain projects excluded from NEPA assessments do not have administrative review available. The 2014 farm bill permanently reauthorizes stewardship end-results contracting authority for Forest Service and BLM projects. It allows for dual service and timber sale contracts for up to 10 years to achieve land management goals, with fire liability provisions. The bill also alters FS timber sale contract requirements, allowing for material designation through description or prescription. The 2014 farm bill permanently reauthorizes the Forest Service's and BLM's Good Neighbor Authority nationwide, allowing state agencies to conduct watershed restoration projects on national forest land. It also requires the Forest Service to designate treatment areas in each state for declining forest conditions. The 2014 farm bill allows state agencies to conduct watershed restoration projects on national forest land through the Good Neighbor Authority. It also designates treatment areas for declining forest conditions and establishes a NEPA categorical exclusion for projects under 3,000 acres. Additionally, the bill includes provisions for revising the strategic plan for forest inventory and analysis programs and authorizes the use of funds for hiring retired employees for technical services. The 2014 farm bill includes provisions for various forestry-related programs on National Forest System lands, such as the Conservation Experienced Services Program and a large air-tanker and aerial asset lease program. It also authorizes a land conveyance in the Jefferson National Forest in Wise County, VA. Additionally, the bill reauthorizes and modifies programs to assist private landowners in practicing conservation on their agricultural and forested lands. Section 2101(a) reauthorizes the Conservation Stewardship Program until FY2018, providing financial and technical assistance for conservation on eligible lands, including nonindustrial private forest lands. Section 2203 reauthorizes the Environmental Quality Incentives Program through FY2018 for promoting conservation on eligible lands. Section 2401 includes forest restoration activities in the Regional Conservation Partnership Program. Section 2301 allows nonindustrial private forest land as an eligible land use for agricultural land easements in the Agriculture Conservation Easement Program. Section 2702 repeals the emergency forestry conservation reserve program for hurricane-damaged areas in 2005. This title reauthorizes funding through FY2018 for agricultural and cooperative research, extension, and education programs. It establishes a forestry research initiative in the Forest Service's Forest Products Laboratory. The title also modifies USDA programs to incentivize renewable energy projects and promote biofuels production. Section 9001 adds the definition of \"Forest Product\" for renewable biomass use. Section 9010 authorizes $25 million annually through FY2018 for the Biomass Crop Assistance Program, providing financial assistance for biomass feedstock production. Section 9012 extends the Community Wood Energy Program through FY2018, offering grants for wood energy systems in public buildings. Section 9011 repeals the Forest Biomass for Energy Program, eliminating a competitive research program for forest biomass energy use. The research and development program encourages the use of forest biomass for energy with annual appropriations of $15 million (FY2009-FY2013). Section 12313 amends the Clean Water Act, stating that no permit is needed for runoff from specified silviculture activities conducted according to industry standards. Some forestry programs may need reauthorization due to periodic farm bills, addressing issues like wildfire protection and conservation for private forest owners. The 2014 farm bill addressed various forestry issues such as wildfire protection, conservation for private forest owners, research for traditional and renewable forest products, and invasive species eradication. Some proposed changes, like eliminating permanent authorizations for certain programs, were not included in the final bill but may be revisited in future legislation. The 2014 farm bill did not include provisions for funding authority issues, but they could resurface. Debate may continue on issues like deteriorating forest resiliency, wildfire response, and climate change adaptation. Previous farm bills have included forestry provisions primarily focusing on forestry assistance programs. The 1990 farm bill created new forestry assistance programs and revised existing ones. The 1996 and 2002 farm bills included various forestry provisions, such as assistance programs, research programs, and the creation of an international forestry branch. The 2014 farm bill did not address funding authority issues but focused on forest resiliency, wildfire response, and climate change adaptation. The 2008 farm bill included a Forestry title with national priorities for private forest management, competitive funding for programs, new conservation and reforestation programs, and amendments to the Lacey Act. It also established a tribal relations program and grants program for Hispanic-serving institutions. The 2008 farm bill Forestry title included revisions to national forest boundaries, timber contract provisions, conservation actions definition, softwood lumber imports reporting, tax treatments for forests, woody biomass energy programs, and amendments to the Lacey Act."
