    "content": "The \"Stem Cell Research Investment Act of 2005\" is also known as the \"Stem Cell Research Bonds\" which provides incentives for stem cell research through tax credits to holders of qualified bonds. The \"Stem Cell Research Investment Act of 2005\" offers tax credits to holders of qualified stem cell research bonds. Taxpayers holding these bonds can receive a credit against their tax liability, calculated at 25 percent of the annual credit determined for the bond. The tax credit rate for qualified stem cell research bonds is determined by the applicable credit rate multiplied by the outstanding face amount of the bond. The applicable credit rate is based on the average market yield on outstanding long-term corporate debt obligations. In certain cases, the credit amount is prorated based on the timing of bond issuance and redemption. The tax credit for qualified stem cell research bonds is determined by the applicable credit rate multiplied by the bond's face amount. The credit amount is prorated based on the timing of bond issuance and redemption, with limitations on the tax credit based on the amount of tax for each taxable year. Unused credits can be carried over to the following year. The tax credit for qualified stem cell research bonds can be carried over to the following taxable year and added to the credit allowable for that year. A qualified stem cell research bond is defined as a bond issued for interdisciplinary scientific and medical research related to stem cells, therapy development, and clinical trials, issued by a State or local government and designated for this purpose. The term 'stem cell' refers to a cell with the ability to divide indefinitely and give rise to specialized cells. Human embryonic stem cells can be used in research supported by bonds if they were derived from embryos donated from fertility clinics and created for fertility treatment purposes. Prior to embryo donation for research, individuals seeking fertility treatment ensured embryos would not be implanted in a woman and consented to their use for research purposes. The entity involved in fertility treatment for creating the embryo must not receive any compensation related to the donation. Additionally, a report on researcher activities must be submitted annually for bonds used in stem cell research. The text discusses the requirements for research conducted with bonds, defines terms like \"credit allowance date\" and \"bond,\" and limits the amount of bonds that can be designated in a calendar year. The text limits the amount of bonds that can be designated in a calendar year, with a national qualified stem cell research bond limitation of $10 billion for the years 2006, 2007, and 2008. Each issuer is restricted to not more than 20 percent of the national limitation amount. The text sets a national qualified stem cell research bond limitation of $10 billion for the years 2006, 2007, and 2008. Any excess amount allocated in a calendar year increases the limitation for the following year. Gross income includes the credit allowed under this section, and any recaptured credit is treated as interest income. If a qualified stem cell research bond ceases to qualify, the issuer must repay the credits received for the bond for the current year and two previous years, plus interest. If a qualified stem cell research bond no longer qualifies, the issuer must repay the credits received for the bond for the current year and two previous years, plus interest. Failure to pay will result in an increased tax for bond holders. The section discusses adjustments to tax credits not used to reduce tax liability, with no credits allowed against tax increases. It also mentions that regulated investment companies holding qualified stem cell research bonds can claim the credit. The section allows for the separation of ownership of qualified stem cell research bonds and the entitlement to the tax credit. The credit will be given to the person holding the entitlement instrument on the credit allowance date, not the bond holder. The qualified stem cell research bond is treated as a stripped bond and the credit as a stripped coupon. The credit can be used for estimated tax purposes. The credit is transferable through sale and repurchase agreements. Issuers must submit reports similar to section 149(e) and annual reports are required. Issuers of qualified stem cell research bonds must submit annual reports to the Secretary by March 31 each year. The report should detail activities funded by the bonds and whether research for a specific purpose has been conducted. This section does not apply to bonds issued after September 30, 2008. The reporting of credit on qualified stem cell research bonds for interest payments is amended to include amounts in gross income under section 1400N(f) as paid on the credit allowance date. Regulations apply for reporting to corporations, with specific subsections disregarded. The Secretary has regulatory authority in this matter. The Secretary has regulatory authority to prescribe necessary regulations for reporting on qualified stem cell research bonds. A conforming amendment is made to the table of subchapters for chapter 1 of the Code. The amendments made by this section regarding stem cell research bonds apply to obligations issued after December 31, 2005."
