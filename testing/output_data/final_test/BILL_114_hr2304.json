The SPEAK FREE Act of 2015 allows for a special motion to dismiss SLAPP suits within specific timeframes in Federal court. The court must schedule a hearing within 30 days of the motion, which can be postponed for up to 60 days under certain conditions, but must be held within 90 days of the motion being served. The court may extend the hearing date for specified discovery under subsection (a) of section 4203, but must set the hearing within 120 days of the special motion to dismiss a SLAPP suit. The court must rule on the special motion within 30 days of the final paper filing or argument date.

A stay issued under subsection (a) based on the filing of a special motion to dismiss under section 4202, that only seeks dismissal of a third-party claim or a cross claim asserted by a defendant shall only apply to discovery requested by the party. The defendant's special motion to dismiss only applies to discovery related to the third-party claim or cross claim. An aggrieved party can appeal an order on the special motion to dismiss. A person can file a motion to quash if their personally identifying information is requested, and it will be granted unless the responding party proves the claim is valid. Sec. 4206 outlines the procedure for removal of a civil action in a State court to the district court of the United States if it raises a claim described in section 4202(a). Removal can be requested by showing grounds in the petition, except in certain exceptions. The exception to removal under paragraph (1) is for third-party or cross claims. If a motion to dismiss is not appealed or all appeals are exhausted, remaining claims are remanded to State court. A motion to quash can be made in a State court for requests or orders. Sec. 4207 outlines the awarding of attorneys fees, costs, and sanctions for prevailing on a motion to dismiss or quash under sections 4202 and 4205. A prevailing party is entitled to litigation costs, expert witness fees, and reasonable attorneys fees.

The court may award litigation costs, expert witness fees, and attorneys fees to the party responding to frivolous motions or notices, except for the Federal Government and State entities.
