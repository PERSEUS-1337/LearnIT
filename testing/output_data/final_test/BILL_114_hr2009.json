    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Pascua Yaqui Tribe Land Conveyance Act\" and includes definitions for clarity. SEC. 2 of the \"Pascua Yaqui Tribe Land Conveyance Act\" provides definitions for key terms such as District, Map, Recreation and Public Purposes Act, Secretary, and Tribe. SEC. 3 of the \"Pascua Yaqui Tribe Land Conveyance Act\" declares approximately 39.65 acres of Federal lands as \"Parcel A\" to be held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the Tribe. This will take effect after the District relinquishes its rights to the land. The United States will convey approximately 13.24 acres of Federal lands to the District as \"Parcel B\" upon payment of fair market value. The Secretary will determine the property's value following specific appraisal standards, with all conveyance costs to be covered by the District. The District can acquire the Federal reversionary interest in approximately 27.5 acres of land known as \"Parcel C\" by submitting an offer within 1 year of the appraisal. The Secretary must convey the reversionary interest within 30 days of the offer. Additionally, a survey of the lands must be completed within 90 days of the enactment of the Act. The Secretary must conduct a survey to determine the boundaries and acreage of the lands with Federal reversionary interest. An appraisal of the Federal interest must be completed within 180 days, and the District must pay the appraised value for the conveyance of the interest. The District must pay all costs related to the conveyance, including survey and appraisal expenses, within 30 days of the conveyance. SEC. 5 prohibits the Tribe from conducting gaming activities on lands acquired under this Act, regardless of claimed authority or federal laws like the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. SEC. 6 addresses water rights. SEC. 6 of the Act states that there will be no Federal reserved right to water for land taken into trust for the Tribe, and the Tribe retains any State water rights. Water rights appurtenant to the land may not be forfeited or abandoned, and nothing in the Act affects the Tribe's rights under Public Law 95-375. The clerk's attestation is signed by Karen L. Haas."
