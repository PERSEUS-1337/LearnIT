    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 832.3 of the Penal Code is amended. Any sheriff, undersheriff, or deputy sheriff, as well as police officers, must complete a training course prescribed by the Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training before exercising their powers, with exceptions for supervised field training programs. Police chiefs appointed after January 1, 1999, must also complete this training within two years of appointment. The training requirements for a deputy sheriff, police chief, and police officer in a local law enforcement agency are the same. The commission will develop a testing program with standardized tests for peace officer training to ensure competency and standardization. Test scores will only be used for approved purposes and research. The commission will maintain confidentiality of test data and determine passing scores for trainees. Passing the tests is required for successful completion of the training. Approved presenters will administer standardized tests or facilitate the commission's administration of tests to trainees. Community colleges may give preference in enrollment to employed law enforcement trainees who complete training as prescribed by this section, with at least 15 percent of each presentation consisting of non-law enforcement trainees if available. Preference should only be given when the trainee cannot complete the course within the required time and no other training program is reasonably available. Average daily attendance for these courses must be reported for state aid. The commission will report to the Legislature on academy proficiency testing scores before July 1, 1987, including an evaluation of the correlation between test scores and performance as a peace officer. Deputy sheriffs under Section 830.1(c) are exempt from certain training requirements if their assignments are custodial-related. They must complete peace officer training, Board of State and Community Corrections training, and local detention facility training within 120 days of employment. Deputy sheriffs under Section 830.1(c) must complete training before being reassigned from custodial duties to crime prevention and law enforcement responsibilities. They are eligible for reassignment within three years of training completion and do not need to requalify for five years after training. Deputy sheriffs under Section 830.1(c) can be reassigned to law enforcement duties within three years of completing training and do not need to requalify for five years after training. Deputy sheriffs can be reassigned to law enforcement duties within three years of training completion without needing to requalify for five years. The deputy sheriff must remain employed by the same department and maintain required training for crime prevention and law enforcement duties. Any school police officer hired after July 1, 1999, must complete basic training before acting as a peace officer. The Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training will provide specialized training for school peace officers to address the unique safety needs of schools. Any school peace officer hired before July 1, 1999, must complete specialized training by July 1, 2002. Those hired after that date have two years to complete the training. Section 832.3 is added to the Penal Code for this purpose, effective until January 1, 2019. Any sheriff, undersheriff, or deputy sheriff, as well as police officers, must complete training prescribed by the Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training before exercising their powers, with a deadline for completion within two years of appointment for police chiefs and other agency heads. The training requirements for a deputy sheriff, police chief, and police officer in a local law enforcement agency are the same. The commission develops standardized tests for peace officer training to ensure competency and standardization. Test scores are confidential and used for comparison and assessment purposes. Passing these tests is required for successful completion of the training. Presenters approved by the commission will administer standardized tests or facilitate their administration to all trainees as required for peace officer training. Community colleges may give enrollment preference to employed law enforcement trainees who complete training as prescribed by this section. At least 15 percent of each presentation should consist of non-law enforcement trainees if available. Preference is only given when the trainee cannot complete the course within the required time and no other training program is reasonably available. Average daily attendance for these courses must be reported for state aid. Before July 1, 1987, the commission will report to the Legislature on academy proficiency testing scores and evaluate the correlation between these scores and performance as a peace officer.

They must complete peace officer training, training for custodial personnel, and training for local detention facilities within 120 days of employment. Deputy sheriffs under Section 830.1(c) must complete training before being reassigned to crime prevention duties. School police officers hired after July 1, 1999, need to complete training before exercising peace officer powers, except during a supervised field training program. The commission prepares specialized training for school peace officers to address school safety needs. Officers hired before July 1, 1999, must complete the training by July 1, 2002, while those hired after must do so within two years. This section becomes effective on January 1, 2019."
