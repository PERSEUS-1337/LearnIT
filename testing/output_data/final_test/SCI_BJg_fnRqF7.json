    "content": "In this paper, a Deep Autoencoder Mixture Clustering (DAMIC) algorithm is proposed, based on a mixture of deep autoencoders where each cluster is represented by an autoencoder. The clustering network transforms data into another space and selects a cluster, using the associated autoencoder to reconstruct the data-point. The algorithm learns nonlinear data representation and a set of autoencoders by minimizing the reconstruction loss. Experimental evaluations on image and text corpora show significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods in clustering objects. In machine learning, clustering involves extracting feature vectors from objects and aggregating them in a feature space using algorithms like k-means. Clustering high-dimensional datasets is challenging, leading to the use of representation learning to map data into a low-dimensional space. Unsupervised deep learning approaches, particularly using deep neural networks, have been applied for clustering in recent years. These methods focus on clustering in a low-dimensional feature space generated by autoencoders or variational autoencoders. Deep neural networks can transform data into clustering-friendly representations. A deep version of k-means learns a data representation and applies k-means in the embedded space. Most deep clustering algorithms include a clustering term in the embedded space and a regularization term to prevent data collapsing. Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) is pre-trained using an autoencoder reconstruction loss and optimizes cluster centroids through a Kullback-Leibeler divergence loss. Deep Clustering network (DCN) is also utilized for clustering. In contrast to DEC, the Deep Clustering network (DCN) uses k-means for clustering and a combination of autoencoder reconstruction loss and k-means clustering loss function for training. The method requires an alternation process between network training and cluster updates. An algorithm is proposed for unsupervised clustering within the mixture-of-experts framework, where each cluster is represented by an autoencoder neural network. The proposed algorithm for deep clustering utilizes a low-dimensional embedded space directed by a softmax classification layer. It avoids clustering collapsing issues and does not require separate regularization terms for parameter tuning. Unlike previous methods, the learning method of the embedding latent space is different, as it does not rely solely on an autoencoder for controlling the embedded space. The proposed deep learning clustering algorithm utilizes a low-dimensional embedded space guided by a softmax classification layer. It does not require decoding in the clustering process and aims to organize data into distinct clusters. The method shows significant improvement over existing techniques on various datasets. The algorithm does not rely on a tuned regularization term to prevent clustering collapse and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard datasets. The proposed clustering algorithm utilizes a deep learning approach with autoencoders specialized for each cluster instead of centroids. It involves a (soft) clustering network that assigns points to clusters based on a distribution. The algorithm is unsupervised, so the network is trained indirectly. The clustering algorithm uses autoencoders specialized for each cluster instead of centroids. The network is unsupervised, so clustering results are used for accurate reconstruction of the input data. Each cluster is represented by a cluster-specialized autoencoder, aiming for small reconstruction errors. The training procedure aims to minimize the error of cluster-based reconstruction by finding a clustering of the data. Unlike other deep clustering methods, this approach avoids collapsing to a trivial solution where all data points are transformed to the same vector. The goal is to minimize the reconstruction error by simultaneously performing data clustering in the embedded space and learning a 'centroid' representation for each cluster using autoencoders. The training procedure aims to minimize the error of cluster-based reconstruction by finding a clustering of the data. The goal is to minimize the reconstruction error by simultaneously performing data clustering in the embedded space and learning a 'centroid' representation for each cluster using autoencoders. There is no need to add regularization terms to prevent data collapsing, as the reconstruction error of the autoencoders is used to obtain soft labels for training the clustering network. Initialization is crucial for handling hard optimization problems paused by unsupervised clustering tasks. A single autoencoder is trained and layer-wise pre-training is used. K-means clustering is then carried out on the bottleneck layer output to obtain initial clustering values. These labels are used to pre-train the clustering network. The network parameters are jointly trained to minimize autoencoding reconstruction after initialization. The proposed algorithm, Deep Autoencoder Mixture Clustering (DAMIC), trains network parameters to minimize autoencoding reconstruction error. DAMIC is an extension of the k-means algorithm, replacing centroids with data-driven representations computed by autoencoders. The probabilistic modeling in DAMIC is akin to a mixture-of-experts model. The MoE model consists of expert models and a gate model, with experts making decisions and the gate selecting the relevant expert. MoE has been used in supervised tasks like classification and regression, with autoencoders serving as experts in clustering algorithms. The clustering network acts as the MoE gating function, with a cost function encouraging expert specialization. The goal is to cluster data points into k clusters. The text discusses clustering data points into k clusters using a nonlinear representation and autoencoders. The approach involves training a single autoencoder for the dataset, applying the k-means algorithm in the embedded space, and using k-means clustering to initialize network parameters. The final clustering is evaluated through experiments on various datasets, including image and text datasets, comparing the method to other deep clustering algorithms. The study utilized image datasets like MNIST and text datasets such as 20NEWS and RCV1 to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. The text datasets were sparse, so the top 2000 words with the highest tf-idf values were selected for each document. The clustering performance was evaluated based on three standard measures. The clustering performance of the proposed DAMIC algorithm is evaluated using three standard measures: normalized mutual information (NMI), clustering accuracy (ACC), and adjusted Rand index (ARI). NMI measures the information overlap between ground-truth classes and obtained clusters, while ACC assesses the correct mapping of data points to classes. ARI adjusts the Rand index for chance grouping. NMI and ACC range from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating perfect clustering, while ARI ranges from -1 to 1. The DAMIC algorithm is compared with classic k-means. The DAMIC algorithm is compared with classic k-means in terms of clustering performance. The algorithm involves applying a DAE followed by KM to the embedded layer, performing joint reconstruction and k-means clustering simultaneously. It uses penalties on reconstruction and clustering losses, implements joint embedding and clustering in the embedded space, and utilizes Tensorflow for implementation. The architecture uses ReLU for neurons except the output layer, which uses sigmoid for DAEs and softmax for clustering network output. The DAMIC algorithm utilizes DAEs with sigmoid function and softmax layer for clustering. Batch normalization and ADAM optimizer are used, with 50 epochs for training. The network architecture consists of 5-layer DNNs for DAEs and a clustering network with ReLUs, with a fixed input size. The MNIST dataset consists of 70000 hand-written gray-scale digit images, each 28x28 pixels in size. The DAE architecture used for this dataset includes a 5-layer network with 1024, 256, 10, 256, 1024 neurons, and a clustering network with 3-layers of 512, 512, 10 neurons. The output layers of the DAE and clustering network are set to sigmoid and softmax functions, respectively. The results show that the DAMIC method outperforms other methods in terms of NMI. The DAMIC method outperforms other methods in NMI and ARI measures. The DEC method achieves the highest ACC result. Each DAE assumes a different pattern of the input, responsible for a different digit. The clustering task is unsupervised, and the autoencoders are sorted by corresponding digits for visualization. An image of the digit '4' was fed to the network, and the outputs of the different DAEs are depicted. The 20Newsgroup corpus consists of 18,846 documents from 20 news groups. The DAEs in the experiment have 5-layer architectures with different numbers of neurons. The clustering network shows high accuracy with a decision of p(c = 4|x; \u03b8 c ) = 0.99. Results of NMI, ARI, and ACC measures indicate that the proposed clustering method outperforms baselines. The experiment used a subset of the RCV-1-v2 dataset with 365,968 documents and 20 topics. The DAEs had specific neuron configurations, and the clustering method outperformed other methods in NMI and ARI measures. The DAMIC algorithm outperforms other methods in NMI and ARI measures but has lower results in the ACC measure. A synthetic data was generated with 4000 samples from four Gaussian clusters. The DAE+KM algorithm was used for initialization, but the DAE's embedded space was not well separated. The DAMIC algorithm was then applied with a 5-layer autoencoder architecture. The clustering network in the experiment had 256, 4, 256, 1024 neurons, while the clustering network had 512, 512, 2 neurons. The DAMIC algorithm outperformed other algorithms in NMI and ARI measures on synthetic data. The technique presented leverages deep neural networks for clustering, representing clusters with an autoencoder network instead of a single centroid vector. This richer representation avoids data collapsing issues and the need for tuned regularization terms.
