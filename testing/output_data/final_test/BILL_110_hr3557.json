    "content": "The \"Restore American Dream Act of 2007\" is cited as the short title. It amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a new section on homeownership plans. The \"Restore American Dream Act of 2007\" introduces a new section on homeownership plans in the Internal Revenue Code. Individuals can deduct cash payments made to a homeownership plan, with limitations on the maximum deduction, not exceeding compensation, and within a specific contribution period. The \"Restore American Dream Act of 2007\" allows individuals to deduct cash payments to a homeownership plan, with restrictions on the number of plans per year for married individuals. The \"Restore American Dream Act of 2007\" allows merging of homeownership plans for married individuals, with each person still able to contribute to the combined plan. A homeownership plan is defined as a trust for qualified residence expenses, subject to ownership limitations. The \"Restore American Dream Act of 2007\" allows merging of homeownership plans for married individuals, with each person still able to contribute to the combined plan. A trust can be created with specific requirements such as accepting cash contributions only, trustee being a bank or meeting certain criteria, no investment in life insurance contracts, assets invested as directed by the account holder, and no commingling of trust assets with other property. The \"Restore American Dream Act of 2007\" allows merging of homeownership plans for married individuals. The trust created must meet specific requirements, including accepting cash contributions only, having a bank trustee, no investment in life insurance contracts, assets invested as directed by the account holder, and no commingling of trust assets with other property. The individual's interest in the account balance is nonforfeitable, and the entire interest will be distributed to the individual at the end of the contribution period. Qualified principal residence acquisition expenses include expenses for acquiring a principal residence. Ownership limitations apply to the account holder. The account holder must be an individual who has never owned a principal residence after the age of 19 (or 24 for students). The term 'principal residence' is defined as in section 121. The contribution period is a 9-year period starting from the establishment of the homeownership plan. The contribution period for a homeownership plan is a 9-year period starting from its establishment, with a maximum limit of 14 years. Contributions are deemed made on the last day of the preceding taxable year if made on time. Financial hardship allows for withdrawals in case of immediate and heavy financial need. Withdrawals from a homeownership plan can be made in cases of heavy financial need, as long as the withdrawal amount is necessary to relieve the need and does not exceed the required amount. Such withdrawals used for qualified principal residence acquisition expenses are not taxable, while amounts not used for this purpose are taxable. Excess contributions to a homeownership plan can be returned before the due date of the tax return if they exceed the allowable deduction amount, as long as the distribution includes the net income attributable to the excess contribution. Any excess contribution to a homeownership plan must be included in the individual's gross income for the taxable year. Transfers of the plan incident to divorce or death are not taxable transfers and are treated as the spouse's homeownership plan. Transfers of a decedent's interest in a homeownership plan to their spouse are not taxable. The surviving spouse's interest is treated as their own homeownership plan. Homeownership plans are exempt from taxation unless they cease to be a homeownership plan. The homeownership plan is subject to taxes under section 511 if any prohibited transactions occur, causing the plan to lose its exemption. Financial hardship exceptions apply for transactions made to pay medical expenses. The homeownership plan may lose its exemption and be subject to taxes if prohibited transactions occur. Exceptions for financial hardship include using the plan to pay medical or funeral expenses for a family member. If the plan ceases to be a homeownership plan, all assets are treated as distributed. During a taxable year, if an individual uses a homeownership plan as loan security, that portion is treated as distributed to them. If the individual acquires a principal residence, the plan ceases to be a homeownership plan, and all assets are distributed to the individual. An individual in a homeownership plan is not considered to have acquired a principal residence if they marry someone who already owns one but do not gain ownership themselves. Additionally, a 10 percent tax is imposed on any distribution from the plan that is included in gross income and not used for purchasing a principal residence. For disability or death cases, the 10 percent tax on distributions from a homeownership plan does not apply if the individual becomes disabled or dies. Custodial accounts are treated as trusts if held by a bank or another entity meeting specific criteria. The trustee of a homeownership plan must report to the Secretary and the individual for whom the plan is maintained on contributions, distributions, and other matters as required by regulations. A trust created by an employer for the exclusive benefit of employees can be treated as a homeownership plan if it meets specific requirements in the governing instrument. The homeownership plan must meet specific requirements in the governing instrument, including separate accounting for each employee's interest and satisfying additional requirements set by the Secretary. Deductions for retirement savings are allowed in arriving at adjusted gross income. Paragraph (7) of section 62(a) of the tax code is amended to include deductions for housing in addition to retirement savings. Section 4973 is also amended to include a homeownership plan as a tax-favored account subject to excess contribution tax. In the case of a homeownership plan, \"excess contributions\" refer to the amount exceeding the deductible limit under section 224. An individual in a homeownership plan is exempt from the tax on prohibited transactions if the plan ceases to be a homeownership plan. The text discusses amendments to the tax code regarding homeownership plans, specifically addressing failure to provide reports on such plans. The amendments include changes to subsections and penalties for non-compliance. Amendments to the tax code include adding a new subparagraph related to homeownership plans. Clerical amendments are made to the table of sections in the tax code. The amendments made by this section regarding homeownership plans and cross-references will apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2007."
