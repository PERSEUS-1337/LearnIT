The website must include citations to the reports' requirements and electronic copies of the reports. The \"Access to Congressionally Mandated Reports Act\" mandates the creation of a website for public access to electronic copies of congressionally mandated reports. The website must provide open access to reports without restrictions and allow for easy retrieval through various search criteria. The website for public access to congressionally mandated reports must include document identification numbers, statute requirements, key words, full text search, and other relevant information specified by the Director of the Government Publishing Office. It should also display the time and date of report submission, provide access within 30 days, and offer permanent electronic access. The website for public access to congressionally mandated reports must include a means for bulk download, publishing of reports by Federal agencies, and a searchable list of reports. The Director of the Government Publishing Office cannot charge a fee or require registration for access to the website. The website required under subsection (a) must be enhanced and updated as necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act. SEC. 3. FEDERAL AGENCY RESPONSIBILITIES.
