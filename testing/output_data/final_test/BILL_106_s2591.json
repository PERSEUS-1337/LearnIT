    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Alternative Fuels Tax Incentives Act\". Since 1994, the United States has imported over half of its oil, with projections showing a continued increase in dependence on foreign oil. This reliance poses a national security risk and negatively impacts the country's trade balance. To address these issues, Congress should implement policy changes to promote the use of domestically-available alternative transportation fuels. To alleviate environmental consequences from oil dependence, widespread use of alternative-fuel vehicles is crucial. Tax credits are needed to encourage their purchase and fueling infrastructure development. Short-term policy should be fuel neutral to promote innovation and use of economically feasible fuels. To promote innovation and use of economically feasible fuels, market forces should decide the winners and losers of alternative fuels. SEC. 30B. CREDIT FOR ALTERNATIVE FUEL VEHICLES. The credit for alternative fuel vehicles allows a tax credit for the incremental cost of qualified vehicles placed in service during the taxable year. The applicable percentage varies based on the vehicle's weight and compliance with Clean Air Act standards. The tax credit for alternative fuel vehicles applies to vehicles meeting California's stringent emission standards or having a gross weight rating of 14,000 pounds or more with emissions levels not exceeding 50 percent of the standard. The tax credit for alternative fuel vehicles applies to vehicles meeting California's emission standards or certified for sale in California with emissions levels not exceeding 50 percent of the standard. The incremental cost of a qualified alternative fuel vehicle is the excess of the manufacturer's suggested retail price over a gasoline or diesel vehicle of the same model, up to $5,000 for vehicles under 8,500 pounds gross weight rating. The tax credit for alternative fuel vehicles is based on the vehicle's gross weight rating, ranging from $10,000 to $50,000. A qualified alternative fuel motor vehicle is defined as one that operates solely on alternative fuel, is new to the taxpayer, and is acquired for personal use or lease. This credit can be applied in conjunction with other credits. The tax credit for alternative fuel vehicles is limited by the regular tax for the year minus other applicable credits, and the tentative minimum tax. Definitions include alternative fuel types and what constitutes a motor vehicle for the credit. The basis of property eligible for a credit is reduced by the amount of the credit allowed. No double benefit is allowed for deductions or credits related to the same cost. Leased vehicles must disclose any credit to the lessee. Regulations provide for recapturing any benefit of the credit. No credit allowed for certain properties or vehicle if taxpayer elects not to apply. Section does not apply to property placed in service after December 31, 2007.

The amendment to Section 30 of the Internal Revenue Code removes the 10 percent limitation on the credit allowed for vehicles. The new limitation for vehicles with a top speed not exceeding 50 miles per hour is the lesser of 10 percent of the vehicle cost or $4,250. The new limitation for electric vehicles varies based on vehicle specifications: $4,250 for vehicles with a top speed not exceeding 50 miles per hour, $6,375 for a driving range of at least 100 miles, $6,375 for a payload capacity of at least 1000 pounds, and $8,500 for vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating exceeding 8,500 but not exceeding 14,000 pounds. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 sets varying limitations for electric vehicles based on specifications such as gross vehicle weight rating. For vehicles exceeding 14,000 but not exceeding 26,000 pounds, the limitation is $21,250, and for vehicles exceeding 26,000 pounds, the limitation is $42,500. Amendments are made to sections 53(d)(1)(B)(iii) and 55(c)(2) of the Code.
