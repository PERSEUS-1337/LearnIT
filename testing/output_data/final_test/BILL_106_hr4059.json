    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Online Privacy and Disclosure Act of 2000\" and includes definitions for key terms. The \"Online Privacy and Disclosure Act of 2000\" defines key terms such as data controller, personal data, data subject, Commission, and person. The Act aims to establish fair business practices for personal data collection, use, and dissemination, allowing businesses to display a seal certifying their adherence to these principles. The Commission is required to prevent unfair and deceptive practices related to the use of this seal. Data controllers can display an official seal certifying compliance with regulations set by the Commission, including principles like lawful and fair collection of personal data, ensuring data accuracy, and specifying purposes for data collection. The principles of data protection include purpose specification, use limitation, openness, and individual participation. Personal data should only be used for disclosed purposes with the consent of the data subject or by law. Data subjects should have easy access to information about their data and the data controller. Individuals have the right to request confirmation of data held about them, access to their data in a timely and understandable manner, reasons for denial of access, and the ability to challenge and correct their data. The accountability principle states that a data controller must comply with measures to uphold data protection principles, including the right to request data erasure, rectification, completion, or amendment. SEC. 5. PREVENTION OF UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE PRACTICES IN ADOPTION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF PRINCIPLES. The Commission is required to prescribe rules for data controllers to adopt a seal certifying compliance with specified principles. Deceptive use of the seal is prohibited. Rules must be established within 270 days of the Act's enactment, and enforcement measures will be in place for violations. Any violation of rules prescribed under subsection (a) of the Act will be treated as a violation of unfair or deceptive acts or practices under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Communications common carriers will be subject to the Commission's jurisdiction for enforcement purposes. SEC. 6. ADMINISTRATION AND APPLICABILITY OF ACT. The Act will be enforced by the Commission under the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Commission will prevent violations of its rules in the same manner as the Federal Trade Commission Act. Penalties and privileges will apply to violators. The Act will be enforced by the Commission with the same means, jurisdiction, power, and duties as the Federal Trade Commission Act. State laws related to the subject matter of this Act are not preempted, allowing states to enforce their own laws."
