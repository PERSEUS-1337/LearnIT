Congress finds that a healthy lifestyle includes a balanced diet and physical activity. Over 60% of American adults and 30% of American children are overweight or obese, leading to chronic health risks. The US ranks last in reducing preventable deaths from obesity-related illnesses. There has been a significant increase in meals eaten outside the home in the past two decades. Nutrition labeling has increased consumers' access to information about the foods they consume. Consumers have access to nutrition information for making healthy choices. Nutrition labeling is voluntarily provided by major food service establishments since 2008. Nutrient content of food can be determined accurately through various sources. The nutrient content of food can be accurately determined through various sources, such as laboratory analyses. Public health and welfare benefit when food service establishment nutrition information is not easily subject to frivolous litigation. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. Section 403(q) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include definitions for terms such as 'standard food item,' 'menu,' and 'reasonable basis.' The term 'food service establishment' refers to an establishment that sells specific types of food items. SEC. 4. NUTRITION LABELING EXEMPTION. Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act regarding exemptions for providing nutrition information. SEC. 5. VOLUNTARY NUTRITION LABELING. SEC. 5. VOLUNTARY NUTRITION LABELING. Food service establishments can voluntarily provide nutrition information for food items by meeting specific requirements, including disclosing written nutrition information on the premises and making it available upon request. Section 403(q) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires chain food service establishments with 20 or more locations to disclose calorie information on the menu board before purchase. Calorie information must be displayed on the menu board or a sign at eye level in the consumer queue before purchase. The menu must include additional nutrition information for all nutrients required by regulations, available in writing on the premises and upon consumer request before purchase. A referral statement must direct consumers to this information. The menu or menu board must include calorie information if not listed directly, stating the suggested daily caloric intake as 2000 calories or an alternative statement prescribed by the Secretary. This requirement does not apply to food offered for sale in a nonprofit food service establishment or food not described in specific subparagraphs. The menu must include calorie information for standard food items, with exemptions for certain foods as determined by the Secretary. Violations include purposefully failing to disclose required information or deceiving with disclosed information. One determination of nutrition information per standard food item is sufficient if portion size and recipe are consistent. The service establishment follows a standardized recipe and trains to a consistent method of preparation. SEC. 7. NATIONAL UNIFORMITY. Amends the requirement for nutrition labeling of food to align with section 403(q), with exemptions for certain establishments. SEC. 8. IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is mandated to promulgate proposed and final regulations for nutrition labeling of food service establishment food within specific timeframes. The Secretary may require additional nutrient information in food labeling to assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices. If deemed unnecessary, certain nutrient information may not be included in food menu item labeling. The Secretary may regulate to remove the requirement for including certain nutrient information in food menu item labeling to assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices. Alternative means may be prescribed to meet the labeling requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The amendments made by this Act will take effect upon enactment, with one specific amendment becoming effective 180 days after final regulations are issued. Additionally, technical changes are made to sections of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act."
