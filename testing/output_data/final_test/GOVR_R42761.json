    "content": "Periodically, tensions flare up between Japan and China over a small group of Japanese-administered islands in the East China Sea. The Senkaku-shoto in Japan, Diaoyu Dao in China, and Diaoyutai Lieyu in Taiwan are claimed by all three countries. The largest island, Uotsurijima, is roughly 1.5 square miles in area, with others ranging in size. Geologists believe the surrounding waters may have oil and gas deposits. The legal classification of these land features as islands is debated. The dispute between Japan and China over the Senkaku Islands has escalated since 2010, with events in 2012 intensifying the situation. Japan's purchase of three islands led to protests and increased Chinese military presence in the area. The escalation of the dispute between Japan and China over the Senkaku Islands has led to increased maritime law enforcement and military patrols in the East China Sea. Concerns about potential clashes have raised questions about the U.S. treaty commitment to protect Japan in the event of a crisis. This report focuses on the historical U.S. administration of the islands and the implications for the current situation. The Okinawa Reversion Treaty, approved by the Senate in 1971, addressed the Diaoyu/Diaoyutai islands and the U.S. view on the claims of the disputants. The relationship of the 1960 U.S.-Japan Security Treaty to the islands is also discussed. For more information on maritime disputes, refer to CRS reports. China and Taiwan both claim sovereignty over the Senkaku Islands (Diaoyu/Diaoyutai) based on historical reasons. China asserts that the islands were part of its maritime territory during the Ming and Qing Dynasties, but did not establish permanent settlements or maintain naval forces in the area. Japan, on the other hand, formally claimed the islands on January 14, 1895. Japan claimed the Senkaku Islands on January 14, 1895, arguing they were uninhabited and without owner. A Japanese citizen established settlements to extract materials. In May 1895, Japan and China signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, where China ceded Taiwan and all islands belonging to it, including the Senkakus. The Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895 did not mention the Senkaku Islands, leading to disputes between Japan, China, and Taiwan over their ownership. Japan's annexation of the islands after the Sino-Japanese War is contested, with China and Taiwan arguing that the islands should have been returned to China based on Allied declarations during World War II. When Japan relinquished authority over Taiwan in 1945, the disposition of the islands was not addressed. The 1951 Treaty of Peace with Japan did not mention the Senkaku Islands, but gave the United States administration powers over Nansei Shoto south of 29 north latitude, including the Ryukyu and Daito Islands. In 1953, the U.S. Civil Administration of the Ryukyus defined the boundaries to include the Senkakus. The Okinawa Reversion Treaty in 1971 included the Senkaku Islands under U.S. administration, with the U.S. Navy establishing firing ranges and paying rent. China disputes the U.S.-Japan agreements as \"backroom deals.\" The Okinawa Reversion Treaty in 1971 included the Senkaku Islands under U.S. administration, with the U.S. Navy establishing firing ranges and paying rent. The treaty defined the territories of the Ryukyu and Daito islands under U.S. jurisdiction, with boundaries that appear to include the Senkakus. The Okinawa Reversion Treaty in 1971 included the Senkaku Islands under U.S. administration, with the U.S. Navy establishing firing ranges and paying rent. Secretary of State William Rogers stated that the treaty did not affect the legal status of the Senkakus, despite returning administrative rights to Japan. The legal status of the Senkaku Islands is disputed between the Republic of China, Japan, and the People's Republic of China. The United States believes that returning administrative rights to Japan does not affect any underlying claims and maintains neutrality on the issue. The United States maintains neutrality on the sovereignty claims over the Senkaku Islands, emphasizing the distinction between administration and sovereignty in the 1960 U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. The Senate consented to the treaty despite objections regarding the inclusion of the Senkakus in the reversion of Okinawa to Japan. The Okinawa Reversion Treaty included the Senkakus in the definition of \"the Ryukyu Islands and the Daito Islands,\" making the Security Treaty applicable to them. This linkage was further solidified by Article II of the treaty, which stated that agreements between Japan and the U.S., including the Security Treaty, applied to the Ryukyu Islands and the Daito Islands. The Okinawa Reversion Treaty linked the Security Treaty to the Senkaku Islands, stating that the U.S. would defend Japan's obligations in the treaty area, including the Senkakus. In 2010, the U.S. reiterated its stance of neutrality on sovereignty but emphasized its commitment to defend Japan's interests. China's increased presence near the Senkakus in 2012 raised tensions. China responded to Japan's purchase of the Senkaku Islands in 2012 by deploying maritime law enforcement ships and increasing patrols in the area. This move was seen as an attempt to assert administrative control over the disputed territory and test Japan's resolve. The increased patrols have led to heightened tensions in the East China Sea, with reciprocal responses from Japan's Coast Guard and Air Self Defense Force. In response to China's actions in the East China Sea, the U.S. called for a halt to using the word \"neutral\" and declared that unilateral actions by China or Taiwan will not affect the U.S. acknowledgment of Japan's control over the Senkaku Islands. Congress included a resolution in the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act reaffirming this stance, which has been reiterated in subsequent bills and resolutions. Secretary Clinton also stated opposition to any unilateral actions undermining Japan's administration of the islands. President Obama and then-Secretary Clinton reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to Japan's control over the Senkaku Islands, opposing any unilateral actions that would undermine Japanese administration. Obama emphasized the importance of resolving disputes peacefully through dialogue and reiterated the U.S. treaty commitment to Japan's security, including the Senkakus. President Obama reiterated the U.S. commitment to Japan's control over the Senkaku Islands, emphasizing the importance of resolving the issue peacefully and not escalating the situation. He stated that the U.S. does not take a position on final sovereignty determinations but supports Japan's administration of the islands. During a joint press conference in Tokyo in February 2017, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis reaffirmed the U.S. recognition of Japanese administration of the Senkaku Islands and stated that the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty applies. President Trump also expressed commitment to Japan's security during a meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. President Donald Trump reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to Japan's security, including the Senkaku Islands, in a joint statement with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. China expressed strong opposition to the U.S. support for Japan's territorial claims, urging both countries to exercise caution to avoid escalating tensions in the region. The U.S. has increased support for Japan in the dispute over the Senkaku Islands, leading to greater diplomatic coordination and security cooperation between the two countries to counter China's assertiveness in the South China Sea. This includes increased sales of advanced military equipment and revisions to bilateral defense guidelines to enhance alliance cooperation in potential conflicts with China. These efforts align with the U.S. strategy to deter conflict and coercion in the Asia-Pacific region."
