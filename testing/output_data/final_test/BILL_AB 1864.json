    "title": "AB 1864",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 27491.41 of the Government Code is amended to define sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) as the unexpected death of an infant under age one with no clear cause after a thorough postmortem examination. The Legislature recognizes SIDS as a significant issue in California, leading to one out of every 500 infant deaths. Coroners are required to perform autopsies within 24 hours in cases of sudden infant death to aid in research and understanding of SIDS. If the attending physician certifies sudden infant death syndrome as the cause of death, the coroner may perform an autopsy. The coroner must also determine the cause of death using a standardized protocol developed by the State Department of Public Health. This protocol is exempt from certain administrative rules and regulations. The protocol for conducting autopsies on sudden infant death syndrome cases must be followed by all coroners in the state. It includes requirements for scene investigations, data collection, cause of death determination, tissue sampling, and submission to a central repository designated by the State Department of Public Health. The State Department of Public Health establishes procedures for researchers to access tissues and data for research with approval from the State Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects. The coroner can take tissue samples from infants who died suddenly without consent if it won't cause disfigurement. The coroner is not liable for actions taken in compliance with this section, and consent is not required for autopsies. Section 27491.41 of the Government Code is amended to define sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) as the unexpected death of an infant where no clear cause is found after a postmortem examination. SIDS is identified as the leading cause of death for children under one year old in California, affecting one in every 500 children. To address this issue, the coroner is required to conduct an autopsy within 24 hours of a sudden infant death to investigate potential causes and risk factors. The attending physician may certify sudden infant death syndrome as the cause of death without an autopsy, but the coroner can choose to perform one. The autopsy must follow a standardized protocol set by the State Department of Public Health. The protocol for conducting autopsies on sudden infant death syndrome cases in the state includes specific requirements for scene investigations, data collection, cause of death determination, tissue sampling, and submission to a central repository designated by the State Department of Public Health. The State Department of Public Health establishes procedures for researchers to access tissues and data for research with approval from the State Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects. Coroners can take tissue samples from infants who died suddenly without consent if it won't cause disfigurement. Coroners and physicians are not liable for actions taken in compliance with this section. Consent is not required for autopsies. Section 27491.42 of the Government Code defines \"sudden unexplained death in childhood\" as the sudden death of a child aged 1 to 18 that remains unexplained after a thorough postmortem examination. The coroner must inform the parent or guardian about the importance of taking tissue samples and is not liable for any actions taken in compliance with this section. Section 1.5 of the bill includes amendments to Section 27491.41 of the Government Code, contingent on the enactment of Senate Bill 1189. If both bills are enacted by January 1, 2017, and amend the same section, this provision will take effect. Reimbursement for mandated costs in the act will be provided to local agencies and school districts as per the Government Code."
