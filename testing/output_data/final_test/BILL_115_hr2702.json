    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"SBIR Commercialization Assistance Act of 2017\". This Act establishes a Commercialization Assistance Pilot Program. Section 9 of the Small Business Act is amended to include a Commercialization Assistance Pilot Program for eligible entities to receive a subsequent Phase II SBIR award within one year of enactment. If a covered agency already has a similar program, they may be exempt from this requirement. The Commercialization Assistance Pilot Program allows covered agencies to allocate up to 5% of SBIR program funds for subsequent Phase II SBIR awards. The program will terminate on September 30, 2022, and eligible entities must submit an application to participate. The Commercialization Assistance Pilot Program requires eligible entities to submit an application with specific information, including an updated Phase II commercialization plan and details on matching funding from a third-party investor. The Commercialization Assistance Pilot Program requires eligible entities to use funds for research and development activities that advance their Phase II program towards commercialization. Eligible entities cannot use funding from ineligible sources for matching requirements. Subsequent Phase II SBIR awards must adhere to certain limitations and be disbursed during Phase II. Eligible entities are selected based on specific criteria for participation in the program. The Commercialization Assistance Pilot Program requires eligible entities to use funds for research and development activities that advance their Phase II program towards commercialization. The head of a covered agency considers various factors when awarding funds, such as the potential for commercializing the research, the feasibility of the commercialization plan, and the societal benefits of the research. The evaluation of small business progress in Phase II for subsequent SBIR awards includes factors like investor expectations and the likelihood of commercial and societal benefits. The Comptroller General will submit an evaluation report to relevant committees within 3 years of the program's enactment. The report to be submitted to relevant committees will include a summary of commercialization assistance pilot programs, results achieved, commercialization rates of Phase II SBIR awardees, and growth in employment and revenue. The report will include a comparison of commercialization success between eligible entities in a commercialization assistance pilot program and recipients of an additional Phase II SBIR award, demographic information of participating entities, an account of funds used by each agency, and the amount of matching funding provided. The report will include an analysis of the effectiveness of the commercialization assistance pilot program implemented by covered agencies, recommendations for improvements to the program, and definitions for terms such as \"covered agency\" and \"eligible entity.\" The Phase II SBIR award under subsection (ff) involves eligibility criteria for third-party investors and sources of funding. Ineligible sources include internal research funds and non-cash forms of funding. The Phase II SBIR award eligibility criteria include funding sources such as owners, family members, affiliates, loans, and subsequent Phase II awards for further commercialization activities."
