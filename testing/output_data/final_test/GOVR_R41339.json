    "content": "Titles III and VI of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 aimed to address issues perceived as impediments to effective regulation of the banking industry. The final version of Title III sought to increase accountability of banking regulators and reduce regulatory arbitrage in the financial system by abolishing the Office of Thrift. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 abolished the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) to improve banking regulation. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) now oversees compliance with consumer protection laws for savings associations. The act also reassigns prudential supervision among federal regulators, with the OCC regulating federally chartered thrifts and national banks, and the FDIC regulating state-chartered thrifts and banks. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 abolished the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) and reassigned regulatory responsibilities. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) now regulates bank holding companies, thrift holding companies, and state-chartered banks. Provisions in the act aim to address perceived inadequacies in prudential regulation and discrepancies between the regulation of banks and savings associations. Provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act prevent depository institutions from changing charters without consent, enhance FRB's oversight of holding companies, and address regulatory differences among banking institutions. Title III of the Dodd-Frank Act addresses various banking regulations, including changes to deposit insurance assessments, increasing coverage to $250,000 retroactively to 2008, and establishing offices of Minority and Women Inclusion. Title VI tightens regulations on banking activities to ensure the safety of depository institutions and their holding companies, including controls on transactions with affiliates, derivative operations, lending limits, and restrictions on investments in hedge funds or proprietary trading. Title III of the Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions for transferring powers and duties from the OTS to other regulatory agencies, establishing a new regulatory structure, and affecting the FDIC and deposit insurance. It also establishes the Office of Minority and Women Inclusion and extends temporary deposit insurance coverage. Section 311 requires the distribution of OTS functions to the OCC, FDIC, and FRB. Section 311 of the Dodd-Frank Act mandates the transfer of OTS functions to OCC, FDIC, and FRB within a year, extendable by six months. Section 312 assigns supervision authority to FRB for savings and loan holding companies, OCC for federally chartered savings associations, and FDIC for state-chartered savings associations. Section 313 abolishes OTS and its Director 90 days post-transfer, while Section 314 tasks OCC with ensuring fair access to financial services and customer treatment. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates the transfer of OTS functions to OCC, FDIC, and FRB within a specified timeframe. It assigns supervision authority to different agencies for various types of savings associations and outlines provisions for the transition process. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates the transfer of OTS functions to OCC, FDIC, and FRB within a specified timeframe. The transfer involves cooperation among agencies for payment of expenses, personnel transfer, property, and administrative services. OTS employees will be transferred based on their functions, with provisions for retention rights and benefits. A plan for implementing Title III must be submitted to relevant committees and inspectors general within specific timeframes. Section 331 of the Dodd-Frank Act changes how assessments on depository institutions for deposit insurance are calculated, moving away from insured deposits to the average consolidated total assets minus tangible equity. The FDIC has the authority to adjust this for custodial banks and banker's banks. The plan must be submitted to relevant committees and inspectors general for review and reporting. Section 332 of the Dodd-Frank Act eliminates the requirement for the FDIC to refund or credit overpayments of assessments and allows for the suspension or limitation of dividend payments from excess reserves in the deposit insurance fund. It also mandates the FDIC to issue regulations on refunding overpayments or limiting dividend payments. Section 333 removes the need for FDIC approval before requiring additional reports from insured depository institutions, now only requiring consultation with the primary federal regulator. Section 334 increases the minimum reserve ratio for the Deposit Insurance Fund from 1.15% to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits or the comparable percentage of the assessment base. Section 335 of the Dodd-Frank Act mandates the FDIC to increase deposit insurance to $250,000 and applies this retroactively to depositors of institutions closed after January 1, 2008. Section 336 replaces the OTS Director with the Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on the FDIC Board of Directors. Section 341 allows savings associations converting to bank status to operate existing branches and acquire new branches in states where they operated before. Section 342 mandates various financial agencies to establish an Office of Minority and Women Inclusion for diversity in management and employment. The Director of the Office of Minority and Women Inclusion is responsible for diversity in management, employment, and business activities. They develop standards for equal employment opportunity and increased participation of minority- and women-owned businesses. The Director can recommend termination of contractors not promoting diversity. Agencies must report annually on workforce diversity efforts and partner with organizations for recruitment. FDIC and NCUA must provide insurance coverage for non-interest bearing accounts without limits. Title VI of the Bank and Savings Association Holding Company and Depository Institution Regulatory Improvements Act of 2010 addresses concerns about weakening banking companies' ability to focus on financial intermediation. It includes a temporary moratorium on FDIC approval of deposit insurance for new industrial loan companies and credit card banks. Title VI of the Bank and Savings Association Holding Company and Depository Institution Regulatory Improvements Act of 2010 introduces various regulatory measures for banking companies, including a moratorium on FDIC approval for new credit card banks. The Bank and Savings Association Holding Company and Depository Institution Regulatory Improvements Act of 2010 includes a moratorium on FDIC approval for new credit card banks, industrial banks, or trust banks in certain change in control situations involving commercial firms. Exceptions exist for institutions in default, danger of default, or for mergers/acquisitions of commercial firms. The Government Accountability Office must conduct a study within eighteen months on eliminating exceptions to the BHC Act definition of \"bank\" or \"bank holding company.\" The study by the Government Accountability Office aims to identify institutions exempt from FRB regulation under the BHC Act, evaluate regulatory frameworks, and assess the consequences of subjecting these institutions to the Act. Exceptions to be studied include state-chartered banks owned by thrift associations and banks controlled by trust companies or mutual savings banks. Section 604 of the BHC Act expands the FRB's authority over bank holding company subsidiaries, modifying the \"Fed-lite\" provisions of the GLBA. It removes limitations on FRB action against regulated subsidiaries and extends reporting requirements to cover compliance with all applicable federal laws. Exemptions include certain institutions like trust companies and credit card banks. Section 604 of the BHC Act expands the FRB's authority over bank holding company subsidiaries, focusing on risks to U.S. financial stability and compliance with federal laws. It includes entities regulated by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. Section 604 of the BHC Act expands the FRB's authority over bank holding company subsidiaries, focusing on risks to U.S. financial stability and compliance with federal laws. It includes entities regulated by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. Sections 604(g) and (h) provide authority for the FRB to require reports and examinations of thrift holding companies, coordinating with other regulators to avoid duplication. Section 604(i) modifies the definition of savings and loan holding company under HOLA. Section 604(d) requires the FRB to consider potential risks to the U.S. banking system in any proposed acquisition. Section 604(e) amends a provision of the BHC Act to require prior notice for financial holding company acquisitions involving savings. Section 605 of the BHC Act requires prior notice for acquisitions involving savings associations and FRB approval for acquisitions involving assets of $10 billion or more. It sets standards for the examination of non-depository subsidiaries of depository institution holding companies, ensuring they are examined in the same manner as insured depository institution subsidiaries. If the FRB does not conduct the examination, the regulator of the lead depository institution may recommend it. The FRB must conduct examinations of non-depository subsidiaries of depository institution holding companies to ensure compliance with laws and appropriate risk management. If the FRB fails to act within 60 days of a recommendation, the lead depository institution's regulator may conduct the examination and submit recommendations for supervisory actions to the FRB. If the FRB does not take enforcement action within 60 days, the recommending agency may take action. Coordination with the FRB is essential to avoid duplication and conflicting supervisory demands. Section 606 of the BHC Act amends the requirements for financial activities by a financial holding company, specifying that the holding company and its subsidiary depository institutions must be well capitalized and well managed. Savings and loan holding companies can engage in activities permissible for financial holding companies if they meet all requirements. Section 607 also amends the BHC Act and Bank Merger Act to increase regulatory oversight. Section 607 of the BHC Act and Bank Merger Act increases capital standards for interstate acquisitions and mergers by requiring well-managed and well-capitalized entities. It also expands restrictions on interaffiliate transactions, including purchases of assets subject to repurchase agreements and securities borrowing. Derivative transactions and credit exposure of member banks to affiliates are covered under Section 608, which limits the FRB's authority to grant exemptions. Exemptions must now be granted by regulation, and the FDIC must be notified before any exemption takes effect. The FRB, along with the appropriate federal banking agency, has authority to determine the calculation of covered transactions in netting agreements. Exemptions for transactions by national or state-chartered banks can be granted if deemed in the public interest and not presenting an unacceptable risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund. Section 608 amends the FRA to limit the FRB's flexibility in granting exemptions for interaffiliate transactions, requiring notification to the FDIC and no objection within 60 days if it poses a risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund. Similar amendments are made for HOLA transactions. Section 609 removes an exemption for bank transactions with subsidiaries, making them subject to FRA section 23A one year after the transfer date. Section 610 and 611 of the FRA address lending limits for national and state-chartered banks, including credit exposures from derivative transactions. Section 612 prohibits depository institutions from converting charters while under enforcement orders without notifying regulators. The new regulator must ensure the implementation of a plan to address supervisory concerns and any conversion proposed, with no objection from the former regulator. Section 613 allows banks to establish de novo branches interstate, overcoming state laws that previously hindered out-of-state banks from branching into a new state. Section 614 adds credit exposure from derivative transactions to restrictions on loans by member banks to insiders, with the FRB authorized to issue implementing rules. Section 616 of the BHC Act, the Savings & Loan Holding Company Act, and the International Lending Supervision Act of 1983 requires federal banking regulators to make capital requirements countercyclical. This means that the amount of capital required to be maintained by holding companies and insured depository institutions should increase during economic expansion and decrease during economic contraction for safety and soundness. Additionally, a new section 38A to the FDI Act specifies that regulators must require bank holding companies, savings and loan holding companies, or any depository institution controlled by a company to serve as a source of financial strength for their subsidiary institutions. Section 616 of the BHC Act requires federal banking regulators to make capital requirements countercyclical, increasing during economic expansion and decreasing during contraction for safety. A new section 38A to the FDI Act mandates holding companies to serve as a source of financial strength for their subsidiary institutions. Regulators are authorized to issue implementing rules within a year and require reports under oath to assess compliance. Section 617 eliminates the investment bank holding company framework under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Section 618 of the BHC Act establishes a framework for securities holding companies to submit to FRB regulation as supervised entities, meeting foreign regulators' requirements for consolidated supervision. The FRB imposes recordkeeping, reporting, and examination requirements on these companies, with full civil enforcement authority and the ability to apply BHC Act requirements. The FRB is also required to prescribe capital and risk management standards. The BHC Act requires the FRB to prescribe capital and risk management standards for supervised securities holding companies, considering various factors. Section 619 prohibits proprietary trading and hedge fund investments by banking entities. \"Banking entity\" includes FDIC-insured depository institutions and their affiliates. The International Banking Act of 1978 prohibits banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading or owning equity in hedge funds or private equity funds, with some exceptions and permitted activities. Nonbank financial companies supervised by the FRB may be subject to additional capital and quantitative limits on such activities unless they are identified as permitted activities under the legislation. The International Banking Act of 1978 prohibits banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading or owning equity in hedge funds or private equity funds, with exceptions and permitted activities. Subsection 619(h) defines terms with some discretion for regulators to expand prohibitions. For example, \"hedge fund\" or \"private equity fund\" is defined as an issuer that would be an investment company but for specific sections of the Investment Company Act of 1940. \"Proprietary trading\" is engaging as a principal for the trading account in various financial transactions. Subsection 619 (b) requires the Financial Stability Oversight Council to complete a study within six months of enactment and make recommendations to promote banking entity safety, limit transfers to unregulated entities, protect taxpayers and consumers, minimize risky activities, reduce conflicts of interest, limit risky activities, accommodate insurance company investment authority, and safeguard financial stability. The Financial Stability Oversight Council must study and make recommendations to promote banking entity safety, limit risky activities, and safeguard financial stability. The regulators must coordinate rules for safety and soundness, with banking entities given two years to divest nonconforming activities. Divestiture of nonconforming activities generally must occur within two years of enactment, with the Federal Reserve Board issuing rules on divestiture provisions within six months of enactment. The Financial Stability Oversight Council must study and make recommendations to promote banking entity safety, limit risky activities, and safeguard financial stability. The Federal Reserve Board is to issue rules on divestiture provisions within six months of enactment. Additional capital and other restrictions on ownership interests in hedge funds or private equity funds by banking entities are to be implemented through joint rulemaking. Divestiture requirements may be extended under certain circumstances. Exceptions to the prohibitions are identified in subsection 619(d). Subsection 619(d) provides exceptions to the prohibitions on certain activities by banking entities, setting conditions for permitted activities. It prohibits transactions that could result in conflicts of interest, exposure to high-risk assets or trading strategies, or threats to safety and soundness. Regulators have the authority to impose additional limits and conditions to protect banking entities engaged in these activities. The exceptions to prohibitions on certain activities by banking entities set conditions for permitted activities to ensure safety and soundness. These activities include purchasing U.S. obligations, federal agency obligations, and obligations of GSEs, as well as market-making activities. The exceptions to prohibitions on certain activities by banking entities set conditions for permitted activities to ensure safety and soundness, including market-making activities, risk-mitigating hedging activities, and small business investment company investments. Subsection (d)(1)(E) allows small business investment company investments and investments in qualified rehabilitated buildings or certified historic structures. Subsection (d)(1)(F) permits insurance companies to engage in proprietary trading activities for the general account, subject to compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The curr_chunk discusses regulations for transactions by a regulated insurance company, including compliance with laws and regulations to protect financial stability. It also mentions authorization for investments conducted outside the US by foreign companies not controlled by US entities. Additionally, it allows regulators to permit other activities that promote safety and soundness. Subsection 619(d)(1)(G) authorizes banking entities to offer private equity or hedge funds under certain conditions, including providing trust, fiduciary, or investment advisory services, offering the fund only to customers of these services, retaining a minimal interest in the funds, and adhering to specific transaction terms. The banking entity must not guarantee fund obligations. Subsection 619(d)(4) allows banking entities to make and retain a \"de minimis investment\" in a hedge fund or private equity fund, subject to limitations, including seeking unaffiliated investors to reduce ownership within a specified timeframe. Investors must reduce a banking entity's initial investment in a hedge fund or private equity fund to a de minimis amount within one year, with possible extensions. The de minimis investment should not exceed 3% of total ownership interests, be immaterial to the banking entity, and not exceed 3% of its Tier 1 capital. The banking entity's aggregate investments in such funds must be deducted from its assets and tangible equity, with the deduction increasing with fund leverage. Under subsection 619(f), a banking entity can engage in transactions with a hedge fund or private equity fund if certain conditions are met, including compliance with FRA sections 23A and 23B. The FRB may allow prime brokerage transactions with funds managed by the banking entity or a nonbank financial company. The banking entity can engage in transactions with a hedge fund or private equity fund under certain conditions, including compliance with FRA sections 23A and 23B. The chief executive officer must provide an annual certification of compliance, and the FRB must approve the primary brokerage agreement. Additional capital charges or restrictions for nonbank financial companies will be determined by appropriate regulators. The regulators have authority to permit activities that promote safety and soundness of banking entities and financial stability. Section 619 provides rules for interpreting the prohibitions and restrictions, allowing for certain activities under specific conditions. Section 619(e) allows regulators to order termination of activities that violate section 619, with internal control rules to ensure compliance. Section 620 mandates a joint report by federal banking agencies on permissible investments and activities within 18 months of enactment. Section 621 prohibits asset-backed securities underwriters and sponsors from engaging in conflicted transactions and requires SEC to issue implementing rules. The report on activities violating section 619 will be forwarded to relevant committees with recommendations. The SEC prohibits conflicted transactions involving asset-backed securities for one year after the initial sale. Exceptions include risk-mitigating hedging activities and purchases consistent with liquidity commitments or market making. Section 622 prohibits certain financial institutions from merging or acquiring assets of another company. The Federal Reserve Board (FRB) may allow exceptions for bank holding companies to merge or acquire assets of another company, even if the acquiring company's liabilities exceed 10% of all financial companies' liabilities. The FRB has rulemaking authority but must consider recommendations from the Council after a study on concentration limits. The Council must complete the study within six months, and the FRB must issue rules within nine months. Section 623 prohibits federal banking agencies from approving interstate merger transactions where the resulting institution would control over 10% of total insured deposits in the US, with exceptions for certain circumstances. Section 624 applies to savings associations that fail to meet certain qualifications. Section 624 of the Dodd-Frank legislation imposes restrictions on savings associations that fail to qualify as domestic building and loan associations or maintain 65% of portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments. It limits their ability to pay dividends without OCC approval and allows for enforcement actions under section 8 of the FDIA. Additionally, section 625 imposes restrictions on dividends for mutual holding companies. The Dodd-Frank legislation imposes restrictions on savings associations and mutual holding companies regarding dividend payments. Savings associations must provide notice before declaring dividends on nonwithdrawable stock, while mutual holding companies can waive dividends under certain conditions. The Federal Reserve Board can object to waivers that may harm the savings association's operations or if the waiver is not in line with fiduciary duties. Section 626 of the Dodd-Frank legislation allows the Federal Reserve Board to require a unitary thrift holding company to conduct its financial activities in an intermediate savings and loan holding company if it engages in non-financial activities. The establishment of an intermediate holding company may be necessary for supervision purposes. Financial activities within the company are exempt from this requirement. The Federal Reserve Board may require a unitary thrift holding company to establish an intermediate holding company for non-financial activities. The grandfathered unitary thrift holding company must support the intermediate holding company if required. The FRB can regulate transactions between the intermediate holding company and its affiliates but cannot restrict transactions with unaffiliated parties. Enforcement authorities may be used by the FRB. Section 627 and 628 of the FDIA repeal the prohibition on paying interest on business checking accounts and allow credit card banks to make commercial loans without being subject to FRB regulation on a consolidated basis. The savings clause exempts unitary savings and loan holding companies from conforming their activities to those permissible for savings and loan holding companies. The FRB may enforce these provisions against grandfathered unitary thrift holding companies using its full array of enforcement authorities. The implementation of Titles III and VI of Dodd-Frank by federal banking agencies involves studies, rulemaking, and other efforts. The FRB and FDIC have web pages tracking their progress, while the OCC has not provided similar public updates on its activities. The FRB, FDIC, OCC, and OTS provided testimony to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs on their plans to implement the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in January 2011."
