The \"FAST Redress Act of 2011\" establishes an Office of Appeals and Redress within the Department of Homeland Security to provide redress for individuals wrongly delayed or prohibited from boarding a commercial aircraft due to being identified as a threat on the terrorist watchlist. The Office will be headed by a Director appointed by the Secretary and responsible for implementing a redress process. The \"FAST Redress Act of 2011\" establishes an Office of Appeals and Redress within the Department of Homeland Security to provide redress for individuals misidentified on the terrorist watchlist. This includes case management, workflow, document management, recordkeeping, and establishing a Comprehensive Cleared List of misidentified individuals. The Office must review, adjudicate, and respond to appeals within 30 days and perform other responsibilities as required by the Secretary. The Secretary shall ensure the Comprehensive Cleared List is integrated into screening systems for terrorist watchlists and transmit necessary information to resolve misidentifications. The Secretary will work with various agencies to consider the Comprehensive Cleared List when assessing security risks of individuals. Federal employees handling personally identifiable information must undergo privacy and security training, and the information must be encrypted for security. The subsection requires encryption and data anonymization techniques for security. Information collected must be minimal, shared via encrypted networks, and handled according to federal security laws. The subsection mandates encryption and data anonymization for security purposes. Information should only be retained as long as necessary for the appeal process. Cooperative agreements with federal agencies are required for accurate terrorist watchlist updates. The Chief Privacy Officer must update and publish a privacy impact assessment for the appeal and redress process. Quarterly reports to congressional committees should include data on individuals seeking and obtaining redress, those denied redress, and the average adjudication time. The Office of Appeals and Redress provides information to individuals at airports and ports of entry to initiate the appeal process. Quarterly reports to congressional committees include data on completed applications, grounds for denials, and the initiation of the appeal process at locations where the Department has a presence. The Office of Appeals and Redress provides support to individuals in need of guidance on the appeal and redress process. The Inspector General will review the implementation of this section and evaluate the appeal process and the status of the Comprehensive Cleared List requirements. The Transportation Security Administration, United States Customs and Border Protection, and other agencies have integrated the Comprehensive Cleared List into their systems for screening individuals against the terrorist watchlist. An assessment will be conducted on the impact of this integration on misidentifications of individuals. The Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate, along with relevant committees, have legislative jurisdiction over the terrorist watchlist. The term 'terrorist watchlist' refers to any list used by TSA, CBP, or DHS to screen individuals. Authorization of appropriations is provided.
