    "content": "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) is the main source of federal aid for K-12 education, with Title I, Part A focusing on Education for the Disadvantaged. The ESEA was established in 1965 and most recently reauthorized by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. The 111th Congress is expected to consider amending and extending the ESEA. The NCLB aimed to increase accountability in public K-12 education, particularly for disadvantaged students, through standards-based assessments and annual progress evaluations. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) requires assessments in reading, math, and science, annual adequate yearly progress (AYP) determinations for public schools and local educational agencies (LEAs), and qualification requirements for teachers. States must aim for all public school pupils to reach proficiency in reading and math by 2013-2014. Consequences are enforced for schools and districts failing to meet AYP standards. Other ESEA programs provide grants for migrant student education, teacher recruitment and development, language instruction for limited English proficient students, school safety, drug abuse prevention, and after-school programs. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) authorizes programs for English proficient students, school safety, drug abuse prevention, after-school care, charter schools, and education services for Native American students. It includes 45 authorized programs with various funding allocation methods. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) authorizes various programs with different funding allocation methods, including federal funds allocated by the Department of Education (ED) to states and local grantees through statutory formulas or competitive/direct allocation. ESEA allocation formulas are established through statute or official mechanisms. The ESEA allocation formulas are mechanisms defined by statute or official policy documents to distribute funds among SEAs or LEAs nationwide. These formulas involve mathematical equations to calculate grant amounts based on eligibility criteria and various factors. The report analyzes the current allocation formulas for ESEA programs, including descriptions of factors used, program formulas, and general patterns and issues. Other reports provide more detailed discussions on individual ESEA program allocation formulas. The report discusses the allocation formulas of major ESEA programs, updated infrequently with key terms explained. Grants are typically made to LEAs via SEAs, with options for substate distribution or LEA-level formulas calculated by ED. Allocation formulas in ESEA programs determine funds distributed to SEAs, LEAs, or other entities based on factors like the number of school-age children from poor families in each state. For example, if 14% of all such children live in California, 14% of state grant funds would be allocated to California. The allocation formula in ESEA programs determines funds distributed based on population factors like school-age children in poor families and total school-age children. Different factors can be weighted differently, such as distributing funds based on total school-age population and school-age children in poor families. Some programs allocate funds based on specific population factors related to the program's purpose, like Indian pupils or migratory children. The allocation formula in ESEA programs indirectly incorporates population factors like school-age children in poor families. Title I-A grants serve as a factor for distributing funds in various ESEA programs, with eligibility thresholds based on population factors. Title I-A Concentration Grant allocation formula requires LEAs to meet specific population factor eligibility thresholds to receive grants. Expenditure factors are also considered in allocation formulas, adjusting for state or local differences in per pupil expenditure for K-12 education. Floors and ceilings based on percentages of the national average are often applied to this factor. The allocation formulas for education grants consider expenditure factors, including floors and ceilings based on percentages of the national average. Hold harmless provisions ensure a minimum grant amount equal to a specified percentage of the previous year's funding, potentially impacting grants to other states or LEAs. Hold harmless amounts are guaranteed if funds are sufficient, otherwise, they are reduced to meet appropriation levels. These provisions apply to grantees meeting eligibility criteria for the current year. Foundation grants are provided under ESEA programs, with additional allocations based on population and other factors. If funds are insufficient, each grantee receives a proportion of their foundation grant, which may be a set amount or based on previous program funding. State minimum grants are set at a percentage of total state grants or as fixed dollar amounts to ensure all states receive a minimum viable grant. Caps may be placed on these minimums to limit the amount granted. The state minimum grants are calculated as a percentage of total state grants, with a cap of 150% of the national average grant per child. This minimum amount is used to increase grants to low population states, funded by reducing grants from other states proportionally. This process is known as Ratable Reduction or Ratable Increase, where grants are adjusted based on available appropriations or specific formula factors. The ESEA programs include fiscal accountability requirements such as maintenance of effort to ensure federal funds increase K-12 education funding over state and local funds. Ratable reduction redistributes funds from states above minimum grant levels to those below, with similar processes in hold harmless provisions. The ESEA programs have fiscal accountability requirements including maintenance of effort to ensure federal funds increase K-12 education funding over state and local funds. Funds must supplement, not supplant, state and local funds, and comparability applies to Title I programs. Funds are distributed by formula to states, DC, and Puerto Rico, with other entities receiving reserved amounts. Reserved funds from total appropriations are typically set aside for Outlying Areas and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Around 1% of program appropriations are reserved for these entities. Additionally, before funds are allocated to states, a portion of appropriations is reserved for national activities like competitive grants and program evaluation. States can also reserve a proportion of their grant for state-level activities. Under Title I-A, states reserve 4% of grants for school improvement activities. Statewide services include technical assistance and program evaluation to improve program implementation. Most funds under ESEA formula grant programs go to LEAs through state-administered programs. ED allocates funds based on allocation formulas outlined in Tables 1-9. Under ESEA programs, funds are allocated to LEAs through state-administered formula grant programs. Title I-A is the main program where funds are distributed via SEAs, with adjustments made by SEAs to initial LEA grants calculated by ED. ESEA formula grant programs are divided into three groups based on the primary population factor. ESEA formula grant programs are categorized based on primary population factors, including total school-age population, specific program purposes (e.g., Indian children for Title VII-A-1), and school-age children in poor families. Title I-A is a significant program with funds distributed through SEAs to LEAs, impacting the allocation of a majority of ESEA funds. The ESEA formula grant programs are categorized based on primary population factors, with families being the main factor. Table 3 lists five ESEA programs that allocate grants based on LEA grants calculated under Title I, Part A. Table 4 includes only programs with an expenditure factor, either directly or indirectly linked to Title I-A grants. The Title I-A formulas impact the allocation of a majority of ESEA funds. The ESEA formula grant programs allocate funds based on various factors, including state average per pupil expenditure for public K-12 education. Title VIII Impact Aid programs use a local contribution rate based on state or national average per pupil expenditure. Some programs have minimum grant provisions at the state or LEA level. The ESEA formula grant programs allocate funds based on factors like state average per pupil expenditure for K-12 education. Title VIII Impact Aid programs use a local contribution rate based on state or national average per pupil expenditure. Some programs have minimum grant provisions at the state or LEA level, with up to 0.25% to 0.5% of total grants available for state grants under various programs. Hold harmless provisions are more common at the state level, with Title I-A formulas having LEA hold harmless provisions and the Safe and Drug-Free Schools program having a state level hold harmless provision. SEAs can reserve a limited percentage of state total grants for administration, evaluation, and technical assistance in some ESEA formula grant programs. Some ESEA formula grant programs have maximum reservations for administration, evaluation, and technical assistance ranging from 1% to 5%. Limits on the use of funds by LEAs for these activities exist in only four ESEA programs. Most ESEA formula grant programs provide grants to Outlying Areas, treating them similarly to states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Some ESEA formula grant programs reserve a share of state grants for services to Indian pupils, while others allocate funds to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Only a few programs set aside formula grant funds for national programs or activities, evaluations, and technical assistance. National programs are usually authorized separately from state formula grants. The ESEA formula grant programs have separate authorizations for evaluations and a general authorization for the Secretary of Education to reserve funds for program evaluation. Most programs have maintenance of effort and supplement, not supplant, provisions, while only Title I has comparability provisions. Table 8 shows fiscal accountability provisions in ESEA programs, with grants allocated competitively if appropriations are below a threshold. Only Mathematics and Science Partnerships program has met its threshold so far. Title I, Part A, provides aid to LEAs for disadvantaged children. Title I-A grants provide supplementary educational services to low-achieving students in pre-kindergarten through grade 12 schools with high concentrations of low-income families. Requirements attached to these grants include assessments, yearly progress standards, consequences for schools that fail to meet standards, and teacher qualifications. Funds are allocated to LEAs through SEAs under Title I-A. Title I-A grants provide supplementary educational services to low-achieving students in schools with high concentrations of low-income families. Funds are allocated to LEAs through SEAs under four different formulas, combining amounts for Basic, Concentration, Targeted Grants, and Education Finance Incentive Grants. These formulas have distinct allocation patterns based on poverty rates and spending levels per pupil. The Basic Grants formula under Title I-A is the original formula, allocating the largest proportion of funds and involving the most LEAs. However, its share of funds has been decreasing since FY2001 due to increases in other formulas. The Basic Grant formula under Title I-A has seen a decline in funds allocated since FY2001, with grants based on each LEA's share of a population factor multiplied by an expenditure factor, subject to certain minimums and state requirements. The Basic Grant formula under Title I-A is based on a population factor and an expenditure factor, with eligibility criteria including a minimum number of children and a certain percentage of the total school-age population. The expenditure factor is determined by the state's average per pupil expenditure for K-12 education, multiplied by 0.40. Each LEA is guaranteed a minimum grant based on their previous year's funding, depending on their child poverty rate. The Basic Grant formula under Title I-A guarantees each LEA a minimum grant based on their previous year's funding, depending on their child poverty rate. States receive a minimum grant of up to 0.25% of total Basic Grant appropriations if funding is equal to or less than FY2001 levels, and up to 0.35% if funding exceeds FY2001 levels. If appropriations are insufficient, a ratable reduction is applied to maximum grants. The Title I-A formula guarantees each LEA a minimum grant based on child poverty rate. If appropriations are insufficient, grants are reduced by a percentage for all LEAs until they equal total appropriations. Fiscal requirements include maintenance of effort, supplement not supplant, and comparability of services. Title I-A ensures that local funds in participating schools are comparable to non-Title I-A schools. Puerto Rico is treated like a state under the Basic Grant formula. Grants are reserved for schools in Outlying Areas and Bureau of Indian Affairs. SEAs make adjustments to LEA grants after ED calculations. Adjustments are made to Title I-A grants to LEAs, including reservations for school improvement grants, state administration, academic achievement awards, charter schools, and LEA boundary changes. States may also use alternative methods for adjustments. The Title I-A grants to LEAs are adjusted for various factors, including school improvement grants, state administration, academic achievement awards, charter schools, and LEA boundary changes. States have the option to use alternative methods for these adjustments, such as reallocating grants among small LEAs based on population factors and expenditure levels. In calculating LEA grants under Title I-A, the amount for each LEA is adjusted through state minimum grant provision and a factor for raising affected LEAs to their hold harmless level. The final grant is determined by multiplying the adjusted amount with various factors including school improvement, state administration, academic achievement, and other adjustments. In the final step of calculating LEA grants under all Title I-A allocation formulas, grants are adjusted for school improvement, state administration reservations, possible state reservations for achievement awards, and other adjustments. The Concentration Grant formula for state administration includes possible reservations for achievement awards and other adjustments by the SEA. It has a higher LEA eligibility threshold compared to Basic Grants, with differences in hold harmless and state minimum grant provisions. The current version dates back to 1988, with a small and declining proportion of Title I-A appropriations allocated under this formula. Approximately 48% of LEAs receive Concentration Grants. Concentration Grants are based on each eligible LEA's share of a population factor multiplied by an expenditure factor, subject to available appropriations, an LEA minimum, and a state minimum. To be eligible, an LEA must have a certain number of children counted in the population factor. Hold harmless rates for Concentration Grants are the same as those for Basic Grants, applying to all LEAs that received grants in the previous year. The Concentration Grant state minimum ensures that each state receives a minimum percentage of total Concentration Grant appropriations based on funding levels. LEAs that received grants in the previous year can continue to receive grants for up to three succeeding years, even if they do not meet eligibility thresholds. The Concentration Grant state minimum provision limits the amount a state can receive based on specific calculations. This includes a cap on the average amount for state grants and adjustments for different factors. LEAs can continue to receive grants for up to three years, even if they do not meet eligibility thresholds. The Concentration Grant Allocation Formula under NCLB allows SEAs to allocate grants based on the number or percentage of children in the population factor exceeding the state average. The formula is similar to Basic Grants, with the exception that in states where the population factor is less than 0.25% of the national total, grants are allocated among eligible LEAs based on the population factor. This includes LEAs meeting the Concentration Grant criteria or all LEAs with a higher number or percentage of children in the population factor. The Concentration Grant Allocation Formula under NCLB allows SEAs to allocate grants based on the number or percentage of children in the population factor exceeding the state average. Targeted Grants were authorized in 1994 but funded in FY2002, constituting a substantial portion of total Title I-A appropriations. Targeted Grants, constituting 21% of FY2008 appropriations, are allocated among 83% of LEAs. The allocation formula is similar to Basic Grants but with differences in how children in the population factor are counted. Children in poor families are assigned weights based on each LEA's child poverty rate, resulting in higher grants per child for LEAs with higher poverty rates. Targeted Grants have a higher eligibility threshold compared to Basic Grants. The Targeted Grants allocation formula assigns weights to children in poor families based on each LEA's child poverty rate, resulting in higher grants per child for LEAs with higher poverty rates. Children counted in the formula are assigned weights based on the poverty rate or number of school-age children in poor families, with LEAs with the highest poverty rates receiving weights of up to four. The Targeted Grants allocation formula assigns weights to children in LEAs based on poverty rates, with higher weights for children in LEAs with the highest poverty rates. The formula uses the higher of two weighted child counts to calculate grants for each LEA, based on numbers and percentages. There are five ranges for each weighting scale, determined by the distribution of Title I-A population factor children among LEAs in 2001. The Targeted Grants allocation formula assigns weights to children in LEAs based on poverty rates, with higher weights for children in LEAs with the highest poverty rates. The formula uses the higher of two weighted child counts to calculate grants for each LEA, based on numbers and percentages. The population factor weights are applied in a stepwise manner, with the greater of the two weighted child counts used to calculate the Targeted Grant. For example, if an LEA has 2,000 population factor children, the population factor figure used to calculate Targeted Grants would be determined through a stepwise process. The population factor children above 691 are weighted at 1.5 in Step 1, with a total of 2,654.5 on the Numbers Scale. The weighted counts from Steps 1 and 2 are combined. Step 1 accounts for 15.58% of the LEA's total school-age population, weighted at 1.0. Step 2 covers the population factor children above 15.58%, weighted at 1.75. The Numbers Scale count of 2,654.5 is used as the population factor for the LEA, as it exceeds the Percentage Scale count of 2,331.5. The population factor for the LEA in the calculation of Targeted Grants is based on a count of 2,654.5 children. To be eligible for a Targeted Grant, an LEA must have 10 or more children counted in the population factor, constituting 5% or more of the total school-age population. Each state is guaranteed a minimum of up to 0.35% of all Targeted Grant appropriations. The EFIG formula for Targeted Grants is similar to Basic Grants, with adjustments for Puerto Rico and weighted child counts. EFIG Grants were authorized in 1994 but received funding in FY2002 after significant modifications to the formula. The EFIG formula for Targeted Grants, authorized in 1994, was significantly modified in FY2002 under the NCLB. EFIG Grants constitute a substantial and growing portion of total Title I-A grants, allocated among a large majority of LEAs. The formula includes unique factors like an effort factor based on per pupil expenditure compared to personal income per capita for each state. The EFIG formula for Targeted Grants, authorized in 1994, was significantly modified in FY2002 under the NCLB. EFIG Grants constitute a substantial and growing portion of total Title I-A grants, allocated among a large majority of LEAs. The formula includes unique factors like an effort factor based on per pupil expenditure compared to personal income per capita for each state, an equity factor, and weighted child counts for intra-state allocation. State total EFIG Grants are determined based on each state's share compared to the national total. State total EFIG Grants are calculated based on a population factor multiplied by expenditure, effort, and equity factors, adjusted by a state minimum. Each LEA's share of the grant is determined by a weighted population factor count compared to all LEAs in the state, with adjustments for a hold harmless provision. The population factor includes children aged 5-17 in various circumstances. The second-stage suballocation of state total EFIG Grants among LEAs involves applying weights to child counts based on the state's equity factor. The weights increase more rapidly for states with higher equity factors, with maximum weights 50% higher for states with equity factors between 0.10 and 0.20, or above 0.20. The EFIG formula for allocating grants to states includes factors not found in other ESEA programs, such as the effort factor based on comparing state average per pupil expenditure to personal income per capita. States with higher equity factors show greater variation in per pupil expenditure among LEAs. The EFIG formula for allocating grants to states includes factors like the effort factor based on comparing state average per pupil expenditure to personal income per capita. The equity factor is based on the disparity in per pupil expenditure among LEAs, with extra weight given to estimated counts of children from poor families. Grants are maximized for states where expenditures per pupil from poor families are 40% higher than expenditures per pupil from non-poor families. The equity factor in the EFIG formula is determined by the variation in expenditures per pupil among LEAs in a state. States with lower expenditure disparities have higher multipliers and grants, while states with higher disparities have lower multipliers and grants. Eligibility threshold and expenditure factor are also key components in determining state grants. The EFIG formula determines state grants based on the equity factor, which considers expenditure disparities among LEAs in a state. The expenditure factor is calculated using the state average per pupil expenditure for public K-12 education, with a minimum of 85% and a maximum of 115% of the national average, further multiplied by 0.40. The hold harmless provision ensures that each LEA receives a proportional share if state total grants are insufficient. Minimum state grants and ratable reductions follow the same guidelines as Targeted and Basic Grants. The Education Finance Incentive Grant Allocation Formula calculates state grants based on factors like population, expenditure, effort, and equity. The formula involves two stages: calculating the preliminary state grant and then the final state grant, which is adjusted based on the total grants available and the state minimum grant provision. The Education Finance Incentive Grant Allocation Formula involves two stages: calculating the preliminary state grant and adjusting the final state grant based on the total grants available and the state minimum grant provision. The state minimum grant adjustment varies based on the state size, with funds either increased or reduced accordingly. The Calculation of LEA EFIG Allocations includes determining the preliminary LEA grant based on population factors and hold harmless levels, followed by adjustments to raise affected LEAs to their hold harmless level. The final step in calculating LEA grants under the Education Finance Incentive Grant Allocation Formula involves adjusting the preliminary LEA grant for school improvement, state administration reservations, achievement awards, and other possible adjustments. This adjustment is necessary to raise affected LEAs in the state to their hold harmless level, with a fixed total state allocation level. The LEA hold harmless adjustment is downward for all LEAs except those already at the hold harmless level. Under ESEA Title I-A, funds for School Improvement activities are generated through two mechanisms. These funds are targeted at schools failing to make AYP for two consecutive years. States reserve 4% for school improvement grants, with additional reservations for state administration, achievement awards, and other adjustments. Adjustments are made to raise affected LEAs to their hold harmless level. States reserve 4% of their Title I-A LEA grants for School Improvement activities, with additional funds allocated through a separate appropriation for state School Improvement Grants. At least 95% of these funds are to be allocated to LEAs for schools in need of improvement, corrective action, or restructuring, with each school receiving between $50,000 and $500,000. There is no set formula for intrastate allocation of these funds. The School Improvement funds are allocated at state discretion without a specific formula. The maximum grant per school is $2 million, with eligibility criteria based on performance and graduation rates. The School Improvement Grant Allocation Formula allocates funds to states based on total grants under Title I, Parts A, C, and D. Each state receives a grant proportional to its share of total grants. Reading First program under Title I-B authorizes grants based on population factor with state minimums. The Reading First program allocates funds to states based on population factors, with priority given to LEAs with high numbers of children in poor families or high poverty rates. Each participating LEA receives a share of the state's grant proportional to its total grants under Title I-A, to improve reading programs for grades K-3. The program supports scientifically based reading instruction and also offers discretionary performance awards to states showing improvements in pupil reading performance. The Reading First program, which funded improvements in pupil reading performance, is no longer funded. Funds were allocated based on population factors, with priority given to children aged 5-17 in poor families. Each state was to receive a minimum grant, with specific allocations for Puerto Rico, Bureau of Indian Affairs schools, and Outlying Areas. The Secretary of Education could reserve up to $25 million nationally. In the Reading First program, the Secretary of Education could reserve up to $25 million for program evaluation and national activities, and $5 million for dissemination of information. Additional funds were reserved for Targeted Assistance grants to states, with competitive awards made from FY2004-2006. Up to 20% of state grants and 3.5% of local funds could be used for various activities. The Reading First program allocates funds to states based on a formula involving the population factor and state minimum adjustments. Funds are distributed to partnerships within states for services to parents and children aged birth to seven years under the Even Start Family Literacy Programs. Even Start Family Literacy Programs offer a range of services to parents and children aged birth to seven years, including education and parenting skills training. Grants are distributed in proportion to Title I-A grants, with a minimum state grant requirement. Maintenance of effort requirements apply to Even Start as a covered program under ESEA. The ESEA maintenance of effort requirement applies to Start as a covered program. Recipient LEAs must provide funding at least 90% as high as in the second preceding year. Puerto Rico is treated as a state. Funds are reserved for Indian tribes, Outlying Areas, and children of migratory workers. The Secretary may reserve funds for program evaluation, technical assistance, and research. Up to $1 million may be reserved for competitive grants to states for family programs. Even Start grants under ESEA Title I, Part A are distributed to states based on a formula that adjusts for state minimum levels. States can reserve up to 6% of their grants for administration and other activities. Additionally, up to $1 million may be set aside for competitive grants for statewide family literacy initiatives. State minimum grant sums are distributed to LEAs under ESEA Title I-B for school library services. If annual appropriations are below $100 million, ED provides competitive grants directly to LEAs. Grants above $100 million are distributed by formula to SEAs, who then provide competitive grants to LEAs. The Migrant Education Program grants funds to SEAs for migrant children education programs, mostly administered by LEAs during the school year and summer. States receive a base grant equal to their FY2002 amount, adjusted for updated migrant children counts. The Migrant Education Program provides grants to states based on the number of eligible migrant children and services provided. Grants have not exceeded $396 million since FY2002, with allocations tied to each state's base-year grant amount. The grant allocation for the Migrant Education Program is based on each state's FY2002 base-year grant, adjusted for inaccurate data. States receive a proportional share of appropriations calculated by multiplying eligible migrant children counts by 40% of the state's average per-pupil expenditure. The base grant amount received is an \"adjusted\" FY2002 grant. States receiving funds under the Migrant Education Program must develop a state plan to address the needs of migrant children, with flexibility in choosing services like instruction, health, counseling, and transportation. Priority is given to children at risk of academic failure, with funding based on eligible student counts. The state's migrant education funding is determined by the number of eligible migrant children served in summer or intersession programs, multiplied by 40% of the state's average per pupil expenditure. Each state receives a grant based on their adjusted FY2002 amount, with Puerto Rico's grant calculated based on their APPE compared to the national average. The Secretary of Education may reserve up to $10 million of total appropriations for migrant education activities, with $3 million available for competitive grants to improve services for migrant children. MEP is subject to fiscal accountability requirements, including a maintenance of effort provision. The Secretary of Education may reserve up to $10 million for migrant education activities, with $3 million for competitive grants. Title I-C funds must supplement state and local funds for migrant pupils. The Migrant Education Program Allocation Formula calculates adjusted student counts and expenditure factors for grants. The adjusted student count is multiplied by an expenditure factor to determine state grant amounts. The state grant is calculated based on the state's grant count divided by the national grant count, multiplied by the appropriated amount. Any additional funds over the FY2002 level are allocated based on the prior year counts of eligible migratory children. The state grant for eligible migratory children is calculated by multiplying the state's migrant education student count by an expenditure factor. The state's grant amount is determined by the state's grant count divided by the national grant count, multiplied by the appropriated amount. Any excess funds over the FY2002 level are allocated based on the prior year counts of eligible migratory children. The FY2002 adjusted grant amount is calculated based on various factors including the adjusted eligible migrant child count, grant count, expenditure factor, annual appropriation, and total number of migrant children. If funds are insufficient, all states have their grant amounts reduced proportionally. Title I-D authorizes programs to improve education for neglected, delinquent, or at-risk students. Subpart 1 grants aid for education in state institutions, with funds allocated based on population and expenditure factors. Subpart 2 provides aid for programs in collaboration with correctional facilities and Title I-A. The Title I-D program provides funding for neglected, delinquent, or at-risk students in state institutions. Funds are allocated based on population factors, with a focus on providing educational services to youth in correctional facilities. The Title I-D program requires at least 15 hours per week of educational services in adult correctional institutions and 20 hours per week in other eligible institutions. Funding is subject to a ratable reduction if appropriations are insufficient. Recipient LEAs must meet maintenance of effort requirements and use funds to supplement, not supplant, state and local funds. Title I-D funds must supplement, not supplant state and local funds for neglected and delinquent pupils. Puerto Rico is treated similarly to the Migrant Education Program. Grants are available for 50 states, DC, and Puerto Rico. Allocation formula involves population and expenditure factors. Title I-F and Title I-G authorize grants for education reform strategies and advanced placement test fees for low-income individuals. Title I-F is no longer funded, while Title I-G provides grants to SEAs and LEAs. The allocation formula for these grants involves population and expenditure factors. The statute allocates funds based on the number of children in each state's Title I-A population. Grants for dropout prevention and reentry programs are given to SEAs or LEAs for high schools with high dropout rates. Funding levels determine whether grants are competitive or formula-based, with the Secretary of Education overseeing the process. The Secretary of Education is authorized to carry out activities for dropout prevention and reentry through state grants for K-12 teachers and principals. Funds are allocated based on population demographics, with SEAs able to reserve up to 5% for administration and statewide services. LEAs must receive at least 95% of the grants. The Secretary of Education authorizes state grants for K-12 teachers and principals for dropout prevention and reentry activities. LEAs must suballocate 95% of grants, with funds distributed based on population demographics. Grants can be used for teacher recruitment, professional development, and needs assessments. States receive grants based on previous funding from antecedent programs. The enactment of the NCLB and the Class Size Reduction Program under the Department of Education Appropriations Act, 2001 influences the distribution of current grants under Title II-A. State grants are allocated based on previous funding from these programs, with formulas dictating grant amounts for LEAs. The Eisenhower Professional Development Program and Class Size Reduction Program formulas determine grant allocations for states and LEAs under Title II-A. Grants are based on factors like Title I-A grants, population aged 5-17, and school enrollment. The allocation of funds for Title II-A grants to states and LEAs is based on a formula that considers factors like poverty, total school-age population, and school enrollment. The formula is similar to that used for the Class Size Reduction Program, with 20% of funds allocated based on school enrollment and 80% based on children in poor families. Additionally, 35% of funds above foundation grants are allocated based on total school-age population, while 65% is based on school-age population. The allocation of Title II-A grants to states and LEAs is based on factors like poverty and school-age population. 20% of funds are allocated based on total school-age population, while 80% are based on school-age population in poor families. Each state receives a minimum of 0.5% of total grants. Grants are reduced proportionally if funds are insufficient. Title II-A is one of many \"covered programs.\" Title II-A is a covered program under ESEA with a maintenance of effort requirement. LEAs must maintain funding levels from state and local sources. Funds must supplement, not supplant, existing funds. Puerto Rico is treated as a state for funding purposes. Reservations from appropriations include grants for the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Outlying Areas. Up to 5% of grants can be reserved for state administration. State level, up to 5% of grants may be reserved for administration and other state activities. A portion of this amount may be reserved for grants to local partnerships consisting of an institution of higher education, a college-level school of arts and sciences, and a high need LEA. The allocation formula for Teacher and Principal Training and Recruiting Fund is based on the state's total grant amount. If appropriations are equal to or less than the FY2001 level, each state receives a proportion of its FY2001 grants. If appropriations exceed FY2001 levels, states receive their FY2001 grants first, with the remaining funds allocated based on population and poverty levels. The final state grant is determined by multiplying the preliminary grant by a minimum adjustment factor. Final state grant is calculated based on total state grant appropriations exceeding FY2001 level. Each state's grant is the greater of the amount calculated in Step 1 adjusted for increased grants or the state minimum. For LEA allocations, if appropriations are equal to or less than FY2001 level, each LEA receives a proportion of its FY2001 grants. If appropriations exceed FY2001 level, LEAs receive grants based on population and poverty levels. The final LEA grant is calculated based on state grant appropriations exceeding the FY2001 level. LEAs receive grants based on population and poverty levels, with 20% allocated based on total population aged 5-17 and 80% based on population aged 5-17 from poor families. The Eisenhower Professional Development Program and Class Size Reduction Program grants are allocated based on population and poverty levels. State grants exceeding the FY2001 level determine the final LEA grant amount. Grants are authorized for eligible partnerships including an SEA and an engineering, mathematics, or science department of an institution of higher education. Title II-B funds are allocated to states based on a formula if appropriations are $100 million or more. The funds are used for professional development, recruitment of math and science teachers, and curriculum development. States must receive a minimum of 0.5% of total funds available. Funds must supplement, not supplant, state and local funds. Puerto Rico, Outlying Areas, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs are also included in the program. The program allocates Title II-B funds to states based on a formula if appropriations are $100 million or more. Funds are used for professional development, teacher recruitment, and curriculum development in math and science. Puerto Rico, Outlying Areas, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs are treated as states. 0.5% of total appropriations is reserved for a national evaluation. Mathematics and Science Partnerships grants are allocated to states based on a formula. The Education Technology State Grants program aims to improve student academic achievement through technology in elementary and secondary schools. Formula grants are distributed to states based on their Title I-A funds proportion. States then allocate 50% of the grants as formula subgrants to eligible LEAs for authorized activities. Each LEA receives a proportion of funding based on their Title I, Part A allocation. The Education Technology State Grants program distributes funds to states based on their Title I-A allocation. States then allocate 50% of the grants as formula subgrants to eligible LEAs. Recipients must use at least 25% of the funds for professional development and can use the rest for technology-related purposes. Title II-D funds are allocated by formula, with grants distributed in proportion to total Title I-A grants. Each state receives a minimum of 0.5% of total state grants. Title II-D funds must be used to supplement state and local funds, with a maximum of 5% for administrative costs. Recipient LEAs must meet a maintenance of effort requirement and ensure funding levels are at least 90% of the previous year. Puerto Rico is treated as a state, and grants to Outlying Areas are distributed accordingly. The Bureau of Indian Affairs and Puerto Rico are treated as states for grant distribution. Reservations of 0.5% and 0.75% of Title II-D appropriations are specifically allocated for state and local technology grants. Additionally, not more than 2% of the total appropriation can be reserved for studies and national technology activities. Education Technology State Grants are calculated based on a formula to ensure equitable distribution among states. The Education Technology State Grants are distributed among states based on a formula to ensure equitable distribution. Each LEA receives a grant proportional to the total grants provided to LEAs in the state under ESEA Title I, Part A. Title III-A authorizes formula grants to states for limited English proficient students and immigrant children. Title III-A authorizes formula grants to states for limited English proficient students and immigrant children. Grants are distributed to states based on the number of LEP students and immigrant students, with states required to distribute funds to eligible local entities based on the number of LEP students served. States must reserve up to 15% of their allotment to award subgrants to eligible entities that have experienced a \"significant increase\" in LEP students. The Title III-A authorizes formula grants to states for limited English proficient students and immigrant children. States must reserve up to 15% of their allotment to award subgrants to eligible entities that have experienced a \"significant increase\" in immigrant students. Grants are determined based on the state's proportional share of LEP students and immigrant students relative to the U.S. population. The Title III-A authorizes formula grants to states for limited English proficient students and immigrant children. States must reserve up to 15% of their allotment to award subgrants to eligible entities that have experienced a \"significant increase\" in immigrant students. Grants are determined based on the state's proportional share of LEP students and immigrant students relative to the U.S. population. ED directs the use of ACS data or the number of children assessed for English proficiency under Title I-A of the ESEA for state allocations. Minimum state grant is $500,000, with maximum reservations for SEA and LEA activities. Each eligible entity can use up to 2% of funds for administration. Title III-A funds must not exceed 2% for administration. Recipient LEAs must meet a maintenance of effort requirement by providing at least 90% of previous year's funding from state and local sources. Funds should supplement, not supplant, federal, state, and local funds for LEP and immigrant programs. Puerto Rico and other areas are included in the treatment guidelines. The Title III-A funds have specific reservations for Puerto Rico, Outlying Areas, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Puerto Rico is treated as a state with a grant limit of 0.5%. Outlying Areas receive 0.5% of the total appropriations. The Secretary of Education reserves funds for Native American and Alaska Native children's schools and national activities. The Title III-A funds reserve 6.5% for national activities, with 0.5% for evaluation and up to $2 million for NCELA. States receive English Language Acquisition grants based on LEP and recent immigrant children, adjusted to raise smaller states to a minimum level. Eligible entities receive grants based on LEP children. The Language Acquisition Grant for an Eligible Entity is calculated based on the number of limited English proficient students in schools served by the entity. If the calculated amount is less than $10,000, the entity may not receive a grant. Title IV-A is a federal initiative to prevent drug abuse and violence in schools. Title IV-A is a federal initiative aimed at preventing drug abuse and violence in schools by providing state grants based on population and Title I-A Concentration Grants. Funds are allocated to state governors for programs to deter youth from drug use and violence, as well as national leadership projects for school safety. The allocation of funds under Title IV-A is based on population and Title I-A Concentration Grants. 50% of funds to states is based on school-age population, while 40% to LEAs is based on K-12 enrollment. Additionally, 50% of state grants to LEAs is based on Title I-A grants, with a minimum state grant requirement. Title IV-A funds are allocated based on population and Title I-A Concentration Grants, with a minimum state grant requirement. Recipient LEAs must meet a maintenance of effort requirement and ensure that Title IV-A funds supplement, not supplant, state and local funds for authorized activities. The program authorizes grants for Puerto Rico, Outlying Areas, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Puerto Rico is treated as a state, with grants allocated to Outlying Areas and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Reservations from appropriations include funds for national evaluation and competitive grants at the state level. Additionally, funds are reserved for state administration costs and programs serving Native Hawaiians. State funds for Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities grants are allocated with 3% reserved for state administration costs and 5% for statewide activities. At least 93% of state grants are to be allocated to LEAs. The calculation formula involves the state total grant amount based on Title I-A Concentration Grants and population factors. The state minimum grant is determined as the greater of 0.5% of total state grants or the previous year's grant amount. The final state grant amount is calculated based on appropriations exceeding or equaling the FY2001 level. If appropriations exceed the FY2001 level, each state's grant is adjusted downward to account for increased grants to states receiving the minimum grant amount. If appropriations are equal to or less than the FY2001 level, each state receives an equal proportion of its FY2001 grant. The final LEA grant amount is calculated based on population factors and Title I-A grants. 40% of the state total allocation is based on population factors, while 60% is based on Title I-A grants. The formula includes various factors such as appropriations, Title I-A Concentration Grants, state minimum allocation, and total Title I-A grants. Title IV-B supports activities for school-aged children during non-school hours, funded through formula grants based on Title I-A grants. States distribute grants to local entities competitively for 3-5 years, prioritizing equitable fund distribution among urban and rural areas. Eligible entities focus on students attending Title I-A schools, using funds for before- and after-school activities to enhance academic achievement. The Title IV-B program focuses on student academic achievement by providing after-school activities for children and youth, as well as literacy-related activities for their families. Grants are allocated to states based on Title I-A grants, with a minimum state grant requirement. Recipient LEAs must meet fiscal requirements to ensure funds supplement, not supplant, state and local funding for the program. The Title IV-B program provides grants for after-school activities and literacy programs. Puerto Rico is treated as a state, with grants reserved for Outlying Areas and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Reservations from appropriations include up to 1% for national activities and up to 2% for state administration. States receive grants based on their share of total ESEA Title I, Part A grants. Title V, Part A authorizes the Innovative Programs block grant, providing aid to SEAs and LEAs for a wide range of educational services. Grants are allocated based on total population aged 5-17, with a state minimum grant amount of 0.5% of total funding. At least 85% of funds must be allocated to LEAs based on state-developed formulas. The formulas for allocating funds to LEAs consider enrollment of pupils in public and private schools, with adjustments for high-cost pupils. States develop formulas for suballocation of grants to LEAs, with funds reserved for specified programs and services. LEAs can use their funds for various education-related activities. The Part A funds can be used by LEAs for innovative assistance programs, with allocations based on the population factor of school-age children. No funding has been provided for this program since FY2007. Adjustments are made for high-cost pupils in the allocation of funds to LEAs. The curr_chunk discusses the allocation of funds for high-cost pupils, including those from economically disadvantaged families and those in sparsely populated or concentrated poverty areas. States must receive a minimum of 0.5% of total grants, and there are fiscal requirements to maintain funding levels. Puerto Rico is treated as a state, 1% of funds are reserved for Outlying Areas, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs does not receive funds under this program. The Bureau of Indian Affairs does not receive funds under this program. States must allocate a minimum of 85% of their grant to LEAs, with the remaining funds used for state-level activities. State grants are determined by a formula based on population factor, appropriation, and adjustments for states receiving the minimum grant amount. Subpart 1 of Title VI-A authorizes grants to states for assessment development and enhancement under Title I-A. Each state initially receives $3 million per year, with additional funds allocated based on population aged 5-17. A minimum \"trigger\" amount of $400 million is allocated as state formula grants, with any excess funds used for competitive enhanced assessment grants. The Bureau of Indian Affairs does not receive funds from this program. States must allocate 85% of their grant to LEAs. Title VI-A appropriation of $8,732,000 is allocated competitively. Each state initially receives $3 million per year, with remaining funds distributed based on population aged 5-17. Funds must supplement state and local funds. Puerto Rico is treated as a state, with 0.5% reserved for Outlying Areas and Bureau of Indian Affairs. State Assessment Grants formula: State Grant = $3,000,000 + ((PF / \u2211 PF) * (APP - $156,000,000)). Each state receives $3 million plus a share of remaining funds based on school-age population. The Small, Rural School Achievement Program (SRSA) under Title VI-B provides flexibility in fund use for rural LEAs with fewer than 600 pupils. Eligible LEAs receive initial grants of $20,000 to $60,000, with final grants adjusted based on amounts received from certain ESEA programs. The SRSA program provides initial grants of $20,000 to $60,000 to eligible LEAs with fewer than 600 pupils. Final grants are adjusted based on funds received from other ESEA programs, and can be used for various educational purposes authorized under different ESEA titles. Grants are calculated based on the number of students in average daily attendance at eligible LEAs. Total state grants are the sum of final grants for all eligible LEAs in the state. The SRSA program provides grants to small, rural LEAs with specific eligibility criteria. Grants range from $20,000 to $60,000 based on student population. Initial grants are adjusted based on funds received from other ESEA programs. The SRSA program provides grants to small, rural LEAs ranging from $20,000 to $60,000 based on student population. Grants are adjusted based on funds received from other ESEA programs like Training and Recruiting Fund, Enhancing Education Through Technology, Safe and Drug-Free Schools, and Innovative Programs. If total deduction equals or exceeds initial grant, LEA receives no SRSA funds. Grants are ratably reduced if appropriations are insufficient, and funds must supplement, not supplant, other federal, state, or local funds. The Small Rural Schools Achievement Program provides grants to small, rural LEAs based on student population. Grants range from $20,000 to $60,000 and are adjusted based on funds received from other ESEA programs. If total deductions exceed the initial grant, the LEA receives no SRSA funds. Grants are reduced proportionally if appropriations are insufficient and must supplement, not replace, other federal, state, or local funds. Puerto Rico and Outlying Areas are treated as states, with no provision for grants to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. In Step 4, each eligible LEA receives a share of available appropriations that is proportional to its grant amount calculated in Step 3. The Rural and Low-Income School Program (RLIS) authorizes grants to rural LEAs with a school-age child poverty rate of 20% or more for various ESEA-related purposes. Under the RLIS program, funds are allocated to SEAs for ESEA-related purposes such as teacher recruitment, parental involvement, and activities under various ESEA titles. Funds are distributed based on the number of population factor students in eligible LEAs. States may suballocate funds among eligible LEAs in different ways. Under the RLIS program, states can allocate funds to eligible LEAs based on population factors, eligibility criteria, and fiscal requirements. Eligible LEAs must have high child poverty rates and rural locale codes. Grants are not available to LEAs already receiving SRSA program funds. Under the RLIS program, recipient LEAs must meet fiscal requirements to receive grants. Funds must supplement, not supplant, other sources. Puerto Rico is treated as a state, with allocations for the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Outlying Areas. Up to 5% of grants can be used for administration. The state grant formula is based on Average Daily Attendance (ADA) and total ADA. The Low-Income Schools Allocation Formula State Grant is determined by the number of students in average daily attendance in eligible LEAs compared to the national total. Grants are authorized for LEAs meeting Indian pupil enrollment thresholds and are based on the number of Indian pupils and per pupil expenditure. Formula grants can be consolidated with other federal education programs for Indian pupils. The Low-Income Schools Allocation Formula State Grant provides grants to eligible LEAs serving Indian pupils for comprehensive educational services, including culturally related activities, substance abuse prevention, and family literacy programs. Eligible LEAs must meet enrollment thresholds and establish a committee to develop a program for the use of funds received under this Subpart. The Low-Income Schools Allocation Formula State Grant provides grants to eligible LEAs serving Indian pupils for comprehensive educational services. An Indian tribe may apply for the grant if the LEA fails to develop a program for fund use. The expenditure factor is based on state average per pupil expenditure or 80% of the national average. Maximum grants are reduced proportionally if appropriations are insufficient. Each eligible LEA is to receive a minimum grant of $3,000, which may be increased to $4,000 if necessary for program quality. The Indian Education Allocation Formula determines funding levels for LEAs serving Indian pupils, ensuring quality programs. Recipient LEAs must maintain funding levels from state and local sources. Puerto Rico, outlying areas, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs are included in the formula. Up to 5% of grants can be reserved for administration at the LEA level. The Indian Education Allocation Formula calculates preliminary LEA grants based on population and expenditure factors. The Impact Aid program compensates LEAs for the burden of federal activities, including federal land ownership and enrollment of children of federal employees. Grants are calculated based on population and expenditure factors, with adjustments for minimum grant provisions. The federal government compensates LEAs for serving federally connected children whose parents work or live on federal land. Section 8003(b) authorizes direct payments to LEAs with at least 400 federally connected children or 3% of ADA. Each child is assigned a weight for funding purposes. The federal government compensates LEAs for serving federally connected children based on weighted student counts to determine grant amounts. Grants are calculated using a local contribution rate, and LEAs must meet fiscal requirements to be eligible for support payments. The federal government compensates LEAs for serving federally connected children based on weighted student counts to determine grant amounts. Grants are available to LEAs in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, but not to Outlying Areas or the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Impact Aid Basic Support Payments Allocation Formula involves calculating a weighted student count, determining the maximum basic support payment, and calculating the Learning Opportunity Threshold percentage for each LEA. The Learning Opportunity Threshold (LOT) percentage for an LEA is calculated based on the percentage of federally connected children in average daily attendance and total current expenditures. The LOT payment is determined by multiplying the maximum basic support payment by the LOT percentage. If appropriations are insufficient, payments are reduced proportionally, and if there is excess funding, the percentage of LOT paid is increased. Section 8003(d) authorizes payments to LEAs based on the number of federally connected children eligible for IDEA services, including children of Armed Forces members and those on Indian lands. Weighted child counts are calculated for eligible children, with a factor of 1.0 for \"a\" children and a factor for \"b\" children. The LEA's payment under Section 8003(d) is determined by multiplying eligible children by specific factors. An LEA must meet fiscal requirements to receive basic support payments. LEAs in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands serving federally connected children are eligible for grants, while Outlying Areas and the BIA are not eligible. Impact Aid Payments for Children with Disabilities Allocation Formula involves calculating a weighted student count based on federally connected children eligible for IDEA. This count is used to determine each LEA's grant, which is a proportional share of available funds. Section 8007 provides funds for construction and facilities upgrading to certain LEAs with high percentages of children living on Indian lands or children of military parents. 40% of these funds are used for formula grants, while 60% are used for other purposes. The discussion focuses on funds awarded by formula grants to LEAs with high percentages of children living on Indian lands or children of military parents. Formula grants are divided equally between these two groups of LEAs, and grants for LEAs impacted by military dependent students are determined by the total number of weighted student units enrolled in an LEA. The formula for Impact Aid Payments for Construction Allocation is based on the weighted student count, which is calculated by multiplying the student counts of military children and children living on Indian lands by their relevant weights. LEAs in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands serving federally connected children are eligible for grants, while grants are not provided to Outlying Areas or the Bureau of Indian Affairs. In Step 1, a weighted student count is calculated by multiplying the number of military children living on or off base by the appropriate weight and adding the results, or by multiplying the number of children living on Indian lands by the appropriate weight. Step 2 divides the funds equally between LEAs with at least 50% military student enrollment or 50% students living on Indian lands. Grants for LEAs impacted by military dependent students are determined by dividing the total available funding by the total number of weighted student units. The Section 8007 appropriation is calculated based on the weighted student count of military children living on or off base and children living on Indian lands. The funds are divided equally among eligible LEAs with a certain percentage of military student enrollment or students living on Indian lands. Grants for LEAs impacted by military dependent students are determined by dividing the total funding by the total number of weighted student units. The report concludes with analyses of selected aspects of the ESEA allocation formulas. Table 13 provides two different \"federal share\" calculations for each state, comparing total ESEA formula grant allocations for FY2006 to total revenues for public K-12 education for the 2005-2006 school year. The second calculation includes federal grants under all K-12 education programs administered by ED. States are sorted based on the ESEA share of total public K-12 revenues, from lowest to highest. The share of public K-12 education revenues provided under ESEA programs varies among states, with ESEA funding constituting approximately one-tenth or less of total revenues in most cases. States like Iowa, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Connecticut, and New Jersey have the lowest ESEA share due to low poverty rates and high levels of state and local funding. In contrast, Puerto Rico stands out with an ESEA share of 21.3%, the highest among all states. The ESEA share of public K-12 education revenues varies among states, with New Mexico, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Alaska receiving the highest shares at 8.4% to 10.7%. These states benefit from ESEA Impact Aid and Indian Education programs, as well as state minimum grant provisions. The national average for ESEA grants is 4.1% of total K-12 education revenues, while total ED funds make up 9.1%, with a ratio of 2.2. States like South Dakota, Montana, Alaska, Wyoming, North Dakota, and Puerto Rico have lower ratios, indicating a smaller ESEA share. States like Maine, Minnesota, Louisiana, Utah, Mississippi, and Iowa have high ratios of total federal share to ESEA share, indicating strong support from both ESEA and other federal programs. Louisiana and Mississippi stand out with high ESEA shares and high ratios, showing above-average support and lower non-federal revenues per pupil. Tables and figures provide state expenditure, effort, and equity factors used in ESEA Title I-A allocation formulas, with the expenditure factor being the most influential. The Title I-A expenditure factors adjust for state or local differences in education costs, criticized for reflecting ability to pay. Two versions apply to all Title I-A formulas except EFIG Grants, differing in constraints based on national average per pupil expenditure. States are sorted based on the three-formula version of the expenditure factor. The expenditure factor in Title I-A grants adjusts for state or local education cost differences. States are sorted based on the three-formula version of the factor, with some grouped at the floor or ceiling. The factor significantly impacts grant sizes, with grants 50% higher in states at the maximum factor compared to states at the minimum factor. The effort factor in Title I-A EFIG Grant formula rewards states with high education expenditures per pupil relative to personal income. It is calculated as the ratio of APPE to PCI for each state compared to the national average. The effort factor in the Title I-A EFIG Grant formula rewards states with high education expenditures per pupil relative to personal income. The range of the effort factor is limited to 0.95 to 1.05, with limited impact on grant levels. States with a maximum effort factor (1.05) would receive an EFIG grant of 11% more than if their effort factor were at the minimum (0.95). The EFIG equity multiplier is intended to reward states with relatively equal levels of expenditures per pupil. The equity multiplier in the EFIG Grant formula rewards states with relatively equal levels of expenditures per pupil among their LEAs. It is calculated as 1.3 minus the state's equity factor, which is based on the coefficient of variation for average per pupil expenditure among the state's LEAs. States with lower expenditure disparities have a higher multiplier, while those with greater disparities have a lower multiplier. Equity multipliers for FY2007 ranged from 1.0653 to 1.3 among states. States with the lowest equity multipliers (1.13 or below) include Illinois, Montana, Virginia, Massachusetts, Missouri, Wyoming, Vermont, and New York. States with the highest equity multipliers (1.21 or above) include West Virginia, Florida, Iowa, Washington, Delaware, and North Carolina. Table 17 and Figure 5 show state ESEA formula grants per child for FY2007 based on total school-age children and children in poor families, with significant variation in grant amounts per child. Among states, there is significant variation in average grants per school-age child and grants per school-age child in a poor family. Factors contributing to this variation include state minimum caps under Title I-A allocation formulas, school-age child poverty rates, and Alaska's eligibility for substantial funds under Titles VII and VIII. Smaller variations also exist among states in other size ranges. The average grants per school-age child vary significantly among states, with smaller states receiving higher amounts compared to larger states. Smaller jurisdictions like New Hampshire receive $644 per school-age child and $4,879 per school-age child from a poor family, while larger states receive $386 per school-age child and $2,254 per school-age child from a poor family. This difference is primarily due to state minimum grant provisions in ESEA allocation formulas. The state minimum grant provisions in ESEA allocation formulas result in significant differences in average grants per child between small and larger states. Despite this, small states receive a relatively modest share of total ESEA funds, with the 12 smallest jurisdictions receiving only 5.2% of funds in FY2007. Even if small states were to receive the same amount of funds per child as larger states, the impact on reallocating funds to larger states would be marginal. For example, reducing the share of funds going to small states by half would only result in an average increase of approximately 2.7% for larger states. The average grant per school-age child increases as the state average poverty rate rises, reflecting the allocation formulas under Title I-A. Grants increase from $309 for low poverty states to $445 for high poverty states. The average grants per school-age child vary based on the poverty rates of states. Grants are higher in states with higher poverty rates, with a decline in grants per child in states with the highest poverty rates. Factors influencing this include state size, expenditure factors, and targeting of high poverty areas under Title I-A. The distribution of grants under Title I-A formulas is done at the LEA level, favoring areas with high poverty concentrations. Some states with low overall poverty rates have LEAs with high poverty concentrations, while in states with high poverty rates, poverty is more dispersed."
