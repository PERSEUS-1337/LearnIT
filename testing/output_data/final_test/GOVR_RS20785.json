    "content": "The November 2000 elections resulted in a tied Senate with 50 Republicans and 50 Democrats. The issue was complicated by the election of Richard B. Cheney as Vice President. Talks about the organization of the Senate began informally between Democratic leader Senator Tom Daschle and Republican leader Senator Trent Lott. After the tied Senate elections in November 2000, talks between Senator Tom Daschle and Senator Trent Lott continued. Senator Daschle, recognized as majority leader, did not replace Senate administrative officers with Democratic nominees. The Senate agreed to elect Senator Robert C. Byrd as President pro tempore and Senator Strom Thurmond as President pro tempore, effective on January 20. Committee chairmen were designated on opening day, with some not returning for the 107th Congress. The 107th Congress convened with changes in committee chairmen. Senate adopted resolutions to designate acting committee chairs and establish powersharing when parties were equally divided. Committees would have equal numbers of Republicans and Democrats. In the 107th Congress, committees had equal numbers of Republicans and Democrats. A full committee chair could discharge a subcommittee from further consideration of a measure or matter if there was a tie vote. Budgets and office space for all committees were equally divided, with overall committee budgets to remain within \"historic levels.\" If a measure or nomination was not reported due to a tie vote, the majority or minority leader could move to discharge the committee, leading to a four-hour debate and a vote on the discharge motion. If discharged by a majority vote, the measure or matter would be placed on the appropriate Senate calendar. The agreement in the 107th Congress ensured equal representation in committees and allowed for discharge of measures in case of tie votes. It also outlined procedures for cloture motions and agenda control in the Senate. Senator Harry Reid clarified the powersharing agreement in January 2001. Senator Harry Reid (D-NV) received unanimous consent to enter a printed colloquy between Senators Daschle and Lott into the Congressional Record, pledging to refrain from blocking consideration of controversial issues and ensuring full and vigorous debates in the 107th Congress. Both party leaders agreed to honor all Senators' amendments and not offer consecutive amendments to fill the amendment tree. Minority party Senators were allowed to serve as presiding officers, and both parties had equal access to common space in the Capitol complex. The agreement in S.Res. 8 ensured equal access to common space in the Capitol complex for meetings and events, supplementing provisions for minority committee office space. However, it did not address all parliamentary issues, such as conference committee composition. Senator Lott and Senator Daschle focused on key points of agreement, leaving other matters unresolved. Some Senate Republicans insist on majority control of Senate conference delegations to utilize Vice President Cheney's tie-breaking vote. The process of appointing Senate conferees may require an amendable motion if objections arise. Senator Lott hinted at this possibility in a discussion on January 8. Ratios of members on conferences are determined by previous Senate practices. The Senate's traditional practice of determining ratios of members on conferences is not intended to be altered by a resolution. During the powersharing period of the 107th Congress, only two measures were sent to conference committee, with a majority of conferees being Republican. Senator James Jeffords later announced his switch from the Republican party to become an Independent and caucus with Senate Democrats. Senator James Jeffords left the Republican party to caucus with Senate Democrats, giving them a numerical edge in the Senate. The powersharing agreement in effect during this time was an experiment, leading to new issues being resolved through informal agreements or unanimous consent negotiations. The success of any Senate organizational settlement depends on adaptability to changing circumstances."
