    "title": "SB 534",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 14105.94 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to allow eligible providers to receive supplemental Medi-Cal reimbursement for ground emergency medical transportation services provided to Medi-Cal beneficiaries. Providers must meet specific criteria to qualify for this additional reimbursement. Eligible providers for supplemental Medi-Cal reimbursement must meet specific criteria, including being enrolled as a Medi-Cal provider and being owned or operated by specified entities such as the state, local government agencies, or federally recognized Indian tribes. The reimbursement calculation and payment process for eligible providers is outlined in the section. The supplemental reimbursement for eligible providers is based on federal financial participation from claims submitted. The total reimbursement from Medi-Cal and other sources cannot exceed 100% of actual costs for ground emergency medical transportation services. The supplemental Medi-Cal reimbursement for eligible providers is based on ground emergency medical transportation services provided to Medi-Cal beneficiaries. The department may also provide reimbursement for paramedic services at a rate equal to cost, pending approval from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The Legislature intends to provide supplemental reimbursement to eligible providers for ground emergency medical transportation services without using General Fund money. Providers must have an agreement with the department to receive reimbursement and cover administrative costs. The nonfederal share of reimbursement must come from specified governmental entities. Participation in the program for supplemental reimbursement for ground emergency medical transportation services is voluntary for eligible providers. If a governmental entity seeks reimbursement on behalf of an eligible provider, they must certify eligible expenditures, provide evidence, and submit data as required by the department. The department requires eligible providers to maintain records for reimbursement disclosure and comply with federal regulations. Federal approval is necessary for program implementation, and claims for federal financial participation must be submitted for allowable expenditures. The department must submit annual materials to the federal government to ensure that only allowable expenditures are included in claims for federal financial participation. If a final determination is made that supplemental reimbursement must be provided to a provider not described in this section, the director will declare the section inoperative. The department will implement an intergovernmental transfer program for Medi-Cal managed care and ground emergency medical transportation. The declaration will be provided to various committees, posted online, and regulatory action may not be necessary for implementation. Increased reimbursement for ground emergency medical transport services provided to Medi-Cal managed care enrollees is available to eligible providers who meet specific conditions in a state fiscal year. The eligibility criteria for increased reimbursement for ground emergency medical transport services under Medi-Cal managed care include ownership by specific entities like state, city, county, fire protection district, special district, community services district, health care district, or a federally recognized Indian tribe. The department will increase capitation payments to Medi-Cal managed care plans for ground emergency medical transportation services provided by eligible providers through intergovernmental transfers. These payments will match the supplemental fee-for-service payments available to eligible providers under federal law. All funds from these transfers will be used to provide additional payments to eligible providers. Medi-Cal managed care plans must pay 100% of increased capitation payments to eligible providers for ground emergency medical transportation services. The intergovernmental transfer program will be implemented on January 1, 2016, or later with necessary federal approvals. Retroactive implementation may occur as needed. The intergovernmental transfer program for Medi-Cal managed care plans is voluntary and does not require additional funds from the General Fund. Eligible providers must agree to reimburse the department for any implementation costs. Administrative fees do not apply to intergovernmental transfers under this program. As a condition of participation, Medi-Cal managed care plans, eligible providers, and affiliated governmental entities must comply with requests for information for federal fund claims. Implementation of this section depends on federal financial participation and necessary approvals. The director can adjust payments to meet federal Medicaid requirements. The increased capitation payments can start from January 1, 2016, upon federal approval. The department can implement this section through various instructions without regulatory action."
