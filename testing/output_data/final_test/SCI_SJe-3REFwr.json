    "content": "Transformers have shown impressive results in natural language processing tasks, but struggle with modeling long sentences due to dispersed global attention. To address this, a Multi-scale attention model (MUSE) combines attention networks with convolutional and feed-forward networks to capture local and token features efficiently. This approach reuses the feed-forward layer from the original Transformer and utilizes lightweight dynamic convolution for implementation. The proposed model, MUSE, outperforms Transformer in various translation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on datasets like IWSLT 2014 German to English and WMT 2014 English to French. Transformer, known for its sequence learning capabilities, relies on self-attention to capture global dependencies between input tokens. Recent research has highlighted shortcomings in the Transformer model's long sequence learning due to over-concentrated and dispersed attention, leading to insufficient representation of information. Local attention has been proposed as a solution to this issue. MUSE, a hybrid self-attention and convolution model, addresses the limitations of self-attention in capturing long-range dependencies in sequence to sequence learning tasks. It combines self-attention and depth-separable convolution to encode inputs and improve information capture. The model's effectiveness is demonstrated through the Parallel multi-scale attention approach, which enhances both local and global context modeling. The proposed method, MUSE, combines self-attention and convolution to address the limitations of self-attention in capturing long-range dependencies. It introduces a parallel multi-scale attention approach for improved local and global context modeling, achieving better performance in generating long sequences. The proposed method, MUSE, combines self-attention and convolution to improve representation learning and increase inference speed by 31% on GPUs. It utilizes a parallel multi-scale attention approach for better local and global context modeling, achieving state-of-the-art BLEU scores on machine translation tasks. The encoder-decoder framework includes N MUSE modules with residual mechanism and layer normalization for connecting layers. The decoder performs attention over the output of the encoder stack. The proposed model, MUSE, combines self-attention and convolution to enhance representation learning. It includes a MUSE module with self-attention, depth-wise separable convolution, and position-wise feed-forward network for capturing global, local, and token features. The module utilizes multi-scale attention hybrids for learning sequence representations in parallel. The MUSE model combines self-attention and convolution for representation learning. MUSE-simple is a simplified version without convolution. Self-attention learns global context representations by projecting input sequences into key, query, and value representations. Convolution operations are introduced in MUSE to capture local context. Incorporating convolution operations into MUSE helps capture local context by utilizing depth-wise convolution. This approach includes point-wise projecting and contextual transformations, with dynamic convolution being the chosen implementation. Multiple cells with varying kernel sizes are used to capture different-range features, with the output defined by specific parameters. Incorporating depth convolution in MUSE involves point-wise projecting and shared projection mechanisms to learn contextual sequence representations. A gating mechanism is introduced to select weights of different convolution cells for token level learning. MUSE incorporates a mechanism to automatically select weights of different convolution cells for token level learning. It concatenates a self-attention network with a positionwise feed-forward network at each layer. The model is evaluated on four machine translation tasks using the WMT 2014 English-French translation dataset. The dataset consists of 36M sentence pairs and follows a standard split for development and test sets. The model also adopts a joint source and target BPE factorization with a vocabulary size of 40K. The model also uses joint source and target BPE factorization with a vocabulary size of 40K. For smaller datasets, it utilizes the WMT 2014 English-German translation dataset with 4.5M sentence pairs and a BPE vocabulary size of 32K. Additionally, experiments are conducted on IWSLT datasets, including a German-English dataset with 160k sentence pairs and an English-Vietnamese dataset with 133k training pairs. The vocabulary sizes for English and Vietnamese are 17.2K and 6.8K, respectively. The MUSE models, MUSE-base and MUSE-large, are built with parameters comparable to Transformer models. They use multi-head attention with 4 heads for MUSE-base and 16 heads for MUSE-large. The architecture includes 12 residual blocks for encoder and decoder, with dimensions of 384 for MUSE-base and 768 for MUSE-large. The hidden dimension for non-linear transformation is 768 for MUSE-base and 3072 for MUSE-large. MUSE-large is trained on 4 Titan RTX GPUs, while MUSE-base is trained on a single NVIDIA GPU. The MUSE-large model is trained on 4 Titan RTX GPUs, while MUSE-base is trained on a single NVIDIA RTX 2080Ti GPU. Dynamic convolution is used as a variant of depth-wise separable convolution, with kernel sizes tuned on the validation set. The training hyper-parameters, including the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001, are also tuned on the validation set. The model is trained for 20K steps with a batch size of 4K for the De-En dataset and for 10K steps for the En-Vi dataset. The dropout rate is set to 0.4 for the En-Vi dataset, trained for 10K steps with a batch size of 4K. Parameters are updated every 4 steps. Checkpoints are saved every epoch and the last 10 are averaged for inference. Beam search with a beam size of 5 is used for translation tasks. BLEU 1 metric is used for evaluation, showing MUSE outperforms previous models on En-De and En-Fr translation tasks. The proposed parallel multi-scale attention model outperforms previous models on En-De and En-Fr translation tasks. MUSE-base achieves a state-of-the-art score of 36.3 on the IWSLT De-En translation dataset. The MUSE-simple model achieves state-of-the-art performance on three tasks in the IWSLT De-En translation dataset by incorporating multi-scale attention. Convolution is crucial in enhancing the multi-scale attention, but combining it with self-attention for better sequence-to-sequence representations is challenging. Incorporating multi-scale attention in the MUSE-simple model improves performance on IWSLT De-En translation tasks. However, combining convolution and self-attention for sequence representations proves challenging, as they both learn contextual sequence representations in the same hidden space. Sharing projection in parallel multi-scale attention shows a 1.4 BLEU score gain over separate projection. The proposed approach in MUSE improves performance on translation tasks by incorporating multi-scale attention. It introduces dynamically selected kernel sizes to allow the network to decide the best size for each layer. Parallel multi-scale attention enhances time efficiency on GPUs by combining small matrices into larger ones for faster computation.

MUSE generates better sequences of various lengths than self-attention, particularly excelling in generating long sequences. Lower layers prioritize local context while higher layers prefer more contextual representations. The weight of dynamic convolution cells in MUSE varies across layers, with lower layers favoring local features and higher layers preferring global features. MUSE not only improves BLEU scores but also enhances translation quality by generating more coherent sentences. Case studies on the De-En dataset show that MUSE outperforms the baseline Transformer in fluency and accuracy. Sequence to sequence learning is crucial in machine learning, with machine translation serving as a key application. Traditional methods like LSTM have limitations, leading to exploration of CNN and models like MUSE which combine local convolution with global self-attention for improved translation quality. Recent studies have explored convolutional neural networks (CNN) and self-attention for high-parallel sequence modeling, capturing local and global dependencies efficiently. While some studies combine self-attention and convolution, they do not outperform individual mechanisms. Sukhbaatar et al. propose augmenting convolution with self-attention for computer vision tasks, but this method does not work for sequence to sequence learning. State-of-the-art models in question answering tasks still rely on self-attention and do not adopt ideas from QAnet. Both self-attention and convolution outperform Evolved transformer by nearly 2 BLEU scores. The proposed Parallel Multi-scale Attention (MUSE) and MUSE-simple outperform previous models on translation tasks by combining self-attention, convolution, and point-wise transformation. This approach addresses the issue of dispersed weights in attention, especially for long sequences, by learning global and local context effectively. MUSE combines self-attention, convolution, and point-wise transformation to learn global, local, and token level sequence representations. The shared projection is crucial for its success in multiscale learning. Future work will explore the effects of shared projection on contextual representation learning and apply the idea to other tasks like image and speech processing.
