The focus was on trade, investment, energy, and climate change, with plans to re-convene the U.S.-India Trade Policy Forum and establish a Joint Working Group on Climate Change. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel will visit India in August. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel will travel to India in August to reinvigorate the defense partnership. Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitley presented a partial-year national budget on July 10, showing the new government's interest in economic reforms. The budget aims to raise foreign direct investment caps in insurance and defense, but lacks a clear path for market opening and intellectual property rights protection. The budget maintains major subsidy and social welfare programs, reflecting India's historical focus on populist initiatives for the poor. The Indian budget aims to raise foreign direct investment caps in insurance and defense sectors, but falls short of the majority allowance desired by Indian and international business interests. India blocked a WTO trade facilitation agreement, extending negotiations due to concerns over food security programs. Prime Minister Modi may be considering the interests of farmers, a demographic not typically supportive of his ruling party. The trade facilitation deal in the WTO is seen as a breakthrough in the Doha Round negotiations. India's decision to obstruct the deal has raised concerns about delegitimizing the WTO. The US and India have been building a strategic partnership based on shared values and interests. India hopes to resolve differences when the WTO reconvenes in September. In 2005, the United States and India signed a defense framework agreement to expand security cooperation. Bilateral trade has grown significantly, reaching over $97 billion in 2013. Indians receive a majority of H1-B visas and there are about 100,000 Indian students in American universities. The Indian-American community, with roughly three million people, has a significant influence in Congress. President Barack Obama's Administration has sought to deepen U.S. engagement with India, building upon efforts started by President Bill Clinton in 2000 and expanded under President George W. Bush. However, there are concerns about a loss of momentum in the partnership, highlighted by diplomatic disputes and disagreements over various issues such as intellectual property rights, market access, immigration law, and civil nuclear cooperation. In May 2014, India's national election resulted in a historic win for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, known for his strong-willed and effective leadership. Modi's government promises fresh U.S. engagement with a more pro-trade and pro-business approach, aiming for a more assertive foreign policy. The BJP-led Indian government under Prime Minister Modi has a firmly Hindu nationalist perspective, which could impact the country's traditional non-alignment approach to global politics. There are concerns about Modi's controversial past, including suspicions about his role in communal rioting in Gujarat in 2002. President Obama and top U.S. officials are interested in strengthening bilateral relations with India to boost trade, investment, and security cooperation. In 2002, communal rioting in Gujarat resulted in up to 2,000 deaths, mostly Muslims. Despite no formal charges, Modi is accused of complicity in the violence. The Bush Administration denied him a visa in 2005, and concerns about his past continue. A BJP-majority government could threaten human and civil rights in India. President Obama clarified the visa issue promptly. President Obama quickly addressed the visa issue by inviting Prime Minister Modi to visit Washington, DC. Modi is scheduled to visit in late September, with Secretary Kerry praising India's democratic exercise and emphasizing the importance of the bilateral relationship. Congressional members have shown support for India's new government, with committees in both chambers holding hearings on U.S.-India relations. In D.C. policy circles, there is anticipation for Modi's visit. In July, Senate and House hearings were held on U.S.-India relations. There is no consensus on India's new government in D.C. policy circles, with concerns about Prime Minister Modi's challenges in meeting high expectations. Washington's reaction to India's election results is a mix of curiosity, hope, and concern. The interest in the strong electoral win of a Delhi outsider, optimism from the business community for reform, and worries about past U.S. shunning of Modi and his stance on religious minorities are key points in the discussion on U.S.-India relations. Some analysts believe that Modi will not significantly change the trajectory of the relationship, while others question the idea of the U.S. and India as \"natural partners\" due to India's stance on Russia's actions in Ukraine. The recent demonstration of diverging U.S. and Indian strategic interests, with some questioning the strength of the partnership due to global circumstances. Analysts urge Washington to see a stronger India as beneficial, despite poor chances for immediate improvement in bilateral ties. Analysts suggest that New Delhi's future policies are likely to benefit the United States indirectly. U.S. officials are advised to work openly with the Modi government to address Indian sensitivities and demonstrate commitment to the rebalance to Asia. India's record-breaking democratic exercise in 2014 involved 815 million voters with a 66.4% turnout. In India's 2014 democratic election, a record 66.4% of 815 million eligible voters turned out to elect a new Lok Sabha. The BJP won a majority of seats, allowing Modi to become the first lower-caste prime minister without coalition partners. The Rajya Sabha, India's smaller upper parliamentary chamber, can impede the BJP's governance agenda as the Congress Party holds a plurality of seats. Key reforms depend on state governments, with only eight currently controlled by the BJP or its allies. Analysts suggest that Indian voters elected Narendra Modi not for his Hindu nationalism but for clean governance and economic reforms. Modi's mandate was likely boosted by the split in Muslim votes among \"secular\" parties, allowing the BJP to win a majority of seats with only 31% of the popular vote. Critics argue that the election was not truly historic, as more than two-thirds of votes went to non-BJP candidates, and regional parties still held significant sway. Prime Minister Modi has reduced the cabinet size from 71 to 44 ministers, with key officials including Rajnath Singh, Sushma Swaraj, and Arun Jaitley. Critics point out that many cabinet ministers are facing criminal charges and are over 60 years old, contradicting Modi's image as a champion of youth. Critics of Prime Minister Modi view him as a ruthless and dictatorial leader who has cultivated an autocratic image. They point to allegations of extrajudicial killings in Gujarat during his tenure. Despite his supporters seeing him as a strong and effective leader, detractors highlight a disregard for the rule of law. India's economic growth has been significant, positioning it to become the world's third-largest economy by 2030. India's economic growth is slowing down, with deficits widening significantly. The country is facing its worst economic slowdown since the 1980s, with two years of sub-5% annual growth and high inflation. To maintain its international influence and attractiveness as a U.S. partner, India needs to reverse these negative economic trends. Modi's business-friendly policies have attracted foreign investors, leading to a surge in India's stock index value before the election. India's top stock index surged by 25% in the 8 months leading up to the election, reaching a new record high after the results were announced. The Mumbai stock market entered the world's top ten for the first time. Arun Jaitley, the finance minister, emphasized attracting foreign and domestic investment for infrastructure and skills development. The BJP's economic policies are debated between \"pro-market\" and \"protectionist\" approaches, making it challenging to predict future economic policies. Predicting future BJP economic policy is challenging due to the debate between \"pro-market\" and \"protectionist\" approaches. While private sector initiatives will be encouraged, state governments hold considerable power over reforms in key sectors, hindering investment climate improvement. Modi also faces foreign policy commitments amidst urgent domestic priorities. Modi faces a busy foreign policy schedule with appearances at five multilateral summit meetings before year's end. He has shown a preference for a pragmatic approach to foreign relations, focusing on economic growth through non-confrontational engagement with India's neighbors. Modi's foreign policy emphasizes economic growth through engagement with India's neighbors, including Pakistan. SAARC leaders were invited to his inauguration, signaling a focus on regional relations. Analysts praise India's prioritization of nearby ties, which could boost economic prospects. Modi's stance on Bangladesh highlights a distinction between Muslim \"infiltrators\" and Hindu \"refugees.\" India's relations with neighboring countries like Bangladesh and China are influenced by various factors such as historical conflicts, ethnic communities, and economic interests. The presence of Hindu \"refugees\" in Bangladesh and the Tamil minority in Sri Lanka affects India's foreign policy decisions. Additionally, India's strained relationship with China, stemming from past conflicts and territorial disputes, is further complicated by China's support for Pakistan and increasing presence in the Indian Ocean Region. Prime Minister Modi's nationalist stance is seen as a response to China's growing influence, while also prioritizing economic growth and regional engagement. Prime Minister Modi has worked to strengthen ties with China through business-oriented trips and promoting commercial links. China is India's largest trade partner, providing investment capital, technology, and management skills. However, tensions with Pakistan persist due to separatist insurgency and terrorist attacks. Modi's Hindu nationalist stance may escalate conflicts with Pakistan, especially in the event of a major terrorist attack traced back to Pakistani soil. Prime Minister Modi aims to balance tensions with Pakistan, particularly in the event of a major terrorist attack traced back to Pakistani soil. He has also focused on strengthening ties with Japan, with experts suggesting that Japan is ripe for deepened relations with India under Modi's leadership. Abe's firm stance on Chinese expansionism aligns with Modi's goals, and Japanese companies have made significant investments in Gujarat. India's strong partnership with Japan under Modi's leadership is driven by shared values and interests. Afghanistan's stability is crucial for India's regional policy, with competition from Pakistan for influence. Modi aims to engage with Kabul while avoiding conflict with Islamabad. Bilateral relations with Israel have flourished in the 21st century, despite formal recognition only coming in 1992. In the 21st century, India's bilateral relations with Israel have blossomed, driven by booming trade in gemstones and defense wares. Prime Minister Modi has close ties to Israeli business leaders and visited Israel as chief minister. Despite maintaining a neutral stance on the Gaza conflict, India has joined the United States in calling for restraint. Frictions with Iran have emerged as India aligns more closely with Washington, including reducing imports of Iranian oil. However, Iran remains a key source of hydrocarbons for India's energy needs, and India continues to develop Iran's Chabahar port. Prime Minister Modi's evolving stance towards Iran may force him to choose between cooperating with Iran or aligning with countries isolating Iran due to its nuclear program. Hindu nationalism, as embraced by parties like the BJP, views India as inherently Hindu, despite not aiming for a strictly Hindu state. Hinduism's lack of a specific sacred text makes the term \"Hindu fundamentalist\" inaccurate. Religions like Islam and Christianity are seen as a threat to the \"Hindu nation\" by Hindu nationalists, who have specific political goals such as scaling back laws benefiting religious minorities, establishing a Uniform Civil Code, repealing Article 370, redrafting school textbooks, and constructing a Ram temple on the site of the Babri Mosque. The United States and India engage closely on various global issues, including science, technology, space, healthcare, education, and sustainable growth. India, a non-signatory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, maintains a nuclear arsenal and is working to enhance its size and sophistication. The issue of Indian nuclear weapons has become less prominent in the relationship since the signing of the U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Agreement in 2005. The US supports India's entry into multilateral arms control organizations and aims for $500 billion in annual bilateral trade by 2024. Bilateral Investment Treaty negotiations are crucial for investment framework. Obama Administration raises concerns about investment diversity and urges transparency in India's investment practices. India is urged to create a transparent way to attract foreign investment and uphold intellectual property rights based on international norms. The US Trade Representative's report highlights India's challenging environment for IPR protection and enforcement, citing issues such as high rates of piracy and counterfeit pharmaceuticals. The US Trade Representative's report highlights India's challenging environment for IPR protection and enforcement, citing issues such as high rates of piracy and counterfeit pharmaceuticals. An \"Out-of-Cycle Review\" for India is expected to address U.S. concerns and boost engagement with trading partners. The Obama Administration sees India's economic connectivity as vital to the region's prosperity and stability, seeking initiatives to better link India with Central Asia and Southeast Asia. Modi's nationalism could align with US policy of rebalancing toward Asia. Washington is urged to take a pragmatic stance with New Delhi. India is eager to import natural gas from the United States, with Prime Minister Modi emphasizing renewable fuels but acknowledging the need for carbon-based fuels due to soaring demand. Exporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) to India is seen as a way to strengthen the bilateral partnership without raising prices for U.S. consumers. Defense cooperation with India is viewed as important by the United States in the context of rebalancing toward Asia. The United States values defense cooperation with India based on common principles and shared national interests like defeating terrorism, preventing weapons proliferation, and maintaining regional stability. Increased security ties are seen as a way to counterbalance growing Chinese influence in Asia. India is modernizing its military, including plans to spend up to $100 billion on updating its arsenal. Bilateral military-to-military contacts have increased, with joint exercises involving all military services since 2002. India and the United States have strengthened their military relations through joint exercises and personnel exchanges. The navy-to-navy collaboration is particularly robust, with the Pentagon eager to expand maritime cooperation with India. Intelligence and counterterrorism cooperation have also increased, but there is a disparity in the willingness to move forward, with India being more hesitant due to lingering distrust of U.S. intentions. Indian wariness of U.S. intentions is rooted in distrust, highlighted by reports of U.S. spying on the BJP. Structural impediments hinder future cooperation, such as the lack of a national-level body in India for engagement. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel emphasized India's importance as a global partner. Reforming India's defense systems is crucial for continued security cooperation. High-level engagement on the Defense Trade and Technology Initiative (DTTI) is a priority for continued bilateral security cooperation between the U.S. and India. Optimism exists that Modi may make changes to India's FDI caps and offsets policies to encourage international defense firms to collaborate. Calls for a revamped formal framework for bilateral defense engagement and greater diplomatic efforts on regional security matters, including human rights abuses in India. The curr_chunk discusses various human rights abuses in India, including police brutality, corruption, violence against women, child abuse, forced labor, and discrimination based on caste, religion, and disabilities. Religious freedom is highlighted as a contentious issue in the country. The curr_chunk discusses concerns about potential domestic communal frictions and violence under Modi's government, with experts emphasizing the importance of his performance in power to prevent new communal violence. Human rights groups fear constraints under Modi's leadership and express concerns about minority rights and freedom of expression. If India's economic troubles persist, Modi may resort to using religious politics for political support, potentially hampering his economic and political goals."
