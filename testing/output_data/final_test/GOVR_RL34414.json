The State Department identifies eligible refugee children overseas for resettlement in the US. The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) cares for these vulnerable children until they are reunited with family or turn 18, providing foster care through a URM program. Since 1980, the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) has handled approximately 12,000 unaccompanied refugee minors (URMs) in the United States. The URM policy debate in the US centers around advocates for increased URM inflows and supporters of current levels. Supporters of greater URM inflows cite rising refugee levels globally, while proponents of current policy highlight the US's already high refugee admission levels. The key policy question for Congress is the number of URMs identified abroad and brought to the US. The report provides an overview of URM policy in the United States, including agencies involved, resources available, trends, statistics, and recent legislation. The emergence of unaccompanied refugee minors as an issue in the US is linked to large refugee flows and US involvement in conflicts. The report will be updated as needed. During World War II, the United States developed policies to assist unaccompanied refugee minors, evacuating children from war zones and displaced persons camps in Europe. Public sympathy was met with opposition questioning the children's ability to assimilate and security concerns. The Cold War era further complicated diplomatic tensions surrounding refugee resettlement. During the Cold War era, diplomatic tensions and political circumstances led to a second wave of unaccompanied refugee children from Soviet-allied countries being eligible for resettlement in the United States. Various programs like the Refugee Relief Act of 1953 and the Hungarian Refugee Program of 1956 allowed European children from Eastern bloc countries to enter outside of immigration quotas. In the early 1960s, a large number of unaccompanied refugee children from communist-controlled Cuba entered the US. The Vietnam conflict also resulted in efforts to assist unaccompanied child refugees, with Operation Babylift in 1975 drawing public attention. Operation Babylift in 1975 brought over 2,500 orphans from Vietnam to the US, but the first flight crashed, killing 78 children. This led to the Indochinese Refugee Children Assistance Program in 1979, highlighting challenges in handling unaccompanied refugee minors. Federal coordination between DOD, DOS, and INS was established, setting the stage for future policy development. The federal coordination in handling unaccompanied refugee minors in 1979 involved the Department of State (DOS) and HHS's ORR, addressing issues such as overlapping jurisdiction, reimbursement concerns, coordination between public and private sectors, detention of juveniles in adult facilities, and age determination of potential juveniles in the refugee population. Congress held hearings in 1979 and 1980 to address these difficulties. In 1979 and 1980, Congress held hearings to address difficulties in dealing with refugees and URMs. The Refugee Act of 1980 was passed to provide a uniform procedure for refugee admissions and federal assistance for resettlement. Special provisions were included for URMs, such as federal reimbursement to welfare providers and placement under state law. The Refugee Act of 1980 addressed difficulties in dealing with refugees and unaccompanied refugee minors (URMs) by providing federal assistance for resettlement and special provisions for URMs, including granting legal custody to the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) and tracking information on URMs in the United States. Since then, ORR has expanded its URM program to include Cuban/Haitian entrants and unaccompanied alien children. To be placed in the URM program, children must be considered refugees, victims of trafficking, Cuban/Haitian entrants, or have been granted asylum. URMs are identified abroad for U.S. resettlement, but some are already in the U.S. when deemed eligible. ORR also cares for \"unaccompanied alien children\" (UAC) detained for unauthorized presence in the U.S. URMs are legally present under the INA, while UACs are defined under the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The URM program and the UAC program are distinct programs administered by ORR, but they operate jointly. Occasionally, refugee children in the URM program may be reclassified as \"unaccompanied\" based on changing family circumstances. ORR reclassifies minors on a case-by-case basis, with the Director having discretion to waive criteria. Cubans and Haitians are also included in these programs. The creation of the new entrant category was promoted by political and social considerations stemming from the large number of Cuban and Haitian nationals arriving by sea who attempted to claim asylum upon arrival in the United States. Immigration officials can choose to grant refugee status, grant parole, or return them to Cuba or Haiti. When an unaccompanied entrant is placed in ORR's custody, ORR will reclassify that entrant to URM status and provide the same services and treatment as for URMs. Some children who come to the United States as UACs request asylum to avoid repatriation. When unaccompanied children (UACs) request asylum in the United States, they are placed under removal proceedings and cared for under the URM program. Authorities follow \"affirmative\" or \"defensive\" application procedures for evaluation. If asylum is granted, a child becomes a URM and may apply for legal permanent resident status after one year. If asylum is denied, the government may pursue removal proceedings. The asylum process for UACs is similar to adults but with some key distinctions, with unclear qualifying requirements according to DHS guidelines and case law. The qualifying requirements for asylum for unaccompanied children in the United States are unclear, especially regarding the age at which a child can apply without parental consent. Cases like Walter Polovchak and Elian Gonzalez have shown that the age varies, with a 12-year-old considered old enough to apply independently. The URM program, developed by ORR, collaborates with state child welfare providers and volunteer organizations. The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) collaborates with welfare service providers and volunteer organizations, particularly the Lutheran Immigration Refugee Services (LIRS) and the United States Catholic Conference (USCC), to operate the unaccompanied refugee minor program. These agencies assist ORR by providing a range of services, including identifying entrants and asylum children, providing direct services like foster care placements, and planning URM program services. The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) collaborates with welfare service providers and volunteer organizations to operate the unaccompanied refugee minor program. ORR works closely with state providers in 16 different states to support the URM program. Despite their small numbers, the vulnerability of unaccompanied refugee children is notable. Figures and tables depict the URM population from FY1999 through FY2005. During FY1999 to FY2005, a total of 782 new unaccompanied refugee minors (URMs) were admitted to the United States. The gender composition of the URM population was predominantly male, with fluctuations in annual rates. Michigan had the highest cumulative number of URMs placed in state social service programs among 16 states. During FY1999 to FY2005, Michigan had the largest cumulative number of URMs placed in state social service programs, accounting for 27% of the total. Virginia and Washington also had significant placements, making up 23% of the total. FY2005 showed a more dispersed distribution of URMs among states, with Michigan, Massachusetts, and Washington experiencing a reduced burden while New York and Texas saw an increase of over 50%. ORR and its partners have various options for placing URMs. During FY1999-FY2005, the most common placement option for unaccompanied refugee minors (URMs) was foster homes, with 50.9% placed in FY2005. Independent living was also a common option, peaking at 34.2% in FY2003 but declining in FY2004 and FY2005. Semi-independent placements decreased from 18.4% in FY2000 to a low. During FY1999-FY2005, placements for unaccompanied refugee minors (URMs) varied, with foster homes being the most common option at 50.9% in FY2005. Independent living peaked at 34.2% in FY2003 but declined in subsequent years. Semi-independent placements also decreased from 18.4% in FY2000 to a low of 11.8% in FY2004. Other less common placement options included group homes, residential treatment facilities, and homes of relatives, which combined for 17.6% of placements in FY2005. Refugee children constituted the majority of the URM population at 88.7% from FY1999 to FY2005. During FY1999-FY2005, refugee children made up 88.7% of the URM population. Other classifications included child asylum seekers (2.3%), Cuban-Haitian entrants (2.7%), unaccompanied refugee children due to family breakdown (2.6%), trafficking victims (2.2%), and children reclassified as URMs after age determinations (1.5%). Country sources for URMs during this period are listed in Table 2. During FY1999-FY2005, the majority of URMs came from regions like Sub-Saharan Africa, Central America, and the Middle East, with countries like Sudan, Liberia, Haiti, and Honduras being significant sources. These countries were often impoverished or in conflict, with Sudan alone accounting for 52% of URMs during this time period. Afghanistan also contributed 30 URMs during this time. During FY1999 to FY2005, the United States accepted approximately 30 unaccompanied refugee minors (URMs) each year from countries like Haiti and Sudan. The URM program has few critics due to its long operation and strong ties with state and volunteer agencies. Policy debates now focus on who should be granted URM status, rather than how to handle the children once in the program. The URM program has faced criticism for its lack of proactive identification of eligible children, with limited data available on unaccompanied refugee children. Concerns have been raised about the displaced population in and around Iraq, where many children are affected by the violent insurgency. According to UNHCR, around 2.3 million Iraqis are refugees in neighboring countries, with children being a particularly affected group. Advocacy groups are pushing for changes in U.S. policy to grant more Iraqi nationals refugee status, and the U.S. has pledged to admit 12,000 Iraqi refugees in FY2008. The United States pledged to admit 12,000 Iraqi refugees in FY2008. Afghan nationals fled their homeland due to conflicts since 1978. The UNHCR estimated a population-of-concern of 3.6 million, with 1.9 million being refugees. Advocacy groups are calling for aid for displaced populations from Darfur. The U.S. government is increasing efforts to aid displaced populations persecuted by the Janjaweed militia, including children who lost their families. The UNHCR estimated a population-of-concern of 2 million in Sudan, with 500,000 refugees in Chad. The George W. Bush administration labeled the Janjaweed actions as genocide. Despite condemnation, violence continues, and few refugees are resettled in advanced industrial countries like the U.S. Refugee admissions in the U.S. have not reached the annual ceiling, with the highest level in FY2005 at 53,738. In FY2007, the U.S. refugee admission level was 48,281, increasing to 80,000 in FY2008. Critics question if the U.S. is admitting enough qualifying refugees, especially children, considering the global refugee population of 9.7 million. Despite having one of the highest refugee admission levels globally, concerns remain about the U.S.'s share. Legislation related to unaccompanied refugee minors has not been introduced in the 111th Congress, but a bill from the 110th Congress may be reintroduced. Senator Diane Feinstein sponsored the Unaccompanied Alien legislation in the Senate. Senator Diane Feinstein sponsored the Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act of 2007 (S. 844) in the current Congress, which aimed to make statutory changes for the treatment and detention of unaccompanied alien minors, including refugees. The legislation also included provisions for child advocates and granting ORR access to children in DHS custody to determine their age. The Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act of 2007, sponsored by Senator Diane Feinstein, aimed to make statutory changes for the treatment and detention of unaccompanied alien minors. The amendment passed the Senate by a voice vote and was included in the \"A Place to Call Home Act\" (H.R. 3409) dealing with youth-related issues."
