    "content": "The \"Rural and Tribal Voter Rights Act\" defines key terms and provides for payments to states for activities such as expanding early voting access and voter registration reforms. The Commission will provide annual payments to states that meet specified requirements. The payment amount is determined based on the total appropriation minus minimum payment amounts, multiplied by the State allocation percentage. The State allocation percentage is calculated based on the voting age population of a State compared to the total voting age population of all States. The guaranteed minimum payment amount for a State cannot be less than one-half of 1 percent of the total appropriation for payments under the authorization for the fiscal year. The State allocation percentage is determined based on voting age population. A State must certify compliance with requirements to receive funds. Funds are to be used for training election officials, establishing early voting locations. The State can use funds for various purposes such as establishing early voting locations, implementing the State plan, acquiring voting technology, establishing online registration systems, and educating voters. States must meet the requirements of the Act to improve election administration for Federal office. The State is eligible for payments under this section for litigation costs or judgments. Any funds received must be deposited in the State election fund. Appropriations are authorized to provide grants for States to fulfill Act requirements. Any payment made to a State under this section shall be available to the State without fiscal year limitation. SEC. 4. EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF EARLY VOTING POLLING LOCATIONS. The State or local election official must provide early voting locations on tribal land upon request by the Tribal government. Each State must develop a plan for the equitable distribution of early voting locations, involving public hearings and consultation with relevant officials. The State plan for early voting locations must consider population density, travel time to local election offices, and potential use of alternate locations like public buildings and courthouses. Stakeholders and citizens appointed by the chief State election official are involved in the planning process. The State plan for early voting locations must consider various factors such as population density, travel time to election offices, and use of public buildings, courthouses, and other locations. It should also ensure equal access to early voting for all protected classes under the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The plan should be revised as needed to accommodate changes in voter populations, and each state's plan will be published in the Federal Register by the Commission. The State plan for early voting locations must consider factors like population density and travel time. States must provide equitable distribution of early voting locations to be exempt from certain requirements. Each State must offer early voting for at least ten days before a Federal election, allowing eligible voters to cast their ballots in person. This requirement goes into effect one year after the enactment of the Act. Additionally, certain Federal facilities will be designated as voter registration agencies. The Secretaries of various agencies must allow States to designate their facilities as voter registration agencies under the National Voter Registration Act of 1993. These agencies are required to offer voter registration forms with applications for services and assistance. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 requires agencies to provide voter registration forms with applications for services. The form must include a question about registering to vote, a statement about assistance not being affected by registering, and options to indicate registration preferences. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 mandates agencies to offer voter registration forms with service applications. They must assist applicants in completing forms and transmit completed applications to election officials electronically. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 requires voter registration agencies to transmit completed applications to election officials within specific timeframes, with exceptions for applications close to election deadlines. Updated registrations must be labeled accordingly. This section applies only to designated voter registration agencies and does not affect section 7 of the Act. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 requires designated voter registration agencies to integrate with state electronic voter registration systems, providing an online system for electronic registration and transmission of applications to election officials. SEC. 7. SAME DAY AND ELECTRONIC REGISTRATION. (a) Same Day Registration.--Each State must allow eligible individuals to register and vote on the day of a Federal election, including early voting, using a compliant form. \n(b) Electronic Registration.--States must offer a secure online interface on a government website for eligible individuals to register or update their voter registration electronically. The online voter registration application must meet the requirements of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993. States must comply with the online registration requirements one year after the enactment of the Act. Eligible individuals can register and vote on the day of a Federal election without a written signature. An \"eligible individual\" for a Federal election is someone qualified to vote. This section does not apply to states without voter registration requirements for Federal elections. SEC. 8. ENFORCEMENT. The Attorney General can take legal action in district court to enforce the Act, and individuals can also bring a civil action if a violation is not corrected within a specified timeframe. If a violation occurs within 30 days of a federal election, notice to the chief State election official is not required before taking legal action. The rights and remedies provided by this Act do not supersede the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The Act does not authorize or require conduct prohibited by the Voting Rights Act of 1965."
