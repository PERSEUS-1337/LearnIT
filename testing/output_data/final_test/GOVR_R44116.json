DOD has relied on contractors for various military operations, with contractors playing a critical role in supporting U.S. military servicemembers. During recent operations, contractors often made up 50% of the workforce. Since 2008, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) has published quarterly contractor census reports providing data on contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan. Questions have been raised about the reliability of DOD's contractor data, but DOD officials claim improvements have been made since 2009, including updates to information technology systems like the joint Synchronized Predeployment and Operational Tracker (SPOT) database. For the fourth quarter of Fiscal Year 2018, CENTCOM reported 49,451 contractor personnel working for DOD within its area of responsibility, including 28,189 individuals in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. Obligations for DOD-funded contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan from FY2009 to FY2018 totaled approximately $208 billion in FY2019 dollars. Force management levels set bounds on military personnel deployment, with the U.S. government using various terms like troop caps or force manning levels. The U.S. government has used force management levels to guide military operations overseas, limiting the number of personnel stationed in Europe in the 1980s and managing military presence in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. The Trump Administration has delegated authority to the Secretary of Defense for establishing force management levels. In August 2017, the DOD announced revisions to force management level practices for Afghanistan. The Defense Department revised force management level accounting practices for Afghanistan to include U.S. Armed Forces personnel on short-duration missions, temporary duty status, combat support agencies, and material recovery element. Data on military personnel deployed in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria were no longer reported in late 2017, leading to criticism. Some experts suggested that force management limits may have increased reliance on contractors and temporary duty personnel for ongoing military operations. In 2017, General John Nicholson testified about the use of contractors in Afghanistan due to force manning levels. The FY2018 NDAA included a provision discouraging substituting contractors for Armed Forces members during overseas deployments. The FY2018 NDAA included a provision discouraging the use of contractors to substitute for Armed Forces members during overseas deployments. The Secretary of Defense was directed to provide a briefing on revising deployment guidelines to prioritize readiness, unit cohesion, and maintenance, and to establish a policy to avoid direct substitution of contractor personnel for U.S. military personnel when possible. The use of private security contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan between FY2002 and FY2011 led to an over-reliance on contractors by DOD, Department of State, and USAID. These contractors were employed for various security services, with the number fluctuating over time. In 2012, Afghanistan had over 28,000 contractors, and in 2009, Iraq had over 15,000. As of the fourth quarter of FY2018, DOD reported 4,172 private security contractors in Afghanistan, with 2,397 armed contractors. As of the fourth quarter of FY2018, there were 4,172 private security contractors in Afghanistan, including 2,397 armed contractors. In Iraq and Syria, DOD reported 418 security contractors, none of whom were armed. Approximately 44% of DOD's contractors in Afghanistan were U.S. citizens, 42% were third-country nationals, and 14% were local nationals. Observers estimated 14,000 to 15,000 U.S. Armed Forces personnel in Afghanistan as of May 2019, with potential plans for withdrawal. The U.S. may withdraw some troops from Iraq, with ongoing negotiations with the Taliban. DOD stopped reporting contractor numbers in Iraq in 2013 after combat missions ended. Reporting resumed in 2014 for Operation Inherent Resolve. In FY2018, DOD began reporting total contractor personnel. In the fourth quarter of FY2018, there were 6,318 DOD contractor personnel in Iraq and Syria, with 49% being U.S. citizens, 38% third-country nationals, and 13% local/host-country nationals. In December 2018, President Trump announced the defeat of the Islamic State and planned to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria, but in February 2019, the White House stated that several hundred troops would remain."
