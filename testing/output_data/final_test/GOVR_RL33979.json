    "content": "The \"universal service concept\" in telecommunications, originating from the 1934 Communications Act, has been a key aspect of federal communications policy. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 established the Universal Service Fund (USF) to support universal service goals. Since 1998, the USF has disbursed nearly $73.7 billion to all states, territories, and the District of Columbia. The telecommunications sector has evolved rapidly over the past decade, offering a wide range of new services from traditional and nontraditional providers. This transformation has led to increased expectations for communication services, with a shift from simple voice connectivity to a demand for multifaceted fixed and mobile services. Consumers now seek greater flexibility in accessing content through various technologies. The telecommunications sector is evolving rapidly, with a shift towards accessing content through various technologies. This trend requires networks to transition into converged next-generation broadband networks to meet growing demands. One challenge is ensuring affordable access for all citizens to advanced telecommunications infrastructure. The telecommunications sector is undergoing rapid changes, leading to a need for reevaluation of traditional policy goals like universal service mandates. Concerns about the USF's sustainability and the need for reform are growing among policymakers, including Congress. Key issues for debate include defining the concept, funding policies, recipient selection, and ensuring proper management and oversight. The FCC has been responsible for facilitating access to telecommunications since 1934. The FCC's mandate is to provide a nationwide wire and radio communications service at reasonable charges, known as the universal service concept. This includes ensuring telecommunications services are available to all Americans, especially in rural and high-cost areas, through cross subsidies among network providers. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 codified the commitment to ensure universal service in telecommunications provision, shifting costs among providers and subscribers to increase subscribers to the network. Cross subsidies among network providers helped fund universal service objectives, but with the breakup of the Bell System, this system was no longer sustainable. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 mandated universal service in the provision of telecommunications services, requiring carriers to support it and make charges explicit. This expanded to include schools, libraries, and rural healthcare providers accessing discounted rates. The act led to the establishment of the Universal Service Fund in 1997, administered by the Universal Service Administrative Company to meet these goals. The FCC, through the USF, provides universal service support through various programs such as high-cost support for eligible telecommunications carriers serving rural areas. This mechanism helps offset the higher costs of providing telephone service in areas with low subscriber density. The FCC's universal service policies target low-income subscribers through programs like Lifeline and Link Up, established in the mid-1980s. These programs assist economically needy individuals with initiation and monthly service costs. Discounts are available for one connection per household, and schools and libraries also benefit from universal service provisions. The FCC's universal service policies aim to provide advanced telecommunications services to elementary and secondary schools and libraries at discounted rates. The Schools and Libraries Division administers the E-rate program, offering discounts ranging from 20% to 90% based on poverty levels and location. The FCC's Rural Health Care program provides discounts for internal connections, Internet access, and telecommunications services in high-cost areas. A yearly funding cap of $2.25 billion was established, with priority given to telecommunications and dedicated services. Rural health care providers must have access to comparable telecommunications services as urban areas, including advanced services. The FCC's Rural Health Care Division administers a support program for public and non-profit health care providers in rural areas. The program, established in 1998 with a $400 million annual funding cap, aims to reduce rates for necessary telecommunications and information services. Additionally, a Rural Health Care Pilot Program was created in 2007 to help build broadband networks for health care providers. Non-profit health care providers build broadband networks for health care services funded by mandatory contributions from telecommunications carriers. The FCC calculates the contribution factor quarterly based on anticipated funding needs of the Universal Service Fund (USF). The factor may change depending on the needs of universal service programs drawing on the USF. The FCC's Wireline Competition Bureau releases a public notice stating the proposed factor. The FCC's Wireline Competition Bureau releases a public notice on the proposed contribution factor, which becomes final after 14 days if there is no FCC action. The contribution factor has seen fluctuations over the years, with a significant increase in the second and third quarters of 2007. Despite reaching a high of 15.5% in the first quarter of 2011, the factor began to moderate again. The contribution factor for the second quarter of 2011 was 14.9%, and for the third quarter, it was 14.4%, showing a slight downward trend. However, in the fourth quarter of 2011, there was a significant increase to 15.3%, the second highest rate on record. The overall growth in the factor over the decade remains a significant policy concern. Exceptions exist for telecommunications providers who are not required to contribute if their annual contributions are de minimis or if they provide only international services. The FCC allows certain providers to contribute to the Universal Service Fund based on a percentage of their interstate and international revenues. Wireless carriers and VoIP providers have set safe harbor percentages for their contributions. Providers can choose to recover USF contributions directly from customers by passing through universal service payments. The Universal Service Fund allows providers to collect fees from customers through a universal service charge on bills. In 2010, $8.0 billion was disbursed, with High Cost support accounting for 53.7%, Schools and Libraries support at 28.7%, Low Income support at 16.5%, and Rural Health Care support at 1.1%. Disbursements for Rural Health Care support were $86.0 million, or 1.1% of total disbursements. Commitments for the schools and libraries support program and the rural health care program differ from disbursements. Only companies providing services draw money directly from the Universal Service Fund. Table A-2 provides data on USF payments and contributions by state and program for 2009. In 2009, USF payments and contributions were distributed across states and programs. Service providers in every state received payments from various programs, with some states being net contributors while others were net receivers. Payments were received from programs like Low Income, Schools and Libraries, High Cost, and Rural Health Care. The allocation of benefits varied by program, with 25 states and the District of Columbia being net contributors to the USF program as a whole. In 2009, USF payments and contributions were distributed across states and programs. Rural states with low population density tend to benefit most from the High Cost program, receiving more payments than estimated contributions. Changes in telecommunications technology have negatively impacted the USF's health and viability. The current policy debate surrounding USF reform focuses on four major concerns: the program's scope, funding sources and methodology, eligibility criteria, and concerns over fraud and abuse. Another issue is the impact of the Antideficiency Act on the USF. A key debate is whether broadband access should be included in universal service. The term universal service in telecommunications refers to providing a range of services to the public at a reasonable price. The 1996 Telecommunications Act established a Joint Board to define these services, which include voice access, directory assistance, emergency services, and more. Some policymakers argue that the FCC's definition of universal service is too limited, failing to consider the importance of advanced services like broadband and Internet access. They reference provisions in the 1996 Telecommunications Act, stating that all regions of the nation, including low-income and rural areas, should have access to telecommunications and information services at a comparable level and rate to urban areas. The FCC is urged to expand its universal service definition to include advanced services like broadband and Internet access, as stated in the 1996 Telecommunications Act. Section 254(c) allows for the definition to evolve with advances in technology, with the Joint Board having the authority to recommend modifications. In 2002, the Joint Board recommended no changes to the list of services eligible for universal service support. The FCC, in a 2003 order, maintained the list of services eligible for universal service support. However, in 2007, the Joint Board recommended including broadband Internet services in the list, which was supported by the FCC's national broadband plan in 2010. The FCC has proposed restructuring the USF to support national broadband goals, but some policymakers advocate for a more modest approach due to concerns about costs and uncertainties. They suggest addressing current policy concerns before expanding the USF definition. The FCC has proposed restructuring the USF to support national broadband goals, but some policymakers advocate for a more modest approach due to concerns about costs and uncertainties. They suggest addressing current policy concerns before expanding the USF definition. Policymakers argue that if ubiquitous broadband deployment is a national policy goal, other means such as economic incentives, easing regulation, municipal ownership, or expanding existing programs should be considered instead of further stressing the USF program. There is a consensus that some reform to broaden the contribution base is needed, but the method of accomplishing this remains open to debate. The FCC has proposed expanding the contribution base for the USF, with options ranging from modest to complete restructuring. Actions have been taken to broaden the pool of contributors, including setting revenue percentages for wireless carriers and requiring interconnected VoIP providers to contribute. Some policy makers suggest expanding the list of USF contributors to include broadband providers, contingent on upgrading telecommunications infrastructure. Another proposal recommends assessing fees on intrastate and interstate/international revenues to broaden the revenue base for USF funds, pending congressional action to designate intrastate revenues for federal contributions. The FCC's attempt to collect support for the E-rate program based on combined interstate and intrastate revenues was challenged in court, leading to a recommendation for congressional clarification. The court ruled that the FCC exceeded its jurisdictional authority in assessing contributions for certain programs. Proponents argue that technological changes have blurred the distinction between interstate and intrastate services. Some express concern over the potential negative impact of including intrastate revenues in USF programs funded by telecommunications revenues. A proposal suggests shifting support to a new methodology based on working numbers or connections, with contributions assessed through a monthly flat fee per working telephone number. Supporters claim this would lead to a more stable assessment, spread contributions over a broader base, and be easier to administer, while opponents argue it would shift the burden to all subscribers as a regressive fixed charge. The USF reform is facing issues with the eligibility criteria and the burden of funding being shifted to all subscribers as a regressive fixed charge. The contribution factor has almost tripled over the past 12 years, reaching a high of 15.5% in the first quarter of 2011. This rise in funding level has led to a reevaluation of the Fund's eligibility criteria. The USF program's eligibility criteria and distribution methodology are under scrutiny due to concerns about long-term sustainability and cost burden on contributors. Revenue flows show stability in three programs but significant growth in the High Cost program, mainly due to support for competitive eligible telecommunications carriers. Payments to wireless carriers increased significantly from $1 million in 2000 to $126.7 million. The USF program has seen significant growth in payments to wireless carriers, increasing from $1 million in 2000 to $126.7 million in 2003, and estimated to total over $1.2 billion in 2010. Meanwhile, payments to incumbent eligible telecommunications carriers decreased from $3.2 billion in 2003 to $3.1 billion in 2010. The FCC's interim cap on High Cost payments to competitive carriers has helped mitigate this trend. Additionally, the Low Income program has experienced growth, with disbursements increasing from $822 million in 2008 to an estimated $1.3 billion in 2010. The recent growth in the Lifeline program can be attributed to the entrance of pre-paid wireless providers and an increase in eligible households due to the recession. Policy discussions focus on proposals to limit eligibility criteria and funding disbursed to stem the growth of the High Cost Program. Various proposals are being considered, such as limiting USF support to a single line per household and using reverse auctions to determine eligibility. Some policy makers propose limiting USF support to a single line per household to curb funding requirements and prevent abuse of funds. They argue that the universal service mandate is to ensure high cost areas receive service at a reasonable rate, not to support multiple carriers in areas that cannot sustain them. Some argue that limiting USF support to a single provider in high cost areas lowers the standard of service, hindering universal service principles. They believe that competition and choice should be available in all regions, including rural areas, to encourage investment in infrastructure. One proposal is to use reverse auctions for selecting eligible carriers. The use of reverse auctions for selecting eligible carriers in high-cost areas aims to decrease funding for High Cost support by awarding funds to providers with the lowest bids. This approach is believed to promote efficient technology use and alleviate pressure on USF funds, although the methodology and requirements can vary. Some suggest using a competitive carrier selection process for high-cost areas, while others propose an auction system to reward the lowest bidder with limited support. Concerns exist about implementing reverse auctions, including cost administration and potential negative impacts on consumers and providers. Critics fear that reverse auctions may hinder network investment, leading to stranded investment and inferior networks. The High Cost program fund distribution is based on the \"identical support rule,\" which some question for funding competitive carriers based on the incumbent carrier's higher infrastructure costs. Critics argue for a more refined distribution methodology reflective of a carrier's actual costs. Some propose capping funds for competitive eligible telecommunications carriers in the High Cost program to control its growth and stabilize the USF contribution factor. This is seen as necessary due to the increasing number of applications pending at the FCC. Some suggest capping funds for competitive eligible telecommunications carriers in the High Cost program to stabilize the USF contribution factor. Placing a cap on the High Cost program could have unintended consequences and undermine universal service goals, according to the federal-state Joint Board. The federal-state Joint Board recommended an interim cap on high-cost support for competitive eligible telecommunications carriers from the High Cost program. This temporary measure aims to curb program growth until comprehensive USF reform is implemented. The FCC adopted a notice of proposed rulemaking to seek comments on this recommendation. The FCC adopted an interim cap on payments to competitive eligible telecommunications carriers to the High Cost fund in May 2008. The cap limits total annual support to the level received in each state in March 2008. This decision will be in place until comprehensive high cost universal service reform is adopted. There is a proposal to use better mapping technology to target areas in need of support more effectively. Some argue that current designated areas for support are too large and cover areas that may not require USF subsidies.

There is a proposal to use better mapping technology to target areas in need of support more effectively. Some argue that current designated areas for support are too large and cover areas that may not require USF subsidies. Concerns have been raised about the potential for fraud, waste, or abuse of the program. Progress is being made with the development and maintenance of a national broadband inventory map, released in February 2011, and efforts to improve data collection. The E-rate program has been singled out for potential fraud, waste, and abuse due to its materiality. Concerns about financial oversight prompted congressional scrutiny, leading to the establishment of measures such as a whistleblower hotline by USAC to address these issues. The FCC adopted measures to safeguard the USF, including a whistleblower hotline and audits to prevent fraud. Debarment rules were extended to cover all programs, penalties for late payments were tightened, and record-keeping requirements were increased. Performance measures were also adopted, as recommended by the GAO. A GAO report in July 2008 highlighted the need for improved performance management and oversight of the High-Cost Program. The FCC needs to improve performance management and oversight of the High-Cost Program by establishing performance goals and measures. The GAO highlighted the lack of these measures, limiting informed decision-making. Despite initial efforts by the FCC, problems still exist, prompting a Notice of Inquiry seeking public input on strengthening management and oversight of the USF. The FCC has taken steps to address these issues but further improvements are needed. The FCC has acknowledged the need for constant scrutiny and assessment of its oversight efforts for the USF. A Notice of Inquiry has been initiated to develop additional rules and safeguards to protect the Fund, with the FCC's Office of the Inspector General focusing on oversight of the E-rate program. The OIG has expanded its audit efforts to ensure program integrity. The OIG expanded audit efforts to include all USF programs and contributors. A large-scale beneficiary audit program was initiated in 2006, with over 450 audits planned. The audit results in 2007 showed compliance with FCC rules, but erroneous payment rates exceeded 9% in most USF program segments. The OIG audit found erroneous payment rates in various USF programs, with significant reductions from early estimates. For example, the High Cost Program's improper payment rate dropped to 2.7% from 16.6%, and the Schools and Libraries Program's rate dropped to 8.6% from 12.8%. Despite improvements, the OIG still emphasizes the need for oversight. The OIG audit found errors in USF programs' payment rates, with reductions in improper payments. The FCC's Enforcement Bureau enforces the Communications Act, pursuing violators and taking enforcement actions. The DOJ is actively pursuing fraud cases, particularly related to the E-rate program. The DOJ has a task force investigating E-rate fraud, leading to fines, restitution, and imprisonment. The 112th Congress will review the USF programs to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse. Both critics and supporters are concerned about program integrity. The FCC's decision in 2004 to apply Antideficiency Act (ADA) compliance to the operation of the USF required funds to be on hand to cover obligations, leading to changes in fund distribution timing by USAC. The FCC's decision in 2004 led to changes in fund distribution timing by USAC, causing a temporary suspension of E-rate funding commitments. Congressional attention was drawn to concerns about disruptions in funding for USF programs and the need for increased USF revenues. Legislation was enacted to provide a one-year exemption from the ADA for the USF, which has been extended multiple times. The USF program has received multiple extensions from the ADA, with the most recent one expiring in December 2011. The issue of whether the USF program should comply with ADA accounting provisions is expected to continue. Congress may address this issue in various ways before the expiration of the current exemption. The USF program may face legislation to provide short-term relief by extending the temporary exemption or enacting a permanent exemption from ADA requirements. Former FCC Chairman Martin confirmed ADA applicability to USF but assured no delays in E-rate program commitments. Concerns remain about compliance and funding sufficiency. The FCC actions regarding ADA compliance may impact disbursements for E-Rate and other USF programs. The National Broadband Plan aims to ensure broadband access for all Americans, with the USF playing a key role in supporting broadband deployment over a 10-year period. The National Broadband Plan recommends reforms to the High Cost program to support broadband deployment and transition from voice communications. The FCC is urged to improve USF performance through stronger oversight and data collection. The National Broadband Plan recommends phasing out the High-Cost program over the next 10 years and replacing it with the Connect America Fund and Mobility Fund to support high-capacity broadband networks. The Connect America Fund aims to provide affordable broadband with specific speed requirements, and funding should only be provided in areas where there is no private sector business case for broadband deployment. The Mobility Fund (MF) is designed to provide targeted funding to ensure all states reach the national average for 3G wireless coverage for voice and data. It will offer one-time support for 3G network deployment, improving the business case for 4G network development. The FCC will identify efficient funding mechanisms, with accountability requirements and enforceable timelines for recipients. The National Broadband Plan (NBP) recommends improving the business case for 4G networks in harder-to-serve areas and expanding Low-Income programs like Lifeline and Link Up to increase broadband adoption for low-income households. The NBP also suggests allowing Lifeline customers to apply discounts to bundled offerings, making broadband service more affordable. The National Broadband Plan (NBP) recommends integrating expanded Lifeline and Link Up programs with e-government efforts, facilitating pilot programs to determine effective program design elements, and initiating rulemakings to streamline the applications process for the E-rate program. The National Broadband Plan (NBP) recommends raising funding caps for inflation, setting minimum broadband connectivity goals for schools and libraries, removing barriers to off-hours community use of E-rate resources, expanding support for internal connections, improving data collection on E-rate fund usage, providing flexibility in purchasing broadband solutions, and making program expenses more cost-efficient. Additionally, the NBP calls for reforming the Rural Health Care Program by restructuring and expanding program components, replacing the Internet Access Fund with a Health Care Broadband Access Fund, increasing subsidy support, and simplifying the application process. The National Broadband Plan recommends increasing funding support for the Rural Health Care Program beyond the current 25%, simplifying the application process, and expanding eligibility to include both rural and urban health care providers based on need. It also suggests establishing a Health Care Broadband Infrastructure Fund to subsidize network deployment where existing infrastructure is insufficient. Other recommendations include expanding the definition of eligible health care providers to include long-term care facilities and off-site administrative offices, and considering support for certain for-profit entities. To prevent fraud, waste, and abuse, the NBP recommends measures to protect program integrity. The National Broadband Plan recommends that the FCC require participating institutions to meet performance measures for efficient use of health IT and to improve the country's health delivery system. It also suggests policies to facilitate demand aggregation for community use and not develop single-purpose networks. Additionally, it recommends amending the Communications Act to allow Tribal lands to share broadband network capacity funded through the E-rate. The National Broadband Plan recommends sharing broadband network capacity on Tribal lands funded through the E-rate and rural health care programs with other community institutions designated by Tribal governments. It suggests amending the Communications Act to help Tribal libraries access E-rate funding and restructuring the USF while maintaining funding levels. Additionally, it proposes shifting $15.5 billion over the next decade from the USF High Cost program to support broadband transition, with the option for Congress to allocate additional funds to accelerate the process. The National Broadband Plan recommends broadening the USF contribution base and adopting revised methodology rules to ensure sustainability. It acknowledges the relationship between broadband goals and the USF contribution factor, aiming to minimize the burden on consumers. The plan includes over 208 recommendations involving various entities, with around 60 calling for FCC action. The FCC has initiated proceedings to implement these recommendations and gather input from stakeholders. The FCC is taking steps to implement the recommendations of the National Broadband Plan, including establishing a Universal Service Working Group and adopting Notices of Proposed Rulemaking to create a Mobility Fund and Connect America Fund. These actions aim to promote the development of broadband services and improve access to advanced wireless services. The FCC is scheduled to vote on these rulemakings on October 27, 2011. The FCC is proposing a Mobility Fund (MF) to improve 3G wireless services in unserved areas through a reverse auction mechanism. The NPRM seeks comments on various proposals, including the allocation of $100 million to $300 million for extending mobile voice and Internet coverage, performance requirements, and oversight functions to prevent fraud and abuse. The FCC proposed a new Connect America Fund to shift money from the current High Cost program, focusing on broadband deployment over the next 10 years. Steps are proposed to transition to a more efficient broadband-focused fund, broadening the USF concept to support networks efficiently. The FCC proposed a new Connect America Fund to shift money from the current High Cost program, focusing on broadband deployment over the next 10 years. The proposal suggests adding broadband and mobility to the definition of supported services, using a reverse auction to provide broadband to unserved areas with a significant amount of funding. Recipients could be fixed or mobile wireless providers, and the proposal seeks comments on various proposals for completing this transition. The FCC proposed a new Connect America Fund to shift money from the current High Cost program, focusing on broadband deployment over the next 10 years. The proposal includes various considerations such as capping the per-line subsidy, minimum broadband speed requirements, public interest obligations, and the role of states in universal service. The comment and reply periods are closed, and the FCC adopted a notice of proposed rulemaking on March 3, 2011. The FCC adopted a notice of proposed rulemaking on March 3, 2011, seeking comment on reforms to modernize the Lifeline and Link Up components of the Low Income program. Proposed changes aim to better position the program to provide broadband services, improve accountability measures, prevent fraud, and enhance enrollment efforts. Key reforms include creating a National Accountability Database for eligibility verification and eliminating funding for unused services after 60 days. The FCC proposed reforms to the Lifeline and Link Up programs to improve accountability, prevent fraud, and enhance enrollment efforts. Changes include evaluating program growth, allowing Lifeline discounts on bundled services, addressing Tribal land residents' needs, and establishing pilot programs. Additionally, the FCC adopted rules to prevent support payments for multiple services to the same individual. The FCC clarified that no consumer can receive more than one Lifeline subsidy at a time, to prevent duplication. USAC will notify consumers with multiple benefits to choose one subsidized service within 30 days. Companies not chosen must de-enroll the consumer within five days. This measure aims to save money for a pilot program. The FCC adopted new rules to upgrade and modernize the E-rate program, allowing for leasing broadband from a wider range of options, community use of E-rate funded services, and indexing the funding cap to account for inflation. Special circumstances schools will receive support for eligible services. The FCC adopted new rules to upgrade and modernize the E-rate program, allowing for leasing broadband from a wider range of options, community use of E-rate funded services, and indexing the funding cap to account for inflation. Special circumstances schools will receive support for eligible services. Additionally, reforms were initiated to the Rural Health Care Program to expand broadband connectivity for health care providers, including a new health infrastructure program and changes to the existing program. The FCC is considering a program to support new broadband projects for healthcare providers, subsidize monthly costs, and expand eligibility criteria. Comments on the proposal have been filed, and Universal Service Fund reform remains a congressional topic of interest. Universal Service Fund reform is a key topic of congressional interest, with both the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee focusing on USF reform. The Senate Commerce Committee held a hearing on October 12, 2011, specifically addressing the High Cost Fund. Three bills related to USF have been introduced, including H.R. 2163, the \"Broadband Affordability Act of 2011,\" which expands the USF's low-income Lifeline program. The \"Broadband Affordability Act of 2011\" expands the USF's Lifeline program to include broadband services at reduced rates. Eligibility requirements are the same as the current Lifeline telephone program. The FCC will establish regulations to prevent multiple subsidies per household, determine support amounts, state matching funds, and define broadband service. Providers need FCC authorization to participate, with no technology preference or eligibility carrier requirement. H.R. 3118 freezes USF funding at 2011 levels. The \"Broadband Affordability Act of 2011\" expands the USF's Lifeline program to include broadband services at reduced rates, with eligibility requirements remaining the same as the current Lifeline telephone program. The bill also freezes USF funding at 2011 levels and implements reforms to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse in the Low Income Program. Additionally, S. 297 amends Section 254 of the Communications Act of 1934 to provide a permanent exemption for the USF from the Antideficiency Act. Hearings on USF reform and the FCC's national broadband plan have been held by the House Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, and the Internet and the Senate Commerce Committee. Former House Communications Subcommittee Chairman Boucher has been involved in these discussions. Former House Communications Subcommittee Chairman Boucher and Representative Terry introduced bill H.R. 5828, the \"Universal Service Reform Act of 2010,\" which aimed to reform the USF by expanding support to include broadband services, widening the contribution base, developing new cost models, limiting fund eligibility, and establishing performance goals. Despite a hearing held by the House Communications Subcommittee, no further action was taken on the bill. House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Waxman and other members also expressed interest in examining USF. Legislation was introduced to expand the role of the Universal Service Fund (USF) and address the affordability of broadband for low-income households. The \"Broadband Affordability Act of 2009\" aimed to include broadband services in the USF's Lifeline program at reduced rates, with the FCC tasked to determine support amounts and state matching funds requirements. Broadband service providers were required to comply with FCC regulations. The \"E-Rate 2.0 Act of 2010\" introduced by Representative Markey expanded the E-rate program to address access to broadband. It created pilot programs for low-income students, community colleges, and head start programs to access broadband services. The bill also aimed to streamline the application process and adjust the annual program cap. The \"Broadband Opportunity and Affordability Act\" introduced by Senator Rockefeller directed the FCC to expand the Lifeline program to include broadband services. The FCC was tasked with determining support amounts, state matching funds, and program neutrality. After 18 months, a report was to be submitted to Congress. The Act also required an inquiry into expanding the Link Up program for broadband service initiation cost reduction. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 extended the USF ADA exemption until December 31, 2011. Efforts for a permanent ADA exemption for the USF were introduced but did not progress further. The 110th Congress introduced legislative measures for USF reform and expansion into broadband, but none were enacted. Hearings were held on the challenges facing USF and the role of broadband in its future. FCC oversight hearings were also conducted. The 110th Congress held hearings on USF challenges and the role of broadband in its future. FCC oversight hearings were conducted, including discussions on broadband deployment and a recommendation for an emergency cap on high-cost support for eligible telecommunications carriers. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee requested information from industry recipients regarding the High Cost Fund portion of the program. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee focused on the High Cost Fund portion of the USF program, requesting information from top recipients of federal funds. Chairman Waxman emphasized the importance of oversight for accountability and potential reform proposals. A provision to extend the USF exemption from the Antideficiency Act was passed as part of the FY2007 continuing resolution. The USF exemption from the Antideficiency Act (ADA) was initially passed in FY2007 and extended until December 31, 2008. Efforts for a permanent ADA exemption were introduced but not enacted. Additional provisions in P.L. 110-161 include restrictions on FCC funds and the transfer of funds for monitoring and oversight. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 extends the USF exemption for the Antideficiency Act until December 31, 2008. It also prohibits the FCC from limiting USF support to a primary line and allows for the transfer of funds for monitoring and oversight. Signed into law on December 26, 2007. The Lifeline Assistance Program and the Link Up Program under the Communications Act of 1934 are being expanded. Bills introduced include H.R. 278 (Cubin) to amend universal service provisions, H.R. 2054 (Boucher) for Universal Service Reform Act of 2007, and H.R. 2829 (Serrano). H.R. 2829 (Serrano) The Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Bill, 2008, authorizes the FCC to transfer funds for monitoring and audits of the USF to prevent fraud. The Senate version extends the USF exemption from the Antideficiency Act and prohibits limiting funding to a single line. H.R. 5806 (Rush) The School Emergency Notification Deployment Act allows E-rate funds for schools. The curr_chunk discusses bills introduced in 2008 related to universal support for schools under the Communications Act of 1934, accessibility for individuals with disabilities to new communication technologies, reforming universal service support collection and distribution, and requiring universal roaming for eligible carriers. The Universal Roaming Act of 2008 requires eligible carriers to offer automatic roaming services to compatible carriers. Other bills introduced in 2007 aim to update and reinvigorate universal service under the Communications Act of 1934. The Universal Service for the 21st Century Act and the Telehealth for America Act of 2008 are bills introduced to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to improve universal service support programs and rural health care support. Introduced on September 16, 2008, under section 254(h) of the Communications Act of 1934. Referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation."
