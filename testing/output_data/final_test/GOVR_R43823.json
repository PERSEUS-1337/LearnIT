The United States uses an indirect election system for choosing its chief executive, with electors appointed by states. Alexander Hamilton praised the electoral college system in The Federalist. The electoral college system has faced criticism for not allowing direct democratic election and giving an advantage to less-populous states. Despite Alexander Hamilton's praise, there have been numerous proposals to reform or eliminate the system since 1800. The electoral college system has faced criticism for not allowing direct democratic election and giving an advantage to less-populous states. Between 1949 and 1979, Congress considered amendments to reform the electoral college, but no proposal has met the requirements of the Constitution's Article V. Proponents of the National Popular Vote initiative aim to achieve direct popular election without needing constitutional amendments. The electoral college system, established by the U.S. Constitution and revised by the Twelfth Amendment, elects the President and Vice President. Each state is allocated electors based on its Senate and House of Representatives delegations. The electoral college has no ongoing existence beyond this purpose. The electoral college system in the U.S. elects the President and Vice President based on the total number of Senate and House of Representatives delegations in each state, including the District of Columbia. The total number of electors is currently 538, with candidates nominated by political parties for the office of elector in each state. Candidates for the office of elector in the U.S. are nominated by state party committees or conventions. To be elected, presidential nominees must secure at least 270 out of 538 electoral votes. Electors are chosen by political parties and are expected to vote for their pledged candidates, although they are considered free agents under the Constitution and can vote for any person they choose. The goal of presidential campaigns is to win by carrying states that collectively cast a majority of electoral votes. Political parties focus on battleground states or states with large delegations of electoral votes. In most states, the winning party's entire ticket of electors is elected through the \"winner-take-all\" system. On Presidential Election Day, voters cast one vote for the state political party \"ticket\" of electors supporting presidential and vice presidential candidates. Electors meet in their respective states to cast separate votes for President and Vice President. Results are sent to Congress and federal authorities, who count the electoral votes and declare the winning candidates on January 6 following the election. The National Popular Vote initiative emerged in response to frustration with failed attempts to secure congressional approval for a direct popular election amendment. The contentious 2000 presidential election also played a significant role in the development of the NPV proposal due to the strict requirements set by the Constitution for amendments. Between 1948 and 1979, Congress debated electoral college reform extensively with numerous proposals introduced in both chambers. The proposals aimed to either eliminate the electoral college system for direct popular election or reform its controversial provisions. Despite some proposals being approved by the Senate and House separately, no consensus was reached in the same Congress. After extensive debates between 1948 and 1979, Congress failed to reach a consensus on electoral college reform. Despite occasional proposals, the issue faded from public attention and legislative agenda. Even after controversial elections in 2000 and 2016, Congress showed little interest in considering reform. Few proposals for direct popular election were introduced over the years. In the 113th Congress, no proposal for direct popular election was introduced. However, in the 114th Congress, four constitutional amendments were proposed to eliminate the electoral college. In the 116th Congress, three amendments were introduced for direct popular election, but no action has been taken. Public support for presidential election reform through direct popular election has been evident since 1967. Public support for direct popular election of the president has fluctuated over the years. In 2013, 63% of respondents favored an amendment for direct election, while 29% preferred to retain the electoral college. After the 2016 election, support for direct election decreased to 49% in favor and 47% opposed. The shift in attitudes may have been influenced by the election results, where the Republican nominee won with fewer popular votes but a majority of electoral votes. Support for the electoral college system increased among Republicans, while Democrats showed even stronger support for direct popular election. Public support for direct popular election of the president has fluctuated over the years. After the 2016 election, support for direct election decreased to 49% in favor and 47% opposed. A recent survey showed that respondents preferred direct election by 50% to 34% for retaining the electoral college, with 43% in favor of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. The disputed 2000 presidential election led to new thinking on electoral college reform, with the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact favored by 43% and opposed by 33%. The election saw George W. Bush and Richard Cheney narrowly winning over Al Gore Jr. and Joseph Lieberman, with a Supreme Court decision giving Bush a narrow plurality in Florida and an electoral college majority. The 2000 presidential election resulted in controversy as the winning candidates, Bush and Cheney, received fewer popular votes than their opponents, Gore and Lieberman. This led to calls for electoral reform, but Congress focused on legislative remedies instead of a constitutional amendment. The Help America Vote Act of 2002 was passed to address voting system irregularities revealed by the election. The 2000 election led to election administration reforms and voting system technology enhancements funded by federal grants. In 2016, the presidential election saw winners with fewer popular votes but a majority of electoral votes. Despite proposals for a direct popular election, the controversy was less than in 2000. The shift in Florida's electoral votes in 2000 could have changed the result, unlike in 2016. In 2000, a shift in Florida's electoral votes could have changed the election result, unlike in 2016. The controversy prompted study and investigation into electoral reform, leading to the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. Project FairVote, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization, has been a key supporter of the National Popular Vote (NPV) initiative for over a decade. The NPV seeks to establish direct popular election of the President and Vice President through an interstate compact, rather than by constitutional amendment. The National Popular Vote initiative aims to establish direct popular election of the President and Vice President through an interstate compact. This would require all 50 states and the District of Columbia to pass legislation appointing electors committed to the nationwide popular vote winner. The National Popular Vote initiative proposes a system where participating state legislatures would choose electors pledged to the nationwide popular vote winner, if states totaling at least 270 electoral votes approve the plan. States could withdraw from the compact, and in case of a tied popular vote, states could choose electors based on the winner in each state. Additionally, the winning presidential candidate could appoint electors to fill any vacancies in the electoral college. The National Popular Vote initiative allows states to choose electors based on the nationwide popular vote winner if states totaling at least 270 electoral votes approve the plan. States can withdraw from the compact within six months of a presidential term ending. NPV Inc., a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, aims to educate the public on implementing a nationwide popular election for the President of the United States. Dr. Koza is the chairman, and Mr. Fadem is the president of NPV Inc. National Popular Vote Inc., led by Dr. Koza and Mr. Fadem, published a handbook detailing the NPV initiative. The organization has an office in Mountain View, CA, and supporters have introduced measures in state legislatures to adopt the interstate compact. The NPV Compact, introduced by National Popular Vote Inc., has gained traction in state legislatures across the US and the District of Columbia. NPV claims support from over 3,000 state legislators and endorsements from major newspapers. They also advocate for the use of the citizen initiative process. The National Popular Vote Compact, supported by National Popular Vote Inc., has gained traction in state legislatures and the District of Columbia. NPV advocates for the use of the citizen initiative process to enact state adherence to the compact. Currently, 14 states and the District of Columbia have adopted the compact, totaling 189 electoral votes. The citizen initiative approach to the compact has not been utilized yet. The National Popular Vote Compact has been adopted by 14 states and the District of Columbia, totaling 189 electoral votes. States that have adopted NPV are listed in chronological order, with California's approval in 2011 adding 55 electoral votes. The National Popular Vote Compact has been adopted by 14 states and the District of Columbia, accounting for 270 electoral votes. Highlights include California's approval in 2011 adding 55 electoral votes, and New York's accession in 2014. Additional states like Connecticut, Colorado, Delaware, and New Mexico joined, adding 24 electoral votes. Legislation to join the NPV has been introduced in 14 states with a combined total of 150 electoral votes. Nevada and Oregon have approved the compact, potentially raising the total to 202 electoral votes. Conversely, some states are considering rescinding approval of the NPV Interstate Compact. NPV Interstate Compact has been introduced in several Democratic-leaning states, but none have been approved yet. Some critics point out that all the states that have joined the compact so far are predominantly Democratic. The compact lacks support from purple and red states, limiting its reach. The NPV Interstate Compact has been introduced in Democratic-leaning states, with some states like Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, and New Mexico joining. These states were won by Democratic candidates in the 2016 election. However, Republican-leaning states like Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, North Carolina, Ohio, and South Carolina have not joined the compact. Between 2008 and 2011, efforts were made to promote retention of the electoral college system, with conservative groups like the Heritage Foundation and the State Government Leadership Foundation opposing the National Popular Vote proposal. Arguments for and against the NPV compact mirror those for and against direct popular election of the President, focusing on the simplicity and democratic appeal of direct election versus the complexity cited by electoral college supporters. Critics of the electoral college system argue that it is undemocratic and outdated, advocating for direct popular election of the President and Vice President. They believe that the electoral college's technical failings make it incompatible with modern democratic values and practices. The electoral college system can lead to the election of a President and Vice President who received fewer popular votes than their opponent due to the winner-take-all system in states. This has happened in elections such as 1876, 1888, 2000, and 2016. The National Popular Vote (NPV) interstate compact advocates for a simple, national, and democratic process where the President and Vice President are chosen directly by the voters. Supporters argue that this system would ensure the candidate with the most popular votes in all 50 states wins the Presidency, eliminating any advantage or disadvantage for states. The National Popular Vote (NPV) interstate compact aims to ensure the candidate with the most popular votes in all 50 states wins the Presidency, eliminating electoral college criticisms like faithless electors and disfranchisement of voters. It would also likely eliminate the need for contingent election under the Twelfth Amendment. The National Popular Vote (NPV) interstate compact advocates for every vote to be equal in presidential elections, ensuring candidates campaign nationwide instead of focusing on battleground states. This would address the disenfranchisement of voters in noncompetitive states. In 2004, candidates concentrated most of their money and campaign visits in a few battleground states, with over 99% of their money in just 16 states. NPV notes that California and Texas are often overlooked in campaigns due to their consistent voting patterns, with California being reliably \"blue\" and Texas consistently voting Republican since 1980. According to NPV, Democratic nominees did not participate in campaign events in California or Texas, while Republican nominees only appeared in one event in each state. In comparison, battleground states like Florida, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania received 71, 55, and 54 candidate appearances, respectively. NPV's analysis shows that in the 2016 general election campaign, major party candidates visited only 12 states out of 38 states and the District of Columbia were bypassed. NPV advocates argue that focusing campaign resources on battleground states depresses turnout in other states. The U.S. Elections Project report, America Goes to the Polls, 2016, shows that in the 2016 presidential election, 65% of eligible voters in 14 battleground states participated, compared to a nationwide turnout of 60%. Campaign visits and ad spending were heavily focused on battleground states, with 95% of visits and 99% of spending occurring there. The NPV manifesto argues that the electoral college limits elections to a few states, making voters elsewhere feel their votes don't matter. The National Popular Vote (NPV) argues that the disparity in voter turnout between battleground and non-battleground states could weaken governance on state and local levels. Critics of NPV claim it is unconstitutional and would not solve the alleged problems of the electoral college system. The National Popular Vote (NPV) is said to potentially create new issues while attempting to address problems with the electoral college system. Critics argue that the NPV compact may violate the principle of majoritarian democracy by not requiring a candidate to win a majority of the popular vote to become president. Congressional approval would be necessary for the NPV compact as it is considered an interstate compact under the Constitution. The National Popular Vote (NPV) compact, by comparison, requires a majority in the electoral college. Critics argue that the NPV may lead to plurality presidencies and create difficulties in multicandidate elections. The National Popular Vote (NPV) compact aims to award electoral votes based on the national popular vote, potentially leading to a President not chosen by the majority of voters. Critics argue that the existing electoral college system is essential for balancing majority and minority rights in federal elections. The NPV initiative aims to change the electoral college system by awarding electoral votes based on the national popular vote. Critics argue that this would go against the Founders' intentions and create a flawed \"majoritarian\" presidency. Critics of the NPV compact argue that it bypasses the Constitution and lacks the broad national support required for successful constitutional amendments. Proponents defend the NPV as a necessary reform to the system, citing Article V's high hurdle as a barrier. The NPV initiative was criticized for not conforming to constitutional means of changing decisions, potentially setting a dangerous precedent. Opponents argue that it would eliminate the electoral college system's multiplier effect, which gives greater legitimacy to the victors. The NPV initiative, criticized for not conforming to constitutional means of changing decisions, could lead to increased contested election results and legal challenges, according to opponents. They argue that NPV would incentivize broader disputes and widespread recounts at every level of election administration. The Heritage Foundation study concluded that under NPV, any suspicions necessitating a recount could lead to a national recount, which opponents find abhorrent. Critics of the NPV initiative argue that the lack of a \"statute of limitations\" could lead to prolonged uncertainty after close presidential elections, unlike proposed constitutional amendments. They question why there is no time limit to \"sunset\" the NPV compact, as it was launched in 2006 and would have expired by 2013 if it were a constitutional amendment. Critics of the NPV initiative question the lack of a time limit for the compact, arguing that campaign resources spread in non-battleground states do not justify a significant change in the presidential election process. They argue against considering campaign spending as a local economic stimulus package, as it would not make a substantial difference in most states' economic conditions. In the modern era, presidential campaigns rely heavily on television, social media, and the internet, rather than traditional campaign methods like rallies and parades. Critics argue that the NPV initiative lacks a time limit and campaign resources in non-battleground states do not significantly impact the presidential election process or local economic development. Observers have raised questions about the NPV initiative being an interstate compact and its potential conflict with the Voting Rights Act. Supporters describe it as a bill, state-level statute, or interstate compact, raising concerns about compliance with the Compact Clause of the Constitution. The Supreme Court has indicated that interstate compacts involve reciprocal commitments between states, dating back to the Articles of Confederation. The Constitution prohibits states from entering into treaties, alliances, and federations, but allows interstate compacts with Congress' consent. The Compact Clause states that no state can enter into agreements with another state without Congress' approval. The Compact Clause in the Constitution allows states to enter into interstate compacts with Congress' consent, reflecting the Framers' belief in cooperative state action while ensuring Congress maintains supervisory power. Congressional consent is required for interstate compacts, with no limits on their scope. Interstate compacts have evolved from settling boundary disputes to addressing complex regional issues, with some being advisory and others regulatory. They cover a wide range of concerns such as mental health, law enforcement, education, and environmental conservation. Around 200 interstate compacts are currently in effect. Interstate compacts address various regional issues like mental health, law enforcement, education, and environmental conservation. The central legal issue regarding the Compact Clause is whether congressional consent is needed for interstate compacts. The Supreme Court has rejected a broad interpretation of the Compact Clause, stating that not all agreements among states require congressional approval. The Compact Clause prohibits states from entering into compacts without congressional consent only when the compact increases political power in the states, encroaching on the supremacy of the United States. The Supreme Court has upheld this interpretation, stating that agreements not falling within this scope do not require congressional approval. The NPV initiative may not require congressional consent under the Compact Clause as it may not be considered an interstate compact. Supporters argue that NPV does not create a new interstate governmental entity, but rather allows states to collectively exercise power. The creation of a new interstate governmental entity may not be necessary to deem an agreement as an interstate compact subject to the Compact Clause. The Supreme Court has a broad definition of interstate compacts, which includes agreements where states agree to perform reciprocal acts. This definition may encompass the NPV compact. The NPV initiative is considered an interstate compact as it requires signatory states to appoint their electors to the national popular vote winner. States cannot withdraw within six months of a President's term, and modifications require reciprocation. The question is whether NPV implicates the Compact Clause by increasing state political power. The NPV initiative, an interstate compact, raises the question of whether it enhances state power at the expense of federal power. The initiative ensures that states' desired outcome for the presidential election is met, but it is unclear how this would diminish federal power as the Constitution does not give the federal government a role in determining electoral college members. One scholar suggests that the NPV initiative could shift power vertically by preventing the House of Representatives from resolving a presidential election without a clear majority. The Supreme Court has not addressed whether this would require congressional consent under the Compact Clause, which primarily focuses on federalism concerns. The Court has also acknowledged a potential secondary purpose of the Compact Clause: to maintain a balance of power between states. The Compact Clause may preserve the balance of powers among states and federal government. Debate surrounds whether the NPV compact threatens nonconsenting states' powers. Supporters argue that states retain their right to select electors, while critics suggest the NPV enhances the political power of populous states. The NPV aims to enhance the political power of populous states in presidential elections, potentially diminishing the influence of non-compacting states. Congressional approval may be necessary for this change in national elections, sparking debate within academia. If implemented, the NPV could lead to significant litigation over its impact on nonconsenting states. Congressional consent to an interstate compact typically involves a joint resolution or act specifying approval, with conditions added as necessary. Approval from both houses and the President's signature are required for it to become law. Implied consent by Congress or delegation of approval to a federal official is also possible. The NPV initiative may face challenges in gaining approval from both houses of Congress and the President, in addition to legal issues related to the Compact Clause. There are broader constitutional concerns about whether states can bypass the electoral college through the NPV, which goes against the indirect election process established in Article II of the Constitution. The Constitution established a nonmajoritarian presidential election process with the electoral college representing state interests. The central issue with the National Popular Vote (NPV) is whether states can change the election system to be more majoritarian. Supporters argue that the Constitution allows states to do so. The Constitution allows states to appoint electors for the electoral college based on their own discretion, with no specific limits imposed on the manner of selection. Supreme Court case law supports states having wide discretion in choosing electors. In 1892, the Supreme Court upheld a Michigan law allowing the election of presidential electors by individual congressional districts, citing historical evidence and Article II of the Constitution. This decision affirmed state legislatures' broad power in appointing electors. The Supreme Court upheld a Michigan law allowing the election of presidential electors by individual congressional districts, affirming state legislatures' broad power in appointing electors. Supporters of the National Popular Vote (NPV) argue that states have the power to select electors in line with the national popular vote results, citing the Supreme Court's 2015 ruling in Arizona Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission. The electoral college was created by the Framers to ensure that states with the least population retained power in the selection of the President, providing a check against domination by the most populous states. Allowing the most populous states to collude to ensure that the national popular vote dictates the results of a state's slate of electors could be irreconcilable with the Framers' intentions. The NPV compact may be constitutionally suspect as it goes against the Framers' intentions for the electoral college. Unlike the case of McPherson, where Michigan tried to appoint electors based on a district's vote, NPV states may not reflect the state's views but rather national sentiment. There is no historical evidence of states selecting electors based on the national popular vote at the time of the Constitution's ratification. The Supreme Court has interpreted that states cannot fundamentally change the constitutional structure in selecting electors. The question remains whether states' authority under Article II allows for the President to be chosen based on the national popular vote. Critics argue the NPV compact may violate the Voting Rights Act. The NPV compact may violate Sections 2 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) by diluting the voting power of minority populations in states. The U.S. Supreme Court invalidated Section 4(b) of the VRA in 2013, rendering Section 5 currently inoperable. The NPV compact may violate Sections 2 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act by potentially diluting the voting power of minority populations in states. Gringer argued that the compact would require preclearance under Section 5, but National Popular Vote Inc. stated that the bill aims to make every person's vote for President equal nationwide, aligning with the Voting Rights Act's goal. The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division did not challenge California's implementation of the compact in 2012. The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division did not challenge California's accession to the NPV compact on VRA grounds. Federal court decisions have upheld Congress's power to protect voting rights and the appointment of electors in accordance with the Fourteenth Amendment. In Oregon v. Mitchell, the Court affirmed Congress's authority to lower the voting age for presidential elections. The Supreme Court upheld Congress's power to reduce the voting age and set residency requirements for presidential elections. Critics have long sought direct election of the President and Vice President, with the NPV initiative offering a new approach through an interstate compact. Since its inception in 2006, the National Popular Vote (NPV) initiative has gained support from 14 states and the District of Columbia, totaling 189 electoral votes. Progress has been sporadic, with recent activity in 2019 showing the most sign-ups in a single year since 2008. However, the lack of support in Republican-controlled state legislatures raises questions about future accessions to the compact. The NPV initiative has gained support from 14 states and the District of Columbia, totaling 189 electoral votes. Greater public knowledge of NPV might spur popular support for the compact, especially in populous states like Florida, Georgia, and Ohio. Proponents could be energized by progress, while opponents may coalesce. Opponents of the NPV initiative may coalesce around issues identified earlier, potentially bringing the initiative to Congress' attention."
