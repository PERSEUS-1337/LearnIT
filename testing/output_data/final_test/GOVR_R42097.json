    "content": "The clause on presidential eligibility and citizenship was included in the Constitution at the Convention of 1787 without debate. The Committee of Detail was tasked with considering qualifications for Congress and the Presidency. Initially, qualifications for Senators and Representatives were included, but not for the President. Later, the Committee recommended adding qualifications for the President. The Committee of Detail recommended adding qualifications for the President, including being 35 years old, a US citizen, and a resident for 21 years. The report was postponed for members to review. The provisions for the President's qualifications were not agreed upon by the whole Convention. On September 4, 1787, the Committee partially reported to the Convention. On September 4, 1787, the Committee of Eleven reported additions and alterations to the Convention, including the requirement for a presidential candidate to be a \"natural born\" citizen, at least 35 years old, and a resident in the U.S. for 14 years. The language on presidential eligibility was agreed upon without debate on September 7, 1787, and underwent stylistic changes by the Committee of Style before being sent to the states. The development of the \"natural born\" citizen clause during the Federal Convention of 1787 did not involve specific discussions on its meaning. However, debates on citizenship qualifications for federal officers, including Members of Congress, influenced the eventual citizenship eligibility requirement for the President. George Mason raised concerns about the citizenship of congressional officeholders and the required length of such citizenship. George Mason argued for strict citizenship requirements for federal officeholders to prevent foreign influence, leading to the adoption of seven years for Representatives and nine years for Senators. Delegates at the Convention shared concerns about admitting foreigners into government, leading to the decision to prioritize native-born citizens for eligibility. After debates on citizenship requirements for federal officeholders, the issue of \"natural born\" citizenship for the President was raised by John Jay in a letter to George Washington during the Convention. This led to a potential restriction of eligibility to Natives, with concerns about foreign influence in government. John Jay's letter to George Washington raised the issue of restricting the presidency to natural born citizens to prevent foreign influence. The timing of Jay's letter coincided with the first use of the term \"natural born\" in the Constitution draft, suggesting a potential influence on the qualification. The term \"natural born\" in the Constitution draft may have been influenced by John Jay's letter to George Washington, expressing concern over foreigners serving as President. Justice Joseph Story later emphasized the importance of the \"natural born\" citizen qualification to prevent ambitious foreigners from seeking the office. The Constitution draft aimed to prevent ambitious foreigners from seeking the office of President and to avoid corrupt interferences from foreign governments in executive elections, based on concerns discussed during the Convention of 1787. Persistent rumors circulated in August about the possibility of establishing a monarchy in the United States, with speculation about inviting foreign royalty like the Bishop of Osnaburgh or Prince Henry of Prussia to become king. Some also considered the presidency as akin to a monarchy due to its unitary executive nature. During the summer, rumors circulated about the possibility of establishing a monarchy in the United States, with speculation about inviting foreign royalty like Prince Henry of Prussia to become king. The concerns over foreign influence and the issue of an American monarchy were real concerns for both the populace and the framers, shaping the development of the role of an American chief executive. The concerns over foreign influence and the possibility of a foreign-born head of state in the United States led the framers to incorporate Article II's eligibility rule, influenced by England's 1701 Act and the aversion to hereditary monarchies. The 1701 Act in England allowed for foreign-born future monarchs, but Article II of the US Constitution rejected this idea to prevent foreign influence in the presidency. The citizenship clause aimed to ensure loyalty and allegiance from the chief executive of the United States. The citizenship clause in the US Constitution aims to ensure loyalty and allegiance from the chief executive of the United States by preventing wealthy foreign citizens, particularly royalty, from becoming naturalized citizens and potentially creating an American monarchy. The term \"natural born\" citizen includes those who are citizens \"at birth\" either by being born on US soil or by descent from US citizens abroad. The concept of allegiance to the United States is passed down and taught by parents, regardless of nationality. Those born in the country have natural ties to the nation under British common law and US laws. The term \"natural born\" citizenship is influenced by English common law and the framers of the US Constitution. The interpretation of the U.S. Constitution is influenced by English common law, as many terms in the Constitution were not specifically defined and must be referred to the common law for clarification. The Supreme Court has explained that terms not defined in the Constitution, like \"ex post facto\" laws, require explanation derived from English common law known to the Framers. Justice Chase in Calder v. Bull stated that these terms had acquired meaning through use by legislators, lawyers, and authors before the Revolution. Chief Justice Taft emphasized the importance of interpreting the Constitution by referencing British common law, as the framers were familiar with it and used its vocabulary. This approach ensures a clear understanding of the Constitution's language and terms. The framers of the Constitution relied on British common law as the foundation for American jurisprudence, expressing their conclusions in terms of the common law to ensure clarity and understanding. Justice Joseph Story emphasized the importance of the common law in shaping the United States Constitution. The common law is the foundation of American jurisprudence, adopted by the original thirteen states after independence in 1776. The Constitution of Delaware specifically stated that the common law of England and statute law in force would remain unless altered by the legislature. The common law, adopted by the original thirteen states after independence in 1776, was recognized in the Constitution of Delaware. Framers of state and federal constitutions in the 1770s were familiar with and acknowledged the application of British common law in the United States. Justice Story noted that while not all British common law was adopted, it was adapted to fit the American situation. This is relevant in analyzing the term \"natural born\" citizen. The term \"natural born\" citizen is analyzed in the context of British common law and the unique American experience. The Supreme Court has ruled that children born in the country, even to alien parents, are considered \"natural born\" subjects under British common law. The rule of law regarding allegiance to the host country applied to the American colonies at the time of the Declaration of Independence and continued under the Constitution. Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England explained the concept of \"natural-born\" allegiance due to all individuals born within the king's dominions. Blackstone traced the development of the concept of \"natural-born\" allegiance to the reciprocal duties of protection and allegiance that developed under the feudal system. In 1844, Assistant Vice-Chancellor Lewis Sandford authored an opinion on the legal history of natural born citizenship status in the United States, finding that persons born in the U.S., even to alien parents, are natural born citizens. Sandford concluded that all persons born in the United States, even of alien parents who were only here temporarily, had \"natural born\" citizenship status under English common law, carried forward in the laws of all original thirteen states after independence, and then under the laws and constitutional provisions of the United States. Julia Lynch was born in this state of alien parents during their temporary sojourn, making her a natural born citizen under the common law of England. At the formation of the national government, English common law prevailed in all thirteen states, making all persons born within the colonies subjects of the Crown of England. Colonial legislation assumed this rule unless proven incompatible with the colonists' circumstances or altered by laws. At the Declaration of Independence, all thirteen states considered a child born within their territory a citizen. This rule remained unchanged until the National Constitution took effect. The Supreme Court affirmed birthright citizenship in the United States v. Wong Kim Ark case in 1898. In England and the United States, a child born to alien parents is considered a natural born subject or citizen, unless the parents are diplomats or enemy troops. This rule has been in place for centuries in England and its colonies. The Court referenced historical precedents showing that children born in England of alien parents were considered natural-born subjects under common law. This rule was followed in the English Colonies and later in the United States, continuing under the Constitution. The federal circuit court decision, written by Supreme Court Justice Swayne, affirmed that all persons born in the allegiance of the United States are natural born citizens according to the common law rule. The Fourteenth Amendment further requires that the person born in the United States be subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, excluding children of foreign diplomats. Birth within the geographic boundaries of the United States does not automatically grant citizenship, especially in unincorporated territories or possessions, unless provided by statute. The Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Wong Kim Ark that being born in such territories does not confer citizenship under the Fourteenth Amendment or common law. In United States v. Wong Kim Ark, the Supreme Court examined English common law of citizenship at the time of the Constitution's drafting, finding citizenship was obtained by jus soli (place of birth) and jus sanguinis (descent). England's common law was jus soli, while citizenship by descent was established by statute, not common law. The Supreme Court in Wong Kim Ark discussed the long-standing statutory recognition of \"natural-born subjects\" born abroad to British parents, which was disputed in legal scholarship. The Supreme Court in Wong Kim Ark discussed the statutory recognition of \"natural-born subjects\" born abroad to British parents, which was disputed in legal scholarship. The statute of 25 Edw. III. [1350] was declaratory of the common law, with suggestions derived from sources such as the Year Book of 1 Rich. III. (1483) and Dyer's Reports. In term 7 Edw. III. Rot. 2 B. R., it was mistakenly adjudged that children born abroad in the service of the king were inheritable. The dissenting Justices in Wong Kim Ark were discussed in the case of Weedin v. Chin Bow, where it was argued that children of citizens born abroad were always natural-born citizens according to common law. A 1921 law review article noted that English common law included jus sanguinis and jus soli. The controversy surrounding birthright citizenship has been debated for centuries. Legal scholars argue that English common law, influenced by both jus sanguinis and jus soli, should be the basis for interpreting the Constitution. Charles Gordon, a former general counsel for the US Immigration and Naturalization Service, highlighted the long-standing practice of recognizing citizenship by descent in both England and the US. Gordon concluded that English common law, a combination of jus soli and jus sanguinis, was adopted by the US and expanded over the centuries through statutes. The applicability of jus sanguinis was confirmed by statutes in England before the American Revolution, which became part of the inherited common law in the US. This position was supported by an 1896 treatise by Albert Venn Dicey, cited in the Supreme Court case Wong Kim Ark. The Supreme Court, citing Venn Dicey, defines 'natural-born British subject' as one who acquires British nationality at birth, including those born abroad. The US does not strictly adhere to English common law, incorporating only applicable principles. The incorporation of English common law and statutory laws by the colonies influenced the legal traditions in the early days of the nation. Interpretive analyses are used to understand the term \"natural born\" citizen in the Constitution. The term \"natural born\" citizen in the American colonies at the time of the revolution and framing of the Constitution is subject to speculation due to the lack of official records from the Federal Convention of 1787. The term \"natural born\" as it related to citizenship under English law and jurisprudence was widely known and used in the American colonies in the 1700's. The term \"natural born\" was widely used in the American colonies in the 1700s, with the First Continental Congress asserting the applicability of English common law and statutory laws to the colonies. The First Continental Congress in 1774 unanimously resolved that the colonies are entitled to English common law and statutes, including the right to be tried by peers and inherit the rights of natural-born subjects in England. This term \"natural born\" was familiar to the framers of the Constitution and other founding fathers. The term \"natural born\" was familiar to the framers of the Constitution and other founding fathers, including John Jay. They were already familiar with the term in the context of British common law and statutory law concepts of citizenship rights and privileges. William Blackstone's legal treatise, published in 1765, was widely known to the framers and explained the concept of \"natural born\" subjects in England and America. Blackstone's explanation in 1765 clarified that children born abroad of English subjects were considered \"natural born\" subjects under English law, unless their fathers were attainted, banished, or in service of an enemy prince. This concept was rooted in British common law and statutory law to promote foreign commerce. The term \"natural born\" in the United States at the time of the Constitution drafting may have had a broader meaning than in early English common law. Legal commentators and historians suggest that the term evolved and broadened in meaning through statutory law, as recognized and adopted by the framers. The term \"natural-born\" had a broad view according to legal commentators and historians, including all foreign-born children of American citizen parents as eligible for the Presidency. Presidential historian Michael Nelson noted that the term encompassed both common law definition and mode of citizenship acquisition, as well as the broadening through English statutory law. The term \"natural born Citizen\" has roots in British common law, encompassing both jus soli and jus sanguinis doctrines. It aimed at immigrants and expanded to include babies born abroad to British citizens. John Jay, who recommended the term, may have intended to include his own children born in Spain and France. The term \"natural born Citizen\" includes babies born abroad to British citizens, as seen in the Naturalization Act of 1790. John Jay likely intended to include his own children born in Spain and France. The Naturalization Act of 1790 suggests that \"natural born\" citizens include those born abroad to American citizens, not just those born in the country. This interpretation was likely influenced by the English statutory recognition of citizenship by descent through one's father. The significance of this early congressional act lies in the fact that many framers of the Constitution were members of the first Congress, providing a contemporaneous understanding of the Constitution's terms. The eligibility requirement of being a \"natural born\" citizen was proposed by the Committee of Eleven, with 8 out of 11 members in the first Congress. The Supreme Court values early actions of the first Congress in interpreting the Constitution due to its proximity in time to the Convention. The eligibility requirement of being a \"natural born\" citizen for the presidency includes those born on US soil and subject to its jurisdiction, as well as those born abroad to US citizens. Congress has the authority to determine citizenship criteria. The Fourteenth Amendment defines US citizenship as being born or naturalized in the US and subject to its jurisdiction. In contrast, jus sanguinis, prevalent in Europe, bases nationality on parentage. Congress has the power to establish citizenship criteria. The provision under discussion in Congress recognizes a certain category of persons as citizens from birth, based on the power granted by the Constitution to pass a uniform rule of naturalization. This provision allows Congress to determine who can be admitted to citizenship, even if born abroad of American parents. Some argue that the common meaning of natural born citizen in 18th century America may differ from what was actually applicable in the American colonies. In 18th century America, the concept of \"natural born citizens\" was derived from a Swiss legal philosopher's treatise on the law of nations. The term was not used in the original French or English interpretations at the time of the U.S. Constitution's drafting, but was later translated to English after the Constitution's adoption. The term \"natural born citizens\" was not included in the original French or English interpretations during the drafting of the U.S. Constitution in 1787. The influence of Vattel's work on the framers is speculative, lacking direct historical evidence, and goes against mainstream principles of constitutional interpretation in American jurisprudence. There is only one reference to Vattel at the Federal Convention of 1787, and no other mentions in the notes. The framers of the U.S. Constitution did not directly reference Vattel's work on citizenship during the Federal Convention of 1787 or in the Federalist Papers. It is unlikely that they would have ignored established legal meanings in favor of a French-language treatise on international law. In 1844, Assistant Vice Chancellor Sandford analyzed natural born citizenship in the United States, concluding that birth in the territory governed citizenship regardless of parents' nationality. Sandford argued that the framers of the Constitution would not have abandoned existing laws for an international law theory of citizenship by descent. In 1844, Vice Chancellor Sandford concluded that the term \"natural born citizen\" in the federal Constitution referred to the established common law principle in all states at the time of the union's formation. The Constitution recognized the term \"citizen\" with a well-understood meaning. The Constitution recognizes the term \"citizen\" with a well-understood meaning and directly acknowledges the common law principle of natural born citizenship. The absence of any indication in the Constitution to change existing laws on this subject supports the interpretation that a native-born individual with alien parents would still be eligible for the presidency. The Constitution's recognition of the term \"citizen\" and the common law principle of natural born citizenship suggests that a native-born individual with alien parents could still be eligible for the presidency. The intent of the representatives at the convention to frame a confederation and union for national purposes does not support the idea of subverting existing laws without proper constitutional provisions. Vattel's work on the \"law of nations\" does not govern citizenship within a country, which is instead regulated by municipal law. Vattel's writings on citizenship by \"descent\" reflected European nations' laws, but U.S. law is based on the place of birth, not parentage. James Madison and the Supreme Court affirmed that birthplace, not parentage, determines citizenship in the United States. The Supreme Court in 1971 and 1998 affirmed that citizenship in the United States is determined by jus soli, or the place of birth, not by descent. The common understanding during the revolutionary period was that a \"natural born\" citizen is one who is a citizen at birth, based on the place of birth within the country. The term \"natural born\" citizen is defined as a citizen by birth, not by descent, based on jus soli or place of birth. Historical intent and common law principles suggest that \"natural born\" citizens are those considered U.S. citizens at birth, either by jus soli or federal statutory law. The term \"natural born citizen\" is supported by federal statutory law and historical understanding. It has been used in federal and state cases to describe individuals born in the U.S. to alien parents. The term \"native born citizen\" has also been used to refer to individuals born in the country without regard to parentage. The term \"natural born citizen\" refers to individuals born in the U.S. to alien parents, without requiring lineage or bloodline. Legal opinions do not consider parentage as a determining factor for presidential eligibility, rejecting the idea of a \"two citizen-parent\" requirement. The Dred Scott decision in 1857 denied citizenship to freed slaves and their descendants, justifying slavery and treating African Americans as property without rights under the Constitution. This exclusive understanding of citizenship was later overturned by the Supreme Court. The Dred Scott decision in 1857, written by Chief Justice Taney, denied citizenship to freed slaves and their descendants, stating they were not intended to be included as citizens in the Constitution. This exclusive view of citizenship treated African Americans as property without rights, based on the belief that they were not part of the sovereign people who ratified the Constitution. The Dred Scott decision in 1857 denied citizenship to freed slaves and their descendants, treating African Americans as subordinate beings subject to the authority of the dominant race. One Justice in a concurring opinion cited Vattel's discussion of citizenship to argue that Negroes brought to America as slaves could not be citizens of the United States. The Dred Scott decision, considered the worst in U.S. history, has been superseded by later Supreme Court rulings and amendments. Justice Daniel's concurrence has never been the basis for any majority ruling in American jurisprudence. Taney distorted history to justify exclusionist principles in American citizenship, ignoring judicial precedents emphasizing birthplace over ancestry. The weakness of the Dred Scott decision was highlighted by the Attorney General's opinion in 1862, before the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Attorney General's opinion in 1862, before the Fourteenth Amendment, emphasized that \"natural born\" citizens are those who are U.S. citizens \"by birth,\" not made by law. This opinion highlighted the foundational principles of citizenship in the United States based on common law and constitutional reasoning. Citizens in the United States become citizens by birth and remain so unless they voluntarily expatriate. The Constitution recognizes natural-born citizens and provides for the naturalization of foreign-born citizens. Citizenship is not granted by the Constitution but is affirmed by the principle that people born in a country are its citizens. The principle that people born in a country are its citizens is reaffirmed by the Constitution. Every person born in the country is considered a citizen at birth, unless proven otherwise. Nativity determines the relationship between the individual and the government. Various legal sources support this concept. The Attorney General's opinion states that individuals born in the United States are considered \"natural born\" citizens, regardless of their parents' citizenship. This includes those who are citizens at birth or by birth, and are not in a special category but rather part of the mass of citizens. The Supreme Court began to question the legal reasoning of the Dred Scott decision, moving away from the theory of citizenship it presented. In a later case, the Court relied on common law to discuss citizenship in the United States, noting that children born to citizen-parents on U.S. soil would be considered \"natural born\" citizens under common law. The Supreme Court in Minor v. Happersett discussed the concept of \"natural born\" citizenship in relation to parentage, but did not make a definitive ruling on the matter. The Court noted that some authorities believe that being born to one citizen-parent or no citizen-parents could still qualify as \"natural born\" citizenship. The Supreme Court in Minor v. Happersett discussed the concept of \"natural born\" citizenship in relation to parentage, but did not make a definitive ruling on the matter. It was never doubted that children born in a country of citizen parents became citizens themselves. The Supreme Court later clarified this in United States v. Wong Kim Ark in 1898, stating that all children born of citizen parents within the jurisdiction are themselves citizens. In United States v. Wong Kim Ark in 1898, the Supreme Court ruled that every person born in the US and subject to its jurisdiction is a \"natural born\" citizen, regardless of parents' citizenship. The Fourteenth Amendment affirmed the common law principle that birth on US soil confers citizenship. The Fourteenth Amendment confirms that anyone born within the US territory and under its jurisdiction is a citizen, regardless of their parents' citizenship, with a few exceptions. The Fourteenth Amendment confirms that anyone born within the US territory and under its jurisdiction is a citizen, regardless of their parents' citizenship. Birth and allegiance are linked, making a natural-born subject or citizen. The common law principle of birth and allegiance determining citizenship has been consistently upheld in the United States, as evidenced by historical legal opinions and Supreme Court cases such as Wong Kim Ark in 1898. The principle of birth and allegiance determining citizenship has been upheld in the United States, with two categories of citizens: natural born citizens and those who must be naturalized. The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees citizenship to those born in the US, while those not born in the US acquire citizenship through Acts of Congress. The distinction between citizenship by birth and citizenship by naturalization is crucial in determining eligibility for the office of President. The Constitution specifies that only \"natural born\" citizens can hold this position, while Congress has the power to establish rules for naturalization. The Court distinguishes between \"natural born\" citizens and \"naturalized\" citizens in terms of rights and duties. While naturalized citizens have the same freedoms as natural born citizens, they are not eligible for the Presidency. The United States Court of Appeals found that an alien who becomes a citizen is afforded the same rights as a natural-born citizen, except for eligibility to the presidency. Constitutional scholars use terms like \"native born\" or \"native citizen\" interchangeably with \"natural born\" to refer to U.S. citizenship from birth for Presidential eligibility. The President must be a native citizen of the United States to prevent foreign influence in the office, as stated by legal scholars like Justice Joseph Story and St. George Tucker. The term \"native citizen\" is used interchangeably with \"natural born\" for Presidential eligibility. The term \"native born\" or \"native citizen\" is often used interchangeably with \"natural born\" in discussions of presidential eligibility, although it is not a specific legal term and is not mentioned in the Constitution. It can refer to anyone born within the U.S. borders, regardless of their parents' citizenship status. The Constitution does not mention native-born citizens but does refer to natural-born citizens. The term \"native born\" is commonly used in legal discussions to describe those born within the country's borders. The Supreme Court has used the terms \"native born\" or \"native\" citizens to distinguish citizenship at birth from naturalized citizens. The Supreme Court has indicated that native-born citizens, or those born within the geographic area of the United States, are eligible for the presidency as natural-born citizens, distinct from naturalized citizens. Schneider v. Rusk emphasized that the rights of native-born and naturalized citizens are equal under the Constitution. The Constitution distinguishes between \"natural born\" citizens eligible for the Presidency and \"naturalized\" citizens who are not eligible. Citizenship implies allegiance and protection duties. Naturalized citizens are equal to native citizens except for Presidential eligibility. The Constitution distinguishes between \"natural born\" citizens eligible for the Presidency and \"naturalized\" citizens who are not eligible. Naturalized citizens have the same rights as native citizens except for Presidential eligibility. Judicially, the status of \"natural born\" citizens has been confirmed for over a century, including foreign-born children of U.S. citizens. The eligibility of all citizens born in the United States to be President is not in question. Case law and historical records do not support the idea of a separate category of citizens who are neither \"natural born\" nor naturalized. The recognized categories in the US are \"natural born\" citizens, who are citizens at birth, and naturalized citizens. During the 2008 presidential campaign, questions arose about Senator McCain's \"natural born\" citizenship eligibility due to being born in the Panama Canal Zone. The concept of place of birth traditionally governs strict common law natural born citizenship in the US. There are legal and historical questions about whether US citizens born abroad to US citizen-parents should also be considered \"natural born\" citizens eligible for the presidency. The treatise Immigration Law and Procedure discusses the eligibility of U.S. citizens born abroad to become President or Vice President. The term \"natural born citizen\" is not clearly defined in the Constitution, causing uncertainty for those who acquire citizenship by descent. The concept originates from British law and is mainly used in the Presidential Qualifications Clause. The Constitution's natural-born qualification for presidential candidacy has sparked debates, with no authoritative adjudication. The reference likely includes all citizens born as citizens, whether native-born or by descent. The Fourteenth Amendment clarifies that a U.S. citizen is one born or naturalized in the United States. This has led to arguments that citizenship is solely based on being born in the U.S. The Constitution's natural-born qualification for presidential candidacy has sparked debates, with no authoritative adjudication. The Fourteenth Amendment clarifies that a U.S. citizen is one born or naturalized in the United States, leading to arguments that citizenship is solely based on being born in the U.S. The Supreme Court in Wong Kim Ark stated that every person born in the United States becomes a citizen and needs no naturalization, while those born outside the U.S. can only become citizens through naturalization. Certain classes of persons can become citizens through various means, such as being born to American parents abroad or through naturalization proceedings. Some argue that individuals born abroad to American parents are not \"natural born\" citizens but rather \"naturalized\" citizens, making them ineligible for the Presidency. Earlier federal cases have supported this argument. In Zimmer v. Acheson, the court ruled that a person born abroad to a naturalized American citizen is considered a \"naturalized\" citizen and can be expatriated under federal law. This decision was based on the distinction between native-born citizens and naturalized citizens, with the appellant falling into the latter category. In Zimmer v. Acheson, the court ruled that a person born abroad to a naturalized American citizen is considered a \"naturalized\" citizen and can be expatriated under federal law. The appellant's father's naturalization status determined the citizenship status of the appellant at birth. The case of Rogers v. Bellei also addressed the conditions placed on U.S. citizens-by-descent, requiring them to reside in the United States to retain their citizenship. The Supreme Court ruled that conditions placed on U.S. citizens-by-descent to reside in the United States to retain their citizenship were not unconstitutional. The Court implied that foreign-born children of U.S. citizens became citizens at birth through naturalization, subject to a reasonable residence requirement. This decision contrasted with the power Congress had to deny citizenship outright and require a more arduous naturalization process. The earlier cases, including Wong Kim Ark, raised interesting contentions about statutory citizenship for those born abroad. The debate over \"natural born\" citizenship status for presidential eligibility of those born abroad to U.S. citizen parents remains unresolved. Supporters argue for a broader interpretation of the Constitution, emphasizing that the Fourteenth Amendment was not intended to address this issue. The term \"natural born citizen\" in Article II should be interpreted inclusively. The term \"natural born citizen\" in Article II should be interpreted in light of the common law and common understanding at the time of the Constitution's adoption. Recent cases suggest that the Fourteenth Amendment sets a minimum standard for citizenship at birth, which can be expanded by federal law. The Supreme Court in Rogers v. Bellei clarified that citizenship under the Fourteenth Amendment's clause requires being born in the US or naturalized, with the possibility of expansion through federal law. English concepts of jus soli, or citizenship by place of birth, influence US law, which can be modified by statute. The framers and ratifiers of the Constitution were influenced by British law on \"natural born\" citizenship, which could be affected by Congress through legislation. The Supreme Court has upheld Congress's authority to expatriate certain citizens, indicating that citizenship status can be modified by statute. In a 2001 case, the Supreme Court clarified that a child born to U.S. citizens abroad has the same legal status as a child born in the United States. The Court emphasized that the child's citizenship status remains the same regardless of where they are born. The common understanding and legal meaning now indicate that someone who is a citizen \"at birth\" is not considered to have been \"naturalized.\" Federal law defines \"naturalization\" as conferring nationality after birth. Justice Thomas recently noted that children born abroad to U.S. parents are considered natural-born citizens under federal law. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals also recognized two ways to be a natural-born citizen: being born in the U.S. or being born abroad to at least one citizen-parent who meets residency requirements. In United States v. Carlos Jesus Marguet-Pillado, the court acknowledged that a person born in 1968 can be a natural born U.S. citizen if born in the U.S. or born abroad to a U.S. citizen parent who meets residency requirements. Senator McCain was also deemed a \"natural born\" citizen by a federal district court in California. Senator McCain was considered a \"natural born\" citizen by a federal district court in California, as he was born to U.S. citizen parents outside the United States, meeting the criteria set by federal nationality statutes. The court determined that being born to citizen parents abroad falls under the definition of \"natural born Citizen\" in Article II of the Constitution. The Fourteenth Amendment set a floor on citizenship, overruling the Dred Scott decision, and provided that all born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to its jurisdiction, were citizens by birth. Senator McCain's citizenship was determined by federal nationality statutes, as he was born to U.S. citizen parents outside the United States. The Supreme Court interpreted the phrase \"out of the limits and jurisdiction of the United States\" in a statute to encompass those not granted citizenship directly by the Fourteenth Amendment. Senator McCain was declared a citizen at birth under this view. Congress later enacted a law to confirm citizenship for individuals in Senator McCain's circumstances. It is highly probable that Senator McCain is a natural born citizen. The federal court in Robinson v. Bowen adopted a broad interpretation of \"natural born\" citizen, including those born abroad with U.S. citizenship transmitted from parents. Lawsuits have challenged Senator McCain and President Obama's eligibility as \"natural born\" citizens. Some cases challenged President Obama's citizenship, alleging he was not born in the U.S. or that his father was not a U.S. citizen at the time of his birth. These cases were dismissed due to lack of legal standing or failure to state a claim for relief. Some cases challenged President Obama's citizenship based on his father not being a U.S. citizen at the time of his birth or his potential dual citizenship. Courts dismissed these cases due to lack of jurisdiction or frivolous claims. Some federal courts have dismissed eligibility cases challenging President Obama's citizenship, citing lack of jurisdiction or frivolous claims. The courts have also imposed fines and ordered counsel to show cause for damages and costs in some instances. In Georgia, a district court fined plaintiff's counsel $20,000 for filing \"frivolous\" motions and using the federal judiciary for political beliefs. In the District of Columbia, a judge dismissed a challenge to the President's \"eligibility\" and ordered counsel to explain why they should not be fined for frivolous filings. Some cases argued that President Obama's citizenship was nullified due to his mother moving to Indonesia when he was a minor. The Supreme Court has ruled that a citizen born in the United States does not lose their citizenship if they move to a foreign country as a minor. Citizenship can only be forfeited through an affirmative action of renunciation as an adult. Expatriation is the process of giving up citizenship. The Supreme Court ruled that citizenship cannot be forfeited by a child born in the United States who passively benefits from foreign naturalization proceedings. Expatriation is the voluntary renunciation of nationality and allegiance, which does not apply to minors moving abroad. The Supreme Court clarified that citizenship cannot be taken away from a child born in the United States unless there is a clear statutory mandate. Lawsuits challenging President Obama's citizenship were dismissed, arguing that his father's nationality made him ineligible to be a \"natural born\" citizen. Obama's eligibility as a \"natural born citizen\" was questioned due to his father's nationality, but the Supreme Court ruled that parental citizenship does not affect a child's status as a U.S. citizen at birth. Foreign laws or citizenships cannot influence the determination of who is a \"natural born\" citizen in the United States. The question of citizenship and categories of citizenship are determined by municipal law, not international law. Allowing recognition of citizenship under foreign law to determine natural born citizenship in the United States would undermine U.S. national sovereignty. The Supreme Court has ruled that a child born in the U.S. of alien parentage becomes a U.S. citizen. The Supreme Court ruled that a child born in the U.S. of alien parentage becomes a U.S. citizen, emphasizing the nation's right to determine its own citizenship laws. Dual nationality is possible, and acquiring citizenship under foreign law does not necessarily negate U.S. citizenship. The heritage of the child's parents does not determine natural-born citizenship in American jurisprudence. Dual nationality does not affect native-born status, as seen in the case of a native-born American citizen with dual citizenship returning to the U.S. for presidential eligibility. The Attorney General concluded that a native-born American citizen with dual citizenship can still be eligible for the presidency, regardless of parental citizenship. There is no legal basis for a two-citizen-parent requirement for \"natural born\" citizenship status in American jurisprudence. The eligibility of a native-born U.S. citizen to be President is not governed by parental citizenship. Historical evidence and legal experts confirm that the term \"natural born citizen\" includes those born within the U.S. regardless of their parents' citizenship status. The rule governing citizenship is determined by municipal law, not international law. In the United States, citizenship is based on jus soli and jus sanguinis principles.

The federal courts have consistently relied on place of birth as the determining factor of natural born citizenship, regardless of parents' status. In a state court ruling in 1844, it was concluded that every person born within the United States is a natural born citizen. The Supreme Court has historically upheld that being born within the United States establishes natural born citizenship, regardless of parents' status. This principle was reaffirmed in the case of United States v. Wong Kim Ark in 1898. The Supreme Court in Wong Kim Ark reaffirmed that every child born on US soil, subject to its jurisdiction, is a \"natural born\" citizen, regardless of parents' nationality. They also clarified that before the Fourteenth Amendment, all white persons born in the US were considered native-born citizens. The Supreme Court has equated \"native born\" citizens with \"natural born\" citizens in terms of eligibility to the Presidency, stating that naturalized citizens have the same rights as native born citizens except for eligibility to the Presidency. The Supreme Court has equated \"native born\" citizens with \"natural born\" citizens in terms of eligibility to the Presidency. Despite laws like the Chinese Exclusion Act, children born in the United States to Chinese parents were still considered \"natural born\" citizens. In 1919 and 1920, court rulings affirmed that individuals born in the United States to Chinese parents were considered natural-born citizens, regardless of their parents' nationality. The Supreme Court did not consider the citizenship of Kwock Jan Fat's father, and there was no discussion about the citizenship of his mother in the court decision. The briefs did not provide any evidence or arguments regarding the mother's citizenship, only mentioning that she was born in China and came to the US as a child. The Supreme Court did not consider the citizenship of Kwock Jan Fat's parents in the court decision. The relevant factor for determining \"natural born\" citizenship was the physical presence of the parents in the United States at the time of Kwock's birth. The Supreme Court focused on the physical presence of Kwock Jan Fat's parents in the United States at the time of his birth, rather than their citizenship status. In a previous case, the Court of Appeals recognized a person as a natural-born citizen based on birth within the country, even if the parents were Chinese aliens. The federal court in 1884 explained the concept of a \"natural born\" citizen in American jurisprudence as being born in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction, regardless of the Fourteenth Amendment. Birth within the dominions and jurisdiction of the United States creates citizenship, except for Africans brought in as slaves and their descendants. In a 1884 federal court case, it was explained that a \"natural born\" citizen in American jurisprudence is someone born in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction. This principle holds true even if one or both parents are \"aliens,\" as stated in earlier cases. In Dos Reis ex rel. Camara v. Nicolls and Loo Goon Hop v. Dulles, court cases affirmed that individuals born in the United States are considered \"natural born\" citizens, regardless of their parents' citizenship. In Yamauchi v. Rogers, a person born in California was also recognized as a \"natural born citizen.\" The court cases affirmed that individuals born in the United States are considered \"natural born\" citizens, regardless of their parents' citizenship. Children born in the US, even to undocumented parents, are recognized as natural-born citizens. In Michigan, a court discussed the eligibility of a presidential candidate based on being a \"natural born\" citizen.

In various court decisions, it has been established that being born in the United States makes one a natural-born citizen eligible for the presidency, regardless of the citizenship status of their parents. \"The common law of England, American colonies, and United States all support the interpretation that persons born within US borders are 'natural born Citizens' for Article II, Section 1 purposes, regardless of parents' citizenship. Every child born in US jurisdiction is a 'natural born Citizen' eligible for presidency, regardless of parents' nationality.\" The term \"natural born citizen\" includes those born in the U.S. and those born abroad to U.S. citizen-parents who met certain requirements. This interpretation is supported by judicial decisions and scholarship, dating back to the founding of the nation. The term \"natural born\" is generally understood to mean having a specific attribute or nature from birth, rather than acquiring it later."
