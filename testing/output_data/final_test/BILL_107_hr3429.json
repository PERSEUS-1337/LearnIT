    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Max Cleland Over-the-Road Bus Security and Safety Act of 2002\" and provides emergency security assistance for over-the-road buses. The \"Max Cleland Over-the-Road Bus Security and Safety Act of 2002\" establishes a grant program for private operators of over-the-road buses to improve system-wide security, including constructing secure facilities, protecting drivers, upgrading equipment for passenger information, and training employees in security procedures. The grant program under the \"Max Cleland Over-the-Road Bus Security and Safety Act of 2002\" allows private operators of over-the-road buses to enhance security by implementing various measures such as employee training, installing surveillance equipment, creating emergency communication systems, and conducting passenger screening programs. The grant can also be used to reimburse operators for security-related costs incurred since September 11, 2001. The Federal share of the cost for grants under the \"Max Cleland Over-the-Road Bus Security and Safety Act of 2002\" is 90 percent. The Secretary must consider private operators who have enhanced bus security since September 11, 2001. Grants are subject to terms and conditions outlined in the Transportation Equity Act. The Secretary must approve a security improvement plan from private over-the-road bus operators before granting funds. Applicants must coordinate security improvements with terminal owners. The Act defines over-the-road buses. SEC. 4 defines an over-the-road bus as having an elevated passenger deck over a baggage compartment. SEC. 5 requires a security assessment for buses. The Secretary of Transportation must submit a preliminary report to the Senate and House committees within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The report will assess the over-the-road bus security grant program, actions taken to address security issues, and the need for additional legislation to ensure the security of travelers on over-the-road buses. The Secretary of Transportation is required to assess the security of Americans traveling on over-the-road buses, including economic impacts, research needs, and industry best practices. Consultation with industry, labor, and other groups is mandated for this assessment. The Secretary of Transportation is authorized $99,000,000 for fiscal year 2003 to make grants for security improvements to over-the-road bus operations. The funds shall remain available until expended."
