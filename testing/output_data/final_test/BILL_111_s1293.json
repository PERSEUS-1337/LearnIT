    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Enhancing Child Health with Automatic School Meal Enrollment Act of 2009\" and aims to improve direct certification. The Act \"Enhancing Child Health with Automatic School Meal Enrollment Act of 2009\" aims to improve direct certification by offering performance awards to States to ensure eligible children are certified accordingly. The Secretary shall consider State data from the prior school year and make performance awards to 5 States demonstrating outstanding performance and 5 States showing substantial progress. The Secretary will provide funding of $2,000,000 each to carry out specific clauses annually from 2009 to 2011 to support improvement efforts. The Secretary will receive and use funds transferred without further appropriation to carry out specific clauses annually from 2009 to 2011. Each school year, corrective action plans will be identified by the Secretary. The report required under the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 states that States not directly certifying 95 percent of eligible children must implement a corrective action plan to meet requirements. States can include performance improvement in the corrective action plan. The report mandates that States failing to directly certify 95% of eligible children must implement a corrective action plan to improve direct certification methods. This plan must be submitted for approval to the Secretary for the following school year. The report requires States to create a direct certification improvement plan with specific measures, a timeline for implementation, and goals to increase direct certification results. The Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act is amended to include a provision stating that no action is required by the household of the child for eligibility for free school meals. The Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act is amended to include a provision for direct certification using statewide education databases. The Secretary of Education must submit a report to Congress within 2 years of this Act's enactment on using statewide databases for direct certification under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act. The report will identify States with such databases and describe best practices for their use. The Secretary of Education will submit a report to Congress on using statewide databases for direct certification under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act. The report will include case studies of States with expanded databases and identify States suitable for database expansion. $500,000 in funding will be transferred to the Secretary for this purpose. The funds transferred under paragraph (1) must be accepted and used without further appropriation."
