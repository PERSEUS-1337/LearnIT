    "content": "Congressional authorization of federal assistance to state and local governments dates back to 1808 with the first federal grant program for the National Guard. Currently, there are over 2,321 congressionally authorized federal assistance programs, leading to challenges in standardizing financial and administrative aspects of grant program management. Federal agencies struggle to provide timely and detailed information on grant awards due to the complexity and fragmentation of these programs. The limitations of databases tracking federal grant funds hinder effective oversight by Congress. Recipients report project information to federal agencies, but data accessibility is limited. Federal grants serve various purposes like purchasing equipment and housing construction. Federal grant projects may involve purchasing fire and police equipment, constructing housing for low-income populations, providing disaster recovery assistance, funding educational activities, and other social services. Organizations manage the application and administration of federal grants, with individuals benefiting from the projects and services. Recipients of federal grant funds must register in federal grant systems before applying and report on fund usage to federal agencies. Information provided by grant recipients is stored in federal databases accessible to the public. This report introduces the reporting requirements for federal grant recipients. This report introduces reporting requirements for federal grant recipients, focusing on financial reporting to federal grant databases as mandated by the Office of Management and Budget. Reporting requirements for federal grant recipients are outlined in authorizing statutes and regulations for each grant program. Some requirements, like post-award audits, apply to most federal grants. To obtain a DUNS number and register with SAM, grant seekers must provide organization details such as legal name, address, and contact information. Additionally, registration with SAM requires providing the DUNS number and taxpayer identification number. Federal grant recipients are required to provide various business information, including the DUNS number, TIN, CAGE code, business type, financial information, executive compensation details, and POC information. The DUNS number is a unique identifier assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, used by federal agencies to identify grant applicants. Organizations must also register in SAM after obtaining a DUNS number. To apply for federal grants, organizations need a DUNS number and must register in SAM. Each grant award is assigned a number for tracking purposes. The federal agency reports grant program information to CFDA. After receiving a grant award, the agency collects recipient and project details. The grant application information is entered into the agency's grant management system to create a unique award number. When a federal agency awards a grant, a unique grant award number is created for tracking purposes. Recipients may have multiple grant award numbers if they receive awards under the same program. Each grant award also corresponds to a grant account in the agency's cash management system. Recipients must report financial information periodically, including expenditures related to the funded project or services. The financial information of federal grant awards is reported periodically to the federal agency. Data on the grant award are reported into various federal grant databases, including federal agency cash management systems, FAADS-PLUS, FSRS, USAspending.gov, and FAC. Federal grant data are stored in multiple databases at both the grant recipient and federal government levels. A unique DUNS number is assigned to each government contractor and federal grant applicant for identification purposes. Since October 1, 2003, the OMB policy mandates the use of a DUNS number on federal grant applications. DUNS numbers are linked to contractor and grant recipient information for each organization address. The System for Award Management (SAM) is the primary database for federal government contractors and grant applicants, requiring registration for award consideration. SAM collects procurement and financial data, consolidating acquisition and grant support systems into one. The consolidation is planned in four phases, with the first phase launched in 2012. The first phase of SAM consolidation, launched in 2012, included nine information databases like CCR, FedReg, ORCA, and EPLS. The consolidation will also encompass systems like eSRS, FSRS, CFDA, FBO, WDOL, FPDS-NG, PPIRS, and FAPIIS, containing data on federal contractors. The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) is a searchable reference source for federal grants and assistance programs. It lists over 2,300 federal programs with details on objectives, eligibility, application processes, and contact information. CFDA is continuously updated and maintained by the General Services Administration (GSA). The CFDA, maintained by the GSA, provides information on federal grants and assistance programs. OMB oversees the collection of program information and issues guidance to ensure accurate data. Cash management involves transferring grant funds between federal agencies and recipients. Different cash management systems may limit interoperability. The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (FFATA) requires federal financial assistance awards over $25,000 to be displayed on USAspending.gov. The Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act) transferred responsibility for USAspending.gov to the Department of Treasury. USAspending.gov was re-launched in 2015 with improvements. The Federal Assistance Awards Data System (FAADS) was established in 1982. The Federal Assistance Awards Data System (FAADS) was established in 1982 by the Consolidated Federal Funds Report Act and maintained by the Bureau of the Census. FAADS-PLUS, introduced in 2007 as a result of the FFATA, is an expanded version of FAADS. FFATA requires prime subgrant recipients to report subaward financial information. The FFATA Subaward Reporting System (FSRS) is used for this purpose. The Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 and OMB guidance mandate that grant recipients expending $750,000 or more in federal awards submit an annual single audit. The Federal Audit Clearinghouse (FAC) oversees this process. The Federal Audit Clearinghouse (FAC) maintains an annual single audit detailing award expenditures, searchable by organization, location, or CFDA program number. Various databases contain federal grant information, but some are not accessible to the public. Accessible systems include Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, USAspending.gov, Dun and Bradstreet, System for Award Management, and Federal Audit. The Dun and Bradstreet (D&B) DUNS number database and System for Award Management (SAM) allow federal grant applicants to opt out of providing public searchable information. Applicants can withhold their DUNS number from the public database by discussing privacy concerns with D&B. However, the DUNS number remains visible to certain users unless the opt-out process for SAM is also completed. Grant applicants can also opt out of having information collected during SAM registration be visible to the public. Entities that opt out of public visibility in the SAM database will still be visible to users with special access and for FOIA requests. Banking information is always kept private."
