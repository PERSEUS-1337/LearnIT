Congress finds that punitive damage awards in financial injury cases are a significant issue, with nearly 50% of all punitive damage awards being made in financial injury cases. In California, punitive damages are awarded in 1 in every 5 financial injury cases. Between 1985-1989 and 1990-1994, punitive damage verdicts in financial injury cases saw a significant increase. The average verdict rose from $3.4 million to $7.6 million, the 90th percentile award increased from $3.9 million to $12.1 million, and the total punitive damages awarded went up from $1.2 billion to $2.3 billion. Punitive damages now make up a large portion of total damages awarded in financial injury cases. Punitive damages in financial injury cases have increased significantly, with awards rising from $3.4 million to $7.6 million on average. In Alabama, punitive damages represent 82% of all damages awarded in such cases. Only a small percentage of filed complaints result in a jury verdict, with punitive damages having a significant impact on settlements. Excessive and unpredictable punitive damage awards negatively affect interstate commerce by increasing costs. Excessive punitive damage awards negatively impact interstate commerce by increasing costs and decreasing availability of goods and services. Consumers are adversely affected by withdrawal of products and higher prices, jeopardizing financial well-being of individuals and small businesses. State legislatures have limited power to address these issues due to lack of control over punitive damages in other states. Establishing a rule of proportionality between punitive and compensatory damages is necessary to restore rationality and fairness in punitive damage awards, addressing concerns of excessive and arbitrary awards. This rule would benefit both plaintiffs and defendants and align with the constitutional objection raised by the United States Supreme Court in BMW of North America v. Gore. The proposed Act aims to establish reasonable limits on punitive damages, with a maximum recovery of 3 times the economic loss or $250,000 per claimant. This solution is projected to reduce excessive punitive damage awards by up to 40%, promoting interstate commerce and upholding due process rights.

The Act applies to civil actions in Federal or State courts involving interstate commerce, charitable or religious activities, or rights protected by Congress under the 14th amendment. Punitive damages can be sought for harm not resulting in death or serious physical impairment.

The court determines what constitutes severe harm, and the Act does not apply to certain civil actions. Punitive damages can be awarded in civil actions if the misconduct meets certain criteria, such as being a crime of violence, act of terrorism, or hate crime for which the defendant has been convicted in any court. The defendant may be liable for punitive damages if the misconduct involves intoxicating alcohol or drugs not taken as prescribed, or if it constitutes a felony sexual offense. The applicability of this subsection is a question of law for the court to determine. SEC. 5. PROPORTIONAL AWARDS. SEC. 5. PROPORTIONAL AWARDS.

The limitations on punitive damages in civil actions under this Act are capped at 3 times the economic loss or $250,000. The court applies these limitations and they are not disclosed to the jury. For corporations, the number of employees includes all subsidiaries of the parent corporation. SEC. 6. PREEMPTION. This Act does not create a cause of action for punitive damages, supersede Federal law, preempt any Federal or State law limiting punitive damages, or reduce courts' ability to order remittitur.
