    "content": "We introduce an unsupervised structure learning algorithm for deep neural networks that encodes a hierarchy of independencies in the input distribution. Neurons in deeper layers capture low-order independencies with a wide scope, while neurons in the first layers capture higher-order independencies with a narrower scope. The depth of the network is determined by the maximal order of independence in the input distribution. The algorithm constructs a generative latent graph and a deep discriminative graph from the data. The algorithm introduces a deep belief network and a discriminative graph based on a generative latent graph. It preserves conditional dependencies and constructs a deep neural network structure for image classification with high accuracy and smaller size. The algorithm is computationally efficient and effective in various domains such as speech recognition and computer vision. In this paper, the focus is on designing network topology-structure learning for recognition, computer vision, and machine translation. Various design choices such as network depth, layer width, building blocks, and connectivity are explored based on guidelines provided by previous studies. Meta-architectures trained on large datasets are proposed for achieving state-of-the-art solutions in high dimensionality problems. The problem of model structure learning has been extensively researched in the domain of probabilistic graphical models, focusing on Bayesian networks for density estimation and causal discovery. Two main approaches, score-based and constraint-based, have been studied. Score-based approaches combine scoring functions like BDe and BIC with search strategies like greedy equivalence search. Additionally, an algorithm for sampling deep belief networks was introduced for high-dimensional image datasets. The text discusses the use of constraint-based approaches in finding optimal structures in large sample limits by testing conditional independence between variables. A new interpretation for depth and inter-layer connectivity in deep neural networks is proposed, where a hierarchy of independencies in the input distribution is encoded in the network structure. This allows for automatic determination of the number of layers in the network. The text discusses a new interpretation for depth and inter-layer connectivity in deep neural networks, where a hierarchy of independencies in the input distribution is encoded in the network structure. The number of layers is automatically determined, and a neuron can connect to deeper layers skipping intermediate layers. The algorithm constructs graphical models and an auxiliary graph, with each variable represented by a node. The text introduces a stochastic inverse graph G Inv and a discriminative model graph G D, with an auxiliary graph G X for Bayesian network equivalence classes. It defines independence order and showcases a learned structure for classifying MNIST digits with neural routes passing through gather layers. The text introduces a layered deep belief network where neural routes pass through gather layers and merge into the final output layer. It describes learning the connectivity of a single-layer neural network based on a joint distribution faithful to a DAG G over observed X and latent nodes H. The text discusses constructing an efficient graph G for a deep belief network by encoding marginal independencies in a CPDAG G X and mimicking conditional dependencies. It explains the v-structure as the simplest connected DAG that encodes statistical independence. The text describes decomposing a graph G into autonomous sets based on marginal independencies and introducing latent variables to represent conditional dependencies. This process involves selecting a common child set, introducing latent variables for ancestor sets, and forming disjoint substructures. The text discusses constructing a graph with a single latent layer by replacing links between parent and child nodes with a common latent parent. The method augments a Bayesian network with latent variables while maintaining conditional dependence. Additionally, a stochastic inverse is generated using a latent structure, and dependencies induced by a latent variable are described using bi-directional edges. The text introduces a heuristic algorithm for constructing stochastic inverses of graphical models, preserving conditional dependencies but potentially adding new edges. The algorithm aims to create a DAG with a different node ordering where observed variables have the highest topological order. The algorithm constructs a DAG by inverting edges and adding bi-directional edges between latent variables. This ensures the preservation of dependencies while rearranging the node ordering. The algorithm constructs a DAG by inverting edges and adding bi-directional edges between latent variables to preserve dependencies while rearranging node ordering. The discriminative graph G D is created by replacing bi-directional dependencies in G Inv with explaining-away relations, introducing the observed class variable Y as a common child of the leaves in G Inv. This allows G D to mimic G Inv over X and H given Y, sharing the same inter-layer connectivity with inverted edge-directions. Introducing node Y provides an \"explaining away\" relation between latents for the classification task. The algorithm constructs a DAG by inverting edges and adding bi-directional edges between latent variables to preserve dependencies while rearranging node ordering. The discriminative graph G D is created by replacing bi-directional dependencies in G Inv with explaining-away relations, introducing the observed class variable Y as a common child of the leaves in G Inv. This allows G D to mimic G Inv over X and H given Y, sharing the same inter-layer connectivity with inverted edge-directions. An \"explaining away\" relation between latents is introduced for the classification task. A neural network is constructed based on the connectivity in G D, with conditional probabilities defined as logistic regressors. BID37 proposed approximating binary stochastic nodes with an infinite set, leading to an approximate probabilistic interpretation for the ReLU function. The ReLU function provides a probabilistic interpretation for better object classification in images. Each latent variable in the neural network is represented by a dense layer, with the class node represented by a softmax layer. The method involves learning multi-layered structures by recursively introducing deeper latent layers based on conditional independence testing. The Recursive Latent Structure Learning algorithm (Algorithm 2) constructs a latent structure over input variables X without including latent variables in condition sets. It recursively updates an auxiliary graph GX to build the structure, ensuring conditional dependencies between input variables are preserved. If the maximal indegree of GX is below n + 1, the algorithm exits. The Recursive Latent Structure Learning algorithm (Algorithm 2) constructs a latent structure over input variables X by recursively updating an auxiliary graph GX. The algorithm uses conditional independence tests to disconnect variables in two steps, first testing dependency between exogenous nodes Xex and X, then within X itself. Remaining edges are directed using specific rules. The Recursive Latent Structure Learning algorithm constructs a latent structure over input variables by identifying v-structures and continually directing edges to increase graph resolution. The SplitAutonomous function identifies autonomous sets in a graph by recursively constructing latent structures for ancestor and descendant sets. The Recursive Latent Structure Learning algorithm constructs a latent structure over input variables by identifying v-structures and directing edges to increase graph resolution. Each recursive call returns a latent structure for autonomous sets, introducing latent variables as parents of the layers. A stochastic inverse G Inv is constructed by inverting edge directions and adding bi-directional edges between latents. The Recursive Latent Structure Learning algorithm constructs a latent structure over input variables by identifying v-structures and directing edges to increase graph resolution. A discriminative structure G D is then constructed by removing bi-directional edges and adding the class node Y as a common child of the last latent layer. A neural network is built based on the connectivity of G D, replacing latent nodes with neurons and edges with bipartite graphs. Recent studies focus on automating design space exploration through hyperparameter optimization. BID34 and BID47 learn RNN network topology by introducing structural parameters and optimizing them with model weights using gradient descent methods. BID56 (NAS) uses a controller-RNN to find optimal layer configurations for a \"trainee network\" based on hyper-parameters. This approach, while effective for large-scale problems like Imagenet, incurs high computational costs. BID57 later addresses the same issue with a hierarchical NAS approach for designing network modules on a smaller scale. BID57 proposes a hierarchical approach using NAS to design network modules on a small-scale dataset (CIFAR-10) and transfer this knowledge to a large-scale problem. BID39 introduces a language for representing complex search-spaces over architectures and hyperparameters as a tree, utilizing methods like MCTS or SMBO for traversal. Smithson et al. present a multi-objective design space exploration considering classification accuracy and computational cost, using a Response Surface Model to predict accuracy at lower cost. Recent studies have focused on architecture search using evolutionary strategies and supervised structure learning, which require significant compute resources. The quality of learned structures is evaluated based on classification accuracy and network size across various benchmarks. These experiments were repeated five times for accuracy assessment.
