    "content": "The Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 brought significant changes to officer training and career development by establishing a joint management system. This system includes Joint Professional Military Education (JPME), Joint Duty Assignment List (JDAL), Joint Specialty Officer (JSO) designation, and joint promotion criteria. The report focuses on JPME requirements in the context of the Act's reforms, discussing its implementation and evolution over the past 30 years. Stakeholders' concerns and issues with JPME are also highlighted for Congress's consideration during the Act's review. The Army Industrial College was established in 1924 to educate officers in mobilization, supply, and industrial support. During World War II, the need for officers trained in joint operations led to the creation of the Army-Navy Staff College in 1943. General Henry H. \"Hap\" Arnold outlined the purpose of this War College as training selected officers for joint and combined operations. The National War College, established in 1946, aims to train officers for unified command, develop effective military strategies, and disseminate lessons learned. Other institutions like the Armed Forces Staff College provide joint operational instruction to mid-grade officers. During the Cold War era, military officers showed little enthusiasm for joint education and assignments, despite the availability of joint courses at institutions like the National War College, ICAF, and AFSC. In 1981, only a small percentage of officers had attended these joint courses, with some believing that joint commitments could hinder career advancement by diverting focus from service-specific education and assignments. In the early 1980s, concerns arose about the Department of Defense's ability to execute joint military operations, leading to a push for greater incentives for top personnel to take on joint roles. This effort culminated in the 1986 Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act, which mandated training and operating in a joint environment for all services. The Goldwater-Nichols Act established requirements for joint officer management, focusing on improving quality, experience, and education. Completion of JPME requirements and joint duty assignments could lead to designation as a joint specialty officer, incentivizing officers to qualify. Designation as a JSO signified proficiency in joint matters, emphasizing effective management of officers trained in joint operations. The Goldwater-Nichols Act defined \"joint matters\" as integrated land, sea, and air forces employment. JPME requirements included completion of a program before joint qualification or assignment to a joint duty position. Education requirements included attendance at a Capstone Course for new generals and flag officers, curriculum review by the Secretary of Defense, and strengthening joint focus in service schools. The Skelton Panel was appointed to review Department of Defense plans for implementing joint professional military education requirements of the Goldwater-Nichols Act. Representative Ike Skelton chaired the panel, which held 28 hearings and published its final report between 1987 and 1989. The Skelton Panel, appointed to review joint professional military education requirements, recommended a two-phase Joint Specialist Officer education process in service colleges and the Armed Forces Staff College. This recommendation was integrated into the FY1990-1991 NDAA as a statement of congressional policy, emphasizing hands-on exercises at AFSC. Exceptions for sequential instruction were allowed for compelling reasons. The FY1990-1991 NDAA mandated a minimum three-month course at AFSC for joint professional military education. Changes have allowed for distance learning, accredited master's degrees, and more flexibility in career paths. The FY1994 NDAA emphasized the role of military schools in providing PME and JPME. The FY1994 NDAA emphasized the role of military schools in providing professional military education for officers in their warfare specialties and integrated employment of land, sea, and air forces under unified command. It also allowed the National Defense University to confer masters of science degrees in national security strategy and national resource strategy. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 required an independent study of Joint Officer Management (JOM) and Joint Professional Military Education (JPME) to assess their ability to meet future demands. The study focused on reviewing the sequencing of JPME and joint duty assignments, assessing the utility of officers in joint billets after JPME, and making recommendations for improvement. The independent study by Booz Allen Hamilton assessed the need to update practice, policy, and law regarding joint officer management and JPME to meet future demands. The Government Accountability Office recommended that DOD develop a strategic approach to officer development in joint matters. The RAND Corporation recommended a strategic human resource approach for joint officer management, linking positions to joint education and experience, and managing officer career paths. The Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 required DOD to develop a strategic plan for joint officer management and JPME to ensure sufficient qualified officers. The FY2005 NDAA required the Secretary of Defense to submit a plan for joint officer management and JPME to Congress by January 15, 2006. The plan needed to address issues like promotion eligibility linked to JPME completion, incentives for completing JPME, entrance exams for JPME schools, enrolling private-sector civilians at NDU, and joint specialty qualification for reserve component officers. The FY2005 NDAA established new requirements for joint professional military education (JPME), including Phase I, Phase II, and the Capstone Course. DOD submitted a strategic plan to Congress in 2006, emphasizing joint experience for qualification. Congress modified joint officer management in the NDAA for FY2007. In response to the FY2007 NDAA, DOD implemented a new Joint Qualification System (JQS) with four levels of qualification and dual tracks for earning joint qualifications. Officers are no longer required to complete JPME I and II before a joint duty assignment. The Secretary of Defense can waive JPME for officers below the grade of O-7. The Secretary of Defense can waive JPME for officers below the grade of O-7 if they have completed two full tours in a joint duty assignment. The legislation clarified that NDU includes the National War College, the Industrial College of the Armed Forces, and the Joint Forces Staff College. In April 2010, the House Armed Services Committee released findings on Professional Military Education, including JPME. The House Armed Services Committee found that due to the removal of the statutory requirement for JPME before joint duty assignments, there were concerns about the qualifications of officers in JDAL positions. Many officers in these positions were too junior to have completed JPME I. JPME II was also found to have low preparatory value, with completion and demand for JPME being more tied to promotion potential than developing required competencies for joint duty assignments. The JPME model for developing joint officers focuses on building generalists and lacks specific joint competencies. There is a need for joint subject matter to be taught at the primary level. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 expanded how joint assignments and experience could be determined. Section 521 revised the definition of joint matters to include integrated military forces from multiple departments. In the past five years, Congress has made minor changes to Joint Professional Military Education (JPME). Section 552 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 authorized a pilot program for JPME II instruction at two combatant commands, including the Joint Special Operations University (JSOU) at MacDill Air Force Base. This program allows credit for completion of JPME I at the National Defense Intelligence College. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 amended 10 U.S.C. \u00a72154 to authorize senior level service courses of at least 10 months for JPME II. This provides flexibility to DOD in completing JPME II coursework. Joint Specialty Officers are trained in joint matters related to unified action by multiple military forces in operations across domains. The curr_chunk discusses the achievement of unified action by multiple military forces in various domains and includes national military strategy, strategic planning, command and control, and combined operations with allied nations. The Senate-passed FY2016 NDAA added acquisition matters to joint duties, allowing officers to pursue a dual career track in combat arms and acquisition fields. The curr_chunk discusses concerns about joint professional military education and a review of the Department of Defense's structure and efficiency in the context of GNA reforms. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter announced the review in December 2015, with key questions outlined in a DOD memorandum dated January 4, 2016. The review will consider adjustments to the joint officer management system to meet joint warfighting requirements. The Department of Defense is conducting a review of joint professional military education to address concerns about meeting joint warfighting requirements. Questions have been raised about faculty qualifications, curriculum adequacy, and the balance between professional development and specialized expertise. Potential policy changes and legislative proposals may result from this review. The review of joint professional military education is addressing concerns about curriculum, delivery methods, and the role of JPME in career management. Questions include the appropriate mix of students, coordination between institutions, and the balance between service-centric PME and JPME. Considerations also include tying JPME completion to officer promotion and determining JPME requirements for Reserve Component members. The review of joint professional military education is examining the balance between joint experience and joint education for joint officer qualification. Congress may need to consider these issues during the GNA review and future legislative initiatives."
