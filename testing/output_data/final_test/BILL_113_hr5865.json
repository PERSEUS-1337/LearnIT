    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Camera Authorization and Maintenance Act of 2014\" or the \"CAM Act of 2014.\" It requires the use of body-worn camera systems. Beginning 180 days after enactment, states or local governments receiving grants from the Attorney General must mandate law enforcement officers to use body-worn cameras or risk losing funding in the following fiscal year. The Attorney General can grant waivers for financial hardships. Definitions follow in accordance with the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. SEC. 3. BODY-WORN CAMERA GRANTS. Title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended to include a new part for body-worn camera grants. Grants can be awarded to States, local governments, and Indian tribes for acquiring, operating, and maintaining body-worn cameras for law enforcement officers. The funds must be used for the specified program. The program described in this section requires law enforcement officers to wear body-worn cameras in certain circumstances, such as regular contact with the public or specific activities like SWAT operations. Cameras should be worn on the officer's chest or at eye level. The policy requires officers to activate body-worn cameras during all law enforcement-related activities while on duty, including traffic stops, arrests, searches, interrogations, investigations, and pursuits. Officers must also note the recording in official reports and provide reasoning if they fail to record a required activity. The policy mandates officers to activate body-worn cameras during all law enforcement activities, informing individuals being recorded unless unsafe, impractical, or impossible. Cameras must remain on until the incident concludes or authorized by a supervisor. Officers are responsible for downloading data, except in specific circumstances like officer-involved shootings or in-custody deaths. The policy requires officers to download data from body-worn cameras after each shift. Videos must be categorized and tagged based on the type of event captured. Grantees must create an audit system to monitor access to recorded data and may conduct forensic reviews for tampering. When setting time frames for data retention, grantees must consider state laws, departmental policies, public disclosure laws, transparency needs, complaint investigation times, and data storage capacity. Data must be managed by a reputable third party vendor for security and integrity. The grantee must use a reputable vendor, sign a legal contract to protect data, ensure system has audit trail and backup, consult legal advisors. Officers can review video footage before making a statement. Grantee's internal audit unit should review body-worn camera footage. Policies must prevent unauthorized access to recorded data. The grantee must have clear protocols for releasing recorded data, provide body-worn camera training for personnel, collect statistical data on camera usage, and conduct periodic reviews of policies. Funds under this part are allocated to local governments with fewer than 100,000 residents, with any remaining funds distributed to other qualifying applicants. The federal share of program costs cannot exceed 50%, and the non-federal share can be provided in cash or in-kind. Establishment of Task Force on Community Policing and Body Camera Accountability. Task force established in the Department of Justice to provide recommendations on community policing, body-worn camera training protocol, and citizen review boards for investigating police misconduct. Membership includes civil rights organizations, law enforcement personnel, and community policing experts. Report due to Congress by April 2015. The task force established by the Department of Justice will conduct a survey to evaluate the effectiveness of body camera requirements in investigating police misconduct cases, with findings to be reported to Congress within a year. GAO will report on the Pentagon's 1033 program within 90 days of the Act's enactment, detailing equipment distribution, value, officer training, and equipment usage in jurisdictions."
