The Congress acknowledges the close relationship between local prosecutors and law enforcement officers in grand jury investigations, leading to public suspicion of preferential treatment for accused police officers. Police officers have the right to testify before grand juries without thorough cross-examination, as these proceedings are secret by law. The secretive grand jury process historically favors law enforcement officers, leading to public distrust. Recent cases involving the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner ended with no indictments for the officers involved, further eroding confidence in the justice system. Preliminary hearings are often skipped in favor of direct presentments by prosecutors.
