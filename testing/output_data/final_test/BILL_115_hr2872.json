    "content": "The Act titled \"Promoting Hydropower Development at Existing Nonpowered Dams Act\" seeks to amend the Federal Power Act by adding a section to promote hydropower development at existing nonpowered dams. The Act aims to expedite the licensing process for non-federal hydropower projects at existing nonpowered dams by allowing the Commission to issue licenses and permits for qualifying facilities. An expedited process will be established within 180 days, with an interagency task force coordinating regulatory processes. The Commission will ensure a final decision on a license application for a qualifying facility within 2 years. Before issuing a license, dam safety assessments for existing non-Federal structures related to the facility will be conducted. Commission's dam safety requirements will apply to qualifying facilities. The Commission's dam safety requirements apply to qualifying facilities and associated nonpowered dams during the license term. Interagency communications for environmental documents and licensing coordination are not considered ex parte communications. The Commission must identify nonpowered dams for hydropower development within 12 months of enactment. The Commission, along with the Secretaries of the Army, Interior, and Agriculture, will develop a list of nonpowered Federal dams with potential for non-Federal hydropower development. Considerations include compatibility with dam purposes, proximity to transmission resources, existing environmental studies, and effects of hydropower development. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will develop a list of nonpowered Federal dams suitable for non-Federal hydropower development. The list will be shared with relevant House and Senate committees and made available to the public. Qualifying criteria for facilities will be defined. The facility must meet specific criteria to be considered for nonpowered dam hydropower development, including being associated with a qualifying nonpowered dam, generating electric power, using water from the dam for generation, and not causing significant changes to dam operations. A qualifying nonpowered dam is a barrier constructed before a certain date for various water-related purposes. A qualifying nonpowered dam is a barrier constructed before a certain date for various water-related purposes that is not generating electricity with hydropower generating works licensed under this section. The Federal Power Act is amended to state that a licensee's obligation to pay annual charges begins when construction of the facility starts."
