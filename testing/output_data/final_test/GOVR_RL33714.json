Prices vary across regions and different consumer groups pay different prices based on distribution costs and quantity purchased. Residential consumers are the largest group, purchasing small quantities at higher prices. In 2005, domestic production provided about 83% of natural gas consumption in the U.S., with imports from Canada and LNG accounting for the rest. The reserve base has been growing, with a reserve to production ratio increasing from 8.8 years in 1997 to 10.4 years in 2004. Storage is crucial for meeting peak winter demand. The natural gas industry prepares for winter heating season demand peaks by injecting gas into storage facilities. Weather plays a crucial role in consumption decisions by residential consumers, with home heating being a primary use of natural gas. Aggregate consumption of natural gas in the United States decreased by 4.1% in the first seven months of 2006 compared to 2005. Aggregate natural gas consumption in the United States decreased by 4.1% in the first seven months of 2006 compared to 2005. Residential consumption saw the largest decline in both percentage and volume terms, followed by commercial and industrial demand. Factors contributing to the decrease include price and weather conditions. Average U.S. residential natural gas prices peaked at $14.64 per mcf in the winter of 2005-2006, 57% higher than the average price from 2000-2005. The winter season was warmer than usual, leading to reduced demand in the residential sector. Commercial demand, mainly for space heating, is also expected to be less affected by price changes. Industrial consumption of natural gas is sensitive to price variations and less affected by weather changes compared to residential or commercial consumption. Many domestic industries using natural gas struggle to compete with overseas producers due to cost increases, leading to a decrease in U.S. industrial natural gas consumption. Aggregate dry natural gas production in the United States for the first seven months of 2006 was 2.8% lower than in the comparable period in 2005, with a decrease in U.S. industrial natural gas consumption due to cost increases affecting domestic industries competing with overseas producers. The hurricanes Katrina and Rita disrupted natural gas production and deliveries from the Gulf Coast region, affecting about 6.7 bcf per day or 11% of U.S. consumption. Imports of natural gas from Canada declined by 3.5% in January to July 2006 compared to 2005, while LNG imports mainly came from Trinidad, Nigeria, Algeria, and other nations. Imports of LNG from countries like Trinidad, Nigeria, and Algeria have decreased by 2.7% in the first seven months of 2006. Natural gas consumption in the U.S. follows yearly cycles, with higher demand during the winter heating season and lower in spring and fall. Cold weather spikes consumption, necessitating natural gas storage capacity for withdrawal and replenishment throughout the year. During the summer, interruptions in gas storage injections can occur due to peak electricity demand conditions. The industry aims to maintain an average gas storage inventory of 3.3 to 3.5 tcf at the start of the winter heating season, with a maximum capacity of 3.6 tcf in the U.S. As of December 1, 2006, there were 3.406 tcf of natural gas in storage, exceeding the previous year and the five-year average. The EIA predicts that by the end of the 2006-2007 winter season, stored gas will reach 1.69 tcf, above the five-year average. The high levels of stored gas at the beginning of the 2006-2007 winter heating season suggest a well-supplied market with moderate price levels. Various prices are monitored in the natural gas industry, including spot market prices at the Henry Hub and futures market prices at NYMEX. Different pricing structures exist for producers and consumers, with city gate prices reflecting delivered prices to major markets. Import prices are paid to suppliers delivering natural gas to the United States. The price of natural gas paid to suppliers delivering to the United States has historically been linked to the price of crude oil, but recent factors like political risk have weakened this connection. In 2006, the average wellhead price for natural gas increased by 10.5% compared to 2005, but prices in June and July were lower than the previous year. In 2005, wellhead prices for natural gas were high due to supply disruptions from hurricanes Katrina and Rita. However, in 2006, prices started to decline compared to the previous year. Residential prices did not follow this trend, remaining high during the winter heating season. The EIA projected a 13% decline in natural gas heating costs for the 2006-2007 winter season due to record high prices the previous year. Residential prices continued to rise in June and July 2006, despite wellhead prices starting to stabilize. The widening margin between wellhead and residential prices may prevent consumers from fully benefiting from market changes. Commercial natural gas prices were lower than residential prices and slowly decreasing from peak levels. Industrial consumers saw fluctuations in natural gas prices from January to July 2005 and 2006, impacting production processes and heating fuel usage. The natural gas market is regional, leading to different prices worldwide. High natural gas prices can force industries to either accept lower profits or move production overseas to lower costs. Industrial consumption of natural gas in the United States has declined by 22% from 1997 to 2005, leading to potential job losses and increased imports of goods. The relative price structure of natural gas would need to significantly change for firms to consider returning production to the domestic economy. Industrial consumption of natural gas in the US fell by 5.2% in 2006 compared to 2005, with high prices from August to December. Electric power generators also faced high prices during the same period. The demand for natural gas by power generators is derived and may have different effects compared to the industrial sector. The demand for natural gas by electric power generators is derived from electricity demand and investment in generating capacity. Consumers have an inelastic demand for electricity, leading to a similar demand for natural gas by generators. Market forces allow generators to pass cost increases to consumers. Foreign competitors and production facility relocation are limited for electric power generators. Long-term investment decisions for electric power capacity are influenced by natural gas prices. The price of natural gas affects the demand structure for it, with different sectors showing varying levels of price sensitivity. While most sectors have inelastic demand, the industrial sector reduces consumption in response to higher prices. This leads to an aggregate decline in U.S. natural gas consumption, with the EIA projecting a tightening market in 2007. The EIA projects a tightening natural gas market in 2007 with an expected increase in aggregate consumption by 2.9%. Consumption by electric power generators is expected to decline by 2.3% from 2006 levels. U.S. production of natural gas is projected to increase by 0.8% in 2007, with imports of LNG from Africa expected to rise by 41%. The report suggests lower natural gas prices and heating costs for the winter 2006-2007 season, but this projection is dependent on various conditions. Weather is a key factor in determining natural gas consumption. The EIA projects a tightening natural gas market in 2007 with an expected increase in aggregate consumption by 2.9%. Weather is a key factor in determining natural gas consumption, with cold weather affecting prices. If NOAA weather forecast overestimates temperatures, gas prices could rise. The EIA's research shows a significant relationship between oil prices and natural gas prices at the Henry Hub. A temporary 20% increase in WTI leads to a 5% immediate rise in natural gas prices, declining to 2% in two months. A permanent 20% increase in WTI results in a 16% increase in natural gas prices one year later. The decline in oil prices in 2006 contributed to lower natural gas prices, possibly due to reduced political tensions in the Middle East. The Middle East and Persian Gulf regions are politically volatile, affecting oil prices. Futures prices for natural gas on NYMEX may impact commodity prices on Henry Hub. Increased interest in long positions by financial traders could raise natural gas futures prices. However, the market was reported as \"over-bought\" in late October, suggesting a potential sell-off and downward pressure on natural gas prices. The EIA STEWFO predicts reduced natural gas heating costs for residential consumers in the winter of 2006-2007 due to rising consumption and falling prices. Analysts believe the price of natural gas has already peaked for the season, with market fundamentals indicating a weakening price. Industrial consumption is decreasing, contributing to overall reduced consumption. However, the volatile nature of natural gas prices in recent years may lead to over or underestimation by the STEWFO."
