The Washita Battlefield National Historic Site Act of 1995 establishes the Washita Battlefield National Historic Site. The purpose of this act is to preserve the historical significance of the site. The Congress finds that the Battle of the Washita in 1868 was a significant engagement between Plains tribes and the US Army, led by Lt. Colonel Custer. The attack resulted in over 150 Indian casualties, symbolizing the tribes' struggle to maintain their traditional lifeways. The Washita battle site remains intact, with the Cheyenne village site largely unaltered. The Cheyenne village site at the Battle of the Washita has not been significantly altered except by periodic flooding of the Washita River. The purpose of establishing the site as a national historic site is to recognize its importance in frontier military history and the struggles of Southern Great Plains tribes to maintain control of their traditional areas. This also provides opportunities for American Indian groups, including the Cheyenne-Arapaho Tribe, to be involved in educational programs and plans for the site. SEC. 203. ESTABLISHMENT.
