    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Diabetic Retinopathy Prevention Act of 2005\". The Congress finds that Type 2 Diabetes affects 17,000,000 Americans, costing the nation $138 billion per year. Diabetic retinopathy, the most common complication of diabetes, leads to visual degradation and blindness, affecting up to 24,000 diabetics annually. The risk of diabetic retinopathy increases with the duration of diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy prevalence increases with diabetes duration. Early detection and treatment can reduce vision loss by 90%. Remote assessment has potential to reach underserved diabetic patients. Medicare coverage is expanded to include remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy, defined in the Social Security Act. This allows for early detection and treatment to reduce vision loss in diabetic patients. The term 'remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy' refers to a diagnostic examination of the retina for early detection of diabetic retinopathy, provided annually to individuals with diabetes. The examination must meet technical standards set by the Secretary and be conducted via a telecommunications system by qualified healthcare professionals. The Act allows for remote assessments of diabetic retinopathy to be conducted by qualified healthcare professionals using store-and-forward technologies, under the supervision of a board-certified ophthalmologist with retinal fellowship training. This is applicable despite any limitations in the Social Security Act, and interim payment is allowed until the final rule is published. The Act allows for remote assessments of diabetic retinopathy by healthcare professionals using store-and-forward technologies. Interim payment is permitted until the final rule is published. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study on costs incurred by providers for these services. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress on the study conducted on the per-patient cost and start-up/administrative costs of remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy. Recommendations will be made on reimbursements under Medicare and the need for repeating the study. The amendments will apply to assessments performed 30 days after the enactment of the Act. Medicaid will cover remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy. Medicaid will cover remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy, with the amendment applying to assessments performed after the enactment of the Act. State plans needing legislation to comply with the new requirement will not be penalized for not meeting it immediately. State plans must comply with new requirements for Medicaid coverage of remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy by the first day of the first calendar quarter after the state legislature's regular session following the enactment of the Act. Each year of a 2-year legislative session is considered a separate regular session. SEC. 5. MOBILE DIABETIC RETINOPATHY SCREENING PILOT PROGRAM. Amends Title III of the Public Health Service Act to establish a Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program. The Secretary will establish a grant program called the 'Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program' to fund 5 eligible entities for mobile diabetic retinopathy screening programs. Grants cannot exceed $1,000,000 per year, and entities must use the funds for project implementation. Applications must be submitted within 90 days of funds availability. The Secretary will publish a notice for grant applications under the 'Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program'. Priority will be given to applicants with experience in diabetic retinopathy evaluation using telecommunications equipment and those serving rural, impoverished, minority, and remote populations. The Secretary must notify Congress at least 3 days before granting funds for the Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program. An advisory committee will evaluate the program's effectiveness in detecting diabetic retinopathy early and implementing preventive measures. The advisory committee will evaluate the effectiveness of the Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program in detecting and preventing diabetic retinopathy. The report will be submitted to Congress within 54 months of the first grant. The advisory committee, eligible entities, and mobile diabetic retinopathy screening program are defined in the legislation. Eligible entities include hospitals, states, educational institutions, local governments, tribal governments, nonprofit health organizations, and community health centers. The mobile diabetic retinopathy screening program offers remote assessment for patients primarily residing in rural areas. The Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program is defined in the legislation as a program for remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy in patients residing in rural, underserved, and remote areas. The Program is mobile and authorized appropriations of $5,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2006 to 2010."
