The gift tax exemption was limited to $1 million. EGTRRA planned to eliminate the estate tax in 2010 but retained the gift tax with its $1 million exemption. It also allowed for a carryover of basis for inherited assets, changing how heirs would be taxed on gains from asset sales. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Act of 2001 (EGTRRA) gradually reduced the estate tax, raising the exemption from $675,000 in 2001 to $3.5 million in 2009 with a top tax rate decrease from 55% to 45%. The provision has a $1.3 million exemption for gain (plus $3 million for a spouse). The tax revisions expire in 2011, returning the tax provisions to their pre-EGTRRA levels. The carryover basis provision effective in 2010 would be eliminated. President Obama proposed a permanent extension of the 2009 rules (a $3.5 million exemption and a 45% tax rate). The House provided for a permanent extension of estate tax rules in 2009 with a 45% tax rate. Senate proposed alternatives such as a 35% tax rate and a $5 million exemption. A temporary extension in 2010 included a $5 million exemption, a 35% rate, and inheritance of unused spousal exemptions. At the end of 2012, without legislation, provisions will revert. President Obama has proposed reforms to address abuses and tax avoidance in estate and gift tax laws. One proposal focuses on reforming the Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT) included in H.R. 4849. The report compares different alternatives for exemptions and tax rates, analyzing policy effects such as revenue, distribution, savings, charitable contributions, and compliance. Other aspects considered include indexing exemptions for inflation. The proposals address exemptions indexed for inflation, inheritance of exemptions for spouses, and perceived abuses in estate tax laws. In 2010, there is no estate tax but a gift tax remains, with a tax on gains accumulated during the decedent's lifetime. An election can be made for 2010 to apply either 2010 or 2011 rules, with some estates having lower tax liability by electing the 2011 rules. The estate and gift tax is unified, combining assets transferred as gifts during a person's lifetime with those transferred at death. The estate and gift tax is unified, combining assets transferred as gifts during a person's lifetime with those transferred at death. The tax is imposed on the decedent's estate and the rate structure applies to total bequests and gifts given. The exemptions differed in 2009, with a combined exemption of $3.5 million and a gift tax exemption of $1 million. The combined exemption for 2011 and 2012 is $5 million, applying to gifts as well. In 2013, the combined exemption will be $1 million. The estate tax rates were 45% in 2009 and will be 35% in 2011-2012. In 2013, without new legislation, rates will range from 41% to 53% for taxable estate amounts between $1 million and $3 million. There is also a 5% surtax for very large estates, resulting in a flat 55% rate. Annual gifts of $13,000 per recipient are exempt from taxes, and the exemption is indexed for inflation. The gift tax exemption is indexed for inflation in $1,000 increments. A generation skipping tax is imposed to address estate tax avoidance through gifts and bequests to a later generation. Estates can exempt assets from the estate tax and take deductions for selected transfers. Transfers between spouses are exempt, as well as deductions for charitable contributions and administrative expenses. A deduction for state estate taxes was phased out in 2001 legislation. In 2011 and 2012, a spouse can inherit any unused exemption. The estate tax exemption can be shared between spouses, benefiting small businesses with provisions like installment payments, special use valuation, and minority discounts. Small businesses can defer payment for five years and pay in installments over 10 years, with a total delay in full payment of 14 years. The estate tax exemption can benefit small businesses with provisions like installment payments, special use valuation, and minority discounts. Small businesses can defer payment for five years and pay in installments over 10 years, with a total delay in full payment of 14 years. The benefit is allowed for the business portion of assets if 35% of the estate is in a farm or closely held business. Small businesses can value their assets at use as a farm or business, allowing a reduction in the estate value of up to $1 million. Heirs must continue to use the farm or business for 10 years. Conservation easements can also benefit farmers and landowners, with a reduction in value and an exclusion of up to 40% of the restricted value of the land, capped at $500,000. The Qualified Family Owned Business Income (QFOBI) deduction allowed estates with at least half of their assets in a family business to take a deduction for these business assets. The provision originally allowed up to $675,000 of business deductions with an overall cap of $1.3 million. If the 2001 tax cuts sunset in 2013, the exemption will become $1 million and QFOBI will be relevant again, allowing an additional $300,000 exemption. To qualify for the QFOBI deduction, heirs must continue the business for 10 years or repay the tax savings. The step-up in basis rule allows heirs to use the value of assets at the date of the decedent's death for capital gains tax purposes, avoiding tax on appreciation during the decedent's lifetime. This rule does not apply to gifts, where carryover basis is used, resulting in both the donor's and donee's gains being taxed. Bequests are also not eligible for the step-up rule. The taxation of gifts and bequests differs in terms of basis rules and tax treatment. Gifts do not benefit from the step-up in basis, with the donor's basis being the original cost of the assets. Gift tax is tax exclusive, while estate tax is tax inclusive. For example, a 50% tax rate on a $1 million gift would cost $1.5 million. The gift tax rate is 50%, costing $0.5 million on a $1 million gift. To provide a net amount of $1 million for a bequest, $2 million is required, with a tax of $1 million. The gift tax rate equivalents for estate tax rates of 55%, 45%, and 35% are 35%, 31%, and 26% respectively. The exemption levels for estate tax in 2009, 2011, and 2012 were $3.5 million and $5 million. The exemption will revert to $1 million in 2013 unless the statute changes. The estate tax exemption levels mentioned are $3.5 million and $5 million. The rate for estate tax will return to 55% in 2013, with rates of 45% in 2009 and 35% in 2011-2012. There are proposals to apply the capital gains tax rate or a multiple of it. Another issue is whether to index the exemption for inflation, as a fixed exemption causes more estates to be subject to tax over time. Congress may need to reconsider the exemption periodically. Additionally, there is a potential carryforward of an unused estate tax exemption to the surviving spouse. The recent legislation allows spouses to inherit unused estate tax exemptions, potentially reducing the estate subject to tax when the second spouse dies. There are proposals to increase special use valuations and conservation easements. The curr_chunk discusses proposals to restrict certain estate tax practices, such as limiting special use valuations and conservation easements, addressing abuses, and requiring fair market value for estate tax and basis determination. Data, evidence, and economic theory are crucial in revising the estate tax. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of estate tax on the population, revenue yield, family businesses, savings, administration, compliance, and charitable giving. Different options are compared in this context, while some oppose the tax philosophically. Arguments include the view that estate tax is a death tax and assets are already taxed under income tax. Gale and Slemrod highlight the complexity of these arguments. The estate tax brings potential tax benefits through the forgiveness of tax on unrealized gains. Supporters believe it is important to limit wealth accumulation across generations. Empirical evidence shows the tax is highly progressive, but the debate on taxing large amounts of wealth to reduce inequality is a value judgment. The estate tax has only affected a small fraction of decedents. Restoring the $1 million exemption would result in less than 2% of decedents paying the estate tax, while a $3.5 million exemption would lead to a quarter of 1% paying the tax. A $5 million exemption would reduce the share to 0.14%. Indexing for inflation shows that real asset growth increases the number of decedents paying the tax. The $3.5 million and $5 million exemptions would exclude the majority of estates from the tax, regardless of indexing. The estate tax provisions aim to balance revenue costs, with concerns about revenue losses despite the small share of total federal revenues. Keeping the 2009 rules in place retroactively to 2010 would result in a revenue gain compared to no estate tax, but subsequent years with larger estate tax provisions would lead to revenue losses. Receipts are delayed due to the filing of estate tax returns. The delay in filing estate tax returns has led to varying estimates of revenue gains and losses over a 10-year period. The Joint Committee on Taxation projected gains of $0.5 billion in FY2010, increasing to $38 billion in FY2019, totaling $234 billion with the 2009 exemptions. Treasury's estimates show smaller gains in the first two fiscal years, turning into a $28 billion loss by FY2019, totaling $171 billion over 10 years. Different exemption levels also impact revenue, with estimates ranging from $34.4 billion for a $1 million exemption to $18.2 billion for a $3.5 million exemption. In 2010, the estate tax liability for a $3.5 million exemption with a 45% rate is $16.3 billion, while a $5 million exemption with a 45% rate incurs a total of $26.2 billion. The cost increases over time due to the growth in wealth, with the reduction in tax increasing from $16.3 billion in 2011 to $30.7 billion in 2019. Indexing exemptions does not have a significant impact on revenue over time, as real growth in wealth plays a more crucial role. The estate tax liability for a $3.5 million exemption with a 45% rate is $16.3 billion, while a $5 million exemption with a 45% rate incurs $26.2 billion. The difference between the two proposals discussed in the 111th Congress would cost $46 billion over two years, with the Joint Committee on Taxation estimating the estate tax revisions at $68 billion. The increase in the gift tax exemption and ability to inherit exemptions contribute to the higher cost estimates. Moving from a $1 million to a $3.5 million exemption results in a larger revenue loss than changing the tax rate from 45% to 35%. Similarly, increasing the exemption from $1 million to $5 million costs less than lowering the rate to 35%. However, transitioning from a $3.5 million exemption and 45% rate to a $5 million exemption or 35% rate incurs similar costs. Rate reductions benefit wealthier estates more than exemptions, reducing the estate tax's progressivity. The estate tax aims to tax high-income and high-wealth taxpayers to contribute to tax system progressivity. Alternative proposals affect estate size coverage and tax distribution, with smaller estates making up the majority. With a $1 million exemption, nearly 80% of taxed estates have assets under $3.5 million. The estate tax aims to tax high-income and high-wealth taxpayers to contribute to tax system progressivity. With a $3.5 million or $5 million exemption, smaller estates would be eliminated from estate tax coverage. Revenue from the estate tax is more concentrated in larger estates, with the $20 million and above class paying the largest share regardless of the exemption amount. The estate tax primarily targets high-wealth families, with over half of the revenue collected from estates worth $20 million or more. Despite high statutory tax rates, the effective tax rate is lower due to exemptions. For example, a $10 million estate with a $3.5 million exemption would only be taxed on $6.5 million, resulting in a 29.5% tax rate. Effective tax rates average less than 20% for estates up to $20 million, increasing with estate size as the exemption becomes a smaller share of the estate. The estate tax rates vary based on exemptions, with lower effective rates for larger estates. Distributional analyses show that the tax is concentrated in higher income classes, with 83% falling in the top quintile for a $1 million exemption. The estate tax is highly progressive, with 83% of the tax falling in the top quintile for a $1 million exemption and 96% for a $3.5 million exemption. The impact on small businesses and farms has been a key issue in the debate, with concerns that families may have to sell businesses to pay the tax due to lack of liquid assets. Farm assets account for 2.4% and business assets for 17.9% of assets reported on estate tax returns. The estate tax is highly progressive, with a majority of the tax falling in the top quintile for different exemption levels. Concerns about the impact on small businesses and farms have been raised, with evidence showing that taxable business estates are a small portion of all taxable estates. Data suggests that estates with business assets make up a higher share of the estate tax compared to the number of taxable estates, indicating a concentration of business assets in larger estates. The effective tax rates for small business returns are somewhat lower, suggesting discounts may be important. The CBO study examined farmer estates and estates taking the QFOBI exemption in 2000. The analysis in Table 10 projects the distribution of estate sizes for 2011 based on an average annual growth rate of 3.5% for 11 years. It shows that farm estates subject to tax would be less than 123 at a $3.5 million exemption and about 65 at a $5 million exemption, accounting for 2% of all taxable estates. Additionally, only 2% to 2.5% of all taxable estate returns claim the QFOBI exemption. Table 11 examines the likelihood of estates having insufficient liquid assets to pay taxes. The analysis shows that farm estates subject to tax would be less than 123 at a $3.5 million exemption and about 65 at a $5 million exemption, accounting for 2% of all taxable estates. Additionally, only 2% to 2.5% of all taxable estate returns claim the QFOBI exemption. There were 138 farm estates with insufficient liquid assets for the $1 million exemption, and 62 at the $3.5 million exemption and 41 at the $5 million exemption for estates claiming the QFOBI deduction. Farm estates were estimated to pay $683 million in estate taxes in 2009, just under 4% of total estate tax liability. The evidence suggests that businesses pay a small fraction of the estate tax, and only a tiny fraction of total estates of businesses and farmers are liable for the tax. Some argue that the estate tax leads to reduced savings, but there is no clear basis for this claim. If the bequest motive is to leave assets to heirs, the estate tax could discourage saving. An alternative approach could be to provide additional benefits for business assets, like an expanded QFOBI deduction. The estate tax could affect savings in different ways, leading to less saving due to increased cost of gifting to children or more saving to retain assets after tax payment. The theoretical prediction on savings is ambiguous, with no clear empirical evidence available. Kopczuk and Slemrod's study on wealth elasticity of estates showed fragile results dependent on model specification. The estate tax could impact savings in various ways, with uncertain effects on savings due to increased gifting costs or asset retention after tax payment. Holtz-Eakin and Smith estimated a $1.6 trillion decrease in wealth from the estate tax, projecting an increase in small business capital and hiring. The study's findings suggest a significant impact of estate taxes on savings, similar to capital income taxes. Eliminating capital income taxes could potentially increase wealth by $40 trillion, doubling the total U.S. capital stock. However, estimates vary, with some suggesting a smaller increase due to feedback effects from the economy. The feedback effect from an infinitely elastic response limits the impact of expanding the capital stock on pre-tax returns. Repealing the estate tax may have a small effect on savings due to the tax yield being small. The tax rate is more crucial than the exemption in determining positive effects on savings. Higher exemptions are less likely to impact the income effect. The estate tax has a small effect on savings, with higher exemptions being less likely to increase savings. Empirical evidence shows a significant response of charitable bequests to the estate tax, but overall charitable giving is projected to decrease by 1-2% with higher exemptions and lower tax rates. Only a small percentage of charitable giving is affected by the estate tax. The estate tax has implications for higher education and compliance costs. Gale and Slemrod suggest that administrative costs are around 7% of revenues, mainly due to planning and compliance. Proposed revisions include portability of the spousal exemption and changes to trust rules. Transfers between spouses are exempt from the estate tax. The estate tax exemption may not benefit a person who transfers their entire estate to a spouse, as it could result in a larger portion of the estate being subject to tax. Estate planning options like credit shelter trusts can help address this issue but may involve complex planning and asset transfers between spouses. allowing a spouse to inherit any unused portion of the exemption could be a simpler solution. Portability of the estate tax exemption allows a spouse to inherit any unused portion, resulting in a total exemption of $7 million for the surviving spouse. While beneficial for assets like pension rights, it may decrease revenue in the long run if made permanent. Portability of the estate tax exemption allows a spouse to inherit any unused portion, resulting in a total exemption of $7 million for the surviving spouse. This provision may benefit smaller estates where transfers and planning are more challenging. Complications arise with second marriages, as the inheritance rules for remarriage and multiple inheritances need clarification. The 2011 provision allows multiple inheritances but limits the exclusion to the last predeceased spouse. The provision allows multiple inheritances but limits the exclusion to the last predeceased spouse, affecting total exclusions in second marriages. Questions arise regarding the value of the inherited exemption and the need for estate tax returns and valuation. The portability rule allows the exemption to exceed the estate value, but a declaration must be made on the estate return for the exemption to be transferred. Complications arise in reconstructing fair market value if the first estate tax return is not filed. A Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT) allows the grantor to receive an annuity, with remaining assets transferred to the trust recipient, reducing the value of the gift. The Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT) allows the grantor to receive an annuity, with remaining assets transferred to the trust recipient, reducing the value of the gift. The trust assets must appreciate faster than the annuity discount rate for a tax-free transfer, with a minimum annuity term of 10 years proposed to raise $3 billion over 10 years. The proposal aims to raise $3 billion over 10 years by restricting estate actions that artificially reduce value. Family partnerships have been used to lower fair market value, allowing for discounts even on cash assets. The Administration's proposal would prevent certain actions from allowing discounts, estimated to generate $18.7 billion over 10 years. Additionally, a provision in the budget would address low valuations for estates and high valuations for heirs' assets. The Administration's budget proposal aims to raise $3 billion over 10 years by requiring the estate tax value to remain the same. The estate tax is relatively small in revenues, coverage, and effects on family businesses, savings, and charitable contributions. Only a small percentage of estates and family businesses are expected to be subject to tax under the proposed exemptions. The majority of the tax falls on estates of $20 million or more, which constitute a very small percentage of decedents. The estate tax primarily affects estates of $20 million or more, with only a small percentage of decedents subject to tax. The tax falls mainly on the top income distribution, with uncertain effects on savings. Increasing the exemption to $3.5 million could impact charitable contributions. Transfers between spouses are exempt, allowing for a combined couples' exemption and simplifying estate planning, but may lead to revenue loss and administrative complications. Various provisions to address perceived abuses are being considered. The estate tax primarily affects estates of $20 million or more, with uncertain effects on savings. Increasing the exemption to $3.5 million could impact charitable contributions. Transfers between spouses are exempt, allowing for a combined couples' exemption and simplifying estate planning. One important provision to address perceived abuses is related to the use of discounts in family partnerships."
