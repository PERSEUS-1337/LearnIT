    "title": "AB 2899",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1197.1 of the Labor Code is amended to impose penalties on employers who pay employees less than the minimum wage set by state or local laws. The penalties include civil fines, restitution of wages, and liquidated damages for intentional violations. For subsequent violations of the same specific offense, a fine of $250 per underpaid employee per pay period will be imposed, in addition to recovering underpaid wages, liquidated damages, and penalties. The recovered amounts will be paid to the affected employee. If the Labor Commissioner finds that a person has paid less than the minimum wage, a citation may be issued describing the violation and penalties. The Commissioner will take action to enforce the citation and recover penalties, wages, and damages. If a person wants to challenge a citation or civil penalty, they must notify the Labor Commissioner within 15 business days for an informal hearing. The Commissioner will hold a hearing within 30 days to affirm, modify, or dismiss the citation or penalty. The Labor Commissioner's decision includes a notice of findings, findings, and an order, served to all parties within 15 days after the hearing. Any amount due must be paid within 45 days, and a writ of mandate can be taken to the superior court within 45 days of service. As a condition to filing a petition for a writ of mandate, the petitioner must post a bond with the Labor Commissioner equal to the total amount of minimum wages, liquidated damages, and overtime compensation owed. The bond, issued by an authorized surety, is in favor of unpaid employees and ensures payment. If a decision affirms or modifies the amounts owed, the petitioner must pay the specified items based on the decision. The petitioner must pay the amounts owed for specified items based on the decision or court judgment in a writ of mandate proceeding. If a settlement agreement is reached, the petitioner must pay the agreed amount. If the employer fails to pay minimum wages, liquidated damages, or overtime compensation within 10 days of judgment, a portion of the undertaking shall be forfeited to the employee. A person issued a citation must transmit the specified amount for the violation within 15 business days. When no petition is filed objecting to a citation or proposed assessment, the Labor Commissioner can file a certified copy in the superior court clerk's office for judgment against the assessed person. When findings affirm or modify a citation or assessment, the Labor Commissioner can enter a certified copy in the superior court clerk's office for judgment against the assessed person. The judgment will bear interest and have the same effect as other judgments, with no charge for the service. In jurisdictions where a local entity can issue citations for violations of local minimum wage laws, the Labor Commissioner can also issue citations upon request if the local entity has not already done so. Civil penalties in this section are additional to other penalties. This section does not affect the applicability of local minimum wage laws to any entity."
