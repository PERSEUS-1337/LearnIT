    "content": "Section 221 introduces two new sex trafficking offenses: aggravated sex trafficking and sex trafficking. Aggravated sex trafficking removes the requirement of proving knowledge of the victim's age, while sex trafficking expands federal jurisdiction to cover persuasion to engage in unlawful prostitution regardless of age or coercion. Proposed 18 U.S.C. 2429 condemns recruiting, enticing, harboring, transporting, providing, or obtaining individuals for commercial sex acts. The proposed section 2430 aims to punish sex trafficking involving minors through force, fraud, or coercion, expanding federal authority to cover offenses in interstate or foreign commerce. Offenders would face imprisonment for at least 15 years or life, with a minimum of 10 years for victims aged 14 or older. This proposal mirrors 18 U.S.C. 1591 but focuses on the knowledge of the victim's minority. Section 2430 would cover attempted violations of persuading adults into consensual acts of prostitution affecting interstate commerce, expanding federal jurisdiction beyond actual travel. This proposal does not require the involvement of minors or coercion, unlike other related sections. The proposed amendments to Section 1592 aim to streamline the document-seizure prohibition and expand the coverage of forced labor, similar to Section 1589. The proposed amendments to Section 1592 aim to expand the coverage of forced labor, including obtaining labor or services through abuse of authority or legal process for either labor or commercial sex acts. It also outlaws obtaining labor or services using a threat of financial harm, with offenders facing imprisonment for up to 5 years. Additionally, a new federal offense, arranging sex tourism, would be punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years. Proposed amendments to federal law would make it a crime for Americans to travel abroad for the purpose of engaging in commercial sex acts with children, punishable by up to 30 years in prison. It is currently illegal to engage in such activities for profit, with offenders facing the same maximum penalty. Traveling for adult commercial sex acts is not a federal crime, nor is attempting to travel for child commercial sex acts. The proposed amendments to federal law would criminalize arranging, inducing, or procuring for profit the foreign travel of an American to engage in a commercial sex act with a child. This may raise First Amendment concerns as it criminalizes attempts to induce others to engage in lawful conduct, such as foreign travel for lawful commercial sex acts with adults, even when done for profit. The Sentencing Commission would be tasked with considering adjustments to the Sentencing Guidelines to reflect these new offenses. The proposed amendments to federal law would criminalize arranging, inducing, or procuring for profit the foreign travel of an American to engage in a commercial sex act with a child. This includes prohibiting the use of physical force, threats, corrupt persuasion, or deception to prevent disclosure of information related to federal employment visas or labor laws. Offenders could face imprisonment for up to 20 years for physical force and up to 10 years for other instances. The witness tampering statute prohibits using force, threats, or intimidation to prevent a witness from informing law enforcement about federal crimes. The witness retaliation statute prohibits retaliating against a witness for providing information on federal crimes. The proposed amendments include establishing a cause of action for victims of obstruction of justice offenses and requiring the return of seized property to victims of involuntary servitude and trafficking. The proposed amendments aim to allow the Attorney General to return confiscated property to trafficking victims, even if they were involved in the offense. This could potentially limit victims to only recovering property that was once theirs. The proposed amendments aim to expand the civil cause of action for victims of involuntary servitude and trafficking, with a 10-year statute of limitations. Additionally, amendments to the Victims of Crime Act would impact the Crime Victims Fund, which provides compensation and assistance grants to victims of federal crimes. The proposed amendments aim to expand the civil cause of action for victims of involuntary servitude and trafficking, with a 10-year statute of limitations. Section 222 would establish extraterritorial jurisdiction over various peonage and trafficking offenses when the offender or the victim is an American or when the offender is in the United States. Section 222 establishes extraterritorial jurisdiction over peonage and trafficking offenses involving American victims or offenders in the United States. Proposed Section 1596's application may be challenging if the only connection to the US is the offender's presence there. Prosecution under 18 U.S.C. 1589 for forced labor could be problematic if the offense occurs entirely in another country without American involvement. Subsection 223(a) aims to streamline Section 278 of the Immigration and Nationality Act with minimal changes. The proposal aims to rename the Justice Department's Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section to the Sexual Exploitation and Obscenity Section, expanding its responsibilities to include sex trafficking offenses involving sexually exploited adults. The Section currently prosecutes federal obscenity, child pornography, interstate trafficking for sexual purposes, international sexual child abuse, and international parental kidnapping offenses. The Innocence Lost Initiative, started in 2003 by the Section, FBI, and National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, would be expanded with a proposed amendment to outlaw trafficking in commercial sexual activity across state lines. Requirements for disclosing employment details to foreign workers would be enforced, with penalties for providing false information. Section 1519 of Title 18, United States Code, prohibits the falsification of records to obstruct the proper administration of any matter within a US department or agency. Violations can result in up to 20 years of imprisonment. If not covered by this section, the offense would fall under the general false statement statute, 18 U.S.C. 1001, with penalties of up to 8 years for specific offenses related to sex trafficking or sexual abuse. The Justice Department has proposed amendments to combat trafficking and enforce disclosure requirements for foreign workers. The Justice Department drafted a Model State Anti-Trafficking Criminal Statute in 2004, including suggested language for state criminal laws related to trafficking in persons, involuntary servitude, sexual servitude of a minor, and trafficking for forced labor. Section 224 would direct the Attorney General to provide a similar model reflecting misconduct in involuntary servitude and the Mann Act, assist states in implementation, and report annually on efforts to combat trafficking."
