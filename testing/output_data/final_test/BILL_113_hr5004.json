    "content": "The Act titled \"Multifamily Housing Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2014\" requires a study on the relationship between energy savings improvements and mortgage performance. The Act mandates a study to analyze the impact of energy savings improvements on homes and buildings, including the increase in property value, effects on mortgage default rates, and risks associated with financing energy efficiency improvements. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development must conduct a study on the impact of energy savings improvements on buildings and homes. Data shared or published must not include personally identifiable information. Results of the study will be published on the department's website and submitted to relevant committees within a year of the Act's enactment. Evaluation of departmental procedures and policies to assess energy expenses and benefits of energy savings improvements for homeowners and building owners will be conducted by the Secretary and the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency within 12 months of completing the required study on energy savings improvements. SEC. 3. IMPROVEMENTS TO EXISTING MULTIFAMILY HOUSING ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS. The Secretary will establish a green refinancing program for multifamily housing projects to increase dollar amount limitations by up to 20% for energy conservation measures. Verification of project needs and cost-effective energy efficiency opportunities is required. The green refinancing program for multifamily housing projects aims to increase dollar amount limitations by up to 20% for energy conservation measures. Verification of project needs and cost-effective energy efficiency opportunities is required, with monitoring over the life of the mortgage. The text chunk discusses the financing of solar energy systems and residential energy conservation measures. The Secretary may increase dollar amount limitations for projects with energy conservation measures if they are cost-effective over the life of the measures. The text chunk discusses verifying third-party assessments for energy conservation measures in projects financed under this section. It includes conducting an energy audit, identifying cost-effective opportunities for increasing energy and water efficiency, and ensuring that the installed measures will be cost-effective over their lifespan. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development will issue guidance for implementing energy conservation measures within a 12-month period. An annual report on energy efficiency improvements will be made publicly available. The Department will publish a report on the implementation of amendments related to residential energy conservation measures under the National Housing Act. SEC. 4. MULTIFAMILY HOUSING ENERGY EFFICIENCY INNOVATION. The Multifamily Housing Energy Innovation Plan aims to provide grants to eligible entities to implement energy-saving strategies in multifamily housing, including reducing energy, water, and gas consumption. Eligible entities must submit an application detailing their energy savings plan and goals to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. The Secretary will establish criteria for selecting grant recipients based on experience and capacity, grant funds needed, other funding sources, and compliance with energy savings requirements. The Secretary will prioritize grant applications based on the eligible entity's experience, innovative approach to energy savings, replicability of the plan, and other relevant factors. Additionally, priority will be given to applications with secured funding from private, nonprofit, or government sources. Grant funds can only be used for energy savings plans that are financing demonstrations for multifamily housing, including various approved financing methods. The grant applications will be prioritized based on the entity's experience, innovative approach to energy savings, replicability of the plan, and secured funding from private, nonprofit, or government sources. The curr_chunk discusses creating green jobs in construction, property management, and technical analysis to promote energy savings in multifamily housing. It also involves acquiring data on retrofitting costs and benefits, as well as implementing demonstration projects for energy efficiency. The curr_chunk focuses on improving energy efficiency in multifamily housing by addressing utility metering, benchmarking energy consumption, and achieving approved goals. Grants must be used for an energy savings plan resulting in significant savings. The grant recipients must implement a plan to reduce energy, water, or gas consumption in multifamily housing by at least 20%. They must also provide details on how the reduction in energy consumption will be calculated. Recipients are required to match funds from other sources, grants are awarded for up to 24 months, and a report must be submitted to the Secretary within 12 months after the grant period ends. The eligible entity, defined as a partnership between specific entities, must submit a report to the Secretary on the performance of energy savings plans. The curr_chunk defines terms related to multifamily housing, such as energy savings plan, low-income families, multifamily housing, Secretary, and split incentive problem. The curr_chunk defines a \"problem\" in multifamily housing where occupants or owners do not pay for energy, water, or gas consumption and lack incentives for energy savings measures. The term \"State\" is also defined as each state, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories. Authorization of appropriations is set at $25,000,000 for fiscal year 2015, $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2016, and $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2017. Authorization of appropriations is set at $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2016, $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2017, and $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2018 to address the issue of non-payment for energy, water, or gas consumption in multifamily housing. During a 5-year period, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development can waive requirements for multifamily properties under a risk-sharing agreement to promote energy and water conservation measures."
