    "content": "The \"Patient Abuse Prevention Act\" establishes a National Registry of Abusive Workers. The Secretary will establish the \"National Registry of Abusive Workers\" to collect data on health care workers with reports of patient abuse. State registries must submit information on workers with confirmed findings of abuse. States are required to report to the Registry. Each State must report information on covered health care workers found to have committed abusive acts involving patients to the National Registry of Abusive Workers. Workers have the right to issue a statement regarding the submission of information. Covered health care facilities are also required to report to the State on covered health care workers. Each covered health care facility must report to the State regarding a health care worker found to have engaged in patient abuse. The State will conduct an investigation to validate the report. Prior to hiring a health care worker, the facility must conduct a criminal background check if not already done as part of state licensing requirements. The State's licensing requirements mandate a criminal background check for health care workers, including certification of no criminal record or abuse findings prior to employment. The State may assess a fee for conducting criminal background checks on health care workers, with facilities able to recover the cost from the workers. Contact with State health care worker registries is required for information on workers. Each health care facility must provide a probationary period for workers until background checks are completed. Direct supervision is required during this period. The requirement for criminal background checks becomes effective on January 1, 1999, or when the FBI's fingerprint system is operational. During a health care worker's probationary period, a covered facility may face civil penalties for violations, with fines ranging from $2,000 for the first offense to $5,000 for subsequent violations within a 5-year period. Additionally, facilities that knowingly retain workers in violation of regulations may face further penalties. In this section, failure to report patient abuse by a covered health care worker may result in civil penalties of up to $5,000 for the first violation and $10,000 for subsequent violations within a 5-year period. The term \"covered health care facility\" refers to providers of services under the Medicare program. The curr_chunk discusses various types of facilities eligible for funding under different healthcare programs, including nursing facilities, home health agencies, hospice programs, hospitals, and health centers. It also mentions facilities of the National Institutes of Health and the Indian Health Service, as well as health centers under section 330 of the Public Health Service Act. The curr_chunk defines a \"covered health care worker\" as an individual with direct patient contact at a covered health care facility. This includes licensed individuals and non-licensed workers like nurse assistants and home health aides. The curr_chunk defines patient abuse as any mistreatment or misappropriation of property of a patient in a covered health care facility. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will consult with the FBI Director and promulgate regulations within 6 months of the Act's enactment. The regulations require submission of information to the Registry within 30 days of a conviction or finding. SEC. 3. EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS FROM PARTICIPATION IN PROGRAMS. Mandatory Lifetime Exclusion under Section 1128(a) of the Social Security Act for individuals or entities convicted of criminal offenses involving bodily security crimes like homicide, battery, endangerment of safety, sexual assault, child or elder abuse, and spousal abuse, or for knowingly continuing to employ or failing to report individuals involved in such offenses in positions with direct patient care. Individuals or entities found guilty of patient abuse by a State or knowingly employing individuals involved in patient abuse may be excluded under Section 1128(b) of the Social Security Act. Individuals or entities found guilty of patient abuse by a State or knowingly employing individuals involved in patient abuse may be excluded under Section 1128(b) of the Social Security Act.

The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish exclusion periods under Section 1128(c)(3)(G) of the Social Security Act. Any entity eligible for federal reimbursement will be excluded from working for entities under federal health care programs. SEC. 4. PREVENTION AND TRAINING DEMONSTRATION PROJECT. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a demonstration program to provide grants for developing best practices in patient abuse prevention training for hospital and healthcare facility staff. Eligible entities must be public or private nonprofit organizations. Grant funds will be used to improve collaboration between State health care agencies, long-term care programs, the industry, and local communities.
