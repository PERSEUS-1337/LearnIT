    "content": "Censure is a formal reprimand by Congress against government officials, with variations in language used for non-Members. Past censure resolutions criticized Presidents for unconstitutional actions, while recent ones focus on terms like \"censure\" and \"condemn.\" Recent censure resolutions, such as H.Res. 700, target executive or judicial branch officials and express the \"sense of\" the House and/or Senate without legal implications. Censure resolutions for Members of Congress are based on the Constitution's power to punish disorderly behavior, while those for the President have no disciplinary authority except through impeachment. Both types of resolutions are usually simple resolutions, not signed by the President, but treated differently in a parliamentary sense by the House and Senate. House censure resolutions, which discipline Members of Congress for disorderly behavior, are privileged for consideration in both the House and Senate. In the House, these resolutions have precedence over regular business and require the offending Member to stand as the censure is read aloud. In the House, censure resolutions are privileged and require the offending Member to stand as the censure is read aloud by the Speaker. In the Senate, the Select Committee on Ethics may recommend disciplinary action against a Senator, including censure, expulsion, or recommendation to the party conference. Censure resolutions for executive or judicial branch officials are not privileged. Non-Member censure resolutions enjoy special parliamentary status and express the formal opinion of the House or Senate. The last presidential censure resolution considered on the congressional floor was in 1912. If a House committee reports a non-Member censure resolution, the full House may consider it by unanimous consent, Suspension of the Rules procedure, or a special rule adopted by the House. In the House, a censure resolution can be brought to the floor through unanimous consent, Suspension of the Rules, or a special rule from the Committee on Rules. Support from the majority party leadership is necessary for consideration. In the Senate, a censure resolution can be considered through unanimous consent or referral to committee if a Senator objects. In the Senate, a censure resolution can be referred to committee for consideration. The resolution may be reported by the committee, allowing it to be debated on the floor. Any amendments to the resolution, including censorious language, would also be subject to debate. Cloture processes may be needed to reach a final vote on the censure language. The language of censure is subjective, with resolutions either using the word \"censure\" or citing alleged presidential abuse. The Congressional Research Service identified 13 former Presidents who faced censure attempts, with some resolutions citing abuse of power. Four censure-related resolutions were adopted but only expressed the chamber's opinion without legal authority. The censure language is subjective and can involve debates and amendments before a final vote. Four former Presidents faced censure attempts, with resolutions sometimes amended on the chamber floor to lessen the rebuke. President Andrew Jackson's censure, stemming from a dispute over the Second Bank of the United States, was the clearest case, although it was later expunged. In 1834, the Senate passed a censure resolution against President Jackson for exceeding his constitutional authority in handling public revenue. Jackson later protested the censure, leading to further Senate resolutions. By 1837, the censure was removed from Senate records. On January 16, the Secretary of the Senate expunged a resolution in the Senate Journal. Representative Robert Hatton reported five resolutions in June 1860, accusing the Secretary of the Navy of ethical violations in military contracts. The resolutions also criticized the President for awarding contracts based on party relations and pending elections, setting a dangerous example. The House voted to adopt five resolutions on June 13, with the fourth resolution targeting the President and Secretary of the Navy passing in a 106-61 vote. Senator Garret Davis reprimanded President Lincoln for allowing generals to return to military service after winning election to the House, citing it as unconstitutional. The Senate Judiciary Committee amended a resolution criticizing President Taft for influencing a Senate election. Senator Joseph Bailey introduced a resolution condemning any presidential attempt to control a Senator's vote as unconstitutional. The Senate adopted an amended resolution criticizing potential presidential actions, with Senator Bailey open to further amendments to gain support. Past critical resolutions towards Presidents were mentioned, including one condemning Polk's actions and another criticizing Tyler in a House committee report. Since 1972, several Presidents have faced censure attempts, with resolutions often calling for resignation. Resolutions from 1972-2016 have been referred to committee without further action. In 1800, Representative Edward Livingston accused the President of judicial interference in a case involving a fugitive aboard a British ship. In 1800, a federal judge was asked to release a fugitive claiming American citizenship into British custody. The House voted against resolutions condemning the President for interfering with judicial decisions. The Tyler case arose after President Harrison's death, with President Tyler vetoing bills and angering Congress members. On August 10, 1842, former President John Quincy Adams proposed a committee to review the President's veto message. The committee recommended a constitutional amendment to lower the veto override threshold to a simple majority. The House voted to approve the report but fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to amend the Constitution. The report criticized the President's abuse of power and assumption of unauthorized powers. The House did not approve a censure resolution, but the report itself served as a form of presidential censure. Tyler's official protest was rejected by the House. In January 1848, an amendment criticizing President Polk's actions in the Mexican-American War was approved by the House, but the resolution itself was not adopted. Instead, a joint resolution praising Generals Taylor and Scott was passed without any criticism of Polk or the war. The Grant case followed months of acrimony. The Grant case followed months of acrimony between President Polk and Senator Charles Sumner, who led efforts against the President's treaty to annex the Dominican Republic. Sumner introduced a resolution criticizing the President's deployment of ships along the Dominican coast as an unauthorized usurpation of power. During the Korean War, President Truman seized control of steel mills, leading to a resolution condemning the action as unauthorized. The resolution was referred to the House Committee on. In 1972, President Nixon faced House resolutions regarding his conduct during the Vietnam War and the Watergate break-in. The Watergate resolutions were submitted after the firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox and the adoption of articles of impeachment by the House Judiciary Committee in 1974. In 1974, resolutions were submitted after the Judiciary Committee adopted articles of impeachment. Three resolutions called for Nixon to resign without citing specific abuses of power. Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, one day after the last censure resolution was submitted. The Clinton resolutions in 1998 concerned the President's testimony before a grand jury, leading to considerations of censure or impeachment for perjury and obstruction of justice. Five resolutions were introduced as alternatives to impeachment proceedings between September 1998 and February 1999. H.Res. 531 (September 11, 1998) called for the President's immediate resignation due to \"abuse of office.\" Other resolutions used variations of \"censure and condemn\" towards the President's conduct. Joint resolutions H.J.Res. 139, H.J.Res. 140, and H.J.Res. 12 were introduced before impeachment proceedings, while S.Res. 44 was introduced on the day the Senate acquitted the President. The joint resolutions required approval from both houses of Congress and the President's signature. They included conditions such as acknowledging censure, donating $500,000 to the Treasury, and refraining from certain activities. These resolutions were the most controversial among the Clinton censure resolutions. The George W. Bush resolutions addressed the Administration's response to the September 11, 2001, attack. The resolutions targeted President Bush and Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales for authorizing wiretaps of Americans and disregarding statutes, treaties, and the Constitution. Other resolutions sought to censure President Bush and Vice President Cheney for actions related to the war in Iraq. Hearings were held on one of the resolutions in 2006, but none were reported out of committee. The five Obama censure resolutions accused him of various charges, including failure to execute laws, usurpation of Congress's power, and actions beyond US laws. They were referred to the Judiciary Committee but received no action. Some resolutions called for the President's resignation. H.Res. 531 (105th Congress) is considered a resolution of censure as it included the phrase \"abused the office,\" unlike other resolutions that did not reprimand the President's conduct."
