    "content": "Private individuals and firms, known as \"contractors\" and \"subcontractors,\" have been transporting mail between postal facilities since 1792. Contractors deliver mail to homes and businesses using various modes of transportation. One common type of land mail transportation contract is the \"highway contract route\" (HCR), which has three subtypes: \"transportation,\" \"combination,\" and \"contract delivery service\" (CDS). The CDS contracts, which involve collecting and delivering mail in rural areas, sparked controversy in 2007 with the National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC). In 2007, the National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC) and the USPS signed a collective bargaining agreement covering compensation and workplace matters. Two memoranda of understanding (MOUs) were established, including a six-month moratorium on new contracting of mail carrier work in post offices with city carriers. A joint USPS-NALC committee was created to review policies on subcontracting mail delivery, considering the parties' interests and public policy. The National Rural Letter Carriers Association (NRLCA) also reached a collective agreement. The NRLCA, representing rural delivery persons, reached a collective bargaining agreement with the USPS in 2006. Article 32 addresses subcontracting mail delivery, requiring advance notification to the Union and discussion before any final decisions are made. The parties recognize grievances can be raised on individual problems in this area. In 2007, both NALC and NRLCA alleged USPS misconduct. In 2007, NALC and NRLCA accused USPS of expanding the use of contract delivery carriers. NALC members protested at USPS headquarters and offices in Florida and New Jersey. USPS denied the accusations, citing cost-effective options and contractual authority to use contractors. A 2008 GAO study showed city carriers cost twice as much as CDS carriers. Some members of Congress expressed concern over USPS hiring contractors. Members of the 110th Congress were concerned about USPS hiring contractors for mail delivery. Representative Albio Sires introduced H.Res. 282 to stop this practice, which was cosponsored by 256 Members. Senator Tom Harkin introduced S. 1457 to forbid USPS from contracting mail delivery services, with 38 cosponsors. The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, along with 38 cosponsors, discussed the issue of USPS hiring contractors for mail delivery. The NALC and NRLCA expressed concerns about contractors delivering mail, especially in suburban and city locations like the Bronx. The USPS clarified that they were not replacing career carriers with contractors and only assigning new delivery routes to them. The Postmaster General committed to not contracting out city delivery in big cities and working with unions on the use of contractors in suburban and rural areas. After negotiations, the NALC and USPS signed an MOU in October 2008 to extend the moratorium on new CDS contracts in post offices with city carriers. The NRLCA and USPS resolved their differences over private mail delivery contractors through the grievance process. The NRLCA-USPS collective bargaining agreement expired in November 2010, followed by the NALC-USPS contract a year later. The status of the mail contracting MOUs is uncertain after negotiations between USPS and the unions. The USPS and two unions engaged in negotiations and mediation, leading to binding arbitration. The NRLCA completed arbitration in July 2012, while the NALC's arbitration is ongoing. The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 established the USPS as an independent entity responsible for efficient mail delivery nationwide. The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 gives USPS discretion over operations, including contracting for transportation services. It also addresses employee compensation and benefits. The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 grants USPS authority over operations, including contracting for transportation services and setting employee compensation and benefits. The National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC) has raised concerns about USPS using contractors instead of career mail carriers, potentially undermining collective bargaining agreements. This raises questions about the balance between USPS's contracting authority and employee compensation under the Act. The number of carrier routes served by CDS carriers increased significantly between 1998 and 2012, while USPS career city and rural carriers still handle the majority of routes and delivery points. Despite the increase in the use of CDS carriers, they only serve on a small percentage of routes and delivery points. There has been a shift in the percentage of routes served by rural carriers over the years. The percentage of routes served by rural carriers has increased from 26.5% to 32.4%, while city carriers have decreased from 71.2% to 63.2%. Delivery points served by rural carriers have also increased from 25.4% to 30.7%, while city carriers have decreased from 73.0% to 67.3%. Postal law requires USPS to operate efficiently but conflicts arise with using private contractors for mail delivery. USPS has increased its use of contractors over the past 15 years, but they still serve only a small percentage of carrier routes. The data shows that contractors serve a small percentage of carrier routes and deliver to few homes and businesses. The issue of using private contractors for mail delivery may be settled through arbitration between USPS, NALC, and NRLCA. Congress may choose to take no action and leave the matter to be decided through collective bargaining and grievance processes. The USPS may have legitimate reasons to use contractors for cost-savings in delivering mail, aligning with long-standing practices. Congress could intervene due to a conflict between USPS efficiency and unionized employee rights, arguing that while USPS should be self-supporting, outsourcing may not be necessary. The USPS may have reasons to use contractors for cost-savings in delivering mail, but Congress could intervene by either banning or limiting the practice to ensure societal benefits of hiring individuals and compensating them well. Congress may also consider providing USPS with additional authorities to recoup any lost savings if contractors are banned or limited."
