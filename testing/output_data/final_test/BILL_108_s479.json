The \"Protect America Scholarships Act of 2003\" authorizes grants for Homeland Security Scholarships to recruit young talent for homeland security professions and make college education more affordable. An eligible entity is a partnership between an institution of higher education and a qualified employer. An eligible student is an individual enrolled or accepted at an institution of higher education with a qualified academic major, who submits a scholarship application. The \"Protect America Scholarships Act of 2003\" authorizes grants for Homeland Security Scholarships to recruit young talent for homeland security professions. A qualified student must be enrolled in a designated academic major related to homeland security and submit a scholarship application. The student must also accept payment of the scholarship in exchange for providing qualified service. The \"Protect America Scholarships Act of 2003\" authorizes grants for Homeland Security Scholarships to recruit young talent for homeland security professions. The scholarship is for students enrolled in a designated major related to homeland security and requires them to provide qualified service in exchange for payment. The program aims to address a critical shortage of qualified personnel in homeland security, prioritizing national and state needs. The term 'qualified service' refers to service provided by a student enrolled in a designated major related to homeland security at an institution of higher education. A qualified employer for this service includes nonprofit organizations and public agencies. The term 'qualified service' refers to full-time employment with the eligible entity that awarded the student a scholarship, or another qualified employer, for a period of 2 years for the first year of the scholarship award and an additional 1 year for each additional year. The position must be related to homeland security, require specialized expertise in the student's academic major, and suffer from a critical lack of qualified personnel. The Secretary will provide guidelines on when a scholarship recipient can work for a different qualified employer than the one who awarded the scholarship. \"Grants to eligible entities.\" The Secretary awards grants to eligible entities for scholarships in exchange for service from students. Entities must submit an application and use funds for scholarships and application forms. The eligible entity receiving a grant must provide a written contract to students applying for a scholarship, outlining rights and obligations. The eligible entity must offer a scholarship to the student for up to 4 years, and the student must accept and maintain enrollment in the academic program until completion. The student must have a qualified academic major, maintain acceptable academic standing, provide qualified service, and repay the scholarship if requirements are not met. The contract must include a provision for any financial obligations arising from the agreement. The contract for scholarships under this subpart is contingent on appropriated funds. Recipients must provide student information and the amount of the scholarship. Eligible entities must match 50% of federal assistance and grants are awarded for a 5-year term. \"Scholarships under this subpart require matching 50% of federal assistance, awarded for a 5-year term.\" The scholarship application process requires submission of an application and written contract to an eligible entity. The scholarship payment covers tuition and fees for the school year, with a maximum amount of $10,000 for fiscal year 2004. The Secretary determines the maximum scholarship amount for each succeeding fiscal year. The Secretary may contract with an institution of higher education for the payment of tuition and fees for eligible students. Verification of qualified service requires documentation from both the student and the eligible entity. An eligible entity receiving a grant must provide documentation to the Secretary verifying that eligible students awarded scholarships have completed their qualified service. If satisfactory documentation is not received by the specified date, the Secretary will collect the scholarship amount as a loan under repayment conditions similar to part B loans. If an eligible student fails to provide documentation for qualified service after receiving a scholarship, they are liable to repay the scholarship amount with interest and collection costs. The Secretary may waive this liability if the student later proves they completed the service or in cases of death or permanent disability. The Secretary may waive the liability for scholarship repayment if the student faces death, permanent disability, inability to complete the program due to institution closure, or extreme hardship in complying with the agreement. Amounts collected by the Secretary remain available for grant awards. Scholarships received under this subpart are not considered gross income for federal tax purposes. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2004 to 2008: $50,000,000 for 2004, $100,000,000 for 2005, $150,000,000 for 2006, and necessary sums for 2007 and 2008."
