    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Child Care Facilities Financing Act\" and provides technical and financial assistance grants. In this section, definitions include \"child care facility\" as a center-based or home-based facility, \"eligible intermediary\" as a nonprofit organization with experience in providing assistance for construction and renovation, and \"eligible recipient\" as any center-based or home-based provider. The Secretary may award grants to child care providers serving eligible children under specific programs. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Secretary may award grants to eligible intermediaries on a competitive basis to assist in carrying out activities for eligible recipients in low-income areas. Applicants must submit an application to the Secretary to be considered for a grant, with priority given to those serving communities with a median household income not exceeding 80 percent. In low-income areas, grants may be awarded to intermediaries serving communities with a median household income not exceeding 80 percent. Low-income individuals, including eligible children, are also considered for assistance. Each eligible intermediary receiving a grant must deposit it into a child care revolving fund and use the funds to provide technical and financial assistance to eligible recipients for acquiring child care facilities. The Federal share of the cost for child care facilities or equipment acquisition, construction, or improvement shall not exceed 50 percent. Loan repayments and investment proceeds received by an eligible intermediary must be deposited into a child care revolving fund for redistribution to other eligible recipients. The non-Federal share of the cost for child care facilities can be provided in cash or in kind. $50,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2002 to 2006."
