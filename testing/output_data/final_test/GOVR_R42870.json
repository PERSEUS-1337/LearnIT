    "content": "The Child Protection Act of 2012 strengthens federal laws to prevent and punish the sexual exploitation of children. It increases penalties for federal child pornography offenses, outlaws harassment of aged victims and witnesses, grants federal marshals more powers to track sex offenders, reevaluates sentencing guidelines for those who intimidate children to obstruct prosecution, and enhances the Justice Department's Internet Crimes Against Children program. Many components of the Act were first proposed in earlier legislation, such as the Protecting Children From Internet Pornographers Act of 2011. The Child Protection Act of 2012, passed in December 2012, makes it a federal crime to transport, receive, sell, or possess child pornography. It covers both pornography depicting actual human beings and computer-generated images. The Child Protection Act of 2012 criminalizes possession, transportation, receipt, or sales of child pornography, including computer-generated images. Federal jurisdiction applies in specific locations or if the pornography involves interstate commerce. Offenses are punishable by imprisonment for 5 to 20 years. The Act increases penalties for possession of child pornography depicting young children. The Child Protection Act of 2012 criminalizes possession, transportation, receipt, or sales of child pornography, including computer-generated images. Federal jurisdiction applies in specific locations or if the pornography involves interstate commerce. Offenses are punishable by imprisonment for 5 to 20 years. Section 1512 of 18 U.S.C. addresses actions such as killing or attempting to kill, the use of force or threats, intimidation, and harassment to influence or prevent a witness from testifying in a federal proceeding. Section 1514 allows the court to issue restraining orders and protective orders to prevent such violations or ongoing harassment. Failure to comply with these orders is a serious offense. The Child Protection Act of 2012 aims to protect child victims of abuse and exploitation by making changes in Section 1514. These modifications address the need for stronger measures to safeguard minor witnesses and victims, especially in cases of child sex abuse. The Act recognizes the challenges faced by child victims in coming forward due to threats and intimidation, emphasizing the importance of providing adequate protection and support for them. The Child Protection Act of 2012 aims to protect child victims of abuse and exploitation by providing Federal courts with the means to control intimidation through protection orders and felony penalties. Violation of restraining orders can result in imprisonment for up to five years and/or a fine of up to $250,000. The Act also makes adjustments to strengthen protection for minor witnesses and victims in child sex abuse cases. The Child Protection Act of 2012 expands Section 1514 to allow protective orders in criminal cases and investigations, not just limited to federal criminal cases. It now permits the court to act on its own initiative and protect defense witnesses and immediate family members. Harassment can now consist of a single act, and child victims and witnesses have increased security measures. Section 1514 now provides child victims and witnesses with protective orders to shield them from harassment and intimidation in federal criminal cases. These orders are more easily accessible for minors compared to adults, and are issued when there is evidence that the conduct may affect the minor's willingness to participate in the case. Section 1514 now creates a rebuttable presumption that Internet publication of identifying information relating to a child victim or witness satisfies the \"no legitimate purpose\" element of harassment or intimidation. This provision aims to protect minors from online harassment and intimidation in federal criminal cases. The Constitution may limit the court's authority in investigations involving restricted personal information. Federal agencies can issue administrative subpoenas without prior judicial approval for regulatory purposes, which is more efficient than obtaining a search warrant. Compliance with administrative subpoenas is generally less intrusive for individuals compared to a government search under a warrant. As a result, administrative subpoenas in regulatory contexts typically withstand judicial scrutiny. The use of administrative subpoenas in regulatory contexts is generally approved as long as statutory requirements are met and demands are reasonable. Congress has authorized their use in criminal investigations for specific cases such as Inspector General inquiries, drug trafficking, health care fraud, and child abuse. The Child Protection Act grants the Marshals Service the authority to issue administrative subpoenas to track unregistered sex offenders. The Marshals Service is responsible for apprehending these offenders by accessing hotel, rental car, or airline records quickly. The federal courts must determine sentencing based on the United States Sentencing Commission's guidelines, which consider the seriousness of the offense, circumstances, and criminal record. Offenses are assigned a base level, with adjustments made for case specifics, resulting in a sentencing range. The Sentencing Commission periodically reviews and revises sentencing guidelines for various offenses, including witness intimidation in crimes against children. The guidelines cover contempt of court, obstruction of justice, perjury, and bribery of witnesses. Obstruction of justice now includes witness tampering and lying to federal officers, with increased sentencing for lies related to sex offenses. The Sentencing Commission is reviewing sentencing guidelines for obstruction of justice offenses related to sex offenses, particularly in cases involving children. The Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force Program assists in investigating and prosecuting Internet sexual offenses against children. Congress has authorized $60 million per year for the program. The Child Protection Act authorizes $60 million per year for FY2009-FY2013 and FY2014-FY2018. It increases ICAC task force training funding to $4 million annually, designates a National Coordinator for Child Exploitation Prevention, and removes criminal activity volume as the sole criterion for high-priority suspects. It also requires the Attorney General to report on the National Internet Crimes Against Children Data System within 90 days. The Child Protection Act authorizes funding for ICAC task force training and designates a National Coordinator for Child Exploitation Prevention. It also includes provisions for issuing temporary restraining orders to prevent harassment of victims or witnesses in Federal criminal cases. The Child Protection Act authorizes funding for ICAC task force training and designates a National Coordinator for Child Exploitation Prevention. It includes provisions for issuing temporary restraining orders in Federal criminal cases, which expire within 14 days unless extended for good cause shown. The order must be filed immediately and a hearing for a protective order must be scheduled promptly. The court shall dissolve the temporary restraining order if the Government's attorney does not proceed with the application for a protective order. A temporary restraining order must be specific in terms, set forth reasons for issuance, and describe the act being restrained in detail. The court will hear and determine a motion to dissolve or modify the order promptly upon request by the adverse party. The court may issue a protective order to prevent harassment of a victim or witness in a Federal criminal case, especially for minor witnesses or victims, if it could affect their willingness to participate. The court will hold a hearing to determine the necessity of the order. The court may issue an ex parte emergency protective order in advance of a hearing if exigent circumstances are present. A protective order shall be specific in terms and set the duration of effect for up to three years to prevent harassment of the victim or witness. The attorney for the Government can apply for a new protective order within ninety days before the expiration of the current order. Violating the protective order can result in a fine, imprisonment for up to 5 years, or both. The term \"course of conduct\" refers to a series of acts indicating a continuity of purpose, while \"harassment\" means a serious act causing substantial emotional distress with no legitimate purpose. The term \"intimidation\" refers to a serious act causing fear or apprehension with no legitimate purpose. \"Specific person\" includes victims or witnesses in Federal cases and their immediate family members. The court shall presume that distributing or publishing a photograph or personal information of a specific person online serves no legitimate purpose, unless authorized by the person, for news reporting, locating a missing person, or part of a government effort to locate a fugitive or person of interest in a criminal investigation."
