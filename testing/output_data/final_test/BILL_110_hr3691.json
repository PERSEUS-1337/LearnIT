Commission Recall Authority under Section 15 (15 U.S.C. 2064) allows the Commission to order actions such as ceasing distribution, notifying handlers, providing public notice of product defects, and informing health officials in case of a substantial product hazard.

An order under this subsection shall require an informal hearing for the person subject to the order to discuss the required actions and reasons why the product should not be recalled or notice required. The Commission may hold a hearing within 2 business days of issuing an order, and may amend the order to specify a recall timetable or require progress reports. If the Commission finds no adequate grounds to continue the actions required by the order after an informal hearing, the order will be vacated. The Commission may vacate the order, and the remedies authorized by this section are in addition to any other available remedies.

The Consumer Product Safety Commission requires manufacturers to include specific details on children's products, such as manufacturer contact information, model details, and manufacturing date. Product registration forms should also contain consumer information spaces and encourage completion. Additionally, forms should offer an online registration option and assure consumers that their information will only be used for recall or safety alerts. The Commission may specify the exact text and format of the registration form in its regulations.
