Government advertising can be especially controversial, as it may conflict with beliefs about government's role in protecting liberty and being thrifty with taxpayer money. Controversies have arisen over government ads discouraging marijuana use and promoting social services. Government advertising can be controversial, with some efforts being criticized for discouraging marijuana use or promoting social services. However, not all government ads are contentious, such as those informing the public about job openings or federal contracts. The duty of government to truthfully inform the public about its activities has been emphasized for decades. The federal government has a basic obligation to inform the public, with some advertising mandated by law, like the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign. Government expenditures on advertising are hard to determine due to the lack of a government-wide definition and central reporting authority. The federal government lacks a standardized definition and reporting system for advertising expenses, giving agencies discretion in budgeting their in-house advertising costs. The Government Accountability Office highlighted this issue in 1977, noting the absence of a requirement for agencies to identify advertising costs in their budgets. Budgeting practices vary by agency, with examples such as military recruiting advertising being budgeted under Operations and Maintenance for military departments. The challenges of defining advertising expenses are significant. Examples include a communications specialist sending press releases and holding interviews, hiring an advertising firm for a public service announcement, and delivering public speeches. The question arises whether these activities constitute advertising. The challenges of defining advertising expenses are significant. An estimate of the federal government's expenditures on contracts for advertising services can be derived from utilizing data from the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS), which has limitations as a data source for agency advertising expenditures. The FPDS does not include expenditures by the legislative or judicial branches or the U.S. Postal Service, nor does it include agency in-house expenses related to advertising. Federal agencies spent $892.5 million on contracts for \"advertising services\" in FY2013, with the Department of Defense leading at $419.0 million. There are few government-wide restrictions on government advertising, and no single agency tracks and oversees federal agencies' advertising expenditures. Expenditures for government advertising are regulated by annual appropriations acts, the U.S. Code, and the Code of Federal Regulations. Restrictions include prohibiting the Department of Defense from using funds for advertising by defense contractors and guidelines for promoting agricultural products. Treasury appropriations laws have long prohibited funds for unauthorized publicity or propaganda. GAO's Principles of Federal Appropriations Law provides further guidance on improper use of funds for advertising activities. Principles of Federal Appropriations Law outlines restrictions on agency use of funds for advertising, including prohibitions on using government funds for advertisements to sway Members of Congress. The decision to advertise depends on the agency's statutory authority and the necessary expense doctrine. The \"necessary expense doctrine\" allows agencies to use general appropriations for expenses necessary for achieving objectives, not prohibited by law, and not covered by other statutes. The Department of Justice enforces the 1919 anti-lobbying law, while oversight of government advertising practices falls to inspectors general, GAO, and Congress. Enforcement of limits on government advertising remains unclear. The Department of Justice enforces the 1919 anti-lobbying law, while oversight of government advertising practices falls to inspectors general, GAO, and Congress. GAO reviews agency advertising after congressional request, but its opinions are advisory and not legally binding. Congress primarily oversees government agency advertising, examining large campaigns perceived as overly promotional of a policy or program."
