    "content": "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers benefits such as medical care, disability compensation, education, vocational rehabilitation, home loan guarantees, and burial expenses for veterans and eligible dependents. These services are provided nationwide through three administrations and the Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA). The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) provides health care services and medical research programs for veterans. It offers primary care, specialized care, and social support services through the nation's largest integrated health care system. Inpatient and outpatient care are also available for eligible dependents of veterans under the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA). The VA budget includes mandatory funding for disability compensation, pensions, education, and burial benefits. The VA budget includes funding for education, life insurance, housing, burial benefits, medical care, research, construction programs, and general operating expenses. Various accounts, revolving funds, trust funds, and special funds support these services. Congress authorized advance appropriations for three VHA accounts in 2009. In 2014, Congress passed the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (H.R. 83; P.L. 113-235), which amended 38 U.S.C \u00a7117 to include three more accounts for advance appropriations within the Veterans Benefits Administration. This act authorizes advance appropriations for three mandatory VA benefits programs: compensation and pensions, readjustment benefits, and veterans insurance and indemnities. Additionally, the FY2016 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (MILCON- VA; P.L. 114-113) provided advance appropriations for FY2017 for these accounts, along with the three VHA accounts already authorized. Section 4003 of the Surface Transportation and Veterans Health Care Choice Improvement Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-41) mandated the creation of a new account for medical community. The FY2017 MILCON-VA Act established a new account for medical community care, funded by rescinding amounts from the 2017 medical services account. Advance appropriations were authorized to prevent delays in care and benefits for veterans in case of funding lapses. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 provides advance appropriations for various veterans' accounts for FY2017. Funding for FY2016 does not include these advance appropriations, which are shown in the FY2017 column under \"memorandum.\" Similarly, FY2018 advance appropriations are provided in the Continuing Appropriations Act. The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-146 as amended by P.L. 113-175, P.L. 113-235, P.L. 114-19, P.L. 114-41, and P.L. 115-26) aims to improve access to medical care at VA facilities. It establishes the Veterans Choice Program to authorize care for veterans outside the VA health care system if they meet certain criteria. The Veterans Choice Program was established by Congress with $10 billion in funding over three years. President Trump signed a law to extend the program and allow unobligated funds to be used until expended. However, due to increased usage of funds, the program could not continue past August 15, 2017. The Veterans Choice Program (VCP) would not continue past August 15, 2017, as all remaining funds would be obligated by then. To sustain VCP through FY2018, $3.5 billion in new mandatory budget authority was required. President Trump signed the VA Choice and Quality Employment Act of 2017, allocating $2.1 billion for the Veterans Choice Fund. An additional $5 billion in mandatory funding was provided to enhance veterans' access to healthcare and improve VA infrastructure.
