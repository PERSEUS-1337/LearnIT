    "content": "The automatic annual adjustment for Members of Congress is determined by a formula using the Employment Cost Index (ECI), which measures private sector pay changes. The adjustment takes effect unless Congress prohibits or revises it, or if the GS federal employees' pay increase is lower, then Member pay is adjusted accordingly. Members' pay cannot increase by more than 5% under the ECI formula. Member pay has been frozen in the past through direct legislation or broader pay freeze laws. The annual adjustment for Members of Congress is determined by a formula using the Employment Cost Index (ECI). Member salaries are funded in a permanent appropriations account and not in the annual appropriations bills. The use of appropriations bills as vehicles for provisions prohibiting the automatic annual pay adjustments for Members developed by custom. The Twenty-seventh Amendment to the Constitution prohibits adjustments to Member pay until after an election of Representatives. Member pay is automatically adjusted based on a formula established by the Ethics Reform Act of 1989. A federal court ruled that the Amendment does not apply to these automatic annual adjustments. The Twenty-seventh Amendment does not apply to automatic annual pay adjustments for Members of Congress, as ruled by a federal court. The impact of the Amendment on pay adjustments separate from the Ethics Reform Act procedures remains unclear. The potential January 2019 member pay adjustment of 2.3% was known when BLS released data on the Employment Cost Index change. During the 12-month period from December 2016 to December 2017, a potential member pay adjustment of 1.8% or $3,100 was known. The House-passed and Senate-reported versions of the FY2019 legislative branch appropriations bill included provisions to prevent this adjustment. Division B of P.L. 115-244 enacted a pay freeze provision on September 21, 2018. The Employment Cost Index (ECI) change from December 2015 to December 2016 resulted in a limited Member pay adjustment of $2,400 due to the 2018 GS base pay adjustment. Legislative branch appropriations bills in 2018 aimed to prevent this adjustment, but were not enacted before FY2018 began. The branch activities were funded through a series of continuing appropriations resolutions, with provisions prohibiting Member pay adjustments in FY2017 and FY2018. The Ethics Reform Act of 1989 established the current pay adjustment system for Members of Congress. The maximum potential January 2017 Member pay adjustment of 1.6%, or $2,800, was known when the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released data for the change in the Employment Cost Index (ECI) during the 12-month period from December 2014 to December 2015 on January 30, 2016. Both the House-passed (H.R. 5325) and Senate-reported (S. 2955) versions of the FY2017 legislative branch appropriations bill contained a provision that would prohibit this adjustment. No further action was taken on H.R. 5325 or S. 2955, but the pay prohibition language was included in the bills. The pay prohibition language was included in the Further Continuing and Security Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 114-254) to limit Member pay adjustment to 1.0% ($1,700) in 2016. The House-passed and Senate-reported versions of the FY2016 legislative branch appropriations bill contained a provision prohibiting this adjustment, which was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113). The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113) included a provision limiting Member pay adjustment to 1.0% ($1,700) in 2016. The House budget resolution proposed holding congressional salaries in escrow if a concurrent budget resolution was not agreed upon by April 15. The maximum potential pay adjustment for January 2015 was 1.6% ($2,800). The potential January 2015 pay adjustment of 1.6%, or $2,800, was known when the BLS released data for the change in the ECI during the 12-month period from December 2012 to December 2013 on January 31, 2014. The FY2015 legislative branch appropriations Act contained a provision prohibiting any Member pay adjustment, which was subsequently included in the FY2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act. The legislative branch bill does not fund or increase Member pay, and a prohibition on automatic pay adjustments could be included in any bill. The President proposed a 1.0% increase in GS employees' base pay for January 2015, limiting any Member pay adjustment to 1.0%. The maximum potential 2014 pay adjustment was 1.2%, known when the BLS released data for the change in the ECI. The adjustment takes effect automatically each year unless denied by Congress or limited by the GS base pay adjustment. The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014, prohibited pay adjustments. The Appropriations Act, 2014 prohibited the 2014 pay adjustment for Members of Congress. The President issued an alternate pay plan for federal civilian employees, implementing a 1.0% increase for GS employees in January 2014. Executive Order 13655 also implemented a 1.0% increase for GS employees. The GS base pay adjustment for Members of Congress in 2013 was limited to 1.0% ($1,700) due to statutory restrictions. The maximum potential pay adjustment was 1.1% ($1,900), but President Obama proposed a 0.5% adjustment for GS employees in his budget. The federal pay freeze was extended until FY2013 budget negotiations were finalized. Negotiations were finalized with the passing of H.J.Res. 117, extending the pay freeze for GS employees. President Obama's Executive Order 13635 included a 0.5% increase in GS base pay, limiting the maximum potential Member pay adjustment to 0.5%. The annual adjustments for Members' pay ranged from 1.1% to 0.5%. Legislation froze Member pay at the 2009 level for 2013. H.R. 325 introduced language holding congressional salaries in escrow if a budget resolution was not agreed to by April 15, 2013. H.R. 325 froze congressional salaries in escrow if a budget resolution was not agreed to by a certain date. The bill was enacted on February 4, 2013. H.R. 807, the Full Faith and Credit Act, prioritized certain payments in case of reaching the debt limit, excluding compensation for Members of Congress. The House passed H.R. 5146 on May 13, 2013, freezing congressional pay adjustments. The bill was introduced and agreed to the same day in both the House and Senate. Other bills were also introduced to prevent the 2011 pay adjustment. The Senate introduced S. 388 on March 1, 2011, to prohibit Members of Congress from receiving pay during government shutdowns or debt limit issues. The House passed H.R. 1255 on April 1, 2011, with a similar provision. The House and Senate introduced bills to prohibit pay for Members of Congress during government shutdowns or debt limit issues. The Speaker of the House stated that Members would continue to be paid during a shutdown, but could return compensation to the Treasury. H.R. 3630 and a motion to recommit included provisions to freeze Member pay, but the motion failed and the bill passed the House. The House-passed bill \"Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2011\" was enacted on February 22, 2012 (P.L. 112-96) without the pay freeze language. H.R. 3835 and H.R. 6726 aimed to extend the pay freeze for federal employees, including Members of Congress, to December 31, 2013, passing the House on February 1, 2012, and January 2, 2013, respectively. In 2013, Congress denied a 2.1% pay adjustment for Members scheduled for January 2010 through legislation in the FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act. The provision prohibiting the pay adjustment was added to H.R. 1105 through H.Res. 184. The House voted on a resolution (H.Res. 184) in February 2009, leading to a 2.8% pay adjustment for Members, increasing salaries to $174,000. This adjustment was less than the projected 2009 base GS adjustment of 2.9%. President George W. Bush issued an executive order finalizing the GS rate on December 18, 2008. In March 2009, the Senate considered altering the automatic annual pay adjustment for Members of Congress. Senator David Vitter proposed an amendment to repeal the provision of law for annual adjustments under the Ethics Reform Act. The Senate agreed to a motion to table the amendment on March 10, 2009. Senator Harry Reid introduced bills to eliminate the automatic pay procedure effective February 1, 2011, and December 31, 2010. The Senate agreed to the latter bill by unanimous consent on March 17, 2009. The Senate passed a bill to eliminate the automatic pay adjustment for Members of Congress on December 31, 2010. An identical bill was introduced in the House the following day. Additional bills affecting congressional pay were also introduced. Member pay language was included in Senate amendments, but no further action was taken. Originally, Members were set to receive a 2.7% increase in January 2008, but this was revised to 2.5% due to factors related to the increase in base pay of GS employees. The scheduled January 2008 across-the-board increase in the base pay of GS employees was 2.5%. President Bush did not issue an alternative plan for the annual pay adjustment, but provided a 0.5% adjustment for the locality pay. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, provided a 3.5% average pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, with the President allocating this percentage between base and locality pay. Since the base portion of the pay adjustment for GS employees was less than the scheduled increase, Member pay was adjusted by the lower rate. On June 27, 2007, the House took action on the January 2008 Member pay increase. The House agreed to order the previous question on the rule for consideration of the FY2008 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations bill. The House bill did not contain Member pay language, and an amendment to halt the pay raise was not allowed. During floor debate, at least one Member spoke against the previous question. The House agreed to order the previous question on the rule for consideration of H.R. 2829, the FY2008 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations bill. This prevented an amendment to prohibit a pay increase from being offered, and brought the rule to an immediate vote. Some Members viewed the vote as against considering an amendment to stop the pay raise. The House agreed to order the previous question on the rule for consideration of H.R. 2829, preventing an amendment to prohibit a pay increase. Members argued against the vote, stating that without it, an amendment could have been offered to halt the pay raise. As a result, Members did not receive the scheduled 1.7% pay adjustment in 2007, keeping their salary at $165,200 instead of the planned $168,500. In 2007, General Schedule (GS) employees were authorized a 1.7% base pay increase, but a series of votes and resolutions postponed the adjustment until February 16, 2007. The scheduled 2007 adjustment was further prevented by a law enacted on February 15, 2007. In 2007, Congress delayed the scheduled pay increase for Members until February 16, 2007, blocking any pay raise for that year. This decision came after concerns were raised about the relative increases in congressional pay compared to the federal minimum wage. In 2007, Congress delayed the scheduled pay increase for Members until February 16, 2007, blocking any pay raise for that year. The House voted to prevent an amendment prohibiting a pay increase to be offered by ordering the previous question on H.R. 5576, the FY2007 Transportation and Treasury Appropriation bill. Representative Jim Matheson intended to offer an amendment related to the pay adjustment, but it was deemed not germane under the terms of H.Res. 865. In 2007, Congress delayed the scheduled pay increase for Members until February 16, 2007, blocking any pay raise for that year. Representative Jim Matheson intended to offer an amendment related to the pay adjustment, but it was deemed not germane under the terms of H.Res. 865. The Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2007, became law (P.L. 110-5, 121 Stat. 12), stating that the adjustment in Member pay scheduled for 2007 shall not take effect. The Senate passed S. 1, the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007, containing a provision that would deny an annual pay adjustment. In 2007, Congress delayed the scheduled pay increase for Members until February 16, 2007, blocking any pay raise for that year. The bill contained a provision that would deny an annual pay adjustment to Members of Congress who vote for an amendment to prohibit an annual adjustment for Members. Members received a pay adjustment of 1.9% in January 2006, increasing their salary to $165,200 from $162,100. In December 2005, a 3.1% pay increase was allocated for GS federal employees, with 2.1% for base pay and 1.0% for locality pay. The House and Senate had differing votes on the January 2006 pay adjustment, with the House allowing a rule for consideration of a bill to deny the increase. The Senate voted on October 18, 2005, to prohibit the scheduled January 2006 Member pay adjustment, but the prohibition did not apply to other federal officials. The amendment was later removed in conference. The Senate agreed to an amendment denying an annual pay adjustment to Members of Congress who vote against prohibiting an increase. The House ordered the previous question on a rule to prevent an amendment allowing a pay increase. The House ordered the previous question on a rule to prevent an amendment allowing a pay increase, which some Members argued was against consideration of a pay raise prohibition amendment. Representative Jim Matheson intended to offer an amendment to prohibit the pay raise, but it was not in order under the terms of H.Res. 342. On 10/18/05, the Senate agreed to an amendment prohibiting the 2006 federal pay adjustment for Members of Congress only. The amendment did not apply to top-level executive and judicial branch officials. Members received a 2.5% pay adjustment in January 2005, increasing their salary to $162,100 from $158,100. In January 2005, Members of Congress received a 2.5% pay increase, raising their salary to $162,100 from $158,100. The House action on a bill related to Member pay increase was seen as approval by some, as nongermane amendments were not allowed for consideration. It is uncertain if Members would have voted to deny the pay increase if given the opportunity. In a House vote related to the Treasury Appropriations bill, an amendment to prohibit a pay increase was not allowed. Members received a 2.2% pay adjustment in 2004, increasing their salary to $158,100. Members received a 2.2% pay adjustment in 2004, increasing their salary to $158,100 from $154,700. The adjustment was effective in two stages, with 0.7% retroactive to January 2004. Some argued that a House vote related to the pay increase was seen as approval of an annual increase. The House voted to prevent nongermane amendments, including one to deny a scheduled 2.2% Member pay increase. Some Members wanted to introduce other unrelated amendments. The Senate tabled an amendment to prohibit the pay adjustment on October 23, 2003. The House voted to prevent nongermane amendments, including one to deny a scheduled 2.2% Member pay increase.

On November 13, 2002, the Senate voted to table an amendment to prohibit the scheduled January 2003 annual adjustment for Members of Congress in the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The House agreed to order the previous question on a rule for consideration of the FY2003 Treasury Appropriations bill on July 18, 2002, preventing an amendment to prohibit a pay increase. Members of Congress voted to order the previous question, preventing an amendment to block a pay raise in January 2003. The Senate also tabled an amendment to stop the salary increase for Members in the Homeland Security Act of 2002. Members received a 3.4% pay adjustment in January 2002, raising their salary to $150,000. In January 2002, Members of Congress received a salary increase to $150,000 from $145,100. The House and Senate considered amendments to block the pay raise, with the House needing a special waiver for the amendment. The Senate ruled an amendment to block the increase as not germane. The House agreed to order the previous question on a rule providing for consideration of a bill, which did not allow for an amendment to prohibit a pay raise for Members of Congress. The Senate sustained a point of order against an amendment to block the pending January 2002 salary increase, as it was not germane under Senate Rule 16. The action was taken during consideration of the FY2002 foreign operations appropriations bill. The amendment authorized legislation on an appropriation bill during consideration of the FY2002 Department of Defense Appropriations bill. Members received a 2.7% pay adjustment in January 2001, instead of the originally scheduled 3.0%. The House agreed to a rule allowing consideration of an amendment to prohibit the January 2001 pay increase. On September 9, 2000, the Senate rejected the conference report on H.R. 4516, the FY2001 Legislative Branch Appropriations bill, as Senators had not previously had a chance to introduce an amendment prohibiting the scheduled January 2001 pay increase. The House agreed to order the previous question on a rule (H.Res. 560) providing for consideration of H.R. 4871, the FY2001 Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations bill. Members voted not to consider an amendment to permit a pay raise prohibition amendment to be offered. The Senate rejected the conference report on H.R. 4516, the FY2001 Legislative Branch Appropriations bill, due to the lack of opportunity to introduce an amendment prohibiting the scheduled January 2001 pay raise. The House did not allow an amendment to permit a pay raise prohibition amendment to be offered. Some Senators felt denied the chance to block a scheduled pay increase in the Treasury bill and debate a raise. The FY2001 Treasury bill was incorporated into the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations bill. Members received a 3.4% pay adjustment in January 2000. The House agreed to block a pay increase for Members in the FY2000 Treasury and General Government Appropriations bill, while allowing an increase for other federal employees.

The House rejected an amendment to strike the pay prohibition language, but passed H.R. 4104 with the language. The Senate adopted an amendment to make the pay prohibition language in S. 2312 the same as in H.R. 4104. The Senate passed H.R. 4104 with pay prohibition language, which was later agreed upon by the House in the conference report.

The Senate had previously adopted an amendment to prohibit the pay adjustment, which did not apply to other top-level federal officials. The House version of the Treasury bill, H.R. 2378, was passed on September 17, 1997. The Senate later amended the bill to include a pay prohibition and sent it back to the House. After a disagreement between the House and Senate, a conference was agreed upon. The House then voted to prevent any amendments related to the pay issue, ultimately sending the bill to conference. The House version of the Treasury bill, H.R. 2378, was passed on September 17, 1997. The Senate later amended the bill to include a pay prohibition for Members of Congress. The bill was signed into law without the pay prohibition language on October 10, 1997. The House voted to order the previous question on a pending motion to instruct conferees on an issue unrelated to the pay issue, effectively foreclosing the possibility of omitting the pay adjustment from the conference report. H.R. 2378 was sent to conference without instructions to prohibit the pay adjustment, and the Senate pay amendment was dropped. Members did not receive the annual pay adjustment of 2.3% scheduled for January 1, 1997, and their salary remained $133,600. In 1996, Members' salary remained $133,600 as a pay adjustment prohibition was incorporated into the FY1997 Omnibus Continuing Appropriations Act.

This provision was included in the Senate substitute amendment to H.R. 2546 on 11/2/1995 but was deleted in the conference report on 1/31/1996. Members were paid during the shutdowns in November 1995 and December 1995-January 1996 because their pay is automatically funded in a permanent appropriation.

The House and Senate both recognized the ratification of this amendment. In 1992, Senators and Representatives received a pay increase of 3.6% and 25% respectively. The Senate later voted to increase their pay by 22.8% to match the salary of Representatives. This action was taken in the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill, FY1992. In 1991, H.R. 2506 was passed into law (P.L. 102-90) increasing Senators' pay to match Representatives' pay, banning honoraria, and limiting outside earned income.
