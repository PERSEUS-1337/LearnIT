    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"FHA In-Person Servicing Improvement Act of 2013\". It includes a Pilot Program. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development will conduct a pilot program under the FHA In-Person Servicing Improvement Act of 2013 to make payments to qualified entities for contacting mortgagors with overdue payments, to identify eligibility for loan modifications or refinances, pre-foreclosure options, and current occupants of homes. The FHA In-Person Servicing Improvement Act of 2013 pilot program involves qualified entities contacting mortgagors with overdue payments, identifying occupants of homes, providing information on home conditions to prevent deterioration, and sharing relevant information with mortgagees and the Secretary for asset management. Qualified entities are defined as single entities or partnerships. Qualified entities for the FHA pilot program must have experience in relevant activities, be unaffiliated with the mortgagor, and comply with State and Federal laws. The Secretary has discretion in selecting entities based on qualifications and infrastructure capability. The Secretary will make available 50,000 to 100,000 loans meeting delinquency criteria for a pilot program within 90 days of the Act's enactment. Payments to selected entities may be flat per mortgage or based on performance success. The pilot program under this section allows for completed loan modifications, pre-foreclosure sales, and deeds in lieu of foreclosure, or a combination of these methods. Entities participating in the program are prohibited from charging any fees to the mortgagor or mortgagee. The Secretary will provide periodic updates on the program's status and submit a report to Congress upon its termination. The Secretary will submit a final report to Congress on the pilot program, analyzing performance characteristics and comparing asset recovery levels of included loans to those not in the program. Definitions for \"covered mortgage\" and \"Secretary\" are provided. The Secretary cannot make payments to any qualified entity for in-person contact with a mortgagor after 24 months from completing required actions."
