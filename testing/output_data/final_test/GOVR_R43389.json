    "content": "The Constitution grants Congress the power to control federal debt policy, allowing them to express views on fiscal policies. Congress imposed an aggregate limit on federal debt in 1917 during World War I funding. Over time, Treasury Secretaries were given more leeway in debt management. In 1939, Congress agreed to impose an aggregate limit, giving the U.S. Treasury authority to manage federal debt structure. The statutory debt limit applies to almost all federal debt, including debt held by the public and the government itself. The federal government's debt includes debt held by the public and debt held by government accounts like federal trust funds. The government's on-budget fiscal balance does not directly impact debt held in government accounts. The change in debt held by the public is mainly influenced by the government's surpluses or deficits and the expansion of the government's balance sheet through loan programs. Only the net subsidy cost of these loans is considered under federal budgetary rules. The debt limit suspension lapsed on March 1, 2019, resetting at $21.988 trillion. U.S. Treasury Secretary invoked extraordinary measures to meet federal obligations. Issuance of state and local government securities was halted but expected to resume. The issuance of State and Local Government Securities (SLGs) was halted due to the debt limit suspension, but it is expected to resume once the current debt limit episode is resolved. Estimates suggest that Treasury could meet federal obligations until just before or just after October 1, 2019, with uncertainties due to federal deficits, economic uncertainty, changes in the federal tax system, and IRS operations. The debt limit issue was previously tied to funding measures for FY2018. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 suspended the debt limit through March 1, 2019. In January 2019, the House adopted a rule to automatically suspend the debt limit when approving a budget resolution for the fiscal year. Congress has chosen to suspend the debt limit instead of raising it by a fixed amount in recent years. After a suspension of the debt limit, the U.S. Treasury has minimal headroom and employs extraordinary measures to manage cash and debt. These measures include suspending debt sales, adjusting debt auctions, and withholding certain government trust fund receipts. The U.S. Treasury employs extraordinary measures after a debt limit suspension, including suspending investments in certain government trust funds and redeeming securities. The Treasury Secretary is required to replenish these funds after the debt limit issue is resolved. The duration of these measures depends on deficit spending, cash flow timing, and other technical factors. The impact of recent tax changes and potential future changes in Congress also play a role in the borrowing capacity extension. The U.S. Treasury employs extraordinary measures after a debt limit suspension, including suspending investments in certain government trust funds and redeeming securities. The duration of these measures depends on deficit spending, cash flow timing, and other technical factors. Recent tax changes and potential future changes in Congress could affect revenue projections and borrowing capacity extension. Treasury cash flow projections are uncertain, making it difficult to estimate how long extraordinary measures would enable the federal government to meet its financial obligations. Estimates by others on reaching the debt limit have been close to Treasury's estimates. The U.S. Treasury Inspector General reported a margin of error in these estimates. An impending debt ceiling constraint presents multiple deadlines, including the exhaustion of borrowing capacity. The U.S. Treasury could meet obligations using available cash balances, but complications may arise as cash runs down. Low cash balances could complicate debt management and Treasury auctions. Debt limit episodes strain Treasury staff and could lead to severe financial dislocation if timely payments cannot be made. During debt limit episodes, timely payments on Treasury securities could be delayed, leading to disruptions in repo lending arrangements. The Federal Reserve indicated readiness to backstop the Treasury market in case of a political deadlock, with contingency plans in place for potential Treasury payment delays. The Federal Reserve had contingency plans in place in December 2013 for Treasury payment delays, warning that such measures only slightly reduce operational difficulties. Debt limit changes occurred frequently in the past two decades, with modifications made to prevent delays in Social Security payments in 1996. Since 1997, debt limit increases have been unnecessary due to federal surpluses, but deficits have been persistent since 2002. Since FY2002, the federal government has faced persistent deficits due to major tax cuts and increased spending. Congress has implemented measures to raise the debt limit, with dates of enactment not always aligning with when increases occur. Suspending the debt limit results in no fixed number in legislation, with new levels set only when the suspension ends. The 2011 debt limit episode garnered significant attention compared to recent instances. The 2011 debt limit episode attracted attention from credit ratings agencies and economists due to concerns about financial consequences if the U.S. Treasury couldn't fund federal obligations. Debate reflected growing worries about fiscal sustainability, with projections showing shrinking deficits in the short term but rising deficits later on. The current trajectory of federal borrowing is deemed unsustainable by the CBO. The current trajectory of federal borrowing is unsustainable, leading to slower economic growth in the long run as debt rises as a percentage of GDP. Without policy changes, Congress would need to raise the debt limit repeatedly to accommodate the growing federal debt. In 2011, the U.S. Treasury Secretary announced a debt issuance suspension period to extend borrowing capacity until August 2, 2011. If the Treasury had exhausted its borrowing authority, it could have used cash balances to meet obligations for a period of time. In 2011, the U.S. Treasury projected its borrowing capacity would be exhausted by July 8, but extended it to early August with extraordinary measures. The debt limit was set to be reached on August 2, prompting the introduction of a bill to raise it to $16,700 billion on May 24, which was later defeated. In May 2011, a bill to raise the debt limit to $16,700 billion was introduced but was defeated in a House vote. The Cut, Cap, and Balance Act of 2011 was passed by the House on July 19, increasing the limit once a proposal for a balanced budget amendment was sent to the states. The Senate later tabled the bill. Some suggested cutting federal spending to avoid raising the debt limit, but significant reductions would have been needed. The expected deficit for the remainder of FY2011 was about $570 billion, requiring a spending reduction of at least $570 billion. Some suggested using the Fourteenth Amendment to ignore the debt limit, but President Obama rejected this. The Budget Control Act of 2011 was introduced by House Speaker Boehner and Majority Leader Reid, and signed into law by President Obama on August 2, 2011. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25) was signed into law by President Obama on August 2, 2011, after House and Senate approval. It included provisions for deficit reduction, raised the debt limit by $2.4 trillion, imposed discretionary spending caps, established a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, and required a vote on a balanced federal budget amendment. The Budget Control Act of 2011 included provisions for deficit reduction, raised the debt limit by $2.4 trillion, and established a mechanism for the President and Treasury Secretary to raise the debt ceiling. The legislation provided a three-step procedure for increasing the debt limit, with the first increase of $400 billion on August 2, 2011, and a second increase of $500 billion on September 22, 2011. The second increase was subject to a joint resolution of disapproval, which was rejected by the Senate on September 8, 2011. In late December 2011, the debt limit came close to its statutory limit, prompting a $1,200 billion increase. This increase matched budget reductions planned through sequestration over the FY2013-FY2021 period. The President delayed the request for the increase to allow Congress to consider a disapproval measure. The House passed a disapproval measure on January 18, 2012, but the Senate did not take up a companion measure and voted down a motion to proceed on January 26, 2012. The debt limit was increased to $16,394 billion after a motion to proceed on the House-passed measure was voted down. Other ways to trigger an increase included a balanced budget amendment or recommendations from the Super Committee. The debt limit increase was estimated to be between $1,200 billion and $1,500 billion, but the Joint Select Committee failed to agree on recommendations. The U.S. Treasury announced on December 26, 2012, that the debt would hit its limit on December 31, leading to a debt issuance suspension period. Extraordinary measures were used to meet federal payments for about two months. Treasury Secretary Geithner predicted that these measures would be exhausted quickly due to technical reasons. Treasury Secretary Geithner estimated that extraordinary measures would be exhausted between mid-February or early March 2013. Speaker John Boehner suggested tying future debt limit increases to spending cuts. House Republicans proposed a three-month debt limit suspension linked to delaying Members' salaries if a budget resolution was not agreed upon. H.R. 325 would allow Treasury to pay bills until May 18, 2013, with a new debt limit set on May 19. The House passed H.R. 325 on January 23, 2013, suspending the debt limit until May 19, 2013. The Senate passed it on January 31, and it was signed into law on February 4. The U.S. Treasury replenished funds used for federal payments, resetting its ability to use extraordinary measures. Treasury Secretary has authority to declare a \"debt issuance suspension period\" (DISP). After the debt limit suspension lapsed in May 2013, the U.S. Treasury reset the debt limit at $16,699 billion. Jacob Lew became Treasury Secretary after Timothy Geithner. The Treasury Secretary can declare a \"debt issuance suspension period\" (DISP) when necessary. After the debt limit suspension lapsed in May 2013, the U.S. Treasury reset the debt limit at $16,699 billion. Some Members believed H.R. 325 (P.L. 113-3) was meant to prevent cash accumulation by the Treasury. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew declared a new debt issuance suspension period on May 20, 2013, allowing the Treasury to use extraordinary measures until August 2, 2013. The U.S. Treasury used extraordinary measures to meet federal obligations until October 11, 2013. Secretary Lew urged Congress to raise the debt limit in a timely fashion. Stronger revenue collections and slower federal spending in 2013 reduced the deficit compared to previous years. Special dividends from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also extended the Treasury's ability to meet obligations. In May 2013, Goldman Sachs projected that federal borrowing capacity would be exhausted in early October with the addition of Fannie Mae dividends and a $16.70 trillion limit. Treasury cash flow estimates have a margin of error, as reported by the U.S. Treasury Inspector General in 2012. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac entered voluntary conservatorship in September 2008, with Treasury supporting them in return for senior preferred stock. Losses for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in conservatorship have been significant. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, under conservatorship since 2008, incurred losses totaling $123 billion. Despite this, they have been profitable since 2012. The firms wrote down the value of their tax assets due to doubts about their return to profitability. However, in May 2013, Fannie Mae announced a reversal of the writedown, triggering a payment of about $60 billion. Treasury agreements now mandate dividend payments based on the firms' net worth. The payment of about $60 billion from Fannie Mae to the U.S. Treasury in June 2013 was triggered by the reversal of a writedown on deferred tax assets. The U.S. Treasury received $66.3 billion from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with additional payments expected. Treasury Secretary Lew anticipated meeting federal obligations until at least Labor Day, with estimates suggesting funds could last until mid-October or November 2013. In 2011, extraordinary measures were used to fund payments until the debt ceiling was raised in August. On August 26, 2013, Treasury Secretary Lew warned that the government would run out of borrowing ability by mid-October, with only $50 billion in cash. By October 17, the Treasury would have around $30 billion in cash to meet obligations. The U.S. Treasury had an operating cash balance of $35 billion on October 8, 2013, and $35 billion on October 11, 2013. Low cash balances could complicate federal debt management and Treasury auctions in late October or early November. Yields for Treasury bills maturing after the October 17 date mentioned in Secretary Lew's September 25 letter have increased, signaling investor reluctance due to debt limit complications. Repo lending, heavily reliant on Treasury securities for collateral, could become more expensive or disrupted, as seen in past debt limit episodes. Financial markets have reacted to impending debt limit deadlines, showing concerns about the government's ability to meet obligations. In response to the debt limit episode in 2011, investors showed reluctance to hold Treasury securities affected by complications. Some funds sold Treasury holdings maturing between October 16 and November 6, 2013. Yields for Treasury bills maturing after October 17 rose sharply, reflecting concerns about the Treasury's borrowing capacity. Market yields on Treasury bills rose sharply for bills maturing after the projected date of the Treasury's borrowing capacity exhaustion. Yields for bills maturing in October 2013 increased significantly, but returned to previous levels after the enactment of a debt limit measure. Congressional discussions on federal debt policy raised various policy issues. On January 22, 2013, the House Ways and Means Committee and other committees held hearings on the history and impact of the debt limit. The Senate Finance Committee also held hearings on the debt limit on October 10, 2013, with testimony from Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew. Additionally, on April 30, 2013, the House Ways and Means Committee reported H.R. 807, granting the Treasury Secretary authority to borrow for funding. The House Ways and Means Committee reported H.R. 807, granting the Treasury Secretary authority to borrow for funding debt payments. The House passed an amended version of H.R. 807 on May 9, 2013. The Senate passed a version of H.J.Res. 59 without provisions from H.R. 807 on September 27. The Obama Administration threatened to veto H.R. 807 or similar provisions. The October 2013 debt limit measure (H.R. 2775) did not include payment prioritization provisions. The U.S. Treasury's financial management of the Social Security program could be affected if the debt limit is reached, leading to constraints and challenges. The Treasury is responsible for making beneficiary payments, reinvesting payroll taxes, and paying interest to the Social Security trust funds. Special Treasury securities funded by Social Security receipts or interest payments are subject to the debt limit, requiring sufficient headroom for issuance. If the debt limit is reached and extraordinary measures are exhausted, the Treasury Secretary's legal authority may be impacted. The Treasury Secretary's legal requirement to reinvest Social Security receipts by issuing special Treasury securities could be difficult to reconcile with the statutory debt limit. Treasury Secretary Lew notified Congress that the government would exhaust its borrowing capacity around October 17, with only $30 billion in projected cash balance. Congress passed a measure to suspend the debt limit until February, which was signed by the President. The debt limit was suspended until February 8, 2014, after the President certified that the Treasury would be unable to meet commitments without issuing debt. A resolution of disapproval was passed in the House but not in the Senate, allowing the debt limit increase to proceed. The debt limit suspension ended on February 7, with provisions similar to those enacted in 2011 and 2013. The U.S. Treasury was prevented from accumulating excess cash reserves for extending extraordinary measures. Various proposals were made to modify the debt limit, including S. 1569 introduced by Senate Majority Leader Reid on October 8, 2013. The proposal aimed to extend the debt limit through February 15, 2014, and restrict the Treasury Secretary's ability to use extraordinary measures until April 15, 2014. It also included extending discretionary funding at \"sequester levels\" until December 15, 2013. The resolution of the debt limit issue in October 2013 led to further developments in early 2014. The U.S. Treasury might exhaust its ability to meet federal obligations in March, with estimates ranging from February to early June. Goldman Sachs projected exhaustion of headroom by mid to late March, but possibly lasting until June. Waiting until mid-March to address the debt limit could pose serious risks for the government's financial situation. Treasury continued to warn Congress of the consequences as the debt limit suspension neared. The U.S. Treasury warned Congress about the consequences of not raising the debt limit as the suspension neared its end in February 2014. Despite the ability to use extraordinary measures, cash outflows from tax refunds limited the Treasury's ability to meet federal obligations. Secretary Lew called for an increase in the debt limit before the suspension ended on February 7, 2014. On February 7, 2014, the U.S. Treasury reset the debt limit to $17,212 billion and suspended sales of State and Local Government Series (SLGS). Secretary Lew declared a debt issuance suspension period (DISP) allowing the use of extraordinary measures until February 27. Congress quickly addressed the debt limit by passing a bill to suspend it through March 15, 2015. The debt limit was raised through March 15, 2015, with the U.S. Treasury prohibited from creating a cash reserve above that level. The measure also reversed a 1% reduction in the cost-of-living adjustment for certain working-age military retirees and extended sequestration of nonexempt mandatory spending from FY2023 to FY2024. The House voted to suspend the debt limit through March 15, 2015, with amended restrictions on Treasury debt management. The Senate voted to reverse reductions in cost-of-living adjustments to working-age military retiree pensions and extend nondefense mandatory sequestration. The President signed the measure into law on February 15, 2014, without requiring a presidential certification. Another measure was signed on the same day to reverse reductions in pensions for military retirees who entered service before 2014. The debt limit, previously suspended through March 15, 2015, was reinstated the next day at $18,113 billion. Treasury Secretary Lew notified congressional leaders on March 6, 2015, about Treasury's actions regarding federal obligations. Treasury Secretary Lew suspended issuance of State and Local Government Series (SLGS) bonds on March 13, 2015, due to the debt limit suspension. He declared a Debt Issuance Suspension Period (DISP) on March 16, 2015, using extraordinary measures to meet federal fiscal obligations until July 30, 2015. Extraordinary powers were invoked again until the end of October to ensure meeting federal financial obligations. The U.S. Treasury changed its cash management policy in May 2015 to ensure meeting federal obligations even in case of market disruption. Secretary Lew highlighted potential events like natural disasters or cyber-attacks that could affect market access. The new policy does not impact the debt limit constraints, with remaining funds and cash reserves providing headroom. The U.S. Treasury changed its cash management policy in May 2015 to ensure meeting federal obligations in case of market disruption. Secretary Lew highlighted potential events like natural disasters or cyber-attacks that could affect market access. The new policy does not impact the debt limit constraints, with remaining funds and cash reserves providing headroom for extraordinary measures. Treasury's headroom expands when federal receipts exceed outlays, except for intragovernmental accounts like Social Security. When outlays are funded by intragovernmental accounts, Treasury's headroom is offset by the need for additional borrowing or drawing down cash balances. Secretary Lew stated that extraordinary measures would be exhausted by November 3, 2015, with a projected cash reserve of less than $30 billion on hand. The U.S. Treasury's cash reserve, projected at less than $30 billion, would be exhausted by early November 2015. Independent forecasts aligned with the Treasury's estimates, with one private forecast indicating a headroom under the debt limit of $38 billion on November 5, 2015. The Congressional Budget Office projected that the extraordinary measures would be depleted in the first half of November, with Treasury's available resources falling below $50 billion. Previous estimates suggested that the debt limit would be reached around the same time. The U.S. Treasury's borrowing capacity would be exhausted by early November 2015, with projections suggesting it could last until the end of November or early December. Lower tax receipts and higher federal trust fund investments delayed the exhaustion date. On October 9, 2015, the Treasury issued a summary of debt balances, showing $355 billion of its available $369 billion in extraordinary measures had been used. The U.S. Treasury had used $355 billion of its available $369 billion in extraordinary measures as of October 7, 2015, leaving $14 billion for upcoming obligations. Secretary Lew highlighted the uncertainty in projections due to fluctuating tax collections and expenditures. The Bipartisan Budget Agreement of 2015 proposed suspending the debt limit until March 15, 2017, with it reinstating the following day at a level reflecting incurred federal obligations during the suspension period. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 suspended the debt limit until March 15, 2017, with provisions to increase discretionary spending caps for FY2016 and FY2017. The House and Senate concurred with the amendments, and the President signed the measure into law (P.L. 114-74) on November 2, 2015. The 2015 debt limit episode was resolved by suspending the debt limit until March 15, 2017. The House passed H.R. 692 on October 21, 2015, granting the Treasury Secretary authority to borrow for debt payments. H.R. 3442 required the Treasury Secretary to report to Congress during a debt limit episode. The U.S. Treasury submitted reports on extraordinary measures used during the episode. In May 2015, Treasury officials announced a policy shift to maintain a larger cash balance of approximately $150 billion to meet federal obligations in case of a disruption in capital markets. Concerns were raised in a November 2016 meeting about the debt limit constraints in 2017 and changes in money market funds increasing demand for Treasury bills. CBO estimated that extraordinary measures could cover federal obligations until fall 2017, but uncertainties remain due to economic changes and federal revenue flows. The Treasury Secretary invoked extraordinary measures in March 2017 to ensure federal obligations were met, with the debt limit reset at $19,809 billion. Administration officials urged Congress to raise the debt limit due to slower federal receipts, potentially exhausting Treasury's capacity sooner than expected. On July 28, 2017, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin informed Congress that extraordinary measures would be used until September 29, 2017, as tax receipts showed stronger growth. Despite projections, Treasury's cash reserves were expected to fall below prudent levels by mid-September. Mnuchin emphasized the need for legislative action by the critical date, while others estimated federal obligations could be met until early October 2017. The debt limit measure tied to legislation responding to Hurricane Harvey was agreed upon by President Trump and congressional leaders on September 6, 2017. The Senate passed an amended version of H.R. 601 to suspend the debt limit and provide funding for government operations through December 8, 2017, as well as supplemental appropriations for disaster relief. The House also agreed on the measure, which was signed by the President the same day. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin used extraordinary measures once the debt limit suspension lapsed after December 8, 2017. After the debt limit suspension lapsed on December 8, 2017, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin extended authorities until the end of February. Extraordinary measures were estimated to last until early March. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 resolved the debt limit issue until 2019 on February 9, 2018. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 resolved the debt limit issue through March 1, 2019, with increased discretionary spending caps and extended government funding. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin invoked extraordinary measures to meet federal obligations until October 1, 2019. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin used extraordinary measures to meet federal obligations until just before or just after October 1, 2019, as some private forecasts estimated Treasury's resources would be exhausted around August 2019."
