    "content": "In 1993, Russia applied to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which was succeeded by the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995. After an 18-year process, Russia was invited to join the WTO in 2011. The Russian parliament approved the protocol of accession in July 2012, and President Putin signed it into law, allowing Russia to formally join the WTO in August 2012. Russia's pending accession to the WTO has garnered significant interest from Congress and the U.S. policymaking establishment. Being the largest economy outside the WTO, Russia's accession could impact the future of the organization. Some stakeholders are concerned about repeating the perceived mistakes made during China's accession, emphasizing the importance of ensuring Russia's compliance with WTO rules. Russia's accession to the WTO is tied to the U.S. passing legislation for permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) with Russia. Congress passed H.R. 6156, and the President signed it into law (P.L. 112-208) on December 14, 2012. This report gives an overview of the WTO and the accession process. The report provides an overview of the WTO, Russia's accession process, U.S. policy on the accession, and the potential impact on Russian trade with the United States. The WTO, with 153 members, aims to facilitate trade through various agreements. The WTO membership commits countries to trade principles like Most-favored nation treatment, National treatment, Transparency, and lowering trade barriers through negotiations. The WTO conducts negotiations to lower trade barriers and bind tariff levels. Members rely on tariffs to protect sensitive sectors and avoid using quotas or nontariff measures. The WTO provides dispute resolution and trade policy reviews to ensure compliance with agreements. The WTO conducts trade regime reviews to ensure compliance with rules. Trade among members accounts for over 90% of world trade. The accession process involves a letter requesting membership and forming a working party to consider the application. The U.S. delegation was part of the working party on Russia's accession. The accession process for WTO membership involves detailed negotiations with the Working Party (WP) on trade regime commitments, including discussions on market-opening concessions and compliance with WTO rules. The accession process for WTO membership involves negotiations with the Working Party (WP) on market-opening concessions, tariffs, and services commitments. Bilateral agreements are consolidated into draft schedules on goods and services for all WTO members. WP operates by consensus, with any member able to halt proceedings. The WP report includes commitments on rules, schedules on goods and services, a draft Protocol of Accession, and a draft Decision for the General Council to invite the applicant-country to accede to the WTO. The WTO accession process involves approval by at least two-thirds of members, with no set timeframe. The process can vary in length depending on factors such as complexity and political will. Since 1995, 25 countries have acceded, with the shortest taking 2 years and 10 months (Kyrgyz Republic) and the longest taking 15 years and 5 months. Russia's WTO accession process has been ongoing for over 15 years, surpassing the previous record. The country's transition from central planning has been challenging due to the deeply entrenched communist system and lack of a market economy legacy. Policymakers have supported restructuring and reform efforts to align with post-Soviet economic changes. The Soviet economy prioritized military needs over private sector production and consumer demand. Boris Yeltsin initiated Russia's WTO accession process in 1993 amidst political instability, including confrontations with the Supreme Soviet and economic challenges like high inflation and a financial crisis in 1998. During his first presidential term (2000-2004), Vladimir Putin promoted Russia's integration into the world economy and accession to the WTO to revive the economy. However, in his second term (2004-2008), Putin reversed economic reforms by increasing state control over critical sectors. Putin retrenched on economic reform by reasserting state control over critical economic sectors, including oil and natural gas, and halting other structural reforms. The arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovskiy in 2003 generated skepticism about Putin's commitment to economic restructuring and led to concerns among foreign investors. Despite this, the Russian economy experienced strong growth due to increasing world oil prices. The Russian economy saw strong growth due to increasing world oil prices and prudent fiscal policies. Progress was made towards WTO accession despite Putin's wavering support. The global financial crisis in 2008 led to an economic downturn, revealing the economy's dependence on oil production and exports. This crisis marked the beginning of a new phase in Russian economic policy under President Dmitri Medvedev. Russia's economy faced challenges due to a decrease in oil prices and financial weaknesses. Investor unease was also present after a military confrontation with Georgia. Despite progress towards WTO accession, Putin announced a change in strategy in 2009, causing delays and raising doubts about Russia's commitment. Russia, along with two other countries, faced resistance from WTO members but decided to pursue accession separately. President Obama and President Medvedev pledged to resolve bilateral issues, with the US offering technical assistance. By October 1, 2010, most bilateral issues, including intellectual property rights, were resolved. Russia began the WTO accession process in 1994 and established a Working Party in 1995. The process of Russia's accession to the WTO began in 1995, with negotiations and clarifications on trade regime descriptions. Bilateral negotiations with WTO members started in 1998, and by 2009, most were completed. The final working party report was attached to the Protocol of Accession in November 2011. Russia's accession to the WTO was approved in December 2011, with commitments to comply with WTO agreements on tariff rates. Bound tariff rates provide flexibility, with Russia's average applied tariff rate on manufactured goods decreasing from 12.1% in 2005 to 9.5% in 2011. Russia's tariff rate on manufactured goods decreased from 12.1% in 2005 to 9.5% in 2011. High tariff rates are maintained on sensitive products like cars and cigarettes. Tariffs on various goods will be reduced, including wide-body aircraft to 7.5%, narrow-bodied aircraft to 12.5%, and aerospace engines to 5%. Other reductions include automobiles to 12%, construction equipment to 5.5%, agricultural equipment to 5.6%, medical equipment to 4.9%, high-tech instruments to 4.4%, and chemicals to 5.2%. Russia has committed to reducing tariffs on various goods, including machinery, electrical equipment, consumer goods, and textiles. They have also agreed to eliminate tariffs on information technology products and implement 95% of these commitments within the first three years of accession. Agricultural product imports, especially meats, have been a contentious issue in trade relations with other countries. Russia's high tariffs and tariff-rate quotas on agricultural imports, along with sanitary and phytosanitary controls, have been contentious issues during WTO accession negotiations. Agricultural subsidies and trade commitments were mainly negotiated with the United States, the EU, and the Cairns group. Russia agreed to reduce and bind tariffs on dairy products, cereals, oilseeds, fats, oils, wood, and paper. Russia has agreed to reduce tariffs on agricultural imports, including cereals, oilseeds, fats, oils, wood, and paper. Specific tariff-rate quotas have been set for pork, poultry, and beef imports. Russia will adhere to WTO Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement to protect human, animal, and plant health. The SPS Agreement aims to prevent disguised protectionism by requiring standards based on science, non-discrimination, minimal trade distortion, and equivalence to facilitate trade. Members can use higher standards if scientifically justified, and exporting countries demonstrating equivalent safety measures should be accepted by importing countries. Russia's implementation of SPS agreement has been a challenge due to rigid requirements for imported products, impacting US exports of meats, dairy, and grains. Russia's SPS requirements have been criticized by other agriculture exporting countries for not aligning with international standards. Bilateral negotiations with the US, EU, and Cairns Group focused on Russia adopting laws to follow international SPS standards. The formation of the Customs Union with Belarus and Kazakhstan led to harmonization of customs regulations, including SPS regimes, among the three countries. CU authorities now issue SPS certificates instead of national agencies. Russia's commitments to adhere to international SPS standards, including membership in Codex Alimentarius, OIE, and IPPC, are being ensured in CU regulations. Russia has agreed to negotiate veterinary export certificates and refrain from suspending imports without allowing corrective measures. Russia has agreed to eliminate all agricultural export subsidies and reduce trade-distorting subsidies to $4.4 billion by 2018. They will also limit product-specific subsidies to 30% of allowable trade-distorting subsidies. Additionally, Russia maintains export duties on hydrocarbons, scrap metals, and other strategic materials. In 2007, Russia introduced export duties on raw lumber to support domestic processors, causing tension with the EU. After negotiations, export duties were set at 13%-15% instead of increasing to 80%. The EU Trade Commissioner confirmed resolution of the issue in 2011, crucial for Finland's lumber industry. The US prioritized opening Russia's services sector during WTO negotiations. The United States led negotiations to open Russia's services sector, focusing on financial services. Russian commitments were obtained in insurance and banking, allowing 100% foreign ownership of non-life insurance companies and phasing out restrictions on foreign participation in life insurance over five years. Russia will increase the number of licenses for foreign life insurance companies and raise the ceiling on total foreign ownership in the banking sector to 50%. Foreign banks can open subsidiaries under the regulatory control of the Russian central bank. In telecommunications, Russia will eliminate the government monopoly on land-line long distance services. Russia has agreed to eliminate the government monopoly on land-line long distance services and allow foreign-owned telecommunications companies to operate in any sector. They will establish an independent telecommunications regulator separate from the Ministry of Communications to avoid conflicts of interest. Additionally, Russia will increase market access for foreign providers of professional and business services, including allowing foreign-owned companies to establish 100%-owned business service companies in Russia. They will also permit foreign-owned providers of distribution services to establish wholly owned subsidiaries in Russia. Russia will open its market to foreign audio-visual service suppliers in motion picture distribution and projection services, sales of television and radio programs, and allow foreign audio-visual companies to operate as 100% foreign-owned entities. Additionally, Russia has committed to opening its services markets to energy services and computer-related services providers. Despite improvements in intellectual property rights protection, enforcement remains weak, particularly in combating Internet piracy. Russia has made commitments to improve its intellectual property rights protection, especially in combating Internet piracy. This includes measures such as closing down production of pirated optical media and denying licenses to past offenders. These commitments were made in bilateral negotiations with the United States and other World Trade Organization members. Russia has enacted legislation to combat piracy and counterfeiting, shut down illegal distribution websites, protect pharmaceutical test data, and strengthen border enforcement. The United States is cautious about Russia's enforcement and seeks \"on-the-ground results.\" The WTO TRIMS agreement aims to prevent trade distortion through restrictions on foreign direct investments. The TRIMS agreement prohibits trade-performance requirements for foreign direct investors. In 2005, Russia implemented a program to promote domestic auto production, with criteria including local content and production operations in Russia. By 2011, the requirements were increased for reduced import duties on components. The United States and the EU raised concerns about Russia's program promoting domestic auto production, which violated the TRIMS agreement. The US secured a commitment from Russia to end the program by 2018, while the EU negotiated for compensation to mitigate the impact on its auto parts exports. Additionally, there were concerns about Russia's subsidies for natural gas prices, which were seen as giving unfair advantages to domestic producers in energy-intensive industries. Russia's agreement to price natural gas at market prices to commercial users while subsidizing prices for households and non-commercial users raised concerns about unfair advantages in energy-intensive industries. As part of its WTO accession, Russia agreed to join the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) within four years, allowing firms from other signatories access to certain government contracts. This has economic policy implications for Russia. Russia's WTO accession has economic policy implications for Russia, including introducing greater certainty in trade relations with other members, adherence to WTO rules limiting trade restrictions, and potential sanctions for non-compliance. It is also expected to improve the Russian business climate for traders and foreign investors. Russia's WTO accession would make it a less risky place for traders and foreign investors, providing a seat at the negotiating table. A World Bank study predicts a 3.3% increase in GDP in the medium term and an 11% increase in the long term due to more efficient resource allocation, reduced tariffs, and increased competition from imports. Improved terms of trade and measures taken by Russia would also contribute to GDP growth. The study predicts that Russia's accession to the WTO would lead to significant economic growth, with the largest contribution coming from liberalizing foreign investment in services. This would benefit industries like non-ferrous metals and chemicals, while negatively impacting machinery, food, and construction materials. The U.S. government has supported Russia's WTO accession as part of efforts to improve relations. The United States has provided advice to Russia on making its trade and investment regime WTO compatible and educating Russian firms on WTO implications. U.S. support for Russia's WTO accession is crucial due to its influence within the organization. This support is part of a broader U.S. policy to encourage Russia to establish a market economy and foster cooperation in the U.S.-Russian relationship. Technical assistance and trade preferences have been provided to support Russia in trade and investment areas. The U.S. has provided technical assistance, trade preferences, and financial aid to support trade and investment with Russia. Trade and investment between the two countries have increased post-Cold War, with U.S. exports rising significantly. U.S. exports include meat, machinery parts, and aircraft parts, while imports from Russia have also increased. Bilateral trade between the United States and Russia increased from $7.8 billion to $26.8 billion from 2000 to 2008, driven by higher world prices of oil and natural resources. Despite the growth, both countries remain moderately important trade partners, with Russia accounting for 1.6% of U.S. imports and 0.6% of U.S. exports in 2010. Investment relations between the two countries are also modest. Investment relations between the United States and Russia are modest, with the U.S. accounting for less than 2.5% of total accumulated foreign direct and portfolio investment in Russia by the end of 2010. U.S. exporters and investors are cautious about entering the Russian market due to various factors such as weak enforcement of intellectual property rights, burdensome taxation, and government corruption. Russia's accession to the WTO could potentially impact the relationship. Russia's WTO accession could bring stability and predictability to the relationship with the United States, limiting unilateral actions and enforcing trade agreements. It is forecasted to increase U.S. exports of agricultural products and aircraft parts due to reduced tariffs and standardized measures. The United States could benefit from increased exports of civil aircraft, telecommunications equipment, and pharmaceuticals with lower Russian tariffs. Improved enforcement of intellectual property rights and concessions on foreign investment could boost investor confidence and U.S. business investment in Russia. \"Normal trade relations\" (NTR) or \"most-favored-nation\" (MFN) trade status ensures nondiscriminatory treatment of trading partners, with Title IV of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974 imposing conditions on Russia's status not applied to other WTO members. The United States invoked non-application under Section 402, the Jackson-Vanik amendment, to comply with the MFN principle before Russia enters the WTO. This allows the US to opt-out of certain obligations towards Russia, ensuring that WTO rules and mechanisms do not apply in trade with Russia. On December 16, 2011, the US invoked non-application when Russia joined the WTO. The House and Senate passed H.R. 6156, signed into law on December 14, 2012. President Obama extended PNTR status to Russia on December 20. Russia formally joined the WTO on August 22, 2012, after a 19-year process, facing challenges due to domestic uncertainties. Russia's accession to the WTO was delayed by international crises and the formation of a customs union with Belarus and Kazakhstan. A dispute with Georgia over trade monitoring threatened to further delay the process, but was resolved with the help of Swiss mediators. By joining the WTO, Russia commits to aligning its trade laws with WTO rules, integrating its trading system with the global economy. Russia's integration into the WTO involves commitments such as nondiscriminatory treatment of imports, binding tariff levels, transparency in trade measures, limiting agriculture subsidies, enforcing intellectual property rights, and refraining from local content requirements. This move allows Russia to shape and implement international trade rules while holding other WTO members accountable. Russia's WTO membership will hold other partners accountable for adhering to trade rules with Russia, making relations more stable. It will attract foreign investors by locking in trade reforms and boosting economic growth. Russia's accession expands the WTO umbrella to major economies, allowing Russia to shape the agenda, which can be positive or negative depending on interests. NTR or MFN status ensures nondiscriminatory treatment, with only Cuba and North Korea lacking this status. In trade, NTR status grants lower import duties, benefiting countries with this status. The Trade Act of 1974 denies NTR status to communist countries, except Poland and Yugoslavia. The Jackson-Vanik amendment restricts NTR status and U.S. credit facilities for countries that limit freedom of emigration. The Jackson-Vanik amendment restricts NTR status and U.S. credit facilities for countries that limit freedom of emigration. The President can determine compliance with freedom-of-emigration conditions, with semiannual reports to Congress. The President can waive these requirements if it promotes freedom of emigration, subject to annual renewal and congressional disapproval. The United States and a country must have a bilateral agreement for reciprocal NTR or MFN treatment before receiving NTR status. A congressional joint resolution is required for the agreement to go into effect. In 1990, the US and the Soviet Union signed a trade agreement under the Trade Act of 1974, which was later applied to US-Russian trade relations. Russia has received NTR status since 1994 under the presidential waiver authority. Since September 1994, Russia has received NTR status under the full compliance provision, with presidential extensions facing little congressional opposition."
