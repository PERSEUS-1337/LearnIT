It can receive signals from 25 megahertz to 10 gigahertz and has transmitters for solar and ionospheric studies. The Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, managed by SRI International, is the world's largest single-dish radio telescope, measuring 1,000 feet across. It has unrivaled sensitivity and can access 40.0% of the sky. Initially designed for radar studies of Earth's ionosphere, it was also valuable for research in radio and radar astronomy. Construction began in 1960 with funding from the Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency, and it was commissioned for service in 1963. Ownership was transferred to the National Science Foundation in 1970. The Arecibo Observatory, managed by SRI International, is the world's largest single-dish radio telescope, measuring 1,000 feet across. It was initially funded by the Defense Department and later transferred to the National Science Foundation. The telescope underwent upgrades in 1974 and 1997, increasing its capabilities and enabling it to operate at higher frequencies. The upgrades were funded by NSF and NASA, totaling $8.0 million. The Arecibo Observatory underwent a $25.0 million upgrade, funded by NSF and NASA, to operate at up to 10 GHZ. This upgrade increased the telescope's sensitivity, frequency coverage, and agility, enabling dual-beam incoherent scatter radar capability for new research opportunities in radio astronomy, planetary radar, and ionospheric observations. The observatory has been used for research in various areas such as interstellar gas, pulsars, Earth's ionosphere, galactic structure, pre-biotic molecules, planetary surfaces, moons, and near-Earth asteroids. The Arecibo Observatory made significant discoveries, including determining Mercury's correct rotation rate, finding a binary pulsar, discovering planets outside the solar system, and mapping galaxy distribution. In 1982, it identified hydroxyl megamaser radio emissions indicating galaxy collisions. In 1997, the NRC established the Astronomy and Astrophysics Survey Committee to assess the field for the 2000-2010 decade. The 2000 decadal survey report on Astronomy and Astrophysics emphasized the need for balancing long-term support for facility operations and research grants with new technological opportunities. Recommendations were made for coordinating programs between NSF, NASA, and DOE, as well as exploring international collaborations and partnerships. Competitive reviews of astronomy facilities were recommended every five years, aligning with the Connecting Quarks with the Cosmos report. The 2008 annual report of the federal Astronomy and Astrophysics Advisory Committee highlighted the need for AST to adapt to new scientific opportunities and operational models for future astronomy facilities. It emphasized the importance of supporting current facilities while making cuts to fund new, more powerful facilities. The report also suggested exploring alternative funding sources and partnerships to ensure long-term stability for Arecibo. The 2010 report by the National Research Council analyzed near-earth objects (NEOs) and mitigation strategies, highlighting the unique role of the Arecibo and Goldstone radar systems in characterizing NEOs with unmatched accuracy. International partnerships and joint projects were suggested to increase support and share responsibility, despite potential managerial complexities. The report recommended exploring collaborations with other institutions in Puerto Rico and seeking support from NSF's Division of Atmospheric Sciences. The report emphasized the crucial role of the Arecibo and Goldstone radar systems in characterizing NEOs with unmatched accuracy. Immediate action is needed to maintain and staff the Arecibo Observatory, with recommendations for NASA and NSF to support radar observations of NEOs. The 2010 decadal survey provided a comprehensive review of strategic planning in astronomy and astrophysics. The Astro2010 survey focused on interagency issues among NSF's AST, NASA's Astrophysics Division, and DOE's Office of Science, High Energy Physics. Recommendations were made for funding levels for astronomical research, prioritizing both unrealized projects and new research activities. NSF-Astronomy was advised to complete its next senior review before a mid-decade independent review to determine which facilities to cease supporting for new telescope construction and science analysis. In 2005-2006, NSF's AST conducted a Senior Review of its facilities to identify potential reinvestment in high-priority programs and improve operational efficiency. The review recommended changes to redirect savings from existing programs to support new activities, including restructuring Arecibo's operations. The Senior Review recommended decreasing Arecibo's annual budget from $12.0 million to $9.0 million in FY2009 and securing partnerships for the remaining necessary funding to address the deficit in the astronomy budget. The Senior Review recommended decreasing Arecibo's annual budget from $12.0 million to $9.0 million in FY2009 and securing partnerships for the remaining necessary funding. If alternative funding sources or partnerships could not be obtained by 2011, the Observatory should be dismantled. The recommendation recognized Arecibo's scientific contributions but suggested a decrease in AST support due to the uncertainty of its long-term scientific program. The Senior Review recommends decreasing AST support for Arecibo to $8 million over the next three years, allowing for a reduction in staff and discontinuation of future instrumentation programs without compromising the main science program. They suggest that NAIC either close Arecibo or operate it with a much smaller budget, requiring external funding to continue operations. If kept open beyond 2011, it would be a limited term extension pending the next decadal survey. Supporters argue that NSF's increasing budget should result in additional funding for AST and Arecibo. The NSF's Senior Review recommends reducing AST support for Arecibo to $8 million over three years, potentially leading to staff cuts and discontinuation of future programs. Concerns have been raised about the lack of priority given to solar system science, with some arguing that the planetary radar research program at Arecibo is at risk. The Arecibo radar system plays a significant role in detecting near-Earth objects (NEOs), with calls for NASA to provide funding due to the benefits of tracking NEOs. The NASA Authorization Act, 2005, directs NASA to track and catalogue near-Earth objects (NEOs). NASA believes NSF should support the Observatory, as it focuses on space-based programs. The Senior Review report highlighted NASA's reluctance to support ground-based telescopes, despite their scientific productivity. Revisiting the working relationship between NASA and NSF is necessary. Cornell University planned to terminate Arecibo's planetary radar operations in 2007. The University planned to terminate Arecibo's planetary radar operations in October 2007 due to budget constraints, but continued on a reduced schedule. The Senior Review suggested seeking partners to share costs and keep the telescope competitive. Efforts are being made to balance operating older facilities with constructing new ones. The report estimated that closing and decommissioning Arecibo could cost $88.0 million. The closure and decommissioning of the Arecibo Observatory could cost an estimated $88.0 million, approximately eight times its current annual operating cost. Funding from various sources was anticipated to support additional astronomical research, asteroid-detection efforts, and atmospheric research at the Observatory. Funding from the Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences (AGS) was set to increase from $2.3 million to $4.0 million by FY2015, while funding from AST decreased from $6.2 million in FY2011 to an estimated $5.5 million in FY2012. The Arecibo Observatory's funding decreased from $6.2 million in FY2011 to an estimated $5.5 million in FY2012, with further decreases expected to $4.0 million by FY2015. NASA provided $2.0 million in FY2011 and has budget plans to support planetary radar. NSF awarded a $42.0 million contract to SRI International to manage the Arecibo, which operates on a $10.7 million budget. The Administration's FY2013 budget request for NSF provides $8.2 million for the Arecibo Observatory. The FY2013 budget request for NSF allocates $8.2 million for the Arecibo Observatory, with $5.0 million from AST and $3.2 million from AGS. The FY2012 support was $5.5 million from AST and $3.2 million from AGS. The Appropriations Committees express concern over the NSF's division of Astronomical Science Senior Review regarding the Observatory's funding, emphasizing its importance in scientific research areas. They hope for reconsideration of future funding decisions. In the 110th Congress, bills were introduced to provide funding for the Arecibo Observatory for research on Earth's ionosphere, radio astronomy, and the solar system. The bills also aimed to coordinate with NASA for characterizing and mitigating near-Earth objects. The 112th Congress may consider increased funding for Arecibo to support NASA's mandate on observing near-Earth objects. NASA could benefit from continued support of the Arecibo Observatory, as dismantling it and restoring the land could be more costly than maintenance. The future of Arecibo will be evaluated in a mid-decade review, with budget constraints potentially impacting programs recommended in previous surveys."
