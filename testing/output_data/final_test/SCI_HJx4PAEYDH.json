Non-recurrent models like Transformer with multi-head attention have shown effectiveness in sequence tasks. However, they struggle with modeling local structures and rely heavily on position embeddings. The R-Transformer proposed in this paper combines advantages of RNNs and multi-head attention while addressing their drawbacks. The R-Transformer model effectively captures local structures and global dependencies in sequences without position embeddings. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various tasks, overcoming recurrent neural networks' issues with gradient problems. Recently developed sequence learning models like Temporal Convolution Networks (TCN) and Transformer have addressed issues with recurrent neural networks such as gradient problems and difficulty in parallelizing computations. These models rely on convolution operations or attention mechanisms, allowing for better performance in sequence learning tasks. The Transformer model, with its multi-head attention mechanism, has shown remarkable performance in capturing long-term dependencies in sequences. However, there are issues with treating every position identically, which is mitigated by introducing position embeddings. The R-Transformer model hierarchically arranges different networks, including localRNNs for processing positions in a local window. The R-Transformer model hierarchically arranges different networks: localRNNs for local window processing, multi-head attention networks for global dependencies, and Position-wise feedforward networks for non-linear feature transformation. The model addresses limitations with padding and the need for effective position embeddings. It argues that while multi-head attention captures global dependencies, it overlooks important local structures in sequences like natural languages. The R-Transformer model proposes a novel sequence learning model that combines RNNs and the standard Transformer to address limitations in capturing local structures in sequences like natural languages. It introduces a local recurrent neural network, LocalRNN, to process signals within a local window before computing global dependencies with the multi-head attention mechanism. The R-Transformer model introduces a LocalRNN, which processes signals within local windows to capture sequence locality explicitly. By sliding the local window along the sequence, global sequential information is also incorporated. The model outperforms TCN and standard Transformer in various sequence learning tasks. The R-Transformer model introduces a LocalRNN to capture sequence locality explicitly. It outperforms TCN and standard Transformer in sequence learning tasks. Section 2 discusses the sequence modeling problem, and Section 3 presents the proposed R-Transformer model. Section 4 describes experimental details and results, while Section 5 briefly reviews related work. Section 6 concludes the work. The proposed R-Transformer model consists of a stack of identical layers with components for local structures, global dependencies, and feedforward networks. It can be extended to solve sequence-to-sequence learning problems in the future. The R-Transformer model includes components for local structures, global dependencies, and feedforward networks. It utilizes RNNs to model strong local structures in sequential data by reorganizing long sequences into short sequences processed independently. A local window of size M is constructed for each target position to capture local information and learn latent representations. The LocalRNN, a shared RNN, incorporates local structure information of each region in the sequence to learn latent representations. It focuses on short-term dependencies, processing local short sequences sequentially to output hidden states. Padding the input sequence ensures an auto-regressive processing without future information. The LocalRNN processes input sequences by padding them and outputs hidden representations that capture local sequential information. Unlike 1-D Convolutional Neural Networks, it fully incorporates sequential information within each window, unlike position embeddings which may have limitations. The LocalRNN processes short sequences within a fixed local window, mitigating long-term dependency issues and improving computation efficiency through parallel implementation. It refines representations at each position to incorporate local information effectively. The LocalRNN processes short sequences within a fixed local window to refine representations with local information. A pooling sublayer is built on top to capture global long-term dependencies using a multi-head attention mechanism, allowing direct connections between positions for refining representations efficiently. The scaled dot product is used as the attention function in the LocalRNN model, with each head attending to past positions to capture long-term dependencies. Query, key, and value vectors are projected into their respective spaces using projection matrices, allowing different heads to focus on different aspects of dependencies. The R-Transformer model utilizes multi-head attention and position-wise fully connected feed-forward networks to refine representations of each position independently. Residual and layernorm connections are added between sub-layers. The architecture of an N-layer R-Transformer is formally described, with a comparison to TCN highlighting the hierarchical structure motivation. The R-Transformer model incorporates multi-head attention and position-wise fully connected feed-forward networks to refine representations of each position independently. It contrasts with TCN in how it handles sequential information within receptive fields and global long-term dependencies. TCN uses dilated convolutions for global dependencies but misses information from nonconsecutive positions, while R-Transformer's multi-head attention pooling considers every past position for better information integration. The R-Transformer model distinguishes itself from the standard Transformer by effectively capturing locality in sequences with the LocalRNN structure and not relying on position embeddings. It is compared with various recurrent architectures and sequence models in different domains to demonstrate its advantages. The study compares R-Transformer with different sequence models like Vanilla RNN, GRU, LSTM, TCN, and Transformer. Transformer and R-Transformer were implemented with Pytorch, using the same hyperparameters and training settings. The task involves testing a model's ability to memorize long-term dependencies by rescaling images in the MNIST dataset into sequences. The dataset is split into training and testing sets using Pytorch. The study compares R-Transformer with different sequence models like Vanilla RNN, GRU, LSTM, TCN, and Transformer. The study compares different sequence models on their performance in memorizing long-term dependencies. RNNs perform worse due to difficulty in memorizing long-term dependencies, while Transformer and TCN show better results. TCN slightly outperforms Transformer, but R-Transformer incorporating LocalRNN achieves the best performance. The study evaluates R-Transformer on polyphonic music modeling with the Nottingham dataset. The dataset includes British and American folk tunes and is split into training, validation, and testing sets. Different learning rates and dropout probabilities are tested to prevent overfitting. Gradient clipping is used during training, and negative log-likelihood is chosen as the evaluation metric. LSTM and TCN models outperform others in the experimental results. The experimental results in Table 2 show that LTSM and TCN outperform Transformer in music modeling due to strong local structures. R-Transformer with LocalRNN achieves better results than Transformer and TCN, as TCN tends to ignore sequential information in local structures. R-Transformer is further evaluated on character-level and word-level language modeling tasks using the PennTreebank dataset. The PennTreebank dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets for character-level and word-level language modeling tasks. Transformer and R-Transformer models are used with specific learning rates and dropout rates. Gradient clipping is applied during training, and performance is measured using bpc. The PennTreebank dataset is divided into training, validation, and testing sets with varying word counts. Transformer, R-Transformer, and Transformer-XL models are used with specific learning rates and dropout rates. Performance is evaluated using perplexity, with lower values indicating better performance. Regularization techniques like variational dropout and weight dropout are not applied. The experimental results for character-level and word-level language modeling tasks are presented in Table 3 and Table 4. Transformer performs slightly better than RNNs but worse than other models due to its inability to fully capture strong local structures in language. TCN outperforms RNNs by capturing both local structures and long-term dependencies. R-Transformer, with components like LocalRNN and Multi-head attention, achieves significantly better results than TCN in capturing both local structures and long-term dependencies. The experimental results show that R-Transformer achieves better results than TCN in capturing local structures and long-term dependencies. Transformer-XL performs slightly better than R-Transformer in word-level language modeling, suggesting limited contribution of engineered positional embeddings. Standard Transformer outperforms RNNs in sequences with long-term dependencies but struggles with strong locality in sequences like polyphonic music and language. TCN is a strong sequence model that can effectively learn both local structures and long-term dependencies. The proposed R-Transformer, combining LocalRNN and multi-head attention, outperforms TCN and Transformer in various tasks. Experimental settings are fair, but more evaluation on larger models and datasets is needed for convincing results. Future work includes exploring LSTM variants. Recurrent Neural Networks like LSTM and GRU have been popular for sequence modeling, but they face issues with efficiency and gradient problems. Recent efforts have focused on developing models without recursive structures, divided into convolution-based and non-convolution-based categories. The first category of models in sequence modeling includes convolution-based approaches such as WaveNet and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN). These models use causal filters, dilated convolution, and gate mechanisms to capture global and local information in raw audios and model sequential dependencies in languages. TCN has been shown to outperform traditional recurrent networks in various tasks. Our R-transformer is inspired by models that focus on local and global information, particularly those utilizing multi-head attention mechanism. This mechanism, introduced in Vaswani et al. (2017) for machine translation, has been successful in learning long-term dependencies. However, it heavily relies on position embeddings, which can be challenging to design effectively. Our empirical results highlight the importance of incorporating local information in sequence learning models. The R-Transformer model combines the strengths of RNN and multi-head attention, effectively capturing local structures without the need for position embeddings. It consists of a LocalRNN for learning local structures and a multi-head attention pooling for long-term dependencies. The model allows for easy parallelization over sequence positions and has shown promising results in various sequence modeling tasks. The R-Transformer model has shown advantages over other sequence models in various tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing local structures and long-term dependencies without the need for position embeddings."
