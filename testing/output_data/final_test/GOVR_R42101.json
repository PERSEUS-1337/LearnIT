    "content": "Delegations from over 190 countries and regions gathered in Durban, South Africa from November 28 to December 9, 2011, to discuss addressing climate change under the UNFCCC. The meeting marked the 20th anniversary of the UNFCCC and the end of the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. Countries are increasingly recognizing climate change as a key driver for transitioning to more sustainable energy and economic models. The 1992 UNFCCC treaty aimed to move countries towards more efficient and less climate-vulnerable models. Parties, including the United States, committed to \"common but differentiated\" responsibilities under the UNFCCC. The Kyoto Protocol in 1997 required Annex I Parties to reduce GHG emissions by 5% below 1990 levels during the first commitment period of 2008-2012. This was seen as a first step towards including all countries in the process. The Kyoto Protocol required Annex I Parties to reduce GHG emissions, with the United States not ratifying the agreement. From 1990 to 2009, Annex I Parties decreased emissions by 11.5%, while globally emissions rose by 29% from 1990 to 2008. Negotiations for a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol were delayed, leading to the Bali Action Plan which aimed to include all Parties. However, disagreements between developed and developing countries hindered progress, resulting in the Copenhagen Accord in 2009 and the Cancun Agreements in 2010. This ongoing division continues to impede negotiations for a new agreement. Negotiations aim to establish legally binding GHG obligations for all countries, but concerns exist about maintaining momentum. Expectations for the Durban conference vary, with low-income nations and environmental groups seeking a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol with stronger GHG reduction commitments, a legal framework for new agreements, and the design of the Green Climate Fund. The Durban negotiations in 2010-2012 focused on provisions for the period of 2013-2020 and the mobilization of $100 billion annually by 2020. Some delegations, like Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, may be content with no resolutions or process collapse. The U.S. delegation's credibility is compromised due to lack of consensus on domestic policy, hindering its ability to negotiate commitments. The U.S. never became a Party to the Kyoto Protocol and has not fully addressed GHG emissions mitigation. The United States has not fully funded requests for financial support for low-emitting technology in low-income countries. Congress is divided on the country's stance in international climate change negotiations, with contrasting views from Representative Bobby L. Rush and Senator James M. Inhofe. Many doubt the U.S. Senate will ratify any climate treaty in the near future. The Durban conference will address the future of the Kyoto Protocol and the potential for future binding GHG obligations for all Parties. Despite differences within the United States and with other countries, there is a positive atmosphere in negotiations leading up to Durban. Discussions will continue on two tracks under the Kyoto Protocol and the UNFCCC, with key topics summarized in the report. The Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period is set to expire at the end of 2012, with negotiations ongoing for a subsequent commitment period. Most countries are eager to continue the protocol to maintain emissions trading mechanisms and other achievements. The Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period is set to expire at the end of 2012, with negotiations ongoing for a subsequent commitment period. Most countries are eager to continue the protocol to maintain emissions trading mechanisms and other achievements. Some Parties, like Canada, Japan, and Russia, are hesitant to offer further GHG reduction commitments without the participation of major emitters like the United States, China, India, and Brazil. Concerns also exist about the exemption of middle-income Parties from quantitative GHG reduction commitments and the distinction between \"developed\" and \"developing\" country parties. The European Union is open to another commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol. The European Union is willing to agree to another commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol but requires a clear \"road map\" to agreements including GHG obligations for all major emitting Parties. Australia and Norway propose binding emissions caps for Annex I Parties and GHG abatement actions for non-Annex I Parties by 2015. Concerns about the Kyoto Protocol include overly constraining rules, unresolved issues on emission reductions and offsets, and the potential use of unused emission allowances from the first commitment period. The Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-Term Cooperation (AWG-LCA) is divided over maintaining the distinction between developed and developing countries in climate change negotiations. Some countries, like Brazil, South Africa, India, and China (BASIC countries), support the Bali Action Plan's division of the world into developed and developing nations. There are proposals on the table to negotiate a new agreement for greenhouse gas reductions by 2015, to take effect by 2020. The United States seeks clarity on future GHG reduction agreements, wanting all major emitters, including China, to be bound by commitments. China and other large emitters resist mandatory commitments, citing concerns about achieving targets and prioritizing economic development. China argues that Annex I Parties should fulfill past commitments before negotiating new ones. The Copenhagen Accord and Cancun Agreements aim to limit warming to 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, with some countries pushing for a lower limit of 1.5\u00b0C. Analysts suggest Annex I Parties need to reduce GHG emissions by 50% below 1990 levels by 2020 and over 85% by 2050 to achieve this goal. The UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol require countries to reduce GHG emissions to 50% below 1990 levels by 2020 and more than 85% by 2050. Current pledges are not enough to meet the 2\u00b0C goal, let alone the 1.5\u00b0C option. Pressure is on for more ambitious commitments, but quantitative strengthening of pledges is not expected in Durban. Parties must report their GHG emissions, removals by sinks, policies, measures, and projections under the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol requires countries to reduce GHG emissions. Parties must report their emissions, removals, policies, and measures. The Copenhagen Accord and Cancun Agreements call for international assessment and review of emission reduction targets. Non-Annex I Parties receiving international financing are subject to monitoring and verification. The reporting requirements for countries receiving international financing for mitigation and adaptation are subject to further monitoring and verification. The specifics of the reporting and reviews are yet to be defined by the Parties, with some seeking parallel provisions for all Parties while others express concerns about sovereignty and expert capacity. Decision on guidelines for biennial reports and establishment of a registry of actions are expected in the future. The UNFCCC is considering establishing a registry of actions by non-Annex I Parties and guidelines for Common Accounting Rules. There is a push for incentives for Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) to help tropical countries combat deforestation and sell credits to other countries to meet their GHG targets. However, agreement has not been reached on this issue. Parties are working on establishing acceptable baselines for measuring forest protections and monitoring carbon uptake for REDD+ credits. Issues to be addressed include financing REDD+ actions, reporting carbon reductions, establishing reference levels, and ensuring safeguards. In Cancun, a Green Climate Fund was established to support low-income countries' mitigation and adaptation actions. The Transitional Committee recommended the design of the Fund for approval by the COP in Durban. The COP will decide on the role and composition of a new Standing Committee on financial matters to coordinate funds under the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol. Ban Ki-Moon urged governments to expedite financial resource mobilization. Fast-start funds were pledged to be \"new and additional,\" but transparency in accounting and reporting is lacking. Many low-income countries have expressed concerns about the reported funding. Many low-income countries want all $100 billion annually pledged for climate finance to go through the Green Climate Fund (GCF), while others believe most funds will come from private investment and other sources. Disagreements exist on setting a quantitative target for GCF funding and the sources of financing to count towards the goal. The United States and high-income countries emphasize the importance of private sector funding with appropriate incentives. Many developing countries prefer public funding for climate finance, while others advocate for private sector involvement with incentives. New funding mechanisms proposed include carbon emission allowances, international transaction fees, and reallocating fossil fuel subsidies to the GCF. The United States and other nations urge middle-income countries like China and India to contribute to the Climate Green Fund. The United States and other nations want the World Bank to manage the new Climate Green Fund, while developing countries prefer United Nations management for \"direct access\" to funds. The Transitional Committee in October 2011 did not unanimously adopt a design for the fund, referring it to the Conference of the Parties in Durban. The United States opposed the proposal, concerned about the independence of the GCF Board from the COP. The Cancun Agreements mandated a Technology Mechanism with a Technology Executive Committee and Clean Technology Centre. The COP in Durban is expected to decide on rules for the mechanism. The COP in Durban is expected to decide on rules for the Technology Mechanism, including how to select TEC members and whether to address intellectual property. The issue of intellectual property was omitted from the mechanism's establishment language due to disagreement between countries. There are various options for resolving the relationships between the TEC, the Clean Technology Centre, the Adaptation Committee, and the COP. In Durban, Parties are focusing more on addressing adaptation under the UNFCCC as global temperatures rise. There are differing views on balancing efforts to mitigate climate change and adapt to its effects. The establishment of a new Adaptation Committee in the Cancun Agreements aims to stimulate effective adaptation, especially for vulnerable populations. Decision on operationalizing the Committee is expected in Durban, including its composition, relationship to COP, and other institutions like the Standing Committee on finance and the Green Climate Fund. Parties in Durban are discussing how to allocate funding and prioritize the most vulnerable countries. They may include a work program on \"loss and damage\" in developing countries in the Adaptation Committee's activities. Some Parties are seeking a mandate for a decision in 2012 on disaster risk reduction, an international insurance mechanism, and a rehabilitation mechanism. The COP in Cancun mandated a review from 2013-2015 on the long-term goal of limiting global temperature increase to 2 o C, with consideration of tightening the goal to 1.5 o C. The Durban conference will address the scope of a review on climate change vulnerability, urged by small island states and other populations. It will also discuss the modalities of how the review may proceed."
