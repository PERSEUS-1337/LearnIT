President Nkurunziza's controversial third-term bid in 2015 led to divisions, a coup attempt, and mass displacement of over 400,000 refugees. Efforts to mediate talks between the government and opposition have stalled, with regional leaders showing support for Nkurunziza's continued rule. The political crisis in Burundi under President Nkurunziza's rule has led to mass displacement and stalled mediation efforts. The government has blocked UN police deployment and restricted human rights observers. US Congress has expressed concern over the situation's impact on regional stability and US efforts in Africa, particularly Burundi's role in AMISOM. The Trump Administration's approach to Burundi remains uncertain, with a potential shift towards national security over human rights concerns. Military assistance has been significant since AMISOM's deployment in 2007. There are considerations of the impact of U.S. and EU efforts to isolate key actors fueling instability through sanctions and aid restrictions. The Administration's proposed FY2018 budget includes cuts to health and economic aid for Burundi. U.S. Representative Nikki Haley has criticized human rights violations in the country. The Obama Administration's policy towards Burundi focused on preventing mass atrocities and opposing African presidents extending term limits. Congress supported these policies with resolutions on Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The future approach under the Trump Administration remains uncertain, with a potential shift towards national security over human rights concerns. Representative Nikki Haley has criticized human rights violations in Burundi. Burundi, one of the world's poorest countries, has a history of political instability, military interference, and ethnic violence. The high population density has led to conflicts over land, exacerbated by displacement. Tanzania has hosted Burundian refugees since the 1970s. Burundian armed factions have also been active in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Burundi is majority Hutu, with minority Tutsi and Twa ethnic communities. Burundi's history is marked by ethnic violence, with Tutsis dominating the government and military. Hutus were massacred in state-backed killings in 1972, leading to a civil war in the 1990s. The neighboring country, Rwanda, also experienced genocide in 1994. In 2000, Burundi signed the Arusha Accords for peace, with the involvement of U.S. Presidential Envoy Howard Wolpe and President Bill Clinton. The Arusha Accords in Burundi, signed in 2000 with the involvement of U.S. President Bill Clinton, aimed to bring stability and inclusiveness to the region. They established a two-term limit on the presidency, promoted ethnic balance in government and military, and led to the disarmament of rebel groups. The accords also paved the way for a new constitution in 2005, which formalized a Hutu-Tutsi quota system for state posts to ensure greater inclusion and protection of both ethnic groups. After the Arusha Accords in 2000, Burundi underwent a post-conflict political transition with Nkurunziza, a Hutu former rebel leader, becoming president in 2005. Hutu rebel combatants were integrated into the military with donor assistance, reducing instability. Despite high-level corruption and ongoing violence, electoral competition shifted towards intra-Hutu rivalry within the CNDD-FDD party. The CNDD-FDD faced internal conflicts and opposition from groups like the Hutu-led FNL. Ex-combatants loyal to Nkurunziza formed a parallel chain of command for targeted killings. Opposition parties boycotted the 2010 elections, leading to Nkurunziza's re-election and increased government control. Tensions escalated in 2015 over Nkurunziza's candidacy, resulting in large demonstrations and a failed coup attempt. After a failed coup attempt in May 2015, the government targeted suspected opponents in the army and ruling party. Security services cracked down on protesters, civil society, and independent media accused of supporting the coup. Most opposition parties boycotted the election, allowing Nkurunziza and the CNDD-FDD to dominate, winning 77 out of 100 legislative seats. An opposition coalition between UPRONA and FNL won 21 seats, with FNL leader Agathon Rwasa emerging as a key rival to Nkurunziza. Since the election, political and security conditions in Burundi have worsened. Armed groups, some led by CNDD-FDD dissidents, have emerged, leading to state repression of the opposition and a low-intensity conflict. Both government and opposition factions have resorted to violence, including extrajudicial killings, assassinations, grenade attacks, and torture. The Imbonerakure youth wing, working with security forces, has targeted political opponents and extorted money from civilians trying to flee the country. The Imbonerakure in Burundi have been accused of attacking civilians, extorting money, and using sexual violence as a tactic. U.N. investigators have also implicated the national intelligence service, police, and Imbonerakure in crimes against humanity. The army is facing internal rifts and is being characterized as polarized and reforming around a loyalist hard core. Civil society activists believe ruling party hardliners are deliberately weakening the army. The government in Burundi has become increasingly repressive, with critical civil society groups and media outlets facing bans and restrictions. The government has defied international criticism by withdrawing from the ICC and rejecting peacekeeping forces. Ethnic polarization is growing, with elites on both sides appealing to hardline sentiment. Growing ethnic polarization in Burundi has led to hardline appeals by ruling party figures, denouncing a supposed Tutsi plot and using divisive rhetoric. Security forces crack down on perceived opponents regardless of ethnicity, while poverty and food insecurity fuel grassroots tensions. The U.N. has expressed concern over incitement to violence. Since 2015, political tensions, displacement, cuts to aid, and economic challenges have worsened in Burundi. The economy shrank by 4% in 2015 and 1% in 2016, with food prices soaring and 8% of the population facing chronic malnutrition. Healthcare funding cuts have led to drug shortages and a rise in malaria cases. The number of Burundians needing humanitarian aid has tripled since early 2016, with restrictions on foreign aid and charity activities. The East African Community has been trying to facilitate a political process to prevent a crisis, but talks have stalled. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni. Talks between the government and opposition in Burundi have stalled due to disagreements over participation, with the government refusing to engage with the main exiled opposition coalition CNARED. Despite criticisms, former Tanzanian President Mkapa defended Nkurunziza's legitimacy in December 2016. In May 2017, Museveni and Tanzanian President Magufuli urged the EU to lift aid restrictions and sanctions, sparking opposition backlash. CNARED leaders called for Mkapa's replacement and criticized the statements at the EAC. The Burundian government's CNDI initiative, criticized for excluding opposition and civil society groups, released a report in May 2017 supporting the removal of presidential term limits. Nkurunziza supports amending the constitution to remove presidential term limits. A commission on constitutional amendments was established, with recommendations due by the end of 2017. Tensions have risen in Burundi, with concerns of potential armed conflict drawing in neighboring states and non-state actors, particularly Rwanda. Many Burundian dissidents and activists have fled to Rwanda since 2015. Tensions between Burundi and Rwanda have escalated since 2015, with accusations of rebel support and military training. Rwanda has distanced itself from the Burundi crisis ahead of its own presidential election. Regional leaders are concerned about the impact on stability, but there is no unified response. The AU threatened sanctions in 2015 but has not taken action. In 2015, a report on human rights abuses led to the deployment of a 5,000-strong force. The AU authorized a peacekeeping force in Burundi to address human rights abuses, but reversed course due to threats from Burundian authorities. UN Security Council resolutions called for an end to violence and deployed police officers to observe security conditions and support human rights monitors. The UN Security Council intended to impose targeted measures against those threatening peace in Burundi, but has not authorized sanctions. In 2015, the UN Human Rights Council called for an investigation into alleged human rights abuses in Burundi, with experts suggesting crimes against humanity may have been committed primarily by state agents. The Human Rights Council established a Commission of Inquiry to investigate human rights abuses in Burundi, with the government refusing to cooperate. The COI reported widespread fear and brutal violations, often by state security forces. The EU imposed sanctions on government officials in response to the crisis. In response to human rights abuses in Burundi, the EU suspended financial support to the government, including funds for troops in AMISOM. Burundi and the AU reached an agreement for troop payments through a private bank, avoiding withdrawal threats. EU and U.S. sanctions have sparked debate on engaging versus isolating the Burundian government to promote peace. The ruling party in Burundi accuses Western powers of plotting against the government, with claims of foreign involvement in regime change. US diplomats express concern over human rights violations by government forces and support EAC mediation efforts. In April 2017, U.S. accused Burundian government of human rights violations and called for an end to extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, and torture. The U.S. also criticized legal restrictions on NGOs and opposition parties in Burundi, while expressing support for the Mkapa mediation efforts. The Obama Administration's approach to the Burundi crisis focused on preventing \"mass atrocities\" and opposing African presidents who sought to extend term limits. They urged Nkurunziza not to seek reelection in 2015, supported EAC-led mediation efforts, and backed initial AU plans for military intervention. The Administration also isolated key figures destabilizing Burundi to deter further conflict. In November 2015, President Obama signed Executive Order 13712, authorizing targeted financial sanctions against individuals threatening peace and security, undermining democratic institutions, or committing human rights abuses in Burundi. Eight individuals were designated under the E.O., including state security officials, dissident security commanders involved in a coup attempt, and a civilian opposition leader. Obama also revoked Burundi's eligibility for U.S. trade preferences under AGOA. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget proposes a significant decrease in aid to Burundi under AGOA. Global Health Program funding would decrease from $30 million in FY2016 to $13 million in FY2018, with economic aid of $1.3 million being eliminated. The Food for Peace program providing $18.7 million in food aid in FY2016 would end entirely. This reduction does not include emergency humanitarian aid or regional security assistance programs. Since FY2006, the United States has allocated around $300 million in security assistance for Burundi, mainly to support the military's counterterrorism and peacekeeping capabilities. The funding comes from various sources such as the State Department's Peacekeeping Operations account and Defense Department-administered training and equipment. In mid-2015, the Obama Administration suspended several security assistance programs for Burundi. The Obama Administration suspended security assistance programs for Burundi, including police assistance due to political repression and military training due to security concerns. Funding for International Military Education and Training continued. Some advisory support and equipment transfers to Burundian troops in Somalia under AMISOM were maintained. Burundi faces aid restrictions under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, but President Obama waived them for FY2017. President Obama waived aid restrictions for Burundi in FY2017, citing national interest. President Nkurunziza's potential extension of office beyond 2020 may escalate political tensions and violence. Flashpoints could emerge by the end of 2017 with constitutional amendments. Burundi currently faces violent repression, poverty, and risks of wider conflict. The opposition's internal divisions may hinder unified negotiations. Corruption intensifies the competition for state resources. Endemic corruption in Burundi fuels a high-stakes contest for state resources, leading to potential violence as political figures, including Nkurunziza, have military backgrounds. Regional leaders struggle to uphold democratic norms and protect civilians from government abuses. The AU and EAC fail to pressure Burundi's government on term limits, mirroring a lack of regional condemnation in other countries like the DRC and Uganda. The rift between regional leaders and donors over Nkurunziza's legitimacy in countries like Uganda, Rwanda, Gabon, and Republic of Congo may hinder a unified international approach. The evolving U.S. response to Burundi raises issues for Congress regarding funding for health, conflict mitigation, and humanitarian relief. Congress has criticized Rwandan involvement in neighboring conflicts in past aid appropriations measures. The Trump Administration's approach to democracy promotion and atrocity-prevention efforts in Burundi is under scrutiny, with some observers questioning its prioritization of these objectives. Congressional oversight may focus on arguments for isolating Burundian leaders internationally and addressing the government's claims of unfair Western persecution. The Burundian military's internal divisions and polarization may lead Congress to reevaluate U.S. security assistance supporting Burundi's deployments in Somalia and the Central African Republic. Secretary of State Tillerson praised Burundi's troops in Somalia, but human rights issues and security conditions could limit military aid. Allegations of abuse have also been raised against the Burundian contingent in the Central African Republic, prompting discussions on potential contingency plans in case of a Burundian withdrawal from either mission."
