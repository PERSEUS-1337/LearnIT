    "content": "The \"Forced and Indentured Child Labor Prevention Act\" prohibits the acquisition of products produced by forced or indentured child labor. The \"Forced and Indentured Child Labor Prevention Act\" prohibits executive agencies from acquiring items listed as potentially produced by forced or indentured child labor. The Secretary of Labor, in consultation with other officials, publishes a list of such items every other year. The \"Forced and Indentured Child Labor Prevention Act\" requires executive agencies to include clauses in contracts for items on a list of potentially produced by forced or indentured child labor, certifying efforts to prevent such labor. The \"Forced and Indentured Child Labor Prevention Act\" mandates contractors to cooperate fully with access requests from agency officials or inspectors to examine records, persons, or premises for potential child labor use in contracted items. This applies to acquisitions exceeding the micro-purchase threshold, including commercial items. The \"Forced and Indentured Child Labor Prevention Act\" requires contractors to cooperate with investigations if there are suspicions of false certifications or lack of cooperation. The head of the executive agency can refer the matter to the Inspector General, Attorney General, and Secretary of the Treasury for investigation. Remedies can be imposed on contractors found in violation. The executive agency can terminate a contract if the contractor uses forced or indentured child labor, submits a false certification, or fails to cooperate. The termination is at the discretion of the agency head based on these findings. The head of an executive agency can debar or suspend a contractor for up to 3 years if they engage in acts like using forced or indentured child labor. The Administrator of General Services maintains a list of excluded parties for Federal contracts based on these findings. The Administrator of General Services, with the assistance of other executive agencies, reviews actions taken under the section each year and submits a report to Congress. The Federal Acquisition Regulation must be revised within 180 days to implement the section and include provisions on forced or indentured labor. The Federal Acquisition Regulation must be revised to include forced or indentured child labor as a cause for debarment and suspension from contracting with executive agencies. This section does not apply to contracts for products mined, produced, or manufactured in foreign countries. The text discusses the eligibility criteria for foreign countries or instrumentalities to participate in government procurement contracts under certain trade agreements, such as the WTO Agreement or the North American Free Trade Agreement. The value of the contract must meet specified thresholds. The term \"WTO Agreement\" refers to the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization. The requirements of this section apply to any solicitation, unsolicited proposal, or contract by an executive agency after a specified date, which is 30 days after the publication of revisions to the Federal Acquisition Regulation."
