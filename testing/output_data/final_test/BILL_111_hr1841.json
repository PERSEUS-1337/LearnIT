    "content": "The \"Acid Rain and Mercury Control Act\" includes sections on reduction of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions, mercury emission reductions, protecting regional ecosystems, and authorization of appropriations. The Act aims to address environmental concerns related to acid rain and mercury pollution. Congress finds that reductions of atmospheric sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide from utility plants are necessary to reduce acid deposition and its adverse effects on public health, natural resources, ecosystems, and visibility. These emissions also contribute to the development of fine particulates, which are linked to human mortality and morbidity. Regional nitrogen oxide reductions may be needed to protect sensitive watersheds. Since the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, some acidic lakes in the Adirondacks, New York, have shown slow chemical recovery from acid rain. Nitrogen oxide regulations have been implemented cost-effectively, but progress is slower than intended. Nitrogen oxide is mobile and can lead to ozone formation far from the source. The EPA issued the Clean Air Interstate Rule in 2005, requiring further reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide in 28 Eastern States and the District of Columbia, representing significant reductions in emissions. The United States Court of Appeals vacated the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) in 2008, leading to a remand back to the EPA. Fossil fuel-fired electric generating units emit a significant amount of mercury, which is harmful to young children and developing fetuses. There are numerous fish advisories for mercury in the United States, with over 90 in New York alone. The EPA issued the Clean Air Mercury Rule in 2005 to regulate mercury emissions from power plants, but it was vacated by the US Court of Appeals in 2008. The Supreme Court denied a request to reconsider the decision in 2009. The Act aims to address the health and environmental risks posed by sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions. The Act aims to reduce human health and environmental risks by requiring reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions, supporting existing acid rain and mercury monitoring programs, and imposing strict standards for utility emissions of nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, and mercury from power plants. The Clean Air Act is amended to include a section on reducing sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from power plants. The Clean Air Act is amended to include emission reduction objectives for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from power plants by 75 percent from specified levels. The Administrator must promulgate regulations within 2 years to achieve these objectives. The Administrator must determine equitable allocation of emission reductions, consider previous reductions, and prevent adverse effects on public health and the environment. Market-oriented mechanisms like emissions trading may be included to achieve emission reduction objectives. The Administrator must coordinate with other departments and agencies to minimize economic costs and maximize gains in achieving emission reduction objectives. This includes incentives for renewable energy and implementing cost-saving policies. The regulations may require additional emissions reductions from powerplants if necessary to protect public health or welfare. Powerplants must comply with new source performance standards within a specified timeframe. Powerplants must comply with new source performance standards, parts C and D requirements for modified sources, and additional regulations. These requirements are in addition to any other requirements of the Act. The term 'powerplant' refers to electric generation facilities with a capacity of 25 megawatts or more using combustion devices for electricity generation. The Clean Air Act is amended to include Title VII - Mercury Reductions, which outlines definitions, a mercury reduction program, and prohibitions related to mercury emissions. The curr_chunk defines terms related to coal-fired electric generating facilities and cogeneration facilities, specifying criteria such as capacity and electricity generation for sale. The curr_chunk focuses on the Mercury Reduction Program under SEC. 702. The Mercury Reduction Program under SEC. 702 sets emission limits for new and existing units, requiring compliance with a limit of 0.6 pounds of mercury per trillion Btu. Monitoring systems must be in place by January 1, 2011, to measure emissions accurately. Owners must adhere to the emission limitations to avoid excess emissions. The excess emissions penalty for units emitting mercury above the limit is $10,000 per ounce of excess emissions. Regulations must prevent re-release of captured mercury into the environment by 2011. \"SEC. 703. PROHIBITIONS.\" It is unlawful for the owner or operator of an electricity generating facility to operate in noncompliance with the requirements of the title, fail to submit emission allowances or pay penalties, fail to offset excess emissions, or emit mercury above established limits. Additionally, it is prohibited for any person to hold, use, or transfer emission allowances allocated under the title without following regulations set by the Administrator. SEC. 5. EFFECT ON OTHER LAW.\n\nThis Act does not affect a State's ability to further limit sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, or mercury. It also does not modify any existing requirements of the Act or relieve anyone from complying with it.\n\nSEC. 6. PROTECTING SENSITIVE REGIONAL ECOSYSTEMS. The Administrator is required to submit a report to Congress by December 31, 2012, identifying objectives for credible environmental indicators to protect and restore sensitive ecosystems in various mountain ranges and water bodies. An updated report must be submitted by December 31, 2021, assessing the status and trends of these ecosystems. The Administrator must submit reports assessing environmental objectives and indicators for sensitive ecosystems by December 31, 2021. Regulations require a determination on emission reductions under the Clean Air Act by the same date. The Administrator will promulgate regulations within 2 years if emission reductions under the Clean Air Act are deemed insufficient to protect sensitive ecosystems. Authorization of appropriations for the Administrator to promulgate regulations within 2 years if emission reductions under the Clean Air Act are insufficient to protect sensitive ecosystems. For fiscal years 2010 through 2020, appropriations are authorized for operational support of the National Atmospheric Deposition Program. This includes funding to various agencies such as the United States Geological Survey, Environmental Protection Agency, National Park Service, Forest Service, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. For fiscal years 2010 through 2020, appropriations are authorized for various programs including the National Atmospheric Deposition Program, Clean Air Status and Trends Network, and Temporally Integrated Monitoring of Ecosystems. Funding is allocated to agencies such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, and National Park Service. SEC. 8. MODERNIZATION. Authorization of Appropriations for equipment and site modernization and network expansion of various environmental programs: $6,000,000 to the National Atmospheric Deposition Program National Trends Network, $2,000,000 to the National Atmospheric Deposition Program Mercury Deposition Network, $1,000,000 to the National Atmospheric Deposition Program Atmospheric Integrated Research Monitoring Network, and $4,600,000 to the Clean Air Status and Trends Network. The Clean Air Status and Trends Network receives $4,600,000 in funding from the Environmental Protection Agency, with the amounts remaining available until expended."
