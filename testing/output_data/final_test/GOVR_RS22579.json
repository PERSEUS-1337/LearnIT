    "content": "The District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2009 proposed increasing the size of the U.S. House of Representatives from 435 to 437 seats. One seat would be allocated to D.C. and the other to either Utah or through normal allocation. Utah would gain a fourth seat. Both versions treated D.C. as a state for seat allocation but limited it to one seat in future apportionments. Similar bills were introduced in the 110th Congress. In the 110th Congress, bills were introduced to increase the size of the House of Representatives. The House approved H.R. 1905 and sent it to the Senate. S. 1257 was reported out of the Senate Committee with amendments. However, cloture on the motion to proceed was not invoked in the Senate, leaving the measure pending. The 435 seat limit for the House was imposed in 1929, and altering the size would require a new law. The House size of 468 would prevent states from losing seats, but would increase delegation sizes for California, Texas, and Florida. Increasing the House size has been common when admitting new states to the Union. Exceptions to this include states formed from other states like Maine, Kentucky, and West Virginia. When Alaska and Hawaii were admitted in 1959 and 1960, the House size was temporarily increased to 437 to accommodate them. This differed from previous state admission acts, where new state representatives were added to the apportionment totals. In 1961, after the 1960 census, Alaska was entitled to one seat and Hawaii to two seats in the reestablished 435-seat House. The House size was temporarily increased to 437 to accommodate Alaska and Hawaii in 1959 and 1960. After the 1960 census, Alaska was entitled to one seat and Hawaii to two seats in the reestablished 435-seat House. Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Missouri each received one less seat than they would have with a House size of 438. Table 1 displays the apportionment of seats in the House based on the 2000 and 2010 Census data, showing a shift of 12 seats among 18 states for the 113th Congress. Table 1 displays the shift of 12 seats among 18 states for the 113th Congress based on the 2000 and 2010 Census data. States like Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania will lose seats, while states like Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, South Carolina, Utah, and Washington will gain seats. Additionally, Florida will gain two seats, Ohio and New York will each lose two seats, and Texas will gain four seats. If the District of Columbia were to be treated as a state, Minnesota would lose a seat, bringing its delegation down to seven Representatives. If the District of Columbia were given a vote in the House of Representatives and the House size increased to 437, it would receive one Representative. North Carolina would gain one more Representative than scheduled after the 2010 census. Minnesota would keep its eighth seat, and no other state would be affected. The allocation of seats is determined by a \"priority list\" using the equal proportions formula. Table 2 and Table 3 show the end of the priority list used to allocate Representatives based on the 2010 Census, with the last seat at 435 and 437 respectively. The allocation formula remains the same even if the District of Columbia is treated as a state, as it is entitled to one Representative."
