The amendment allows individuals or entities receiving grants under certain acts to refuse to perform abortions based on religious beliefs. Senator Frank Church emphasized the need for the conscience clause to protect religious hospitals from being mandated to perform procedures against their beliefs. The Church Amendment, passed in 1973, allows individuals or entities receiving federal funds to refuse to perform abortions or sterilization procedures based on religious beliefs. It also prohibits employment discrimination against medical personnel who refuse to perform such services on moral or religious grounds. By 1978, most states had enacted conscience clause legislation, with a lull in activity from 1978 to 1996. From 1978 to 1996, there was a pause in conscience clause activity, except for the Danforth Amendment in 1988, which mandated neutrality on abortion under Title IX. Congress later added more conscience provisions in the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996, prohibiting discrimination against healthcare entities refusing certain services. The 1996 omnibus legislation and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 protect healthcare entities, doctors, and medical students from being discriminated against for refusing to provide abortion services or training. Congress amended Medicare and Medicaid programs to prevent managed care plans from restricting healthcare professionals from discussing treatment options with patients. The 1997 legislation extended conscience clause laws to Medicare and Medicaid managed care plans, allowing them to refuse to pay for abortion counseling or referral services on moral or religious grounds. Providers can still offer these services but may not be reimbursed by the plan. The 1997 legislation expanded conscience clause laws to include Medicare and Medicaid-funded health plans, allowing them to refuse to provide counseling and referral for abortion services. Recent abortion bills in Congress aim to further broaden the scope of these laws, such as the Abortion Non-Discrimination Act (ANDA) introduced in every Congress since the 107th Congress. The Abortion Non-Discrimination Act (ANDA) aims to expand the definition of \"health care entity\" to include various healthcare facilities and organizations. Supporters argue that this is necessary to protect religious hospitals and providers who oppose abortion, while opponents fear it could restrict women's access to abortion. Critics also raise concerns that ANDA could allow providers to drop abortion coverage for financial reasons. The Weldon Amendment, inserted in various appropriations measures since 2004, prohibits funds from being used by federal agencies or programs that discriminate against healthcare entities for not providing, paying for, covering, or referring for abortions. The term \"health care entity\" includes individual healthcare professionals, hospitals, and other healthcare facilities. The Weldon Amendment protects healthcare entities from being required to provide or pay for abortion-related services, allowing a wide range of providers to refuse without reprisals. The Weldon Amendment allows health insurance companies and HMOs to refuse coverage for abortions, potentially denying services to a larger number of individuals. It differs from the proposed ANDA in that it only denies funds under specific appropriations and is not permanent legislation. On December 19, 2008, HHS issued a new rule to implement the Church Amendment, Section 245 of the PHSA, and the Weldon Amendment, providing definitions for terms, requiring a certification of compliance for federal health care fund recipients, and designating HHS's Office of Civil Rights for complaint handling. The rule aimed to educate on federal law protections and promote inclusivity in healthcare, but critics feared it could harm individuals' health. The new rule, criticized for potentially limiting access to healthcare services like oral contraceptives, is now being reconsidered by HHS after receiving feedback. HHS aims to review the regulation to ensure alignment with current Administration policy and is seeking public comments on rescinding the rule. The proposed rule to rescind the 2008 final rule on abortion coverage in health insurance plans is under consideration by HHS. Legislation has been passed to address the issue of uninsured individuals and restructuring the private health insurance market. The Affordable Health Care for America Act and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act include provisions on abortion coverage and conscience protection for specified entities. The House-passed bill, H.R. 3962, and the Senate-passed bill, H.R. 3590, both include provisions for conscience protection regarding abortion coverage in health care entities. H.R. 3962 prohibits discrimination against health care entities that do not provide, pay for, or refer for abortions, while H.R. 3590 prohibits exchange plans from discriminating against individuals based on their health care choices. The bill would prevent discrimination against healthcare providers or facilities for refusing to provide, pay for, or refer for abortions. It would not impact existing federal laws protecting conscience rights and anti-discrimination laws."
