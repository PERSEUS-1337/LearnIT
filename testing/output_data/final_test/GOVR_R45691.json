    "content": "Many Members of Congress were actively involved in foreign policy debates regarding U.S. intervention in the Bosnia war. The United States is seen as a stakeholder in Bosnia's future due to its impact on the postwar state. Bosnia still faces challenges and holds geopolitical importance in the Western Balkans. Congress is urged to examine Bosnia's internal politics and its role in Balkan stability amidst ongoing security issues in the region. Bosnia's history includes various forms of governance, from a medieval kingdom to a federal unit. Its present borders align with Ottoman Turkish rule. The Dayton Peace Agreement established Bosnia as an independent state with a constitution recognizing Bosniaks, Croats, and Serbs as constituent peoples. Religious differences among these groups are significant, with Bosniaks being predominantly Muslim and Serbs largely Orthodox Christian. Bosnia has three main ethnic identities: Bosniaks are mostly Muslim, Serbs are Orthodox Christian, and Croats are Catholic. The population breakdown is approximately 50.1% Bosniaks, 30.8% Bosnian Serbs, and 15.4% Bosnian Croats. The country's religious and cultural diversity is a key characteristic, with Islam, Catholicism, Orthodoxy, and Judaism all having historical roots in Bosnia. During the 1990s, Bosnia's ethnic relations were often portrayed as \"ancient hatreds,\" but experts reject this idea. Ethnic conflict was fueled by domestic leaders and external powers seeking control. Nationalist movements in Yugoslavia led to manipulation of historical grievances among Bosnian Serbs and Croats. Nationalist leaders in Serbia and Croatia appealed to Bosnian Serbs and Croats as ethnic \"kin,\" establishing sister parties to influence Bosnian politics. In the 1990 elections, voters chose ethnic parties over the ruling League of Communists, leading to Bosnia's independence referendum in 1992. Bosnian Serbs boycotted the vote, leading to a conflict involving Serb, Croat, and Bosniak forces. Bosnia's territory was divided during a three-year conflict involving Serb, Croat, and Bosniak forces. Bosnian Serb and Croat leaders declared separate entities, while some advocated unification with Serbia and Croatia. The war was one of Europe's deadliest since WWII, with Sarajevo besieged for 44 months and over 10,000 civilians killed. Paramilitary factions from neighboring countries also participated in the conflict. During the Bosnian conflict, Serbia supported Bosnian Croats and Serbs, while the Yugoslav National Army aided Bosnian Serb forces. Ethnic cleansing led to the deaths of over 100,000 Bosnians and displacement of half the population. Many women and girls were victims of sexual violence. War crimes have been prosecuted, including the conviction of Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107 for genocide and war crimes. During the Bosnian war, war crimes were committed, leading to the conviction of individuals like Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107 and Ratko Mladi\u0107 for genocide and other crimes. The Srebrenica massacres in 1995, where over 8,000 Bosniak men and boys were executed, were ruled as an act of genocide by the International Court of Justice and ICTY. These incidents highlighted the human toll of the conflict and pressured U.S. policymakers to take a stronger role in resolving the conflict. The United States played a key role in brokering peace agreements during the Bosnian war, including the 1994 Washington Agreement and the Dayton Peace Agreement in 1995. The Dayton Agreement established Bosnia's complex political system, with one of its annexes serving as the country's constitution. The Dayton Peace Agreement in 1995 established Bosnia's political system, dividing it into two entities - Republika Srpska and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This division reflects ethnic majorities and territorial seizure, with Bosniaks viewing it as favoring Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Serbs seeing it as protection against marginalization. The agreement designates Bosniaks, Croats, and Serbs as Bosnia's \"constituent peoples.\" The Dayton system in Bosnia divides the country into two entities, with ethnic quotas ensuring equal representation of Bosniaks, Croats, and Serbs in government bodies. This power-sharing structure aims to prevent any group from feeling marginalized, despite causing political gridlock. Bosnia is a parliamentary republic with a decentralized structure, including a central government, entities, Br\u010dko district, and cantonal/municipal governments. The three-member presidency consists of one Serb elected by Republika Srpska voters, and one Bosniak and Croat elected by Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina voters. The Council of Ministers in Bosnia, similar to a cabinet government, is responsible for foreign relations, defense, and intelligence. The country is divided into two entities, Republika Srpska and the Federation entity, each with its own ethnic majority. The state-level government is considered weak, with limited jurisdiction compared to the entities. The two entities in Bosnia, Republika Srpska and the Federation entity, have broader policy jurisdiction than the state-level government. They handle functions like civilian policing, economic policy, fiscal policy, energy policy, and health and social policy. Each entity has its own constitution, president, vice presidents, legislature, and cabinet government with a prime minister. They can also establish special relationships with neighboring states. Br\u010dko district, a border region, was initially administered by the international community to prevent RS secession. It remains a self-governing district with a mixed population. The Federation entity in Bosnia is divided into ten cantons with jurisdiction in various policy areas. It has been relatively successful in passing reforms and integrating its population. The Dayton Agreement established international oversight through the Office of the High Representative. The High Representative, supported by the Peace Implementation Council, was empowered to impose decisions and sanctions on obstructive politicians after a 1997 conference. Initially active in promoting reforms, criticism of lack of democratic legitimacy has led to a decrease in the High Representative's role. Bosnian Serb politicians claim interventions favor Bosniak leaders for a centralized state, while some U.S. and EU policymakers see the attraction of. The international community, led by NATO and later the EU, played a key security role in Bosnia after the war. NATO initially deployed 60,000 troops, with the US contributing the largest share. The EU took over peacekeeping in 2004, reducing troop numbers to around 600. Analysts credit the Dayton Agreement for preventing widespread violence in Bosnia since 1995. Critics question the sustainability of Bosnia's political system under the Dayton Agreement, citing concerns that it reinforces ethnic divisions and allows ethnic parties to manipulate nationalist tensions for political gain. Divisions are perpetuated through segregated institutions like schools, further deepening societal rifts. The political system in Bosnia under the Dayton Agreement reinforces ethnic divisions through segregated institutions like schools, hindering major reforms and creating barriers to passing legislation. Corruption in Bosnia is rooted in the wartime economy, with organized crime and corruption prevalent. The GAO report highlighted widespread organized crime and corruption within Bosnia's political parties, civil service, law enforcement, and judiciary. The ruling ethnic parties control all aspects of government, judiciary, and economy, maintaining power and wealth for their members. The rule of law has deteriorated, with major parties accused of siphoning state resources and politicizing public sector hiring. Employment often relies on political connections, creating a cycle of dependence for many Bosnians. The political elites in Bosnia maintain power through a patronage system, exploiting their positions for personal gain. They block legislation that threatens their status and benefit from a cycle of dependence on political connections for employment. The ruling ethnic parties control all aspects of government, judiciary, and economy, with little incentive to reform the system. Bosnia's MPs are among the best-paid in Europe, leading to personal enrichment for politicians in office. The patronage system in Bosnia is the main cause of dysfunction and resistance to reform among political elites. Entrenched politicians fear penalties and criminal indictments, making them resistant to external pressure for change. Previous reform efforts have failed, leading to a shift towards socioeconomic reforms in 2014. The 2015 \"Reform Agenda\" aimed at improving the economy and dismantling patronage networks. The 2015 \"Reform Agenda\" in Bosnia aimed at economic, administrative, and legal reforms supported by international organizations. Despite incentives like the EU offering entry into force of the Stabilization and Association Agreement, the Agenda was largely unsuccessful due to entrenched parties resisting measures that would weaken their dominance. There is little consensus on how to reform Bosnia's political system as long as dominant parties remain entrenched. Bosnian Serb and Croat leaders seek more autonomy, while Bosniak leaders prefer centralization and institutional reforms. Citizens express anger towards the political class and distrust of institutions. In a 2018 survey, 86% of Bosnians believe the country is heading in the wrong direction, leading to emigration of 170,000 individuals since 2013. Dissatisfaction with education, healthcare, insecurity, and nepotism are key reasons for emigration. Social discontent in 2014 and 2018 suggests that strengthening civil society could pressure for reform. Some hope for reform lies in Bosnia's \"civic parties,\" which focus on socioeconomic interests rather than ethnicity. Bosnia's challenges were highlighted during the 2018 general election, where ethnic parties dominated despite widespread voter dissatisfaction. The parties are still in negotiations for government formation, with ethnic parties expected to maintain dominance. Leaders of the Bosniak, Croat, and Serb parties agreed on principles for forming the state-level government in March 2019. Serb parties agreed on principles for forming the state-level government. \u0160efik D\u017eaferovi\u0107 narrowly defeated the candidate of the civic SDP party for the Bosniak seat in the state-level presidency. Some analysts expressed concern about nationalist leaders holding two of the three seats on the presidency. Serb leader Milorad Dodik and his ally, nationalist Bosnian Croat politician Dragan \u010covi\u0107, have challenged Bosnian statehood and called for more autonomy. \u017deljko Kom\u0161i\u0107 of the Democratic Front surprisingly defeated \u010covi\u0107 for the Croat seat in the presidency. Kom\u0161i\u0107, a moderate figure, supports centralizing reforms and won with 53% of the vote. He has been elected as the Croat member of the presidency in 2006 and 2010, amidst controversy. Kom\u0161i\u0107, who identifies as Croat, does not have strong ties to the Croatian government. Kom\u0161i\u0107, a Croat leader from central Bosnia, won the presidency seat despite accusations of illegitimate representation by some Croat leaders. His victory is expected to impact HDZ-BiH's stance on electoral reform. In RS, Milorad Dodik defeated the incumbent Serb member with 54% of the vote, solidifying his dominance in entity politics. Milorad Dodik has dominated entity politics in RS since the mid-2000s, consolidating power and facing sanctions from the US Treasury Department. Concerns arise that he will obstruct the central government while dictating politics in RS. Dodik called for Bosnia to recognize Crimea as Russian territory and approved new ministries in RS. In December 2018, the RS National Assembly approved the creation of new ministries, seen as an attempt to assert control over competencies. Controversy arose in early 2019 when legislation was passed to create a commission to reinvestigate the Srebrenica events, sparking accusations of denial or downplaying of massacres. Formation of governments in FBiH faced legal challenges, casting doubt over government formation. Party leaders are still negotiating the formation of governments in FBiH and the state-level Council of Ministers. The Electoral Commission assigned delegates to the House of Peoples based on 2013 legislation due to the FBiH government's failure to fix electoral laws before the election. The Electoral Commission assigned delegates to the House of Peoples based on the 2013 census amid pressure from U.S. and EU officials. Bosnia, one of Europe's poorest countries, suffered $110 billion in damage from the 1992-1995 war, with GDP per capita at $5,148 in 2017. Unemployment was at 18% in 2018, down from 28% in 2015, with youth unemployment at 46%. GDP growth has averaged since 2015. Bosnia's GDP growth has averaged around 3% since 2015, driven by consumption fueled by migrant remittances. The IMF has urged privatization of state-owned enterprises, which make up 20% of the economy. Bosnia participates in free trade agreements with the EU, EFTA, and CEFTA, with the EU being its primary trade partner. Bosnia's major exports include vehicle seats, raw materials, leather products, textiles, energy, and wood products. The EU is Bosnia's primary source of foreign direct investment (FDI), with Austria, Croatia, and Slovenia being the top sources. However, Bosnia's fragmented legal and administrative structure creates a challenging investment climate, with corruption and political instability deterring investment. FDI amounts to just 2% of Bosnia's GDP, well below the Western Balkan average of 5%. Bosnia's low foreign direct investment (FDI) at 2% of GDP, below the Western Balkan average of 5%, hinders economic growth. The EU and U.S. support NATO and EU accession for democratization and reform in Bosnia, with EU membership being a key policy issue. Bosnia's EU application in 2016 focuses on rule of law, public administration reform, and economic development. Bosnia applied to join the EU in 2016, currently a potential candidate receiving financial assistance. Between 2014-2020, Bosnia is set to receive \u20ac552 million in EU aid. However, its EU membership prospects are uncertain due to slow reform implementation and legal challenges. Some doubt Bosnia's ability to harmonize legislation under its current political system. Bosnia's potential EU membership is uncertain due to slow reform implementation and legal challenges. Bosnian leaders are divided over joining NATO, with Bosnian Serb opposition rooted in resentment over NATO's role in the Bosnian war. Bosnia joined NATO's Partnership for Peace in 2006 and may launch a Membership Action Plan once certain conditions are met. The most challenging issue in Bosnia is the reregistration of defense installations from entity to state-level government. RS officials resist giving up control over these installations. In December 2018, NATO invited Bosnia to activate its MAP, seen as a push for reform. Bosniak and Croat leaders are positive, but Bosnian Serbs oppose joining NATO, supporting military neutrality instead. RS President and Dodik, a member of the presidency, vow to pursue military neutrality despite NATO's invitation. Relations with Croatia and Serbia are strained. Bosnia's relations with Croatia and Serbia are crucial for regional stability, but have been tense due to historical conflicts. Democratic progress in Croatia and Serbia has improved relations, but Bosnian leaders have criticized interference in their affairs. Leaders like Dragan \u010covi\u0107 and Milorad Dodik have ties to Croatia and Serbia, raising concerns. Croatian support for \u010covi\u0107 in Bosnia's 2018 elections has also been noted. The government financially and politically backed \u010covi\u0107 in Bosnia's 2018 elections. Croatian politicians raised the issue of Bosnian Croats' constitutional challenges in international forums. Former High Representatives to Bosnia expressed alarm over Croatia's interference in Bosnia's internal affairs. The Croatian government challenged the legitimacy of \u017deljko Kom\u0161i\u0107 as the Croat member of the Bosnian presidency. Some parties in Croatia hold election events on Bosnian territory to mobilize Bosnian Croat voters with dual citizenship. The Serbian government supports Dodik, with some politicians backing convicted Bosnian Serb war criminals. The issue of convicted Bosnian Serb war criminals remains sensitive in Bosnia, with unresolved border disputes with Serbia. Dual citizenship treaties with Croatia and Serbia have raised jurisdictional issues for indicted war criminals. Despite occasional tensions, Croatia and Serbia are important economic partners for Bosnia. The EU has allocated \u20ac1 billion for connectivity projects in the Western Balkans. The Western Balkans region has received \u20ac1 billion in grants for connectivity projects from the EU for 2015-2020. Concerns have been raised about Russian influence in the area, with analysts suggesting Russia aims to hinder Euro-Atlantic integration and assert its great power status in the region. Analysts have identified Russian tools in the Western Balkans, including playing a \"spoiler\" role, projecting soft power, and leveraging energy dominance. Russia supports Bosnian Serb and Bosnian Croat nationalist leaders, exacerbating ethnic divisions and hindering Euro-Atlantic reform efforts in Bosnia. Dodik's high-level meetings with Putin signal Russian support, with experts noting Russia as a key ally in resisting Western pressure for reforms. Russia has supported divisive RS policies, including backing Dodik's controversial actions in violation of Bosnian Constitutional Court rulings. Analysts are concerned about Russia's support for RS's Srebrenica commission and its role in the security sector, training RS police special forces in counterterrorism. This could lead to militarization and increased violence in the region. Additionally, Russia has shown support for \u010covi\u0107, who advocates for greater autonomy for Croats and a third Croat entity. Analysts warn that Russian support for RS could escalate violence in confrontations with the Bosnian government. Bosnian Serb ultranationalist groups, backed by Russia, may mobilize to aid RS leaders. Russian soft power leverages cultural ties with Bosnian Serbs and promotes anti-Western narratives through media like Sputnik and RT. Local media in RS also echo pro-Russian sentiments, with positive coverage of Russia and negative portrayals of the US and NATO. The media in RS glorifies the Russian military, emphasizes cultural and religious ties between Serbs and Russians, and covers high-level meetings between RS and Russian officials. Economic relations between Russia and RS have deepened, with Russian state-owned oil company Zarubezhneft acquiring key assets in RS without an open tender, leading to concerns about its influence. Zarubezhneft is a major employer and taxpayer in RS, contributing significantly to the budget. Bosnia relies on Russian natural gas imports via Ukraine, with energy policy controlled by entities within the country. Gazprom, a Russian natural gas provider, has a significant presence in the market. Turkish influence in Bosnia has grown over the past two decades, with Ankara's close relationship with Bosniak leaders seen as a key factor. Turkish President Erdogan has used historical ties and religious kinship with Bosniaks to expand soft power in the region since the collapse of Yugoslavia. Turkey gained prestige among Bosniaks during the 1992-1995 war by condemning the international arms embargo against Bosnia. Erdogan has invoked Ottoman-era connections to Bosnia to strengthen ties. Turkey, along with Iran and Saudi Arabia, provided arms to Bosniak forces during the war. Turkish influence has continued post-war, with significant assistance from the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency for Ottoman-era restoration projects. Bosniaks have strong support for Turkey, with 76% having positive views in a 2018 survey. Some analysts believe Turkey is trying to establish a protective role for itself in Bosnia, similar to Croatia and Serbia for Bosnian Croats and Serbs. Some analysts believe Turkey is attempting to establish a protective role in Bosnia for Bosniaks, with strong ties to the SDA party. Economic relations have deepened, with Turkish FDI accounting for 5.6% of flows in 2016. A notable project is a highway connecting Sarajevo to Belgrade, with Turkey expected to provide funding. Some officials, including French President Emmanuel Macron, have expressed concern over Turkey's alleged ambitions in the Balkans. Analysts caution that Turkey's influence in the region may be overstated, as the scope of Turkish investment is sometimes exaggerated in the media. Chinese investments in Bosnia between 2011 and 2019 amounted to $3.6 billion, primarily in energy and transportation projects. Chinese firms have contracts to construct energy plants and highways in the region. A \u20ac1.4 billion deal was signed to construct a highway between Banja Luka and Mlini\u0161te. The EU Energy Community criticized the FBiH entity government's decision to guarantee a \u20ac600 million loan from China's Exim Bank to build a coal-fired power plant in Tuzla. Concerns have been raised about China's economic influence in Bosnia, with EU and U.S. officials expressing worry over the scope of Chinese investments in the Balkans and their lending practices. Chinese lending practices in Bosnia violate EU rules in public procurement by frequently requiring the use of Chinese contractors, laborers, or supplies. Unlike EU funds, Chinese loans have few conditions linked to transparency or reform. EU officials are concerned about China's economic leverage over recipient states, potentially hindering the EU's unified stance on relations with China. Bosnia has seen an increase in migrant and refugee traffic since early 2018, with an estimated 23,000 entering the country. Approximately 23,000 migrants and refugees have entered Bosnia, with 25% remaining in the country. Many aim to reach the EU through Croatia but face increased border controls. The EU provided \u20ac2 million in 2018 to assist Bosnia in responding to the crisis. Backlash from some Bosnians, particularly in Una-Sana Canton, has been triggered by the high concentration of migrants. Residents in Biha\u0107 protested against migrant camps, while authorities in Velika Kladu\u0161a obstructed plans to house migrants. The incident in a city in the canton obstructed the Ministry of Security's plans to house migrants, showing local backlash and government difficulties. Islam has a long history in Bosnia, with the Islamic Community playing a key role. Majority of practicing Muslims follow the Hanafi school of Sunni Islam, but concerns exist about the influence of more conservative practices from Arab Gulf states. During Bosnia's 1992-1995 war, transnational Islamist militancy and Salafist Hanbali religious doctrine were promoted by entities from the Arab Gulf states. Saudi Arabia provided $600 million in aid post-war to promote socially conservative Sunni views. Iran also supported Bosniak leaders. Salafi groups have limited support in Bosnia due to the high level of secularism among Bosnian Muslims. Many Bosnian Muslims who follow Salafist ideas live in remote rural communities and are not inherently violent. The Grand Mufti of Bosnia's Islamic Community pressured Salafi groups to acknowledge his authority, bringing 90% under official structures. Despite their small numbers, radicalized individuals pose a terrorist threat, as seen in attacks in Bugojno and on the U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo. The rise of IS and Nusra Front in Syria and Iraq in the 2010s increased the terrorism threat in Bosnia, with social media used for recruitment. Between 2012 and 2017, an estimated 350 Bosnian citizens traveled to fight with armed groups. Bosnian citizens traveled from Bosnia or Bosnian diaspora communities to fight with armed groups in Iraq and Syria. Recently, returned foreign fighters are seen as a potential threat due to the weakening of armed groups like IS. Bosnia's stock of illegal weapons may worsen the risk. Officials estimated that over 100 Bosnians remained in Syria, 50 had returned, and 70 were killed. In 2014, new criminal offenses were introduced to prosecute foreign terrorist fighters and recruiters. Bosnia is considered a cooperative counterterrorism partner by the U.S. State Department, but political fragmentation could undermine efforts. The Bosnian conflict shaped the post-Cold War role of the United States and NATO in European security. The U.S. played a significant role in resolving the conflict, leading NATO airstrikes, brokering the Dayton Peace Agreement, and deploying troops to Bosnia. Political gridlock in state-level and FBiH governments hindered new counterterrorism measures in 2017. Dysfunction could undermine counterterrorism efforts in Bosnia. The United States' strong involvement in resolving the Bosnian conflict and shaping Bosnia's political system has made it a stakeholder in Bosnia's future. U.S. officials, often in cooperation with the EU, have intervened to defuse crises, broker reform talks, and impose sanctions against Bosnian officials for corruption and human rights violations. Many analysts believe that the U.S. attaches strategic importance to Bosnia's stability. The United States has a strong involvement in Bosnia's stability, with analysts believing that turbulence in Bosnia could affect the Balkans. The Trump Administration's potential support for a Serbia-Kosovo agreement raised concerns about reshaping U.S. policy towards Bosnia, but the new U.S. Ambassador affirmed commitment to Bosnia's sovereignty. U.S. engagement in Bosnia has fluctuated under different administrations. U.S. engagement in Bosnia has fluctuated under different administrations, with a decreased focus during the administrations of President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama. Some analysts urge the United States to assume a greater role in Bosnia due to current crises, emphasizing the effectiveness of collaboration between the EU and the U.S. Congressional interest in Bosnia dates back to the 1992-1995 war, with resolutions passed in support of Bosnia's territorial integrity. In Congress, a bill was introduced to establish an enterprise fund for economic development in Bosnia. The House Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing on Bosnia's prospects before its elections. Bosnia's engagement with the U.S. is part of broader concerns over external influences in the Western Balkans. Bosnia has received over $2 billion in aid since 1995 through foreign assistance appropriations. Since 1995, Bosnia has received over $2 billion in aid, with the United States pledging $1 billion between 1996 and 1999 for civilian provisions and reconstruction. U.S. military operations in Bosnia have cost over $10 billion. Foreign assistance to Bosnia has decreased in recent years, with approximately $33 million in FY2015 and FY2016, $53.5 million in FY2017, and $41.5 million in FY2018. The Administration requested $21 million for FY2019 and $16.9 million for FY2020. Bosnia still faces challenges 25 years after the Dayton Peace Agreement, and U.S. relations with Bosnia raise questions on encouraging the government to follow legal rulings. The text discusses incorporating legal rulings into election legislation and the constitution in Bosnia, countering Russian influence in Republika Srpska, addressing potential militarization, supporting reform initiatives, and reviving the Germany-U.K. initiative. It also mentions the decrease in foreign assistance to Bosnia and the ongoing challenges faced 25 years after the Dayton Peace Agreement. The text raises questions about the adequacy of troops in the EU Force mission in Bosnia, preventing destabilization if Serbia and Kosovo redraw borders, encouraging Croatia and Serbia to bridge ethnic divisions in Bosnia, effectively countering corruption with U.S. assistance, and the role of foreign aid in supporting civic groups and independent media."
