The amendment to Section 170(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code allows for a special rule for contributions of book inventory for educational purposes. The property must be used solely for the care of the ill, the needy, or infants, and the reduction in value cannot exceed twice the basis of the property. The term 'qualified book contribution' refers to a charitable donation of books, meeting specific requirements related to the identity of the recipient organization.
