The rise of Pope John Paul II in 1978 inspired Poles to challenge their government and the Soviet Union. In 1980, Lech Walesa led shipyard workers in Gdansk in a strike, leading to the formation of Solidarity, an independent trade union. Solidarity played a key role in ending communist rule in Poland. Walesa was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983. Solidarity candidates won Poland's first democratically-contested elections in 1989 and 1990. Poland joined NATO in 1999 and the EU in 2004, conducting a proactive foreign policy. Poland has actively pursued its national interests and asserted itself with major powers like Germany, the European Union, and the United States. It has cooperated with neighboring states in regional formations but focused its foreign policy initiatives on promoting democracy in Belarus and Ukraine to the east and integrating into the EU to the west. Poland is emblematic of countries tied to both the United States and the EU, aiming to maintain good relations with both despite occasional conflicts like the Iraq war. Poland supported U.S. policy in the Iraq conflict but public opinion turned against involvement due to various factors. The government is withdrawing troops, and there is a perception of lack of gratitude from the U.S. The upcoming parliamentary elections may see a change in ruling party, but foreign policy is not expected to drastically shift. Warsaw may become less pro-American under the next government, as Poland's economic prosperity relies on EU cooperation. Poland's history of Russian domination influences its eastward focus on democratizing Belarus and Ukraine for security reasons. Poland's policies towards its neighbors align somewhat with the United States, being confrontational towards Belarus but seeking engagement with Ukraine. Poland played a significant role in mediating Ukraine's political crisis in 2004, leveraging its EU membership to push for EU and NATO membership for both Ukraine and Belarus. President Kwasniewski, along with EU and Lithuanian leaders, helped negotiate a settlement over a disputed presidential vote in Ukraine. Poland advocated for Brussels to actively assist in resolving the crisis in Kiev and endorsed Ukraine's eventual EU membership. This demonstrated the EU's growing support for democratic initiatives, as noted by a U.S. commentator. Poland's role in promoting democracy in Ukraine and Belarus has been significant, with President Kwasniewski playing a key role in mediating Ukraine's political crisis in 2004. Some observers believe that Poland may now focus on encouraging reforms in Moldova. The country's relationship with Russia is crucial, with some cautioning against a \"phobia\" about Russia hindering Poland's foreign policy effectiveness. Improving relations with Moscow is seen as essential for promoting democracy in Belarus and Ukraine. Poland's EU membership has brought economic gains, including agricultural subsidies and increased farm exports. The country has asserted itself on various issues, sometimes conflicting with major EU players like France and Germany. This assertiveness is expected to continue as Poland strengthens its position within the EU. Poland, a member of the EU, has asserted itself on various issues, including advocating for Europe's Christian heritage in the EU constitution, supporting Turkey's EU membership, maintaining low corporate taxes, and backing the development of an EU military capability without weakening NATO. Poland also supported the United States in Iraq by providing troops during the combat phase. Poland deployed a large contingent of peacekeeping troops in Iraq, but public pressure and various factors led to a phased withdrawal of forces starting in December 2004. Poland's participation in the Iraq conflict was attributed to gratitude for past U.S. support, including assistance during the Cold War. Poland joined the Iraq effort out of gratitude for past U.S. support and to maintain a strong transatlantic security linkage. They believed in the need to thwart tyranny and spread democracy, and saw practical benefits in gaining valuable military experience and information from the operation. Poland's participation in the Iraq operation provided valuable military experience and information, as well as a psychological boost from being treated as important partners by the Bush administration. However, this decision led to domestic difficulties and strained relations with other EU states, particularly France and Germany, who opposed the invasion. Some Poles criticize the unconditional partnership with the US, feeling they are paying for American mistakes in Iraq. President Kwasniewski urged the US to be more flexible, while Lech Walesa openly criticized American dominance in Iraq and globally. President and Solidarity leader Lech Walesa criticized America for failing morally and politically despite being a military and economic superpower. Poles are questioning the benefits of their loyalty to the United States, particularly in terms of military assistance, Iraq reconstruction contracts, and U.S. visa policy. The visa waiver issue is of particular concern to Poles, as they hope to join other countries granted visa waivers for short-term travel to the United States. The political class in Poland was outraged by the US decision to impose visa regulations on Polish nationals after 9/11. Lech Walesa criticized Americans for mocking Poland. US analysts argue that high unemployment in Poland could lead to visa overstays. Making an exception for Poland could lead to other countries seeking exemptions. Poland is lobbying to host a U.S. military base, citing benefits such as economic growth, security, and payback for their participation in Iraq. The country has a history of asserting its independence and protecting its national interests. Poland, a close ally of the United States and new EU member, aims to balance its transatlantic interests. Despite strained resources from the Iraq mission, Poland supports the US within NATO and seeks to modernize its armed forces. Participation in the Iraq operation was a controversial foreign policy decision for Poland since the fall of Communism. Many Poles supported deploying troops with the coalition and were proud of Poland's command role. Poland's support for the US in NATO and its role in the Iraq war have led to increased public opposition and criticism of the US. Some Poles believe that aligning too closely with the US has damaged relations with other allies and suggest repairing intra-EU relations. Poland's actions within the EU have aligned with US preferences, such as supporting consumption taxes over investment. There is a belief that Poland, with its growing influence, could become a leading force within a stronger EU. Poland's alignment with the US in NATO and the Iraq war has caused public criticism. The country supports consumption taxes over investment and emphasizes its transatlantic ties. Poland's independent stance within the EU, including decisions like purchasing US fighter jets, reflects its willingness to mix religion with governance. There is a sense that Poland could become a leading force in a stronger EU. Poland's foreign policy aligns with U.S. international goals, supporting democracy in Ukraine and acting as a bridge between Russia and the West. Despite disappointment over lack of measurable benefits from supporting the U.S., Poland maintains active ties with Russia to discourage non-democratic tendencies. Poland hopes to discourage non-democratic tendencies and sees a future aligned with fellow EU countries. It is speculated that Poland may become a staunch U.S. ally within the EU, potentially leading the Central and Eastern European region. However, neighboring countries hope Poland does not see itself as the spokesperson for Central Europe. Some observers believe Polish politics is transitioning with the fading of the old Solidarity generation. The new generation of politicians in Poland may not have as strong ties to the United States, cautioning U.S. policymakers not to take Polish friendship for granted. With President Kwasniewski's term ending, it is unlikely that future Polish leaders will be as pro-US. Warsaw may be less willing to align closely with the US in the coming years. Poland may move away from the US in the next few years, but will be cautious about setting itself against Berlin and Paris to please Washington. The fall 2005 parliamentary elections could result in a center-right coalition with some members feeling ambivalent about the EU. Analysts suggest that a non-socialist-led government could potentially shift Polish foreign policy. A non-socialist-led government in Poland could potentially push the country's national interests more aggressively in bilateral relations with the United States."
