    "content": "The \"Property Mitigation Assistance Act of 2007\" may be cited as the short title. It includes a Homeowner Mitigation Loan Program. The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Assistance and Emergency Relief Act is amended to establish a Homeowner Mitigation Loan Program for pre-disaster property mitigation measures in States. States must meet eligibility requirements to receive grants under this program. To receive a grant under the Homeowner Mitigation Loan Program, a State must have submitted a mitigation plan, established a process for accepting applications, set up a revolving loan fund, and submitted a detailed plan for setting terms and conditions for loans and grants. The Administrator will allocate grant amounts to eligible States based on a funding formula. The funding formula for allocating grants to States under the Homeowner Mitigation Loan Program is based on factors such as the extent of potential hazards, level of risk, number of properties at risk, prior property damages, and future risk data. The Homeowner Mitigation Loan Program allocates grants to States based on various factors. Each State is guaranteed a minimum of $500,000, and they must contribute a 10% match to receive grant funds. Grants can be used for grant and lending functions, including revolving loans and grants to homeowners and businesses. Each State can provide grants or loans from a revolving loan fund to assist homeowners and businesses with pre-disaster property mitigation measures, ensuring repayment and adequate funding. The property owner must meet requirements to ensure the loan's purpose. States can offer grants for mitigation measures to low-income homeowners and provide low-interest loans for property elevation. The legislation provides grants and loans for pre-disaster property mitigation measures to homeowners with household incomes below 120% of the area median income, and loans for mitigation measures to homeowners with incomes above 120% or any other property owner. Each State must establish maximum grant and loan amounts for elevation and other pre-disaster property mitigation measures. Considerations for determining these amounts include household incomes below 120% of the area median income for grants and loans, and loans for homeowners with incomes above 120% or any other property owner. The maximum grant and loan amounts for mitigation measures should consider maximizing mitigation efforts and enabling homeowners to undertake mitigation activities effectively. Each State must develop a sliding scale mechanism to determine interest rates for homeowner loans based on income level. Interest on loans under this program shall not compound, and the principal balance is due without compounding. The principal of a loan, along with any accrued interest, is not due before a specified period unless the property securing the loan is sold or transferred. The accrued interest on the principal becomes due and payable to the State. Loans must be repaid on a monthly basis within a maximum period of 15 years, with no penalty for prepayment. The borrower can repay the loan in full without penalty, either in a lump sum or through installment payments, before it is due. Interest and proceeds from loan obligations go back to the revolving loan fund. Loans made under this section can be subordinated to refinancing. The borrower can repay the loan in full without penalty, either in a lump sum or through installment payments, before it is due. Loans made under this section can be subordinated to refinancing. An individual homeowner or business desiring a loan or grant under this paragraph shall submit an application as required by the State. Individual homeowner seeking a loan or grant must provide proof of property insurance, including flood insurance if mitigation measures are for flood risk reduction. States receiving grants must establish a process for timely application review. The State issues a determination on loan or grant applications for mitigation projects, considering if the applicant is in a hazard-prone area, if the project is eligible, and if it meets requirements. The State issues determinations on loan or grant applications for mitigation projects based on hazard-prone areas, project eligibility, and meeting requirements. States receiving grants must consult with local governments on proposed projects and cannot use funds for community-wide mitigation activities. States can designate housing finance agencies or other entities to receive grants. The Administrator shall promulgate regulations within 6 months of the Property Mitigation Assistance Act of 2007 enactment. An annual report to Congress on authorized activities is required. The Administrator must report annually to Congress on activities authorized by the subsection, including definitions for terms like low-interest loan, median income, and other pre-disaster property mitigation measures. The Administrator reports annually to Congress on authorized activities, including property mitigation measures such as storm shutters, elevation projects, and other risk-reducing actions. The prime rate of interest is defined as the federal funds rate plus 300 basis points. The term 'property mitigation measures related to elevation' refers to raising the elevation of a home. The term 'State' includes all states of the United States and its territories. $200,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2008 to 2013 for carrying out these measures."
