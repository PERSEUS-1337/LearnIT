    "content": "BAN ON CHILDREN'S PRODUCTS CONTAINING LEAD. Congress finds that young children are exposed to lead in consumer products, leading to adverse health effects such as neurological damage, delayed development, and even death. Children are especially vulnerable to lead poisoning, as even small exposures can contribute to overall lead levels in the blood and increase the risk of health issues. Since January 1998, the Consumer Product Safety Commission has recalled over 50 children's products containing lead, urging manufacturers to eliminate lead in consumer products. Any children's product with lead will be banned as a hazardous substance under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act 180 days after the enactment of this Act. The Federal Hazardous Substances Act bans children's products containing lead, regardless of accessibility to children. Definitions include \"children's product\" for kids under 7 and \"children's product that contains lead.\" The Federal Hazardous Substances Act prohibits children's products with lead content exceeding 0.02% for jewelry and 0.04% for other items. The Consumer Product Safety Commission must establish regulations within two years of the Act's enactment. The Safety Commission may establish lower thresholds for children's products if deemed necessary. If a subsequent determination is made, the Commission can prescribe even lower thresholds. The Commission can set lower thresholds for children's products if needed, without affecting the ban on lead-containing paint in consumer products."
