The Cherry Valley area in Northeastern Pennsylvania is home to over 80 special-concern animal and plant species and natural habitats. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service biologists have ranked Cherry Valley highly as a potential national wildlife refuge. Six endangered or threatened species have been documented in or near Cherry Valley, including the bog turtle, dwarf wedge mussel, northeastern bulrush, small whorled pogonia, bald eagle, and Indiana bat. Cherry Valley provides habitat for 79 species of national or regional concern, including neo-tropical migratory birds, waterfowl, rare plants, and anadromous fish. The watershed encompasses a segment of the Kittatinny Ridge, an important migration route for birds of prey in the Northeastern United States. The Kittatinny Ridge in Cherry Valley is a significant migration route for birds of prey in the Northeastern United States. It also includes a segment of the Appalachian Trail and supports rare calcareous wetlands. Studies have shown high water quality in Cherry Creek, and there is strong local support for establishing a Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge. Local communities, conservation entities, and land-management agencies support the establishment of a Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge, viewing it as a complement to existing conservation efforts. Several local landowners have placed their land in conservation easements, supported by voter-approved funds from Monroe County and Stroud Township. Two federally owned parcels adjacent to the area under consideration for the Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge are the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area and a 700-acre segment of the Appalachian Trail. SEC. 3. STUDY OF REFUGE POTENTIAL AND FUTURE REFUGE LAND ACQUISITION. The Secretary will conduct a study to evaluate habitat in Northeastern Pennsylvania for potential acquisition by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service for inclusion in the Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge, consulting with relevant stakeholders. The Secretary will conduct a study to evaluate habitat in Northeastern Pennsylvania for potential acquisition by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service for inclusion in the Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge, determining boundaries and assessing conservation benefits. The Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge aims to protect threatened and endangered species, enhance aquatic and wetland habitats, provide opportunities for wildlife-dependent recreation, research, and education, and fulfill international obligations. Public participation is encouraged, with special consideration given to local input on potential future land acquisitions. The total area for acquisition should not exceed 30,000 acres. The Secretary must complete a study within 12 months and submit a report to Congress with a map identifying lands for acquisition, cost estimates, and potential funding sources for the Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge. Total acquisition area should not exceed 30,000 acres. Authorization of $200,000 for the Secretary to conduct a study on Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge, with funds from non-Federal sources.
