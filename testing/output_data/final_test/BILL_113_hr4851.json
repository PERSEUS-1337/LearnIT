    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2014\". The Chinese Government restricts access to Tibet for US officials and citizens, while promoting tourism in the region. Foreigners need permission from the Tibet Foreign and Overseas Affairs Office to visit. The Tibet Autonomous Region requires permission from the Tibet Foreign and Overseas Affairs Office for entry, a restriction not found in other parts of China. The Tibet Foreign and Overseas Affairs Office denied over 10 US diplomatic access requests between May 2011 and December 2012. Consular access was restricted by the Chinese Government after a fatal bus crash in October 2013. The Chinese Government has been unresponsive to the US request to open a consulate in Tibet Autonomous Region. Foreign diplomats face restrictions and government-organized tours in Tibetan areas, limiting independent reporting. Foreign tourists in Tibet Autonomous Region face restrictions and are limited to certain areas like Lhasa, Rikaze, and Shannan. They are also required to be part of tightly managed tours, with journalists facing access restrictions as well. Foreign journalists need permission from local authorities to travel and interview Chinese citizens. The US allows Chinese citizens to travel freely within the country, but Chinese diplomats must notify the Department of State of their travel plans. Visas are regularly granted to Chinese officials, scholars, and others visiting the US for government-related activities. Chinese diplomats in the US promote Chinese Government's perspective on Tibetan areas, while restricting US citizens' travel there. They lobby officials to refrain from statements on Tibet, calling it interference in China's internal affairs. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"Tibetan areas\" include the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) and designated prefectures and counties in Sichuan, Qinghai, Yunnan, and Gansu provinces of China. \"Senior leadership positions\" refer to key roles at the provincial level. The curr_chunk lists key positions in Tibetan Autonomous Region including Chairman of People's Congress, Party Secretary, Mayor of Lhasa, and heads of various departments. The curr_chunk lists key positions at different levels including provincial capitals, prefectural and county levels, national level, and regional level. The curr_chunk specifies individuals in Tibetan areas subject to scrutiny, including Armed Police, Military Commanders, and others involved in policy formulation. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" refers to specific committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate. The curr_chunk states that there will be a report to Congress.

The Secretary of State will submit a report to Congress every 12 months regarding access granted to Tibetan areas in China, including lists of senior leaders in specific provinces and autonomous prefectures. The Secretary of State will submit a report to Congress annually on access to Tibetan areas in China, including lists of senior leaders at national and regional levels. The report will be publicly available on the Department of State's website. SEC. 5. INADMISSIBILITY OF CERTAIN ALIENS. An alien is ineligible for a visa or admission to the United States if they are on a specific list and if restrictions on travel to Tibet Autonomous Region are in effect. United States officials, journalists, and citizens face greater restrictions on travel to designated Tibetan autonomous areas in China compared to other areas in the same provinces. If specific permission is still required for foreigners to enter Tibet Autonomous Region, it could impact travel to the region. The Secretary of State may revoke visas of aliens ineligible to travel to designated Tibetan autonomous areas in China. Waivers for national interests may be granted. The Secretary of State may waive subsection (a) or (b) for aliens if necessary for international agreements or national security. Notification to congressional committees required for granted waivers.

SEC. 6. VISA POLICY. Congress emphasizes reciprocity in consular access between countries, urging equivalent access for diplomats. The Secretary of State should consider China's treatment of U.S. diplomats when granting access to Chinese diplomats in the U.S., especially in Tibetan areas."
