    "content": "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized revisions to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ground-level ozone on October 1, 2015, lowering the standard from 75 parts per billion (ppb) to 70 ppb. This revision triggers a process where states and EPA identify areas not meeting the standards and develop plans to lower emissions. The new standards are based on a review of over 1,000 scientific studies and were reviewed by the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC). EPA Administrator signed the standards under a court order. The EPA finalized revisions to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ground-level ozone on October 1, 2015, lowering the standard from 75 ppb to 70 ppb. Ground-level ozone, or \"smog,\" is linked to health issues like asthma and heart attacks. The new standard aims to reduce premature deaths by 320 to 660 annually nationwide by 2025. California was excluded from the estimates due to a later attainment deadline in the 2030s. The EPA revised the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ground-level ozone in 2015, lowering the standard to 70 ppb. High ozone concentrations damage plants and crops, with the U.S. Forest Service finding visible injury at monitoring sites. EPA estimated crop losses could be reduced by $400 million to $620 million annually with a more stringent ozone standard. The EPA estimated substantial health and welfare benefits of reducing ozone to 70 ppb by 2025, with costs at $1.4 billion annually. 107 million people lived in nonattainment areas for ozone NAAQS in 2018, with 20 areas not attaining the standard. The EPA estimated health and welfare benefits of reducing ozone to 70 ppb by 2025, with costs at $1.4 billion annually. In 2018, 107 million people lived in nonattainment areas for ozone NAAQS, leaving 20 areas with a combined population of nearly 78 million not meeting the standard. The actual nonattainment designations in 2018 are based on 2014-2016 monitoring data, showing just over 200 counties in 22 states and the District of Columbia, plus two tribal areas. Emissions contributing to ozone formation have declined, resulting in fewer counties not meeting the standard compared to EPA's 2015 estimate. The EPA's estimate for nonattainment is lower than in 2015. The economic, health, and environmental impacts of changing the ozone NAAQS have sparked interest in EPA's review. NAAQS are federal standards for outdoor air quality, with primary standards protecting public health and secondary standards protecting public welfare. The Clean Air Act defines criteria pollutants that endanger public health or welfare. Six pollutants are currently identified, and the EPA Administrator can modify the list. NAAQS are federal standards for outdoor air quality, defining what EPA considers clean air for pollutants. The EPA sets National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to define clean air for pollutants. Nonattainment areas exceeding these standards must reduce pollutant levels, with a lengthy designation process often delayed by litigation or consultations. State and local governments then have up to three years to produce State Implementation Plans (SIPs) outlining measures to attain the standards. Under the Clean Air Act, ozone nonattainment areas are classified based on pollution levels, with varying timelines for compliance. The process of finalizing State Implementation Plans (SIPs) for EPA approval can be lengthy, with required pollution control measures becoming more stringent based on pollution severity. Compliance with National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) initiates a complex implementation process with far-reaching impacts on public health, economic sectors, and state and local governments. The EPA has tools to enforce compliance with National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), including highway-fund sanctions and federal implementation plans (FIPs) for nonattainment areas. States usually avoid sanctions by submitting adequate emission reduction plans. EPA also sets national standards to control criteria pollutants. The EPA enforces National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to control emissions of criteria pollutants from products like automobiles and power plants. These standards lead to emission reductions that states can incorporate into their plans, reducing the need for local air pollution control measures. The Clean Air Act requires the agency to review each NAAQS every five years, often triggering lawsuits for non-compliance. In June 2013, the Sierra Club sued EPA for failing to review the 2008 ozone NAAQS, leading to a court order for EPA to propose any changes by December 1, 2014. The EPA is required to review National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) every five years. The process involves compiling scientific literature, summarizing it in a Criteria Document or Integrated Science Assessment (ISA), and reviewing more than 1,000 scientific studies. The ISA for ozone covers a wide range of topics related to ozone in the atmosphere, exposure, toxicology, epidemiology, and effects on various aspects. The EPA prepares Risk and Exposure Assessments to identify exposure pathways, at-risk populations, and health endpoints following the completion of the Integrated Science Assessment (ISA). A final Staff Paper or Policy Assessment summarizes the information compiled in the ISA and Risk Assessment, providing options to the Administrator regarding NAAQS indicators, averaging times, statistical form, and numerical levels. The Policy Assessment for the 2015 NAAQS revision was publicly released on August 29, 2014. The Clean Air Act amendments in 1977 mandated the appointment of an independent Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) to ensure NAAQS reviews meet scientific standards. CASAC consists of seven members, primarily from academia and state air pollution sectors. Before the 2015 review, EPA last changed the NAAQS for ozone in March 2008, from 0.08 ppm to 0.075 ppm. The CASAC Review Panel plays a key role in evaluating the agency's work during NAAQS-setting and NAAQS-revision, with panels of experts providing input on specific pollutants under review. The 2008 NAAQS for ozone was subject to controversy, with a more stringent standard recommended by the CASAC Review Panel. EPA agreed to reconsider the standard in 2009, proposing a stricter primary standard in 2010. However, the process was halted by a presidential decision to wait for the 2015 review before making any changes due to evidence of health effects at lower exposure levels. The EPA staff and CASAC recommended strengthening the ozone standard, with a suggested range of 0.060 to 0.070 ppm for the primary 8-hour standard. Despite these recommendations, the standard was finalized at 0.075 ppm by the Bush Administration's EPA Administrator, leading to the designation of nonattainment areas in 2012. The number of counties exceeding the 0.075 ppm ozone standard decreased from 345 to 115 between 2004 and 2016, with emissions declining due to stricter standards and economic factors. The EPA began a process to reconsider the 2008 ozone NAAQS in September 2009, proposing a more stringent primary NAAQS in January 2010. The reconsideration process recommended a primary NAAQS of 0.070 ppm (70 ppb), within the range recommended by the CASAC Ozone Review Panel in 2008. The draft final standard was sent for interagency review in 2011 but was withdrawn at the President's request. The 2015 review, after assessing over 1,000 new studies, supported revising the ozone standard for public health benefits. The EPA is considering revising the primary O3 standard to improve public health protection, with a recommended range of 70 ppb to 60 ppb. CASAC advises setting the standard below 70 ppb for better public health outcomes. The EPA Administrator proposed revising the primary NAAQS for ozone to a level between 65 to 70 ppb, and ultimately set it at 70 ppb in October 2015. The secondary NAAQS for ozone, which protects public welfare, was also assessed. Ozone can harm tree growth and crop yields, with damage accumulating over the growing season. The EPA staff recommended establishing a new seasonal average secondary standard for ozone exposure, termed a \"W126 index,\" to address damage to tree growth and crop yields. The staff suggested a range of 7-21 ppm-hours, but CASAC's ozone panel recommended an upper bound of no higher than 15 ppm-hours. The Administrator's final choice in March 2008 was to set a secondary standard at 0.075 ppm averaged over 8 hours. The EPA Administrator set a secondary standard for ozone exposure at 0.075 ppm averaged over 8 hours, despite disagreement with CASAC and his staff. The Office of Management and Budget argued that the standard did not adequately consider economic values and well-being, but ultimately prevailed in the decision. Upon reconsideration, the 2011 draft final standards would have adopted the W126 index and set the secondary standard at 13 ppm-hours, aligning with CASAC's recommendations. The President's request to withdraw the draft standard halted the implementation of a seasonal standard. EPA's August 2014 Policy Assessment renewed the debate, with staff recommending a secondary standard between 7 to 17 ppm-hours, similar to CASAC's range. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals remanded the 2008 secondary standard to EPA for further explanation or reconsideration. The 2015 final rule revises the secondary standard for ozone protection, emphasizing a cumulative seasonal approach and strengthening protection for trees, plants, and ecosystems. The standard remains the same as the primary standard, with a focus on the fourth-highest maximum daily 8-hour ozone concentration per year not exceeding 70 ppb. The EPA has evaluated ozone exposure to vegetation using a W126 index. The EPA has determined that a W126 index level of 17 ppm-hours is sufficient to protect public welfare based on the latest science. An 8-hour standard of 70 ppb will limit cumulative, seasonal exposures above this level, averaged over three years. CASAC raised concerns about the sufficiency of this explanation in addressing a D.C. Circuit decision in the Mississippi case. The CASAC does not support a level higher than 15 ppm-hrs due to potential biomass and yield loss in tree and crop species. Specific economically significant crops like soybeans may not be protected at 15 ppm-hrs. A level below 10 ppm-hrs is needed to reduce foliar injury, with 7 ppm-hrs offering better protection. CASAC did not recommend a three-year average for the secondary standard. The NAAQS Revisions in October 2015 set the ozone standards at 7 ppm-hrs to 15 ppm-hrs. States identified 213 counties in 55 potential nonattainment areas, with Indian tribes designating two additional areas as nonattainment. EPA is working with agencies to implement measures for attainment. The EPA identified two additional areas as nonattainment for the 2008 ozone NAAQS. Most counties identified are currently in nonattainment or covered by a maintenance plan. EPA completed the second step of the implementation process by finalizing designations after dialogue with states, focusing on monitoring data quality and boundary issues. The EPA finalized designations for nonattainment areas under the 2015 ozone NAAQS, including 51 areas with 159 entire counties and 41 partial counties. This process involved reviewing monitoring data and determining boundaries for identified nonattainment areas. The EPA finalized designations for nonattainment areas under the 2015 ozone NAAQS, including 51 areas with 159 entire counties and 41 partial counties. On July 17, 2018, final designation decisions were made for an eight-county area including San Antonio, TX, designating one county as nonattainment and the remaining seven as attainment. Nonattainment areas are classified based on severity, with Marginal being the least severe and Extreme being the most severe. States are required to submit State Implementation Plans (SIPs) outlining measures to reduce emission levels within three to four years for nonattainment areas other than Marginal. Under the Clean Air Act, states have three to four years after final designations to develop and submit required SIP elements to EPA. Finalizing SIPs can take longer than the designated period. Ozone pollution is complex as it forms in the atmosphere from VOCs and NOx reacting in sunlight. Ozone concentration depends on temperature and sunlight, making it a summertime pollutant. Ozone pollution formation is influenced by various factors such as temperature, sunlight, and emissions of precursor gases like VOCs and NOx. Predicting ozone air quality is challenging due to the complex reactions involved. Control strategies for reducing ozone pollution require implementing a wide range of measures from both stationary and mobile sources of air pollution. Sources of VOCs include motor vehicles, industrial processes, paints, coatings, solvents, service stations, pesticide application, dry cleaning, fuel combustion, and open burning. Nitrogen oxides primarily come from fuel combustion by motor vehicles, electric utilities, and industrial sources. Wintertime ozone pollution has emerged in rural areas of the western United States, particularly near oil and gas fields, leading to high ozone concentrations similar to those in Los Angeles. Recent assessments have found that oil and gas wells in the Upper Green River Basin of Wyoming, the Uintah Basin of Utah, and a nearby area of Colorado release VOCs that react with NOx from oil and gas operations and coal-fired power plants to create ozone. Studies show that 98% to 99% of VOCs and 57% to 61% of NOx in the Uintah Basin come from oil and gas operations, with sunlight reflecting off heavy snow cover magnifying ozone formation. In 2012, EPA promulgated standards to reduce VOC emissions from oil and gas operations, including \"green completions\" for natural gas wells. In 2016, these standards were extended to cover oil wells. In 2015, EPA proposed Control Techniques Guidelines to help reduce VOC emissions from existing oil and gas sources in ozone nonattainment areas. The impact of regulations on wintertime ozone concentrations in the Ozone Transport Region is uncertain. The Upper Green River Basin was designated nonattainment under the 2008 ozone NAAQS but has now been designated attainment for the 2015 standard. Despite EPA being prohibited from considering costs in setting NAAQS, a Regulatory Impact Analysis is produced to analyze costs and benefits. EPA chose a standard of 70 ppb in the 2015 final rule, with estimates for two options: 70 ppb and 65 ppb. The EPA's estimates for two options, 70 ppb and 65 ppb, show nationwide benefits and costs. The estimated annual cost for a 70 ppb standard in 2025 is $1.4 billion, significantly lower than previous estimates. This reduction is attributed to a baseline set at 75 ppb and other rules implemented since 2011. The EPA's rules implemented since 2011, including Tier 3 auto emission and gasoline standards, are expected to reduce ozone precursors. By 2025, these rules are projected to bring monitored ozone levels to 70 ppb or below in most counties. The estimated nationwide benefits for a 70 ppb standard range from $2.9 billion to $5.9 billion annually in 2025, with public health benefits such as fewer premature deaths and hospital admissions. The final standard for ozone control is projected to bring significant benefits, including the avoidance of 320 to 660 premature deaths annually in 2025. The dollar value of avoided premature deaths makes up a large portion of EPA's total monetized benefits, with PM 2.5 co-benefits contributing to a significant portion of the estimated benefits. The EPA projects significant benefits from the final ozone control standard, including the prevention of nonfatal heart attacks, hospital admissions, respiratory symptoms, asthma exacerbations, missed work or school days, and restricted activity days. Critics argue that including co-benefits in the analysis skews the net benefit calculation. The EPA provided separate cost and benefit estimates for California due to the differences in timing for emissions reductions. Most areas in California have until the 2030s to reach attainment. EPA also estimated costs for the eastern and western United States separately. Industry sources estimate that 98% of the $1.4 billion cost to achieve a 70 ppb ozone standard is incurred by emission sources in the eastern United States. A study projected the cost of attaining a more stringent ozone standard at up to $140 billion annually from 2017 to 2040, based on different assumptions from the EPA's analysis. EPA proposed a standard in the range of 65 to 70 ppb, with the cost of attaining a 65 ppb standard being over 10 times that of a 70 ppb standard. The NAM study's baseline differs from EPA's and does not include recent regulations like the Cross State Air Pollution Rule or the Clean Power Plan. EPA projected a decline in coal-fired electricity generation due to the Clean Power Plan, leading to substantial reductions in NOx emissions. The NAM study suggests that more than half of the emission reductions needed for compliance would come from costly \"unknown controls.\" EPA's modeling indicates a smaller role for unknown controls in reducing emissions. The NAM study focused on NOx emissions without considering VOC controls. Recent EPA analyses suggest low-cost emission control options in the oil and gas sector. API, American Chemistry Council, and NAM released state maps showing potential nonattainment areas and costs of the rule on a state-by-state basis. API's nationwide map identified 958 counties potentially in violation of a 70 ppb ozone NAAQS, a larger number than EPA's projection of 241 counties in 2015. The number of nonattainment counties recommended by states and designated by EPA is significantly lower than industry projections. For example, API's map showed more counties potentially in nonattainment than state data indicated. In states like Oklahoma and Kansas, the contrast between industry projections and state data is evident. Other states also showed discrepancies between the number of counties identified on the API map and the actual number identified by state data. The number of counties identified on the API map for nonattainment is higher than those designated by the state and EPA. The 2015 ozone NAAQS review raised concerns about attainment costs, background ozone levels, and review schedules. EPA is focusing on NAAQS reform to reduce burdens on energy resources and streamline the review process. The EPA formed the \"Ozone Cooperative Compliance Task Force\" to address ozone NAAQS issues and explore options for states to improve air quality. Despite cost concerns, the Clean Air Act prohibits considering costs in setting NAAQS standards, as affirmed by the Supreme Court in 2001. The court concluded that Section 109(b)(1) \"unambiguously bars cost considerations from the NAAQS-setting process.\" Cost-effectiveness is considered extensively by EPA and states in selecting emission control options to meet standards, but cost considerations are not allowed in setting NAAQS. In the 112th and 114th Congress, legislation was proposed to require the consideration of costs in setting National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). However, the Senate did not pass these bills. In the 115th Congress, bills were introduced to allow the Administrator to consider technological feasibility as a secondary consideration in certain circumstances when establishing or revising NAAQS. In the 115th Congress, S. 263 / H.R. 806 were introduced to allow the consideration of technological feasibility as a secondary factor in setting NAAQS. The House passed H.R. 806 on July 18, 2017. Some states, especially in the inter-mountain West, face high \"background\" ozone levels originating from natural and manmade sources. Stratospheric ozone can mix down to the surface at high concentrations in discrete events called intrusions, especially at higher-altitude locations. Manmade background ozone includes ozone formed due to anthropogenic sources emitted far away, while methane emissions can also contribute to global background ozone levels. EPA identified two definitions of background ozone: natural background (NB) and United States background (USB). Both definitions identify ozone levels that would exist in the absence of manmade emissions. In the final rule, EPA discussed concerns about revising the NAAQS based on natural background ozone levels in certain states. The agency conducted modeling analyses and concluded that seasonal mean daily maximum 8-hour average concentrations of USB ozone range from 25-50 ppb across the U.S. The final rule stated that seasonal mean daily maximum 8-hour average concentrations of USB O3 range from 25-50 ppb, with the highest estimates in the intermountain western U.S. The rule clarified that U.S. background O3 concentrations will not prevent attainment of a revised O3 standard at 70 ppb. The courts have established that attainability and technological feasibility are not relevant in setting NAAQS. EPA may consider proximity to background concentrations when revising NAAQS. The final rule outlined regulatory relief measures, including excluding air quality monitoring data from design value calculations for certain events, relief for rural transport areas, and the application of CAA Section 179B to approve state SIP submissions affected by international emissions. The EPA's regulatory relief measures may require assessment by states and EPA, causing frustration for states invoking the \"exceptional event\" exceptions. EPA modeling shows few counties exceeding the 70 ppb standard without additional emission control measures. Proposed legislation aims to ease the definition of exceptional events in the Clean Air Act. The House passed H.R. 806 to amend the Clean Air Act, allowing states to exclude air quality monitoring data for NAAQS determination. EPA's NAAQS reviews are often delayed, leading to challenges in implementing revised standards. Many in Congress and affected industries want longer time between NAAQS reviews. Bills introduced to change review schedule. Environmental groups oppose extending deadline to 10 years, as it would delay court-ordered reviews. The existing network of ozone monitors is mainly in urban areas, but ozone can also be high in rural areas. Additional monitoring in rural areas is suggested to detect impacts on forests and agriculture, but funding is a concern. EPA proposed changes to minimum ozone monitoring in a separate 2009 rulemaking. In a 2009 rulemaking, EPA proposed changing ozone monitoring requirements for urban and nonurban areas, but the requirements were not finalized. In the 2015 ozone NAAQS rule, EPA updated the Air Quality Index, revised monitoring seasons in 32 states, and required modernization of the PAMS Network. The EPA has made changes to ozone monitoring requirements, including updating the Air Quality Index, revising monitoring seasons in 32 states, modernizing the PAMS Network, and changing the Federal Reference Method for monitoring. However, additional monitors are not required in smaller urban or rural areas, which could impact the designation of nonattainment areas. The EPA has updated ozone monitoring requirements, including implementing more stringent standards for major sources of ozone precursors. This should make it easier to demonstrate attainment with the ozone NAAQS. The EPA has updated ozone monitoring requirements to make it easier to demonstrate attainment with the ozone NAAQS. Nationwide regulations are expected to bring most counties into compliance by 2025, shifting the burden to state and local governments. Tighter ozone standards raise concerns about controlling downwind pollution from emission sources in other states. EPA has addressed this issue through regulations like the Clean Air Interstate Rule. The EPA has addressed the issue of downwind pollution from emission sources in other states through regulations like the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR, 2005), the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR, 2011), and the CSAPR Update Rule (2016). The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals found fault with both the CAIR and CSAPR rules, but the Supreme Court upheld the methodology of EPA's CSAPR standard-setting process in a 2014 decision (EPA v. EME Homer City Generation, LLP). The complexity of controlling air pollution that crosses state lines has led to calls for Congress to revisit the Clean Air Act sections related to such controls. Congress should revisit the Clean Air Act sections related to controlling air pollution that crosses state lines. Several bills have been introduced on the subject over the years, but none have made it to the floor of the House or Senate since the last major CAA revision in 1990. The Supreme Court's decision in the Homer City case may have further reduced the likelihood of congressional action. In recent Congresses, multiple bills have been introduced to address the revision of ozone NAAQS, with some passing the House but not the Senate. In the 115th Congress, six bills were introduced to affect EPA's authority on ozone NAAQS. S. 263/H.R. 806 would delay deadlines for nonattainment area designations and State Implementation Plan revisions, change NAAQS reviews to 10-year intervals, and consider technological feasibility in setting air quality standards. Regulations and guidance for implementation would also be required. H.R. 806 and S. 263 aim to change EPA's authority on ozone NAAQS by delaying deadlines, revising State Implementation Plans, and requiring regulations for implementation. H.R. 806 also includes a report to Congress on ozone formation and control strategies. S. 452, the ORDEAL Act of 2017, would delay enforcement of the 2015 ozone NAAQS until 2025 and require reviews every 10 years. S. 1203 would defer nonattainment area designations for ozone NAAQS if certain standards are met. H.R. 958, the Wasteful EPA Programs Elimination Act of 2017, prohibits EPA funds for implementing post-enactment ozone standards. H.R. 3354 would delay nonattainment area designation deadlines. The Act of 2018 would delay deadlines for nonattainment area designation under the 2015 ozone NAAQS revision until October 2025. The ozone NAAQS has been challenged in court, with parties on both sides. EPA requested a delay in oral argument in the case Murray Energy v. EPA, which was granted by the court. EPA was required to file status reports with the D.C. Circuit every 90 days. EPA notified the court that it will not revisit the 2015 ozone standard and has started the next ozone NAAQS review. Lawsuits have been filed challenging EPA's final designation of an area in Wisconsin as attainment for the 2015 standard."
