The \"Accutane Safety and Risk Management Act\" requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to withdraw approval for drugs containing isotretinoin within 30 days of enactment. Holders of affected applications can submit supplemental applications for approval. The \"Accutane Safety and Risk Management Act\" mandates drug approval under subpart H of part 314 of title 21, CFR. The Secretary establishes distribution restrictions through a single approved program, requiring direct distribution to pharmacists who are registered and educated on potential side effects. The \"Accutane Safety and Risk Management Act\" mandates drug approval under subpart H of part 314 of title 21, CFR. The Secretary establishes distribution restrictions through a single approved program, requiring direct distribution to pharmacists who are registered and educated on potential side effects, including birth defects, mental health issues, and behavioral problems. Pharmacists must dispense the drug only with prescriptions from certified treatment centers and comply with program conditions. The program certifies clinics and medical offices as treatment centers for the drug, provides certifications effective for one year, and offers educational materials for patients on managing risks and adverse side effects. The drug is prescribed for severe, recalcitrant nodular acne that is unresponsive to conventional therapy, including antibiotics. The patient must be registered with the program, receive education on the drug, complete a questionnaire, and sign a statement. The patient must provide informed consent, undergo blood tests, and receive education on avoiding pregnancy while on the drug. The practitioner must verify that female patients are not pregnant before treatment. The practitioner must verify that the patient has undergone a pregnancy test and received a negative result before issuing a prescription for a 30-day supply of the drug with no refills. Male patients must also receive education on avoiding impregnating women while on the drug. Each further prescription requires another in-person consultation with the practitioner. The practitioner must ensure the patient undergoes a pregnancy test and receives a negative result before prescribing a 30-day supply of the drug with no refills. Male patients must also be educated on avoiding impregnating women while on the drug. Additional conditions may be determined by the Secretary to protect public health. Certification requirements for treatment centers prescribing isotretinoin include practitioner compliance with specified regulations. The practitioner must be authorized to administer prescription drugs, register with the program, receive education on side effects, prescribe drugs according to regulations, report pregnancies, and provide follow-up care. The practitioner, authorized to administer prescription drugs, must register with the program. They cannot issue prescriptions for the drug by telephone, fax, or internet. The practitioner must report adverse events associated with the drug to the Secretary quarterly, except in the case of a patient death, where the report must be submitted immediately. The practitioner must submit a report of a patient death immediately, but no later than 15 days after learning of it. The practitioner must also sign a statement agreeing to comply with program requirements. The program renews certification annually after evaluating the clinic or office. The Secretary monitors the distribution of isotretinoin drugs to ensure compliance with program conditions. Additional regulations may be imposed to protect public health. The Secretary may approve isotretinoin for new uses under certain conditions, which are subject to the same regulations as the original use. The program may be expanded to include the new use or a separate program may be required. The Secretary may require a separate program for the new use, with monitoring and regulations applying to the new use as they do to the original use. Section 3 also applies to the new use. Manufacturers and distributors of isotretinoin-containing drugs must report adverse events to the Secretary, with immediate reporting required for deaths associated with the drug. Further studies are also mandated. The Secretary, in consultation with relevant agencies, will conduct studies on the effects of isotretinoin on the central nervous system and behavioral effects like depression and suicidal behavior in adolescents and adults. Appropriations are authorized for these studies."
