    "content": "The \"Civil Legal Assistance Attorney Loan Repayment Act\" allows for loan repayment for civil legal assistance attorneys under the Higher Education Act of 1965. The purpose of this section is to encourage qualified individuals to enter and continue employment as civil legal assistance attorneys. A civil legal assistance attorney is defined as an attorney who works full-time for a nonprofit organization providing legal assistance to low-income individuals without a fee and is continually licensed to practice law. The term \"student loan\" refers to loans made, insured, or guaranteed under specific parts of the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Secretary shall carry out a program of assuming the obligation to repay a student loan for borrowers who are employed as civil legal assistance attorneys and not in default on a qualifying loan. This program includes loans used to repay specific types of federal loans. To be eligible for loan repayment benefits, a borrower must enter into a written agreement with the Secretary, committing to remain employed as a civil legal assistance attorney for at least 3 years. If the borrower is involuntarily separated from employment due to misconduct or voluntarily leaves before the agreed period, they must repay any benefits received. The borrower must repay any benefits received under the agreement if they fail to do so, the Federal Government can recover the amount owed. The Secretary has the authority to waive the right of recovery if it is deemed against equity or the public interest. Student loan payments will be made for the duration of the agreement, subject to the availability of appropriations. \"Repayments made by individuals under this agreement will be credited back to the original appropriation account. The credited amount will be merged with other funds in the account and will be available for the same purposes and period. Student loan repayments by the Secretary are subject to terms and limitations.\" The borrower and the Secretary can agree on terms for loan repayment, with a maximum limit of $6,000 per year or $40,000 in total. The Secretary cannot reimburse repayments made before the agreement. Additional agreements may be made as needed. On completion of the required service period, the borrower and the Secretary may enter into an additional agreement for less than 3 years. Repayment benefits are provided on a first-come, first-served basis, with priority given to certain borrowers each fiscal year. The borrower must meet specific criteria to qualify for repayment benefits, including practicing law for 5 years or less, serving as a civil legal assistance attorney for at least 90% of the time, receiving benefits in the previous fiscal year, and completing less than 3 years of the required service period. The Secretary is authorized to issue regulations for implementation, and $10,000,000 is allocated for fiscal year 2008 with additional funding as needed for subsequent years."
