    "content": "On July 18, 2005, President Bush and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh signed a joint statement announcing a \"global partnership\" for full civil nuclear cooperation between the United States and India. This agreement marked a significant shift from U.S. nonproliferation policy. President Bush committed to seeking approval from Congress to amend laws for the agreement, while India agreed to separate its civilian and military nuclear facilities, declare civilian facilities to the IAEA, and sign an Additional Protocol for enhanced inspections. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) requires the U.S. to ensure that its cooperation with non-nuclear weapon states does not aid in the production of nuclear weapons. The 1978 Nuclear Nonproliferation Act imposed stricter restrictions on U.S. nuclear cooperation, including full-scope safeguards on all nuclear material in non-nuclear weapon states. This was in response to India's 1974 nuclear explosion, which led to the creation of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG). The NSG later adopted the full-scope safeguards condition for nuclear exports, endorsed by the 1995 and 2000 NPT conferences. India, Pakistan, and Israel are de facto nuclear weapon states outside the NPT with limited safeguards agreements. India's nuclear facilities have minimal international inspections. The Bush Administration required a credible separation plan for nuclear cooperation with India under P.L. 109-401. The President must determine that India has provided a credible plan to separate civil and military nuclear facilities, filed a declaration with the IAEA, concluded legal steps for safeguards agreement, and is progressing towards an Additional Protocol for its civil nuclear program. India is actively working with the United States on a multilateral treaty to cease the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons. They are also supporting efforts to prevent the spread of enrichment and reprocessing technology to states without full-scale facilities. India is securing nuclear materials through export control legislation and adhering to international guidelines. The NSG has agreed to supply nuclear items to India. Indian and U.S. officials have been discussing the identification of civilian facilities, with the U.S. encouraging India to declare its civilian infrastructure comprehensively. There are differing opinions on which facilities should be included or excluded from safeguards, with some critics emphasizing the importance of facilities like the CIRUS reactor, known for its controversial past. The fast breeder reactor program's facilities are also seen as crucial to be placed under safeguards, especially for potential plutonium production for weapons in the future. The fast breeder reactor program is crucial for India's nuclear fuel cycle and energy independence. Critics suggest that opening the international uranium market could aid India's nuclear weapons program. Halting fissile material production is necessary to ensure U.S. assistance doesn't support India's nuclear programs. Indian officials emphasize that the peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement aims to expand their peaceful nuclear program without limiting their strategic program. Critics propose placing specific facilities under safeguards to prevent any potential surplus effect in the uranium market. Observers like Robert Einhorn suggest that safeguards on Indian facilities primarily serve a symbolic role in demonstrating India's commitment to nonproliferation. U.S. officials highlight the importance of safeguards to ensure compliance with Article I of the NPT and prevent U.S. cooperation from assisting a nuclear weapons program in a non-nuclear weapon state. India's nuclear program, described as inherently dual-purpose, has been a topic of discussion regarding safeguards arrangements. Indian officials believe that having the same responsibilities as other advanced nuclear states equates to a voluntary safeguards arrangement, while critics argue for safeguards to endure perpetually. This report delves into India's nuclear fuel cycle, the separation of civilian and military facilities, and potential concerns for Congress regarding nuclear cooperation with India. India pursued civilian and military applications of nuclear energy since the establishment of its Atomic Energy Commission in 1948. Assistance from Canada and the United States aided in the development of the first indigenous research reactor, Apsara. Following a border war with China in 1962 and China's nuclear test in 1964, India intensified its drive for nuclear weapons. The CIRUS reactor provided plutonium for India's 1974 \"peaceful nuclear explosive\" test, leading to a fairly independent nuclear infrastructure supporting both civilian and military purposes. India's nuclear fuel cycle development aims to reduce reliance on uranium by utilizing plutonium, recycling spent fuel, and thorium. The three-stage fuel cycle involves natural uranium-fueled reactors to produce plutonium, fast reactors with thorium to generate U-233 and more plutonium, and finally using U-233 and thorium fuel in fast reactors. This strategy was devised 40 years ago to achieve energy independence due to India's limited uranium reserves. India has not advanced beyond the first stage of the fuel cycle, aside from running a fast breeder test reactor (40 MWth Fast Breeder Test Reactor or FBTR) based on a French design and a small research reactor that uses U-233 fuel (Kamini). The current energy plan is to have 12 GWe installed capacity by 2015 and 20 GWe by 2020, achieved through a mix of pressurized heavy water reactors (PHWRs), light water reactors, and fast breeder reactors. The Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission stated that breeder reactors could support 500 GWe of power generation using plutonium bred from indigenous uranium. India plans to construct 5 fast breeder reactors of 500 MWe each and import 8 light water reactors of 1000 MWe each. Indigenous pressurized heavy water reactors are expected to provide half of the 20 GWe capacity, but there are concerns about uranium shortages. The uranium crisis has led to reduced operating capacity of natural-uranium fueled reactors. The Department of Atomic Energy faces challenges in mining certain uranium deposits due to lack of clearance from local governments. India's nuclear industry includes power reactors fueled by natural uranium and heavy water, with some reactors under IAEA safeguards. Canada and Russia have supplied reactors to India, with plans for more reactors in the future. Most reactors produce 220 MWe, while new Russian reactors will produce 1000 MWe. Domestic facilities are largely not safeguarded. India's nuclear facilities in India include research reactors, power reactors, breeder reactors, uranium enrichment, spent fuel reprocessing, heavy water production plants, and uranium processing. India has three operating research reactors and four decommissioned reactors. Apsara, the oldest reactor, is awaiting refurbishment for testing a new indigenous design. The CIRUS and Dhruva research reactors at BARC in Trombay, along with Kamini in Kalpakkam, have been used for experiments, isotope production, and training. CIRUS reactor's plutonium production for India's 1974 nuclear test raised concerns about violating agreements with the US and Canada. The State Department noted in November 2005 that the debate on India violating a contract was inconclusive due to uncertainty about U.S.-supplied heavy water's role in plutonium production for the 1974 test. Nonproliferation experts criticized the Administration for not resolving the controversy. The Canadian government urged declaring the CIRUS reactor as civilian and placing it under IAEA safeguards to honor the original agreement. The Dhruva reactor, operational since 1985, is also suspected to be linked to India's nuclear weapons program. India's nuclear weapons program includes the CIRUS and Dhruva reactors, capable of producing 25-35 kg of plutonium annually. The Kaminireactor at the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research uses U-233 fuel and became operational in 1996. India has 22 power reactors, with 15 currently operating, 7 under construction, and 3 planned. Some reactors are under IAEA safeguards. The reactors scheduled to be placed under safeguards under the separation plan include PHWR and BWR types. Of the 15 operating power reactors, four are under safeguards. Two pressurized water reactors under construction by the Russians at Kudankulam will also be under IAEA safeguards. Additionally, there are five more reactors planned for construction. India plans to increase its nuclear energy capacity significantly in the coming years, with five more reactors planned for construction. The current 15 operating power reactors have a net capacity of 3602 MWe, accounting for about 3% of the country's electricity consumption. The breeder reactor program is crucial to India's three-stage nuclear development plan, aiming to produce more fissile material than it consumes. India has a Fast Breeder Test Reactor and is constructing a prototype breeder reactor. They also have a uranium enrichment program and facilities for spent fuel reprocessing to produce plutonium for civilian and military needs. The Trombay Plutonium Plant separates plutonium primarily for weapons purposes, while civilian plutonium separation is done at the Power Reactor Fuel Reprocessing Plant at Tarapur and Kalpakkam Reprocessing Plant. India has six heavy water production plants that do not require safeguards agreements but may need to be reported under an Additional Protocol. It is uncertain if India will report all plants or just those not needed for military plutonium production. India's uranium production includes three mines, two copper-mine tailing extraction units, one mill, uranium conversion facilities, and fuel fabrication plants. Safeguards are in place for nuclear material leaving the conversion process and entering the fuel fabrication process. Reporting under an Additional Protocol includes all nuclear fuel cycle activities. India's front end fuel cycle activities, including uranium ore mining, milling, and conversion, are under scrutiny for safeguards and nonproliferation goals. Under Secretary Joseph emphasized the need for a credible, transparent, and meaningful separation plan that contributes to U.S. nonproliferation objectives. Safeguards must be applied indefinitely to prevent any diversion for military purposes. The Administration emphasized the need for safeguards covering India's civil nuclear fuel cycle to prevent diversion to military use and strengthen nonproliferation efforts. A credible plan should declare all civil nuclear facilities, mitigate perceptions of nuclear weapons status, and safeguard power reactors and associated facilities. India's breeder reactors, including the prototype fast breeder reactor, are planned to be connected to the electrical grid for energy production. Safeguarding these reactors would address proliferation concerns and align with nonproliferation objectives, similar to other advanced nuclear states. India's approach to creating a credible separation plan for its civil nuclear facilities is crucial for strengthening nonproliferation efforts. India's separation plan for its civil nuclear facilities is aimed at addressing proliferation concerns and aligning with nonproliferation objectives. India's decisions regarding the plan were guided by its future needs in the weapons program, despite officials stating that the agreement is not about their weapons program. Prime Minister Singh emphasized that the scope of the separation plan was determined based on India's current and future strategic needs after careful deliberation of all relevant factors. India's future strategic needs and program, based on its Nuclear Doctrine, aim to maintain a credible minimum nuclear deterrent. Key considerations include the availability of fissile material for India's deterrent. The July 18 agreement allows India to potentially keep some facilities out of safeguards for future weapons production, but this approach comes with costs. Some suggest keeping a few indigenous pressurized heavy water reactors out of safeguards for this purpose. Some argue for keeping indigenous pressurized heavy water reactors out of safeguards for future weapons production. A phased approach is suggested to allow India time to determine its credible deterrent. AEC Chairman Anil Kakodkar controversially recommended some PHWRs not be under safeguards due to the breeder program's need for unsafeguarded plutonium. Others in India believe weapons plutonium needs can be met from existing reactors like CIRUS and Dhruva. India's need to exclude its breeder reactor program from safeguards is based on maintaining long-term energy security and the 'minimum credible deterrent.' Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission Dr. Kakodkar argued that the breeder program is essential for this purpose. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh emphasized the importance of categorizing power reactors as civilian to conserve native uranium for weapon-grade plutonium production. India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh emphasized the importance of not accepting safeguards on India's indigenous fast breeder program to ensure research and development activities continue unhindered. Indian officials prefer to only place facilities with foreign components under safeguards, with no research and development activities included. Indian officials are reluctant to put research and development facilities, including the prototype fast breeder reactor at the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research, under safeguards due to concerns about financial costs, duplication of critical plants, and preserving India's prestige and independence. AEC Chairman Kakodkar questioned the need for India to adhere to advanced country standards in R&D. During President Bush's visit in 2006, a final separation plan was agreed upon by U.S. and Indian officials. India's principles included credibility, feasibility, transparency, national security, cost-effectiveness, and public acceptance. India's safeguard application was based on the impact on national security. India's separation plan for facilities under IAEA safeguards raised concerns about national security. Key elements included eight indigenous power reactors already under safeguards, future reactors may be included, some facilities in the Nuclear Fuel Complex specified as civilian, and research facilities and heavy water plants declared as civilian but \"safeguards-irrelevant.\" Certain facilities and activities were excluded from the separation list. The separation plan for facilities under IAEA safeguards in India excluded several key facilities and activities, including indigenous power reactors, enrichment facilities, spent fuel reprocessing facilities, research reactors, heavy water plants, and military-related plants. The implementation document stated that safeguards would not be accepted on the Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor and the Fast Breeder Test Reactor. The Fast Breeder Programme is in the R&D stage, with plans to place future civilian thermal power reactors and breeder reactors under safeguards. India retains the right to determine reactors as civilian. There may be non-civilian breeder reactors for nuclear weapons industry, but civilian growth is expected. CIRUS will shut down in 2010, Apsara reactor's fuel core will be safeguarded, and some Nuclear Fuel Complex facilities will be specified. In 2008, some facilities in the Nuclear Fuel Complex were specified as civilian and certain spent fuel storage pools were made available for safeguards. India declared certain heavy water plants and research facilities as civilian, but not subject to safeguards. India's enrichment facility and Dhruva research reactor are excluded from safeguards. India plans to enter into permanent safeguard arrangements with the International Atomic Energy Agency. India's separation plan for civilian and military nuclear facilities raises questions about the safeguards arrangement envisioned with the International Atomic Energy Agency. The plan aims to ensure uninterrupted operation of civilian nuclear reactors in the event of fuel supply disruptions, achieving transparency and oversight on India's nuclear program. Congressional views on the credibility of the separation plan are being debated. The separation plan for India's civilian and military nuclear facilities is being debated in Congress. Under Secretary of State Nicholas Burns stated that capturing 100% of India's nuclear program is not possible due to its status as a nuclear weapons power. The Administration defends the plan as credible and defensible, meeting the standard of effectively covering India's civil nuclear fuel cycle. The separation plan for India's civilian and military nuclear facilities is considered credible and defensible as it covers nearly two-thirds of India's current and planned thermal power reactors, commits to applying IAEA safeguards in perpetuity, and includes upstream and downstream facilities associated with the safeguarded reactors. The separation plan for India's civilian and military nuclear facilities covers almost two-thirds of current reactors, focusing on reprocessing capabilities for the nuclear fuel cycle. Safeguarding facilities like reprocessing and enrichment plants and breeder reactors would enhance nonproliferation efforts. India's plans to build commercial-scale breeder reactors have raised proliferation concerns due to the production of weapons-grade plutonium. The purpose of the breeder program and its potential military application have been subjects of debate among Indian officials and critics. Critics urge India to clarify the purpose of its breeder program amid concerns about fuel sources for future civilian reactors. Prime Minister Singh stated that only civilian facilities not affecting deterrence or research efforts will be placed under safeguards. The planned Advanced Heavy Water Reactor in India is not included in the facilities declared as civilian, raising questions about India's separation plan and its commitment to nonproliferation. The absence of research facilities, reprocessing, and enrichment facilities could be seen as falling short of bringing India into the mainstream of nonproliferation efforts. The Bush Administration has identified enrichment and reprocessing technologies as sensitive parts of the nuclear fuel cycle that should be limited. India's facility at Rattenhalli is reportedly used to enrich uranium for a naval fuel reactor. Naval fuel is not subject to IAEA safeguards, as it is considered a non-peaceful activity. Non-nuclear weapon states have not implemented the provision for the non-application of safeguards to naval fuel. Brazil has placed its enrichment facilities under safeguards, despite having a naval fuel program. India's separation plan raises questions about its adherence to nonproliferation standards. The five nuclear weapon states have not faced this issue as they have not included naval-related facilities in their safeguards-eligible lists. India's naval fuel facilities are not included in safeguards-eligible lists, raising concerns about adherence to nonproliferation standards. The US emphasizes the importance of a credible Indian separation plan to comply with NPT obligations. The US has proposed a lower level of assurance by suggesting the separation plan replace comprehensive safeguards. The US proposes India's separation plan replace comprehensive safeguards, raising concerns about adherence to nonproliferation standards. Congress must assess the impact of international cooperation on India's nuclear weapons program. Compliance with NPT obligations is crucial in assessing US assistance to India's nuclear weapons program. The Atomic Energy Act requires the Administration to provide Congress with a Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement along with a summary of India's plan to separate its civil and military nuclear facilities. Congress also requires reports related to the separation plan under P.L. 109-401. Under the Reporting to Congress provision of Section 104, the Administration must inform committees of material noncompliance with the separation plan, construction of nuclear facilities in India, changes in India's nuclear weapons production, and changes in unsafeguarded nuclear fuel cycle activities. The Implementation and Compliance Report provision requires reporting on additional nuclear facilities and materials placed under IAEA safeguards by India. The curr_chunk discusses various aspects related to U.S. civil nuclear cooperation with India, including India's nuclear weapons program, uranium production, electricity generation from reactors, and the impact of imported uranium on nuclear explosive device production. The President's signing statement on December 18, 2006, emphasized the executive branch's authority to protect sensitive information that could affect foreign relations, national security, and the Executive's deliberative processes. The executive branch's signing statement emphasized its authority to protect sensitive information that could impact foreign relations, national security, and the Executive's duties. Limiting reporting scope may hinder Congress's assessment of the nuclear cooperation agreement at key times."
