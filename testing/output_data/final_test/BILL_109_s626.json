Congress finds that diabetes is a significant public health threat in the US, with over 18 million Americans currently affected and the number expected to double by 2050. Diabetes is the sixth leading cause of death, with Type 1 and Type 2 being the two forms of the disease. Type 1 is characterized by the body's inability to produce insulin, while Type 2 occurs when the body does not produce enough insulin or cannot use it effectively. Diabetes is a costly disease, with $132 billion in health care costs in 2002. Type 2 diabetes is common in the Medicare population, affecting 1 in 5 adults over 65. People with Type 1 diabetes need daily insulin injections to survive, while some with Type 2 can manage it through diet, exercise, and medication. Diabetes self-management training (DSMT) provides knowledge and skills to help patients effectively manage their diabetes and reduce risks. Certified diabetes educators specialize in assisting individuals with diabetes in developing self-management skills to avoid complications and secondary conditions. The Prevention Program study showed that lifestyle changes, like those taught in DSMT programs, reduced the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 58%. This intervention was particularly effective for individuals aged 60 and older, with a 71% reduction in diabetes development. Patients under the care of certified diabetes educators also showed improved diabetes control and health status. Medicare coverage for DSMT was established in 1997, recognizing its value. There are over 20,000 certified diabetes educators in the United States. Certified diabetes educators in the United States are credentialed by the NCBDE and must meet specific qualifications, pass an exam, and renew their credentials. They are uniquely qualified to provide DSMT under the Medicare program. Certified diabetes educators are recognized as Medicare providers for diabetes outpatient self-management training services. Certified diabetes educators are recognized as Medicare providers for diabetes outpatient self-management training services, meeting quality standards established in the Social Security Act. Certified diabetes educators are recognized as Medicare providers for diabetes outpatient self-management training services. A certified diabetes educator is a health care professional specializing in helping individuals with diabetes develop self-management skills to overcome daily challenges caused by the disease. They must meet criteria for initial certification, including a qualifying professional credential. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study to identify barriers for individuals with diabetes in accessing self-management training, including economic and geographic obstacles, availability of referrals, and qualified providers. The Comptroller General of the United States will submit a report to Congress within a year of the enactment of the Act regarding barriers for individuals with diabetes in accessing self-management training. The amendments made by the Act will apply to diabetes outpatient self-management training services six months after the enactment date."
