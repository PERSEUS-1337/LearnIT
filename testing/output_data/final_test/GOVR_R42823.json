    "content": "This report provides an overview of current U.S.-India security engagement, highlighting key areas such as military-to-military contacts, counterterrorism cooperation, and defense trade. Obstacles to deeper cooperation, including historical distrust and bureaucratic challenges, are discussed. The report concludes with a discussion on the outlook for future engagement and the role of congressional action in shaping foreign policy. India has emerged as a significant player on the global stage due to its economy, society, and military power, drawing attention from the U.S. as a key focus of foreign policy. This attention is partly driven by China's rise, leading to converging geopolitical interests between the U.S. and India. The engagement between the two countries has been ongoing since the Bush administration, with a focus on areas such as military cooperation and defense trade. The U.S. and Indian governments have been working towards a strategic partnership since the Bush administration, with a focus on enhancing peace and security. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton emphasizes the importance of India's role on the world stage, stating that a strong bilateral partnership benefits both countries. The Pentagon report highlights the natural partnership between the United States and India, based on shared interests and values. India's growing importance to U.S. interests is expected in the long run. In a major October 2012 policy speech, Deputy Secretary of State William Burns highlighted the growing confidence in the partnership between the U.S. and India, based on shared values such as democracy, pluralism, and rule of law. This partnership includes economic, security, and global initiatives, as well as plans for civilian nuclear cooperation and a 10-year defense framework agreement signed in 2005. Large-scale combined military exercises have become common in the new century. In the new century, there is increased bilateral cooperation between the U.S. and India in military exercises and intelligence sharing. Major U.S. arms sales to India are ongoing, with positive trends in security-related activities. However, concerns remain about India's ability to be a strong international security actor, given its fragile coalition government and corruption scandals. India's economic growth has slowed down, raising doubts about its ability to increase resources and military capabilities. The country's GDP per capita is significantly lower than China and the United States. India's armed forces' equipment and capabilities are modest compared to China, with no clear consensus on its security cooperation with the United States. India's security cooperation with the United States faces challenges due to New Delhi's reluctance to align with American expectations. The \"deselection\" of U.S.-built combat aircraft in 2011 and India's cautious approach to new security postures hinder progress. Indian leaders prioritize maintaining \"strategic autonomy,\" limiting the scope of U.S.-India security cooperation. Progress in U.S.-India security cooperation is expected to be gradual and without major breakthroughs like the civilian nuclear deal. Despite challenges, there is bipartisan support in Congress for expanding the partnership, especially in areas related to security. Congressional funding decisions for foreign aid programs directly impact military ties and counterterrorism cooperation with India. Congressional oversight plays a role in shaping progress, including allowing major defense trade with India. The Caucus urged the Deputy Secretary of Defense to push India to improve defense procurement procedures and pursue co-development opportunities. The rise of Asia has made the region a key concern for the United States, which seeks stability in the Indo-Pacific through security partnerships and open markets. India's increased economic and military capabilities have made it a key player in U.S. security calculations, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. India is seen as a defense cooperation linchpin in the U.S. strategy of rebalancing towards Asia, focusing on expanding military partnerships in South Asia. The U.S. strategy in Asia focuses on countering China's military capabilities and strengthening alliances in the region. South Asia is a key area of interest due to the growing threat of Islamist extremism. The U.S. aims to pivot towards the Asia-Pacific to maintain its economic and political influence. India, as the largest country in South Asia, has long been a target of Islamist terrorism. The United States and India have strengthened their counterterrorism cooperation, especially after the 2008 Mumbai attack. Both countries also share interests in promoting Afghan stability. The George W. Bush Administration advocated for civil nuclear trade with India to align it with global nonproliferation efforts. India is seen as a key partner in global nonproliferation efforts, with the US aiming to prevent nuclear conflict in South Asia. Washington values India's democracy and open markets as factors for international stability and security. India is also viewed as a potential ally in promoting liberal political systems worldwide. India is a major emerging global market on a path towards greater liberalization, projected to play a key role in land-based trade initiatives. Washington seeks India's support for international human rights norms and views the Indian Navy as a partner for disaster relief missions. U.S.-India security cooperation has flourished since 2001, with both countries desiring greater bilateral cooperation. The India-U.S. Defense Policy Group was revived in late 2001, leading to a 10-year defense framework agreement in 2005. This agreement aims to enhance bilateral relations through collaboration in multilateral operations, defense trade, technology transfers, missile defense, and procurement. Despite optimistic outlooks from officials, analysts advise patience in maintaining this security relationship. Experts advise patience in Washington and realistic short-term expectations for the India-U.S. relationship. Some suggest that American focus on shorter-term goals could jeopardize long-term benefits of cooperation. Despite differences in tactics, the two countries' strategic goals are seen as fundamentally compatible. However, a more skeptical view suggests that India may only coordinate policies with the U.S. without becoming true allies in the near future. Over the past decade, the United States and India have significantly increased their military engagement, particularly in naval collaboration due to convergent strategic interests in maritime security in the Indian Ocean Region. India now conducts more exercises and personnel exchanges with the U.S. Navy than with any other country, with over 50 formal events annually. The U.S. and Indian navies have a long history of contact, with joint naval exercises growing in scope and complexity in the 21st century. Exercises like \"Malabar,\" \"Habu Nag,\" \"Spitting Cobra,\" and \"Salvex\" demonstrate the increasing cooperation between the two countries. The Malabar maneuvers, which began before US sanctions in 1998 and resumed in 2002, are high-profile multinational naval exercises involving countries like Japan, Australia, and Singapore. China has shown interest in the exercises, but India has been selective in including third countries. In 2012, New Delhi reportedly declined Japan's request to participate in Malabar '12, which included elements of the US Seventh Fleet. The Malabar maneuvers are high-profile multinational naval exercises involving countries like Japan, Australia, and Singapore. India has been selective in including third countries, with analysts noting India's cautious posture to avoid appearing as a junior partner to the United States. India prefers conducting multilateral naval exercises in the Indian Ocean Region under U.N. initiatives to counter piracy. The U.S. government officials are confident in India's commitment to strengthening navy-to-navy familiarity and non-combat security objectives, despite differences in geostrategic approaches. Relationships among flag officers are described as personable, with higher levels of trust than in previous decades. Informal contacts between senior officers of both navies have become more common, with the top U.S. naval officer even invited to board Indian submarines and warships during a visit. While the U.S. sends a significant number of military officers on training exchanges to India, visits of Indian military officers to the U.S. are more restricted. According to the Department of Defense, 198 Indian officers trained in the U.S. under IMET. The \"Cope India\" exercise is a key component of U.S.-Indian air force cooperation, focusing on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations. During Cope India '09, U.S. and Indian paratroopers conducted jumps from U.S. C-17 and C-130J aircraft. India acquired similar aircraft from the U.S., and U.S. Air Force personnel have provided training on these transports and P-8I maritime reconnaissance planes. India also participated in the \"Red Flag Nellis\" air-to-air combat exercise hosted by the U.S. for the first time in 2008. The Indian Air Force participated in the \"Red Flag Nellis\" air-to-air combat exercise in 2008 and is set to participate again in 2013. The exercise involves various types of aircraft and aims to familiarize the IAF with U.S. network-centric warfare. Younger pilots have been sent to the United States for training and exposure to a multi-national war-game environment. American pilots have been impressed with the skills of their Indian counterparts in mock air combat. The Indian Air Force showcased its Su-30MKIs in Red Flag Nellis '08, facing off against the American F-22 Raptor. Despite India's decision not to purchase U.S. fighter jets in 2011, there is potential for strengthening bilateral air force cooperation through greater personnel exchanges. Bilateral air force cooperation, including personnel exchanges, should be further explored. U.S.-Indian army cooperation is highlighted by the annual \"Yudh Abhyas\" exercise, which has evolved from company-sized field training to battalion-level maneuvers. Notable advancements include American tanks landing in India for the first time in Yudh Abhyas '12, and training on the Javelin anti-tank missile system during a 2010 exercise in Alaska. India has shown interest in the Javelin anti-tank missiles system. The \"Vajra Prahar\" joint exercises between U.S. and Indian special forces focus on various combat skills. U.S. Special Forces soldiers have also attended India's Counter-Insurgency Jungle Warfare School. Both countries' special forces regularly participate in navy, army, and air force exercises. There are no joint exercises involving U.S. Marines due to India's lack of a direct counterpart. India's interest in developing its amphibious units has led to direct contact between the U.S. Marines and the Indian military through exercises. \"Shatrujeet\" exercises since 2010 have focused on exchanges in amphibious doctrine. Indian military officers observed coordination of U.S. Navy and Marine personnel during the 2010 Habu Nag naval exercise, learning about the Marines' landings and facilitating interaction between naval and amphibious elements. In 2010, the U.S. Pacific Command and Indian Integrated Defense Staff conducted the inaugural Joint Exercise India in Alaska, a significant step in U.S.-Indian military cooperation. Washington seeks to conclude the Logistics Support Agreement with New Delhi for reciprocal use of facilities. However, New Delhi is wary of potential entanglement in U.S. military operations. Indian sensitivities have led U.S. officials to downplay the importance of the Logistics Support Agreement (LSA) during recent years. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta stated that there had been no discussion about the LSA during his visit to India in mid-2012. Despite the absence of a bilateral LSA, special exceptions have been made for India to provide logistical support for U.S. operations, such as allowing U.S. military aircraft to refuel in Mumbai during Operation Desert Shield/Storm in 1991, which caused political uproar in India. During Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003, India refused to repeat refueling U.S. aircraft in Mumbai, causing political uproar. India also assisted in Operation Enduring Freedom by facilitating ship repairs, providing escorts, and offering airbases for U.S. operations. In 2005-2006, both U.S. and Indian navies exchanged communications equipment during tsunami relief efforts in the Indian Ocean Region. This trend shows ad hoc logistics cooperation between the two countries. India was among the first countries to welcome President Bush's call for continued development of ballistic missile defense systems. The 2005 defense pact calls for expanded collaboration on BMD, and Indian researchers announced readiness to launch their tactical BMD system in 2012. The United States is willing to discuss potential sales of missile defense systems to India. Despite U.S. offers for collaboration on anti-missile systems, India has not shown interest due to budget constraints and a focus on developing their own systems. There is little progress in bilateral engagement on missile defense, with Deputy Secretary of Defense Carter emphasizing the importance of collaboration during a visit to New Delhi in 2012. Some Indian experts advise against purchasing U.S. systems, citing concerns about effectiveness and regional security. U.S.-India cooperation on space issues has focused on civilian activities, but the need for multilateral codes of conduct for space use is growing. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty, signed by India, does not address current concerns about the militarization of space. Negotiations on space use in the U.N. Conference on Disarmament are stalled, with China and Russia proposing a ban on space weapons that excludes ground-based anti-satellite weapons. The European Union is also working on a space code. Analysts suggest that Asian countries like India and Japan should take a more active role in shaping space-use codes. India and the United States are working on shaping space-use codes to prevent intrusive policies and limit weapon deployment in space. Military ties between the two countries are strong, with a focus on expanding cooperation, especially in the navy. Challenges in military-to-military cooperation involve setting engagement targets through joint workshops. India and the United States are strengthening military ties, focusing on expanding cooperation, particularly in the navy. Challenges in military-to-military cooperation include setting engagement targets through joint workshops. Despite some disconnect in engagement targets, India shows commitment to deepening the military-to-military relationship with the U.S. through sustained interaction and increasing interoperability on common missions. The emerging U.S.-India strategic partnership includes increased intelligence sharing, counterterrorism cooperation, and cyber security efforts. The two countries have established joint working groups and forums to coordinate bilateral efforts in these areas, with a focus on defeating terrorism and violent extremism. The partnership aims to bolster mutual defense capabilities and safeguard critical infrastructures from cyber attacks. The U.S.-India strategic partnership includes increased intelligence sharing, counterterrorism cooperation, and cyber security efforts. The bilateral Counterterrorism Cooperation Initiative was launched in 2010, with both countries prioritizing terrorism as a key security threat. Despite historic Indian distrust, the U.S. increasingly aligns with Indian analyses of the terrorist threat posed by Pakistan-based groups. Coordination between Washington and New Delhi at a tactical level has often failed due to divergent approaches. The U.S. and India have struggled to coordinate their counterterrorism efforts due to geopolitical differences. Despite this, analysts believe that their cooperation in this area is resilient and likely to grow steadily. The partnership began during the Cold War, with the U.S. providing support for dealing with hostage situations and aviation security. More significant support was provided in the mid-1990s, including banning fundraising activities of designated terrorist groups. In 1996, Washington banned fundraising activities of designated terrorist groups, including two Sikh organizations in the United States. U.S. and Indian CT analysts believed that political influence of the Sikh community hindered full cooperation on Sikh terrorism. CT efforts have evolved as a key area for U.S.-India cooperation since the early 1990s, with notable attacks by Islamist terrorists targeting U.S. citizens and interests. U.S. and Indian counterterrorism officials closely cooperated in addressing the 1995 kidnapping of American tourists in Kashmir. In 1997, a landmark U.S.-India extradition treaty was signed, leading to the extradition of Sikh individuals by the U.S. The 1998 sanctions on India abruptly ended contacts between the countries' counterterrorism establishments and curtailed the sale of U.S. counterterrorism equipment to India. However, a Joint Working Group on Counterterrorism was established in 2000. The 9/11 attacks tested U.S.-India CT cooperation, highlighting common security interests and vulnerabilities shared by Washington and New Delhi. Pakistan's role as a facilitator of U.S. policies in Afghanistan posed challenges to the relationship. India quickly pivoted towards cooperating with the United States, offering support in dealing with the Afghan Taliban and Al Qaeda. Despite early signs of a strong partnership, the U.S. ultimately embraced Pakistan, known for supporting Islamist militant groups. In response to Pakistan's support for Islamist militant groups, India and the United States strengthened their counterterrorism ties. This included signing a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty in 2001 and establishing a Cyber Security Forum. Additionally, a U.S. Army delegation visited India's Battle School in Jammu and Kashmir for training on anti-militancy operations. Cooperation also extended to mutual maritime security efforts. The U.S.-India defense relationship has expanded to include cooperation on mutual maritime security efforts, prevention of WMD terrorism, and exchanges of law enforcement best practices. Initiatives have included joint military training exercises, visits by senior Indian forensics experts to the FBI's Quantico laboratory, and sharing of best practices in law enforcement. The State Department's Anti-Terrorism Assistance Country Assistance Plan for India focuses on critical incident response, post-incident investigation, human rights, border security, international threat finance, extradition and prosecution, and protection of critical infrastructure. The U.S.-India defense relationship has expanded to include cooperation on mutual maritime security efforts, prevention of WMD terrorism, and exchanges of law enforcement best practices. The State Department's Anti-Terrorism Assistance program in India focuses on critical incident management, infrastructure security, investigations, and promoting Indian law enforcement participation in regional counter-terrorism cooperation. CIA and FBI personnel have assisted in investigations of terrorist attacks in India, including the 2006 Mumbai bombing and the 2008 attack on the same city. The FBI had unprecedented access to evidence and intelligence following the 2008 attack. The United States and India have improved cooperation in sharing forensic expertise and providing access to legal detainees involved in terrorist attacks, such as the 2008 Mumbai assault. Despite bureaucratic and political challenges, progress has been made in enhancing security cooperation between the two countries. During the 2012 Strategic Dialogue, Indian External Affairs Minister Krishna raised India's interest in accessing suspects involved in the Mumbai attacks in U.S. custody. President Obama inaugurated the new Homeland Security Dialogue during his 2010 visit to India, replacing the Joint Working Group on Counterterrorism. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano visited India in 2011 to promote bilateral counterterrorism cooperation. The United States and India are fostering agency-to-agency engagements on various issues such as counternarcotics, counterfeit currency, and transnational crime. The U.S. has designated the Indian Mujahideen as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, showing support for India's counter-terrorism efforts. Exchange visits for sharing best practices in addressing terrorist threats have taken place between the two countries. In 2011 and 2012, various training programs were conducted on topics like bomb blast investigation, critical incident management, and cyber investigations. Discussions on cyber security cooperation and international norms in cyberspace were held. The U.S. and India have robust operational cooperation between their respective emergency response teams. Bilateral counterterrorism and intelligence cooperation is seen as beneficial, although there are challenges to overcome. Washington is eager for more cooperation from India, but New Delhi remains hesitant with modest aspirations. Structural impediments exist, such as the authority of state governments in India over domestic security, hindering national-level coordination with the U.S. India's challenges in reforming its counterterrorism establishment and reluctance to share intelligence pose obstacles to stronger U.S.-India cooperation. India's struggle with institutional reform of its federal counterterrorism apparatus, including the creation of a National Counter-Terrorism Center (NCTC), faces opposition due to concerns about its structure and powers. One analyst criticizes India's plan to establish a National Counter-Terrorism Center (NCTC) as a misguided imitation of the United States without the necessary resources or constitutional context. Cooperation in counterterrorism efforts is hindered by the involvement of Pakistan, leading to concerns in New Delhi about the United States' commitment to protecting India's interests. The United States has not assured India of its commitment to counterterrorism interests, leading to doubts about Washington's pressure on Pakistan to arrest anti-India militants. Experts suggest revising expectations for more realistic goals in counterterrorism cooperation. Intelligence sharing between the two countries remains sporadic, with efforts to build trust seen as genuine but slow. Intelligence sharing between the United States and India is sustained and supported, with the 2008 Mumbai attacks seen as a milestone in bilateral counterterrorism cooperation. However, challenges such as bureaucratic alignment and capacity constraints persist, hindering effective collaboration. India's limited bureaucratic capacity and centralized decision-making processes, along with divergent views on the terrorist threat and doubts about U.S. commitment to cooperation, pose challenges for counterterrorism efforts in India. The need for equipping and training India's security personnel is highlighted, with opportunities for improvement in the intelligence-policing spectrum. Indian law enforcement agencies in India face debilitating problems hindering counterterrorism efforts, including poor forensic capabilities and lack of a national training center for rank-and-file officers. Establishing a national police training center could significantly strengthen police capabilities, as lower-ranking officers possess valuable ground knowledge of extremist groups. The U.S. is well positioned to assist India in improving its counterterrorism efforts, but there are obstacles such as Indian reluctance to expose intelligence personnel to the U.S. and fears of being seen as a junior partner. This hinders the dissemination of knowledge gained from training programs in the U.S. and impacts the effectiveness of cooperation between the two countries. Some Indian analysts criticize U.S. counterterrorism efforts, citing incidents like the shoe bomber and underwear bomber arrests, warrantless surveillance, and long insurgencies in Iraq and Afghanistan. This challenges the notion of U.S. superiority in counterterrorism. Despite acknowledged weaknesses, India has had some successes in Kashmir, northeastern states, and against Maoist rebels and terrorists. Some analysts express satisfaction with the progress of the relationship between India and the U.S., despite acknowledged weaknesses. They suggest allowing reservations to thaw gradually and keeping expectations realistic. The most optimistic observers advise against rushing the development of the counterterrorism and intelligence relationship, focusing instead on tactical gains for trust-building and aligning broad strategic agendas. The issue of U.S. arms sales to India has gained prominence in the new century as New Delhi pursues a major military modernization program. New Delhi is undergoing a significant military modernization program, planning to spend $100 billion over 7-10 years to update its arsenal. U.S. weapons makers are eager to tap into this market, offering sophisticated equipment. Despite concerns from some Indians about closer defense ties with the U.S., major defense sales to India have grown to $8 billion since 2001. Since 2001, India has engaged in $8 billion worth of defense deals with the United States, showcasing a growing interest in purchasing sophisticated military hardware. Despite this, U.S. defense sales to India only represent a small portion of the country's overall purchases in the past decade. Various obstacles such as legal, political, strategic, historical, and bureaucratic challenges hinder efforts to establish a significant defense trade pipeline between the two countries. Washington heavily regulates arms sales by private U.S. firms to foreign countries based on strategic and national security considerations. The U.S. aims to enhance military relations with other countries by promoting interoperability through shared defense platforms, facilitating better understanding, training, and communication among friendly militaries. This also helps protect advanced defense technology from falling into the hands of competitors like Russia and China. The United States aims to protect its advanced defense technology from competitors like Russia and China when selling arms to India, prioritizing strategic outlook over profit. India's defense imports focus on foreign policy autonomy, power projection capabilities, cost, and procurement procedures, avoiding agreements that may impinge on sovereignty. India is focused on increasing its strategic autonomy through domestic defense production capabilities, while also seeking advanced platforms and technologies from major military powers. The country's budget prioritizes domestic development over defense, leading to the use of a low-cost \"L1\" system for foreign defense procurements. India prioritizes domestic defense production but also seeks advanced technologies from major military powers. Washington's push for advanced technology defense sales is met with caution due to concerns about U.S. interoperability agreements eroding India's foreign policy autonomy. Limited cooperation on key agreements like CISMOA and BECA hinders the transfer of advanced technology to India. The CISMOA and BECA agreements allow the transfer of advanced U.S. communication and guidance technologies to signatory states, including satellite navigation and secure communications equipment. Washington's efforts to bring India on board with these pacts have faced resistance, leading to New Delhi forgoing acquisition of some advanced U.S. technologies in recent procurements. In recent procurements like the C-130J and P-8I, Indian officials avoid agreements with the U.S. to prevent signaling a defense alliance. The visibility of CISMOA and BECA decreased after the delivery of the C130-J Hercules in 2011. Indian air force officials believe not having restricted equipment hasn't affected their operational capabilities significantly. The Obama Administration doesn't see the lack of these agreements hindering military relations. In 2009, EUMA negotiations with India overcame a major obstacle and both governments agreed on the mandatory requirement of EUM and EEUM agreements for the sale of defense items. Customized EUMAs were included with each defense sale to India before this agreement. The final 2009 EUMA solution reportedly allows for detached inspection of certain defense articles if needed. The 2009 EUMA solution allows for predetermined inspections, restricting U.S. access to Indian positions. EUMA checks are gradually becoming regularized, with inspections in India experiencing longer response times. EEUMA checks are primarily handled by the Pentagon's Golden Sentry. The 2009 EUMA solution has led to increased cooperation and trust in end-use monitoring, with some inspections taking place. India has turned down purchasing U.S.-made Javelin anti-tank missiles due to EUMA restrictions, opting for equipment from another country instead. The limitations on advanced technology arms sales under EUMA are being identified with each proposal and sale. India's interest in U.S. high-technology goods dates back to the mid-1980s. Restrictions on sensitive equipment sales to India have hindered technology sharing, but the 2005 defense partnership agreement and removal of Indian defense organizations from the U.S. Entity List in 2011 have eased licensing restrictions. The U.S. Commerce Department approved over 99% of India's dual-use technology license requests in FY2010-2011. The State Department approves a majority of munitions licenses requested from India, but concerns remain about leakage of sensitive technology to U.S. rivals. Even if India signs agreements with the U.S., there is no guarantee of approval for highly sensitive items. U.S. officials trust the Indian government but have concerns about safeguards against technology leaks. India may not fully appreciate Washington's reluctance on technology sharing. Many Indian analysts believe New Delhi is wary of relying on the U.S. for munitions due to past instances of U.S. unreliability as an arms supplier. Concerns include potential constraints on foreign policy freedom during crises, citing examples like the 1990 suspension of fighter jet deliveries to Pakistan and 1998 sanctions on India. The 1998 sanctions on India and a 2009 incident with General Electric engines for India's warships raised concerns about U.S. reliability as a defense supplier. India's preference for U.S. transport and reconnaissance platforms over sensitive items reflects its limited faith in U.S. reliability. Efforts are being made to reduce mistrust between Washington and New Delhi. The United States and India are working to build trust in defense cooperation by addressing past mistrust. Efforts include removing Indian defense subsidiaries from the Entity List, approving license requests, and exploring mutually beneficial defense item sales for co-production and technology transfer. Both governments are committed to eliminating barriers to trust-building through incremental steps on various fronts. The United States and India face challenges in defense trade due to bureaucratic complexities and unfamiliarity with each other's procurement procedures. This has led to missed opportunities and frustration, particularly with U.S. export control procedures. Deputy Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter highlighted concerns about the arcane export control system, especially in the context of India's historical separation from the U.S. industrially and technologically during the Cold War. The Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program is America's government-to-government method for selling U.S. defense equipment. Despite concerns about its rigidity, the acceptance of American jets in India's procurement process showed that the FMS system could be competitive. U.S. firms face challenges due to strict regulations, limiting their ability to negotiate with Indian officials. American defense firms face challenges in India's procurement process, as they struggle to negotiate with Indian officials and navigate the L1 system. Non-U.S. firms have more flexibility in negotiations and can make promises without government approval. The L1 system, which awards contracts to the lowest bidder, may not consider the technological benefits of U.S. defense wares. Executives have raised concerns about unclear taxation guidelines and retroactive taxes in India's defense procurement environment. Boeing has had relative success among U.S. defense firms selling to India due to its prior experience with India's commercial aircraft market. In late 2012, India announced its intention to purchase 22 Boeing AH-64D Apache Longbow attack helicopters for $1.2 billion, choosing the Apache over the Russian Mi-28N. Boeing's CH-47F Chinook helicopter was selected over the Russian Mi-28N in field trials for purchase by India. The sales for both helicopters would come through Foreign Military Sales (FMS) with offsets being a common practice in defense trade.Offsets involve industrial compensation through co-production, technology transfer, and foreign investment. Direct offsets are related to the exported item, while indirect offsets are unrelated. Offsets in defense trade have historically served foreign policy and national security objectives for the U.S. However, they can harm the U.S. defense industrial base by displacing subcontractors and boosting foreign competitors. India now requires a 30% defense offset for deals over Rs3 billion, attracting billions in investments over the past five years. Since 2011, India has expanded the range of reinvestment options for defense offsets, including civil aviation, homeland security, training, and technology transfer. Co-production with domestic arms producers is a key feature, but ambiguity and poor oversight by the Indian government have raised concerns among international arms suppliers. The Indian government's poor oversight and policy hinder bilateral defense trade, with U.S. firms criticizing the requirement for domestic investment. Indian analysts argue that diluting offsets for foreign suppliers compromises the defense sector's development. High-level U.S. officials have called on India to clarify its policy and strengthen oversight on offset requirements. India is considering revising its defense sector FDI policy to raise the controlling stake of foreign companies in joint ventures. The de-selection of U.S. fighter jets in a competition sparked debate on U.S.-India defense trade. The U.S. is intensifying efforts to bolster defense trade relations with India due to India's growing importance in the context of the U.S. \"pivot.\" The U.S. is intensifying efforts to bolster defense trade relations with India, focusing on co-production opportunities and overcoming bureaucratic impediments to enhance the strategic partnership. This push reflects America's sincere interest in India's indigenous defense sector and demonstrates a commitment to strengthening defense ties. India is eager to acquire advanced U.S. defense technology despite strategic hesitations and budget constraints. Analysts believe the expected $10 billion in sales over a decade is significant. The push to reduce corruption in the defense sector in India may make America's corruption-free sales procedure more appealing. The U.S. government and defense firms are adapting to operate in the competitive Indian market. U.S. defense firms are adapting to the competitive Indian market as both countries reform their defense procurement practices. Uncertainties remain regarding joint production and technology co-production, but both governments are committed to long-term bilateral defense trade. The U.S. and India have strengthened their bilateral defense relations over the past decade, with a focus on security engagement in the Asia-Pacific region. India's strategic importance has increased, especially with America's \"rebalancing\" approach. Both countries are committed to long-term defense trade, despite some uncertainties regarding joint production and technology co-production. The U.S. and India have deepened their defense relations in the past decade, focusing on security engagement in the Asia-Pacific region. The two countries are committed to long-term defense trade, with the U.S. amending laws to provide special status for India in nuclear and high-technology trade. The 2008 civilian nuclear deal aimed to boost India's electricity capacity and benefit the U.S. economy, but these goals remain unmet. The U.S. and India have strengthened defense relations in the past decade, focusing on security engagement in the Asia-Pacific region. The 2008 civilian nuclear deal aimed to enhance India's electricity capacity and benefit the U.S. economy, but these goals remain unmet. Despite the lack of similar breakthrough initiatives, the U.S. Congress plays a crucial role in overseeing foreign relations with India. The pursuit of closer security and defense trade ties with India faces hurdles and risks, symbolized by sales of advanced weapons without certain defense agreements being signed. Both capitals have shown willingness to cooperate for strategic partnership. India and the U.S. have shown willingness to work together within legal constraints, but face difficulties in sensitive areas like end-use monitoring. India's focus on co-production and technology sharing could limit future opportunities. Congressional oversight may be needed to address disagreements and encourage progress in military ties and defense trade. The foundation of the U.S.-India security relationship is crucial. The U.S.-India security relationship is stable, with mutual confidence growing. Congressional parties can shape the partnership to protect American interests in the 21st century."
