    "content": "Under Section 162(l) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), self-employed individuals can deduct their spending on health insurance for themselves and immediate family members. This deduction is available to sole proprietors, working partners in a partnership, or employees of a subchapter S corporation who own over 2% of the firm's stock. The deduction is above-the-line, meaning it can be claimed even if not itemizing deductions. Self-employed individuals offering health benefits to employees can deduct those costs as a business expense, but cannot include them in the Section 162(l) deduction. The deduction under IRC Section 162(l) for self-employed individuals has limitations. It cannot exceed the net earned income from the business where the health plan was purchased, minus deductions for self-employment tax and contributions to certain pension plans. The deduction is not allowed if the individual is eligible for an employer-sponsored health plan or if the expenses are already included in medical expenses for itemized deductions under IRC Section 213. Health insurance spending by self-employed individuals is not considered an ordinary and necessary business expense, so it must be added to the income base for the self-employment tax. Payments for long-term care insurance can also be included in health insurance expenditures eligible for deduction, with limits based on the taxpayer's age. Deductible amounts range from $320 for those under 40 to $3,980 for those over 70 in 2009. An individual can open a health savings account (HSA) with tax benefits by being covered by a qualified high-deductible health insurance plan. In 2009, the deductible for individual coverage is at least $1,150, with a cap of $5,800 on out-of-pocket expenses. Contributions to an HSA are limited to the lesser of the deductible or $3,000 for individual plans, and $5,950 for family plans. Employer contributions are exempt from income. Individuals age 55 and older can contribute $1,000 more to an HSA. Employer contributions are tax-exempt, and account owners can deduct their contributions. Self-employed individuals cannot contribute pre-tax and must include contributions in their income base for self-employment tax. Withdrawals for medical expenses are tax-free, and unused balances can roll over without penalty. Self-employed individuals can also open Archer MSAs, with more restrictive contribution rules. In 2007, an estimated 14.0 million non-elderly self-employed individuals had health insurance coverage. 71% of those with private insurance were covered through employer plans. Individual coverage for MSAs and HSAs cannot exceed 65% of the deductible, while family coverage is limited to 75% of the deductible. Holders of MSAs can transfer balances to HSAs. In 2007, 71% of the 14.0 million non-elderly self-employed individuals with health insurance were covered through employer plans. The remaining 2.8 million self-employed individuals purchased private health insurance on their own. Individual taxpayers claimed a total of $20.3 billion in deductions for health insurance in 2006, with the cost of the deduction estimated to be $4.8 billion in FY2009. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 introduced health insurance deductions for self-employed individuals, initially limited to 25% of qualified expenses and set to expire in 1989. Congress made changes before considering extension legislation. The Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 added limitations on deduction amounts based on earned income and inclusion in self-employment tax calculations. The self-employment tax deduction was extended multiple times in the early 1990s through various acts of Congress. It was allowed to expire in 1993 but was permanently extended in 1995, retroactive to 1994. The deduction also increased the deductible share of health insurance expenditures. The 104th Congress passed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA, P.L. 104-91), which raised the deductible share of health insurance expenditures for self-employed individuals from 30% in 1996 to 80% in 2006. HIPAA also allowed self-employed taxpayers to include payments for qualified long-term care insurance in the deduction starting from January 1, 1997. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA, P.L. 104-91) raised the deductible share of health insurance expenditures for self-employed individuals from 30% in 1996 to 80% in 2006. This change was accelerated by P.L. 105-277, which increased the deductible share to 100% starting in 2003. The deduction aims to provide tax benefits for self-employed individuals comparable to employee health benefits and to expand health insurance coverage among the self-employed. The effectiveness of the deduction can be measured by its impact on reducing the after-tax cost of health insurance for self-employed individuals. The deduction for health insurance for self-employed individuals reduces the after-tax cost by the individual's marginal income tax rate. This can lead to an increase in coverage rates among the self-employed, with the extent of the increase depending on the sensitivity of demand to cost changes. The deduction is more valuable for those with higher incomes due to their higher marginal tax rates. The tax deduction for health insurance for self-employed individuals is based on the taxpayer's marginal tax rate, leading to varying benefits. Evidence suggests that the deduction has increased health insurance coverage among the self-employed, with a notable rise in coverage rates after the deduction was enacted in 1986. The tax deduction for health insurance for self-employed individuals has led to a rise in coverage rates, reaching 76% after its enactment in 1986. However, coverage has gradually declined since then, with only 69% in 2007. The cost of health care has been a significant factor offsetting the initial stimulus of the deduction on the demand for health insurance among the self-employed. The tax deduction for health insurance for self-employed individuals has had a mixed impact on coverage rates. While it initially led to a rise in coverage rates, reaching 76% after its enactment in 1986, coverage has gradually declined since then to 69% in 2007. The deduction lowers the after-tax cost of health insurance for the self-employed, but they still face higher costs compared to wage earners due to the self-employment tax. This disparity creates an uneven playing field in tax subsidies for health insurance purchase between the two groups. A truly level playing field would allow self-employed individuals to exclude health insurance payments from the self-employment tax. The federal tax code treats self-employed individuals unequally in accessing health insurance compared to wage earners. There is no deduction or exclusion for health insurance for the unemployed or those without employer-provided benefits. Their only option is to claim the itemized deduction for medical expenses. Despite this disparity, a study found that self-employed individuals utilized medical services at the same rate as wage earners in 1996. The study in 1996 found that self-employed individuals utilized medical services at the same rate as wage earners, despite being less likely to be insured. There were no significant differences in hospital admissions, dental checkups, and optometrist visits between the two groups. Self-employed individuals had higher utilization rates for alternative care and chiropractor visits, and their medical spending did not affect their ability to purchase other goods and services. The study questions the need for deductions to increase medical care utilization among the self-employed. The findings suggest that access to medical care may not be influenced by current tax subsidies for health insurance. Proposed tax subsidies, like a refundable tax credit in H.R. 879, could potentially increase health insurance coverage for self-employed individuals and the general population. The key factor is the effective rate of the credit compared to the current deduction under IRC Section 162. The cost of health insurance for self-employed individuals can be better offset by claiming a refundable tax credit rather than a deduction. This is illustrated by a simple example where the after-tax cost of a policy is lower with a credit compared to a deduction. Several bills in Congress aim to equalize the tax treatment of health insurance for self-employed individuals and wage earners. The proposed bills aim to exempt health insurance expenditures by the self-employed from self-employment tax, potentially reducing costs by 15.3%. The revenue cost of the exemption is uncertain and could impact future congressional decisions. This change may increase health insurance coverage among the self-employed. The 111th Congress is considering various proposals to expand health insurance coverage and control healthcare spending, including national health insurance plans, expanding public health insurance programs, and encouraging reforms in state health insurance regulations. H.R. 3200 is a prominent example of a proposal to expand health insurance coverage. It would require individuals to have health insurance, create a health insurance exchange, provide subsidies for low-income individuals, and require employers to provide health insurance or contribute to a trust fund. The proposed measure aims to increase health insurance coverage among the self-employed by offering tax credits to small employers, imposing new regulations on health plans, and expanding Medicaid coverage. In 2007, 26% of self-employed individuals under 65 had no health insurance, compared to 14% of the overall uninsured population. The coverage rate for the self-employed was 74%, lower than that for wage and salary workers at 83%. The uninsured self-employed, mostly with low incomes, could benefit from a measure like H.R. 3200, which includes an individual mandate, income-based subsidies, and health insurance market reforms. The tax deduction for health insurance expenses for the self-employed is simple to administer and helps expand coverage by reducing costs. The tax deduction for health insurance expenses for the self-employed benefits them and their families by reducing after-tax costs. It addresses market failure by lowering the uninsured's negative externalities, such as spreading diseases and passing on uncompensated care costs. However, it also has disadvantages that impact the current debate on expanding healthcare access through tax subsidies. The tax deduction for health insurance expenses for the self-employed may lead to unfair outcomes due to its value being dependent on income levels. A refundable tax credit for health insurance purchases could be a better policy option to provide assistance to those most in need. A refundable tax credit for health insurance purchases could provide more targeted assistance to those in need, especially compared to the current tax deduction for self-employed individuals. The advantages of employer-provided health insurance cannot be replicated by a tax deduction, as group health plans offer unique benefits for participants. In the group market, health plans are negotiated with insurers based on group characteristics like claims history and demographics. Individual health plans are tailored to individual needs through medical underwriting, where applicants undergo medical examinations to assess their risk for costly health problems before coverage is offered. In the group market, insurers decide on policy offerings, coverage, and costs within state law requirements, leading to stable pricing, greater coverage, and lower premiums compared to the non-group market. Group insurance benefits from economies of scale in administrative functions and allows large employers to negotiate better deals with insurers for more generous benefits at lower costs. There are challenges in modifying deductions for self-employed individuals to access employer-sponsored health plans. The U.S. health insurance market may need an overhaul to allow all adults, regardless of employment and health status, to join group health plans. The deduction for employer contributions to health plans could lead to inefficient use of medical care due to moral hazard, where individuals consume more healthcare than needed because insurance covers most costs. The widespread use of health care with marginal benefits less than true costs can lead to social welfare loss. Offering substantial subsidies for health insurance coverage may result in individuals purchasing more insurance than they would without subsidies. Wage earners and the self-employed are more likely to buy generous health insurance coverage due to the lack of caps on exclusion or deduction. The current tax deduction for health insurance coverage may lead to individuals purchasing more insurance than they would without subsidies, increasing the costs of moral hazard. Capping the deduction at average premiums in the non-group market is suggested to prevent overly generous coverage for the self-employed. This highlights an inequity in tax treatment, as only the self-employed and those with employer-provided benefits receive a subsidy, leaving the unemployed and those without benefits at a disadvantage. Some individuals may only lower health insurance costs by claiming itemized deductions for medical expenses, but few qualify due to high thresholds. Health care reform proposals in Congress aim to provide tax subsidies for health insurance for those without employer-provided benefits."
