    "content": "Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the Gulf Coast between New Orleans, Louisiana, and Mobile, Alabama, impacting hundreds of thousands of families in three states and causing over 1,000 deaths. The storm affected 5.8 million people with hurricane-force winds, leading to property damage, loss of life, and significant displacement. Hurricane Katrina caused property damage, loss of life, and displacement of population within a 100-mile radius of its landfall. Flooding, mainly due to breached levees, affected the most people, with New Orleans experiencing significant flooding. Fourteen counties with 2.5 million people experienced flooding and structural damage in this area. Hurricane Katrina impacted Orleans, Biloxi-Gulfport-Pascagoula, and Mobile, affecting about 700,000 people with flooding and structural damage. The report focuses on this severely impacted population within 14 counties. The report discusses FEMA's disaster declaration process and presents CRS estimates of the affected population. The report presents CRS estimates of the population living in 14 eligible counties most affected by Hurricane Katrina, broken down by flooding and structural damage levels. It also provides a social-demographic profile of this population, including characteristics like poverty, race/ethnicity, homeownership, and age groups. The findings are relevant to the post-Katrina debate on addressing the needs of the affected populations. The report discusses the immediate and ongoing needs of populations affected by Hurricane Katrina, including federal disaster assistance available for affected areas. The declaration process for emergencies is similar to major disasters, with two main categories of assistance: public assistance for state and local governments. Federal assistance is provided to individuals and households affected by disasters, including financial help for housing, repairs, and other expenses. FEMA regulations determine eligibility based on factors like damage concentration and trauma to communities. Presidential discretion and specific criteria are used to designate areas for aid. The analysis focuses on areas hardest hit by the hurricane, considering factors like damage, trauma to communities, special populations, agency support, insurance coverage, and individual assistance provided by the state. 31 parishes in Louisiana, 47 counties in Mississippi, and 10 counties in Alabama were eligible for disaster assistance. The estimates of damage from flooding and structural damage after Hurricane Katrina are based on Census 2000 data and FEMA assessments. FEMA categorizes damage into Catastrophic, Extensive, and Moderate levels. After Hurricane Katrina, FEMA categorized damage into Catastrophic, Extensive, and Moderate levels. The damage levels range from total destruction to superficial damage, with separate categories for flood/water damage. Over 700,000 people were severely impacted by the disaster. Population Estimates. Over 700,000 people were most acutely impacted by Hurricane Katrina, with approximately 657,000 living in flooded areas. Among those impacted by flooding, around 25,000 also experienced significant structural damage. In non-flooded areas, about 54,000 people were affected by structural damage likely caused by wind and surging water. Areas affected by Hurricane Katrina have been regrouped into categories to capture the populations most impacted by the storm: Catastrophic damage (40,000), Flooded excluding catastrophic damage (652,000), Non-flooded with extensive damage (5,600), and Non-flooded with moderate damage (13,700). Flooding and structural damage are assessed separately, with areas experiencing both classified accordingly. The majority of the population affected by flooding after Hurricane Katrina was concentrated in Louisiana, particularly in St. Bernard Parish and Orleans Parish. Over three-quarters of Orleans Parish's population and nearly its entire population in St. Bernard Parish were affected by flooding. In Mississippi, nearly 22,000 people were affected by flooding, with the majority in Hancock County. The majority of the population affected by flooding after Hurricane Katrina was concentrated in Louisiana, particularly in St. Bernard Parish and Orleans Parish. In Mississippi, nearly 22,000 people were affected by flooding, with the majority in Hancock County, the westernmost county on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Alabama experienced little flooding that directly impacted populated areas. Areas of catastrophic, extensive, and moderate damage were identified in the FEMA Damage Assessment after Hurricane Katrina. In areas with catastrophic damage, most structures were destroyed, with the majority of affected population in Mississippi, particularly in Harrison County. Approximately 40,000 persons lived in areas with catastrophic damage, with 31,000 likely displaced in Harrison County alone. In Louisiana, an estimated 2,400 people likely experienced catastrophic damage, with 1,500 of them living in Plaquemines Parish. In Alabama, no catastrophic damage was assessed, with minimal flooding in populated areas. Additionally, 9,700 persons lived in areas with extensive damage, and 29,000 persons in areas with moderate damage after Hurricane Katrina. In the moderate damage category, solid structures withstood exterior and interior damage, and some mobile homes were destroyed. Mississippi accounted for the majority of the population affected by extensive (66%) and moderate (53%) damage. Hancock County had higher concentrations of its population affected by hurricane damage compared to neighboring counties. In Louisiana, Orleans Parish and Jefferson Parish were the most impacted by extensive and moderate damage. Alabama's Mobile and Baldwin Counties experienced no catastrophic damage. Hurricane Katrina caused extensive and moderate damage in Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. The storm displaced many people, leading to the loss of homes and making one of the poorest areas in the country even poorer. The impact of flooding and storm damage was significant, with Mississippi bearing the majority of the population affected. Alabama's Mobile and Baldwin Counties did not experience catastrophic damage. Among those displaced by Hurricane Katrina, many lost their homes, possessions, and jobs. Some received assistance from FEMA, Small Business loans, or unemployment insurance, but those in the hardest-hit areas may now be destitute. The socio-economic profile of these areas indicates that the newly poor would join a population already disproportionately disadvantaged. Before the storm, the 700,000 people affected by Katrina were more likely to be poor, minority, and disconnected from the workforce. The economic and social impact of Hurricane Katrina will be felt for years to come, with mass displacement of people and fractured communities. Estimates suggest that 700,000 were acutely impacted, with figures as high as 1.2 million cited for the displaced. At their peak, shelters housed over 270,000 evacuees, but as of October 19, fewer than 8,000 remained. Those who were poor before the storm, and those who became poor following it, face challenges in reestablishing their lives due to limited financial resources. As of October 19, fewer than 8,000 evacuees remained in shelters, with many living in interim housing such as FEMA-provided trailers and apartments. FEMA has approved over 265,000 applications for temporary housing payments and provided nearly 12,000 trailers. The future housing situation for these families is uncertain, but the impact of Hurricane Katrina has already transformed individuals, families, and communities, especially those in poor and minority communities in the Gulf Coast region. The poverty rates in Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi were significantly high even before the hurricane, with about one-fifth of the population in the impacted areas being poor. These rates were well above the national average, reflecting the overall high poverty rates in the region. The poverty rate in storm-damaged areas of Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi combined is 20.7%, with Louisiana having the highest poverty rates due to its larger population in the affected areas. This data is based on FEMA assessments and Census 2000 files. The Congressional Research Service estimates that about one-fifth of the population most directly impacted by Hurricane Katrina was poor, with over 30% having incomes below one-and-one-half times the poverty line and over 40% below twice the poverty line. The hurricane's impact on New Orleans also disproportionately affected individuals under age 15. The impact of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans disproportionately affected African Americans, with an estimated 310,000 black people directly impacted by the storm. In Orleans Parish, 272,000 black people were displaced, accounting for 73% of the population affected. Additionally, over one-third of displaced blacks were estimated to have been poor based on 2000 Census data. Among non-black persons in the parish likely displaced by Hurricane Katrina, an estimated 14.6% were poor. The elderly, who may have had close ties to their communities, were especially affected. They were more likely to live alone, not own a car, and have difficulty evacuating. Among aged homeowners likely displaced by the storm, over 70% had lived in their homes for over 20 years. Among likely displaced aged renters after Hurricane Katrina, 55% had lived in their rental units for over 20 years, and 36% over 30 years. An estimated 88,000 persons aged 65 and older were affected by flooding and/or storm damage, with 27,000 living alone. Additionally, nearly half of all persons aged 65 or older in affected areas reported having a disability. Among persons aged 65 and older in flood or damage-affected areas, a significant percentage reported having disabilities, including sensory disabilities and activity-limiting disabilities. Specifically, 13% reported self-care disabilities, 19% reported difficulties going outside unassisted, and higher percentages were reported among those aged 75 and older. Among aged persons likely displaced by Hurricane Katrina, a significant percentage had disabilities, with one-third of those aged 75 and older reporting a disability. Additionally, a large portion of the aged displaced population were poor, with nearly 28% having incomes below 150% of the poverty line. A considerable number of households in flood or damage-affected areas had no vehicle available, especially among those aged 65 or older. About one-fourth of the population in these areas were children under 18 years old, potentially facing displacement at the beginning of the school year. Hurricane Katrina displaced an estimated 183,000 children, including 136,000 school-age children and 47,000 children under 5 in flooded or damaged areas. Child poverty rates were higher in affected areas compared to the national average. The Census Bureau determined poverty status for 180,000 children in these areas. The poverty rate for children in Hurricane Katrina flooded or damaged areas was 30%, almost twice the national child poverty rate of 16.6%. Approximately 15,000 preschool-age children and 40,000 school-age children in these areas were poor. Over half of the displaced children were African-American. Approximately 45% of displaced black children affected by Hurricane Katrina were estimated to be poor, accounting for 25% of all children displaced by the storm. 38% of children in the hurricane-affected areas lived in female-headed families, compared to 20% nationally. Children in female-headed families are more likely to be poor than those in married couple or other families. In Hurricane Katrina-damaged areas, 12,000 preschool children lived in families headed by single mothers, reflecting a high rate of children in female-headed families. African-American children were disproportionately affected by the hurricane and more likely to be raised by single mothers. Hurricane Katrina disproportionately impacted the poor, with lower labor force participation rates and higher unemployment in damaged areas. Male youths had a 55% participation rate compared to 65% nationwide, while adult men had a 77% rate compared to 82% nationally. In hurricane-damaged areas, labor force participation was lower for men compared to the national average, with higher unemployment rates for both youth and adult men. An estimated 72,000 men over the age of 16 were not working, with 47,000 aged 25-64. Young women aged 16-24 also had lower labor force participation rates and higher unemployment than the national average. Women aged 25-64 in hurricane-damaged areas had similar labor force participation rates to the national average. In hurricane-damaged areas, employment-population ratios for youths and prime working-age adults were lower than the national average, with men experiencing substantially lower rates. Young women in these areas also had employment rates below national averages. Employment-population ratios for young women in hurricane-affected areas were below national averages, while prime working-aged women had slightly lower rates. The adult population in these areas also had lower educational attainment levels compared to the national average, with 23% lacking a high school diploma. In hurricane-damaged or flooded areas, younger adults had lower educational attainment levels compared to U.S. metropolitan areas overall. 22.8% of younger adults aged 18 to 34 without school enrollment did not have a high school diploma, lower than the national average of 20.6%. Additionally, only 22.5% of those in Katrina storm or flood-damaged areas had attained a post-secondary school degree, compared to 29.3% in U.S. metropolitan areas overall. Estimates from CRS and FEMA show households in hurricane-damaged areas had $10 billion in earnings in 1999, including wages and salaries. Some workers in less affected areas may not be included in this estimate. The impact of Hurricane Katrina on households in affected areas was substantial, with an estimated $10 billion in earnings in 1999. This amount represented nearly 29% of total earnings in the 14 county area. The low rate of homeownership in the impacted areas further highlighted the financial disadvantage prior to the hurricane, with only 66% of households owning their homes. The rate of homeownership in Katrina-impacted areas was only 55%, compared to the national rate of 66% in 2000. This lower rate may affect the return of displaced residents, as renters are more mobile and may find it easier to resettle in new communities. Homeowners in Katrina-impacted areas may need to repair or sell their damaged homes, with 65% having mortgages. Data suggests strong community ties, as many had lived in their homes for 20+ years. Renters also had ties, with 29% living in their homes for 10+ years. Most homeowners lived in single-family homes. Overall, a high percentage of homes in the Katrina-impacted areas were mobile homes, reflecting the lower incomes in the area and the susceptibility of mobile homes to damage. Among the households impacted by the storm, 55% owned their own home, with 27% of poor households and 62% of non-poor households being homeowners. Additionally, a quarter of owners and 46% of renters in the impacted areas had housing conditions such as paying more than 30% of income towards housing costs, overcrowding, and lacking complete plumbing or kitchen facilities. The report's analysis is based on FEMA flood and damage assessments merged with Census 2000 data. The assessments were derived from aerial imagery and may have limitations in categorizing areas. The data suggests that housing inadequacy and affordability rates may change as new housing is built after the hurricane. The report relies on Census 2000 data and FEMA flood assessments to infer the social and demographic characteristics of populations impacted by Hurricane Katrina. The FEMA data may not capture all damage, especially inland in Mississippi. More data on the hurricane's impact is expected to become available over time. NOAA continues to conduct flyovers of the affected area for damage categorization. The Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has conducted flyovers of the impacted area to update data as flood waters recede. Local officials, insurance adjusters, and the American Red Cross have assessed structural damage, estimating that 885,791 structures were impacted by Hurricane Katrina, with 492,576 either destroyed or sustaining major damage. The American Red Cross conducted further assessments indicating that FEMA's damage assessment for Hurricane Katrina in Mississippi does not capture the full extent of inland damage. Red Cross data show 4,609 destroyed dwellings outside the three counties assessed by FEMA, accounting for 6.7% of all destroyed dwellings in Mississippi. Additionally, the Red Cross identified 65,237 dwellings with major damage in Mississippi, with 45.9% located in inland counties not included in FEMA's assessment. The FEMA database of registrants provides data on individuals and households affected by Hurricane Katrina, with over 2 million registrations for disaster assistance. Information includes pre-evacuation and post-disaster locations based on zip codes. While privacy concerns are noted, some media outlets have published maps showing displacement patterns. The estimates in this report are based on FEMA flood and damage assessment data, combined with Census 2000 demographic and geographic boundary data. FEMA's assessments were done using remote sensing imagery and analysts' on-site assessments. The data was mapped into a Geographic Information System (GIS) by a Library of Congress cartographer. The GIS used U.S. Census data for geo-spatial analysis and mapping to assess damage and flooding. Estimates in the report are based on 2000 data, providing a rough approximation of the impacted population characteristics. The estimates of hurricane impact focus on persons, families, and households, with a heavy reliance on FEMA data. The American Red Cross found that FEMA's assessment did not capture all inland damage in Mississippi, with 4,609 destroyed dwellings outside the three counties assessed by FEMA. The Red Cross identified 65,237 dwellings with major damage. In Mississippi, 45.9% of dwellings with major damage were located in inland counties not included in FEMA assessment. Structural damage levels range from Catastrophic to Limited, with varying degrees of destruction and displacement. FEMA data on flooding and structural damage may overlap. In Mississippi, structural damage levels range from Catastrophic to Limited, with varying degrees of destruction and displacement. GIS methods were used to categorize areas into ten mutually exclusive categories based on flooding and damage levels. Population in each Census Block was apportioned based on the assessed damage and/or flooding areas. The population in each Census Block was apportioned based on overlapping damaged and flooded areas. Census Block boundaries do not align with the geographic boundaries of the assessed damage areas. The apportioned populations were then aggregated by Census Tract. The apportionment rates for flooding and structural damage were calculated at the Census Tract level using Census 2000 data. This data provides detailed information on social, demographic, income, and housing characteristics of the population. For example, if 20% of a Census Tract's population lived in flooded areas, it would amount to 640 people out of a total population of 3,200. The methodology used estimates the proportionate shares of Census Tracts' populations affected by flooding and/or structural damage, assuming the entire population was affected proportionately regardless of individual characteristics or where they lived within the Tract. The analysis regrouped ten areas of flooding and/or damage into specific groupings, combining areas with Catastrophic Damage into one grouping. In the analysis, areas with Catastrophic Damage were grouped together, regardless of Flooding. Areas with Flooding but no Catastrophic Damage were combined into Flooded areas. Data on flooding severity was lacking. Areas without flooding but with Extensive or Moderate Damage were grouped. Areas with Limited Damage and no flooding were combined with areas without Damage or Flooding. Population estimates for redefined areas were provided for 14 counties or parishes. The analysis grouped areas into categories based on damage and flooding status: Catastrophic damage regardless of flood status (40,000); Flooded areas excluding catastrophic damage (652,000); Non-flooded areas with extensive damage (5,600) or moderate damage (13,700); and areas with no damage, flooding, or limited damage only (1,747,000)."
