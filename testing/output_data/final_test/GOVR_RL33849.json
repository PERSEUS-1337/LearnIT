    "content": "The burning of coal, oil, and natural gas is adding 6 billion tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere annually. By the year 2000, there will be a 25% increase in CO2 levels, leading to significant climate changes. Scientists have long known that adding certain gases to the atmosphere can warm the Earth. This has sparked interest in Congress to address carbon dioxide emissions and understand climate change. Investment in science and technological research has been key in understanding and addressing human-related emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other gases contributing to climate change. These emissions have significantly increased atmospheric concentrations since the Industrial Revolution. Research conducted by universities, governmental agencies, and research institutions has focused on collecting observations, developing models, and assessing the potential impacts of climate change on humans and ecosystems. Research on climate change has been funded by various entities, including universities, governmental agencies, and the private sector. Funding in the U.S. has primarily been through the National Science Foundation (NSF), NASA, and the Department of Energy (DOE). International collaboration has been facilitated by organizations like the International Biosphere/Geosphere Program and the World Meteorological Organization. The research products have undergone peer review, replication, and updates, with numerous assessments conducted by multi-disciplinary bodies. The National Academy of Science, U.S. Congress's former Office of Technology Assessment, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have conducted assessments on climate change. The IPCC, with thousands of scientists, periodically assesses technical knowledge on climate change. The U.S. government supports the IPCC assessment by sponsoring research and experts for policy deliberations. The U.S. Congress has maintained an active interest in climate change, providing funding for research and programs. Scientists have a robust understanding of climate change but are uncertain about future details. Climate change remains a highly debated issue. The U.S. Congress has allocated almost $5 billion for research and programs related to global change. The Global Change Research Program was established in 1990 to understand and respond to global change, with regular scientific assessments required. The Senate ratified the Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992, committing to improving science, international cooperation, and public communication on climate change. Annual reports to Congress, such as Our Changing Planet, outline research progress and strategies. Various committees oversee existing programs and explore further options. The report provides an overview of climate change science, its impacts, and future projections. It highlights the observed impacts, the forces causing climate change, and future projections of climate change impacts. The report does not address mitigation efforts or economic issues related to climate change. The report summarizes the science of climate change, highlighting the observed impacts and future projections. Scientists agree that the Earth's climate is changing, with global temperatures rising since the Industrial Revolution. The U.S. temperature has increased at twice the global average rate since the 1970s. The global climate is likely the warmest in 12,000 years, with precipitation increasing in the 20th Century. The global mean temperature has increased by 0.6 to 0.9 degrees Celsius from 1880 to 2004, with warming observed over land and sea surfaces. Extreme precipitation events have also increased in some regions, while drying has occurred in others. Global warming has not been smooth, with periods of warming and stable temperatures. Since 1979, warming has increased to about twice the rate of the 20th Century average. The National Academy of Science confirmed warming in the mid-troposphere, though less than at the surface. 2005 was the warmest year in nearly 130 years, with the 10 warmest years occurring since 1994. Surface temperatures have increased globally, with the greatest warming in northern high latitudes. Global warming has been observed in high latitudes like Alaska, Canada, Northern Europe, and Russia, with greater increases in the Northern Hemisphere during winter and spring. Evidence includes warming of the world's upper oceans by 0.04 o C since 1955 and continental temperatures rising by 0.02 o C over the past five decades. This warming is a strong signal of long-term change, affecting humans and ecosystems through increased precipitation. Precipitation patterns have shown a 2% increase over land since 1900, with variability across time and locations. Most of the United States and high latitudes have experienced greater wetness, while sub-tropical regions like the Sahel in Africa have seen decreased precipitation. Global trends in extreme weather events show few patterns of change, with no identified trend in global thunderstorm frequencies. Some locations have experienced less frequent extremely cold winter temperatures, but no trend in extremely high temperatures. Researchers at NOAA's National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) have found that rising global temperatures have led to widespread drying in Europe, Asia, Canada, Africa, and Australia. Drought areas have increased by over 50%, especially in the Sahel and southern Africa. Floods worldwide have also increased significantly in the 20th Century, with more frequent occurrences of floods exceeding 200-year levels. However, data limitations remain a challenge for assessing climate variability trends in most regions due to the infrequency of events. In regions with robust precipitation data, extreme precipitation has generally increased, while in some areas like the Sahel and East Africa, it has decreased. Debate continues on trends in hurricane frequency and intensity, with limited data available for about 85% of the world's oceans. Research shows a positive link between sea surface temperatures and increased hurricane activity in the extra-tropical Atlantic basin since the mid-1980s. The need for longer observations and improved understanding of tropical cyclones is emphasized for definitive attribution of changes in hurricane activity to natural variability, greenhouse gas forcing, or other processes. A meeting of international experts highlighted the potential threat of anthropogenic origins to recent increases in tropical cyclone activity. Global temperatures and precipitation have increased over the past century, with significant climate changes also observed at regional scales like the United States. In the United States, temperatures and precipitation have increased during the 20th Century, with regional variations. The mean temperature has risen by 0.6\u00b0C since 1901, following global trends. From 1979 to 2003, the rate of warming in the US was about twice the global average. Exceptions include cooler winters in the Southeast until 1978, and stable or cooler summer and autumn months in the South and central US. The warmest years were 1998, 1934, and 2006. The United States experienced an increase in temperatures and precipitation during the 20th Century, with regional variations. The mean temperature rose by 0.6\u00b0C since 1901, following global trends. The warmest years were 1998, 1934, and 2006. U.S. average precipitation has increased by 6.1% since 1895, with more variability and less distinct patterns than temperature. The Northwest has seen large inter-annual cycles of precipitation since the 1970s, while the Southwest and Hawaii have experienced decreases. The 20th Century also saw strong droughts in the 1930s and 1950s, and an increase in extreme precipitation events since the 1920s and 1930s. The United States has seen an increase in extreme precipitation events since the 1920s and 1930s, with a 20% increase in events \"much above normal\" since 1910. Heavy precipitation not linked to hurricanes has increased by 2.6% per decade in the Southeast in the 20th Century. Tornado frequency has remained relatively stable since 1955. Climate change has led to temperature increases and changes in precipitation globally and in the United States. Land use and flood management efforts aim to mitigate flooding risks. The United States has experienced an increase in extreme precipitation events since the 1920s and 1930s. Climate change has led to temperature increases and changes in precipitation globally and in the United States. Understanding past climate changes through paleoclimatology can provide valuable insights into the current climate trends. The stable and relatively temperate climate of the past 12,000 years, known as the Holocene period, has allowed for the development and thriving of modern human civilizations. Global average temperatures have varied within about 2 degrees Celsius over the past 10,000 years. During the Little Ice Age in the 16th and 17th centuries, temperatures were about 1 degree Celsius cooler than current temperatures. Climate shifts can be rapid, with evidence showing abrupt changes in hurricane frequency, flooding, and mega-droughts lasting decades to centuries. The Earth's climate can change abruptly, with triggers, amplifiers, and bounds that are not well understood, causing concern among many. Major ecological restructuring has accompanied major climatic shifts in the past, triggering significant reorganizations of regional civilizations. Changes in the Earth's climate system in the past century have impacted human activities and ecosystems. Impacts of climate change over the past few decades are visible on human activities and ecosystems. Observations confirm that most biological and physical systems studied are responding to warming and other climate changes over the 20th Century. The northern boundary of successful corn production in the United States has migrated north by 100 miles over the past three decades. Some salmon fisheries in parts of Alaska have seen record catches due to warmer temperatures, while salmon stocks in western Alaska, the Pacific Northwest, and Canada have decreased. In the Pacific Northwest and Canada, salmon stocks have decreased due to exceeding their temperature tolerance limits. Decreasing snowpack and earlier snowmelt in the U.S. West have altered stream flows, impacting flood control, irrigation, and vegetation drying. Higher temperatures increase the risks of heat-related illnesses and deaths, especially in certain regions, age groups, and impoverished populations. In Europe, a severe heat wave in 2003 led to 52,000 premature deaths, with human-driven climate change doubling the risk of such extreme events. Significant impacts of the warming climate are seen in ecological systems worldwide, with changes in phenologies and distributions of over half of analyzed species aligning with regional climate changes. Oceanic plankton productivity has decreased with warming sea surface temperatures, raising concerns as plankton are a vital food source for marine species. Coral bleaching, triggered by heat episodes, is becoming more widespread. Coral bleaching is increasingly widespread in reef regions like Hawaii, the Caribbean, and Australia's Great Barrier Reef due to heat episodes. Elevated carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are acidifying oceans, posing risks to marine organisms and food chains. Warming and drying in Alaska and the western US have led to pest outbreaks, fires, property destruction, and health impacts. Record high temperatures and droughts have caused extensive fires in various countries. Some species benefit from warming conditions, while others reliant on cool habitats are adversely affected. Mountain glaciers worldwide have been contracting over the past 200 years, with accelerated melting in recent decades. Greenland's ice sheets are melting, with a notable increase from 2003 to 2005. Western Antarctica is experiencing accelerated ice melting, while East Antarctica is accumulating ice due to increased precipitation. Glacial flows in western Antarctica have sped up in the past decade, and Arctic sea ice extent hit a record low in 2005. Polar bears, reliant on sea ice for food, have seen a significant decrease in cub numbers. Polar bears in the Beaufort Sea area have seen a decrease in cub survival rates from 2001 to 2006 due to the loss of sea ice. The Earth's climate is changing due to rising sea levels caused by warming oceans and melting glaciers. Human activities, particularly greenhouse gas emissions, are contributing to these changes. The Sun's energy balance affects Earth's climate, with increased solar activity leading to warming tendencies. The Earth's climate is influenced by various factors such as the Sun's activity, distance from the Sun, and the tilt of the Earth's axis. Scientists understand the drivers of climate change over geologic time, including irregular orbits and volcanic eruptions. Human population growth has also impacted the global climate. The global climate has been significantly influenced by human activities over the past 150 years, with population growth, land clearing, fossil fuel use, and industrialization leading to increased greenhouse gas emissions. The IPCC concluded in 2007 that the observed increase in temperatures is largely due to human-induced greenhouse gas concentrations. The section summarizes how human activities influence climate change, focusing on greenhouse gases as the main culprit. It discusses the limited control over natural forcings and methods to compare human and natural influences on climate change. Terms like radiative forcing and GWP are used to explain the contributions of different agents to observed and future climate change. Human activities, particularly since the Industrial Revolution, have significantly altered the Earth's climate by releasing greenhouse gases through fossil fuel consumption, land clearing, and industrial and agricultural activities. These actions have led to feedback mechanisms that can amplify or dampen climate changes. Additionally, human-related influences like air pollution, land use changes, and urban development further contribute to climate change. Greenhouse gas concentrations in the Earth's atmosphere have increased dramatically since the Industrial Revolution, with carbon dioxide growing from about 280 ppm in 1850 to about 380 ppm today. Human activities, such as use of fossil fuels, production of crops and livestock, and manufacture of various products, now emit certain gases in sufficient quantities to have raised concentrations higher than they have been for hundreds of thousands of years, changing the balance of solar radiation in and out of the Earth's atmosphere and altering the Earth's climate. Greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere trap heat, altering the climate. Key gases include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated compounds. These gases have a long atmospheric residence time and global warming effects. The long atmospheric residence time of greenhouse gases has important implications for policy responses. Human-related sources of greenhouse gas emissions include carbon dioxide from fossil fuel combustion, methane from various activities, and nitrous oxide from nitrogen fertilizers. Greenhouse gases come from various sources such as wetlands, termite mounds, nitrogen fertilizers, industrial manufacturing, combustion of waste and fossil fuels, and commercial products. Agricultural production contributes little to carbon dioxide emissions but is a significant source of nitrous oxide emissions. In 2000, CO2 accounted for 72% of human GHG emissions, CH4 for 18%, and N2O for 9%. There is uncertainty in historical estimates, especially before the 1950s. Human-driven emissions of GHG are significant. Human-driven emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) are increasing above natural levels, leading to unprecedented concentrations in the atmosphere. CO2 levels have risen by over one-third in the past 150 years, methane by 150%, and N2O by 16% since the Industrial Revolution. Tropospheric ozone, although naturally occurring, is elevated by human pollution. Tropospheric ozone levels have been increased by polluting emissions since the Industrial Revolution, with concentrations being unevenly distributed in time and space. Regulations in many countries control ozone concentrations by limiting air pollutant emissions. Ozone pollution drifting into the Arctic region may contribute to a significant portion of the observed warming in its springs and summers. Aerosols, including sulfates, black carbon, and organic carbon, can have cooling or warming effects on climate by scattering or absorbing light. Sulfates from human pollution, mainly from coal and oil burning, have a cooling influence on climate by scattering solar radiation. Black carbon warms the atmosphere, while organic carbon emitted from forest fires has a cooling effect. These effects have been included in climate modeling since the early 1990s. Sulfur emissions from burning coal and oil, along with industrial processes, produce aerosols that have increased significantly over the past century. These aerosols have regional and short-lived effects on temperature, influencing precipitation patterns and potentially impacting monsoon water cycles. Their role in climate variability remains a major uncertainty in current research efforts. Emissions from aircraft fuel consumption and water vapor contribute to climate change by affecting global surface temperatures and the vertical distribution of temperatures in the atmosphere. Aviation contrails produce ice crystals that can form clouds in the upper troposphere, with a net warming effect on climate. These effects are more regional than global in nature. Human activities, such as forest clearing and rice production, have significantly impacted carbon dioxide and methane concentrations over thousands of years. Deforestation leads to CO2 emissions through burning or decomposition, increasing atmospheric CO2 levels. Although vegetation regrowth absorbs CO2, it occurs more slowly than emissions. Global deforestation is mainly happening in developing countries. Net deforestation is occurring globally, mainly in developing countries. The United States cleared land decades ago but abandoned some with industrialization and migration to more fertile lands; regrowth of forests on abandoned lands is estimated to be removing CO2 from the atmosphere. U.S. forests overall are a net sink for carbon, not a source, removing around 780 million metric tonnes of CO2 per year. Agriculture covers about one-third of the Earth's land surface and can alter local to regional climates, potentially impacting global climate. Land cover change can result from climate change, creating a feedback within the climate system. CO2 in the atmosphere acts as a nutrient to plants, leading to higher carbon fertilization. Higher carbon fertilization from CO2 in the atmosphere increases vegetation growth and removes more CO2. Precipitation and warming can further enhance vegetation growth, creating a negative feedback to climate warming. However, weedy plants may thrive better than trees in higher CO2 and warmer temperatures, leading to short-lived carbon uptake. Warmer temperatures and moisture can accelerate decomposition and potentially cause die-back, contributing to a positive feedback to climate warming. Vegetation transpires water vapor and land cover changes can affect albedo, impacting the Earth's reflectivity. The Earth's surface albedo affects how much sunlight is absorbed or reflected. Factors like pollution on snow/ice can decrease albedo, leading to more warming. Land clearing can increase reflection of solar energy, cooling the area. Removing trees in snowy areas can have a strong cooling effect. Land clearing warms temperatures near the equator and cools them at high latitudes. Multiple factors influence the Earth's climate. Scientists have determined that human-related greenhouse gas emissions have significantly contributed to global temperature increases since the 1970s. Other factors like solar variability, volcanoes, and natural variability also play a role. Comparing CO2 concentrations with surface temperatures shows a strong correlation over the past million years. The correlation between CO2 levels and global temperatures in paleologic records may not reveal the exact cause of changes, but scientists believe in strong positive feedback loops that amplify warming effects. Some discrepancies in timing between rising CO2 levels and temperatures are attributed to complex climate interactions and other drivers of change. Scientists also use causative radiative forcing to attribute climate change to different sources and predict future changes. The concept of causative radiative forcing is used to attribute climate change to different sources. Greenhouse gas forcing dominates other known forcings in warming the Earth's climate, while volcanic emissions and tropospheric aerosols have smaller effects. Solar variability has a small impact on recent temperature changes, with some scientists suggesting a larger role. Fingerprinting the patterns of radiative forcing and observed change is a method developed since 2000 to compare different forcing agents' effects on climate change. The patterns of climate change vary depending on the forcing agents involved. Volcanic aerosols cause temporary cooling, while reductions in solar irradiance have a longer-lasting impact on land temperatures. Greenhouse gases lead to long-term, global warming with specific patterns such as more warming in winter, at night, and at high latitudes. Cooling is observed at higher altitudes in the atmosphere. The observed cooling at 50 km and higher in the atmosphere cannot be explained by seasonal or solar cycles. Increasing heat content of oceans is not due to urban heat islands. Fingerprint methods attribute climate change to greenhouse gas emissions. Computer models show natural forcings alone cannot explain warming of the last half century. Including greenhouse gases generates similar warming patterns to observed climate changes. Studies show that including greenhouse gases in climate models generates warming patterns similar to observed climate changes, leading scientists to conclude that recent climate change is largely caused by these gases. Various natural and human-related factors have influenced climate change in the 20th Century, but rising concentrations of greenhouse gases are considered a significant contributor. Scientists have determined that the observed climate change over the 20th Century cannot be explained without considering the effects of greenhouse gas emissions. The 2001 review by Science, at the request of President George W. Bush, concluded that human activities are likely the main cause of climate change in recent decades, with some contribution from natural variability. The IPCC assessment in 2007 stated that the increase in global temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations. Computer models are used to project future climate change based on greenhouse gas forcing patterns. Climate models are based on computer projections that represent factors influencing climate. Models have improved, but there is debate over their ability to predict future climate change. Studies indicate that continued greenhouse gas growth will raise global temperatures. Continued greenhouse gas growth will raise global temperatures significantly above natural variability. The 2007 IPCC assessment projects a warming of about 0.2 o C per decade for the next two decades, with potential temperature increases ranging from 1.1 o C to 6.4 o C depending on emission scenarios. It will take many years to narrow down the uncertainty in global temperature predictions. Climate models predict more heat waves, droughts, and floods, with decreased extreme cold episodes. Precipitation is expected to be more intense, leading to increased runoff and flooding risk. Changes in the hydrologic cycle and atmospheric/ocean circulation are anticipated, with regional climate changes likely to be unevenly distributed geographically and temporally. Future regional climate changes could be dramatic due to uneven distribution of forcings and connectedness of regions. While most regions will warm, some may become wetter and others drier. Climate change is expected to fluctuate around a rising average, complicating detection and prediction. Uncertainties remain in forecasting local and seasonal climate changes, with models struggling to capture extreme events and abrupt changes, leading to potential surprises. The uncertainty of future climate changes is compounded by the potential for significant surprises that current models may not predict accurately. Feedback mechanisms in the climate system have historically amplified small perturbations into major climate cycles, with temperature swings of 5 to 6 degrees Celsius. The close relationship between past temperature changes and atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane levels suggests that temperature fluctuations can trigger strong positive feedbacks through the carbon cycle and water vapor, although current models are uncertain in predicting these feedbacks. The uncertainty of future climate changes is compounded by potential surprises that current models may not accurately predict. Key feedbacks affecting future climate projections include water vapor, cloud, vegetation, and albedo. Climate scientists agree that human emissions have committed the climate to change, with greenhouse gas emissions dominating global warming by mid-century. Positive feedbacks to the carbon cycle amplify initial warming, potentially reducing the effectiveness of carbon uptake by oceans and vegetation. Climate change may impact carbon uptake by oceans and vegetation, requiring greater GHG emission reductions to stabilize the climate. Future projections suggest winners and losers among regions, sectors, and income groups. Some may benefit while others suffer harm. Regions may be affected by changes in other regions through trade, security, and immigration pressures. Future generations may experience more change but could be wealthier and better able to adapt. Many species may become extinct, while others flourish. Local effects of climate change may influence decision-making more than national or global aggregates. The IPCC released its fourth assessment on climate change impacts in April 2007. Most models project benefits for agriculture due to increased CO2 fertilization, but negative impacts may occur in some regions. As climate change progresses, negative impacts on crop agriculture are projected in most regions except for high latitudes. Adverse impacts on Africa are a concern. Research on agricultural impacts is inconclusive and lacks consideration of climate variability and spread of pests and diseases favored by warmer temperatures and higher CO2 concentrations. Experts believe that climate change will impact agriculture, with potential benefits from CO2 fertilization but negative effects on crops, livestock, fisheries, and oil-producing crops. Biotechnological products and cropping flexibility have not been fully considered in impact studies. Migration of agricultural production to climate-favored regions may affect land values and labor forces. Climate change and higher CO2 levels may have both positive and negative effects on forests, leading to stress, disease, pests, and die-offs. Climate change could lead to die-offs in forests, impacting land cover and resulting in significant consequences for agriculture, economy, culture, and ecology. There is a risk of Amazon rainforest dieback, potentially amplifying greenhouse-gas induced climate change. Arctic sea ice extent is projected to decrease, with models showing a possibility of an ice-free Arctic in summers by the end of the century, affecting polar bears, seals, and birds. Recent research on the melting of ice sheets and accumulation of snow and ice at higher elevations has reduced scientists' confidence in projections for sea level rise. Some models project lower rises in sea levels with future warming, but evidence shows faster melting in some locations. Understanding of ice sheet dynamics is weak, leading to uncertainty about future sea level rise. Major declines in live coral cover for reef systems worldwide are expected due to increased high temperatures. Projected climate change includes potential impacts on coral reef systems, with declining live coral cover leading to consequences for the food chain and fisheries. Additionally, models predict increased heavy precipitation in certain regions by the late 21st Century, with more rain than snow and earlier snow melt. There is also a likelihood of increased tropical cyclone intensity with continued warming. Projected climate change is expected to have major repercussions for ecological systems, with effects on populations, species, landscapes, and ecosystem services. The impacts are highly localized and interconnected through food chains, nutrient flows, and atmospheric and ocean circulations. Some species may flourish in a more temperate environment, while others may face obstacles in adapting or migrating to suitable habitats. Climate change projections may lead to disruptions in food chains, increased competition, and potential extinctions. Human health impacts include heat stress, air pollution, and the spread of diseases like malaria. Rising temperatures could also boost allergens and mold growth. The U.S. government invests around $6 billion yearly on climate change research, voluntary programs, and financial incentives to advance low-GHG-emitting technologies, with a focus on setting clear and realistic objectives for research and programs to facilitate oversight and improvements. The federal government invests in climate change research and manages assets potentially affected by climate change, such as public lands and energy supply. Climate change may impact natural and cultural assets, altering their values and management objectives. Climate change may affect the demand and supply of energy for government operations, leading to implications for infrastructure planning and expenses. The federal government may need to redefine objectives and provide institutional flexibility for adaptive management as climate conditions change. Evaluating objectives and practices in light of potential climate change can enhance resource management success, especially considering abrupt ecosystem changes that may require federal responses. Climate change can lead to emergencies and disasters requiring federal responses and resources. Examples include hurricanes, droughts, fires, and social strife. The federal government may need to act as an insurer of last resort due to increased economic losses from extreme weather events since 1980. Economic exposures to extreme weather events can result in significant costs in the United States and globally. Experts recommend considering climate change implications in infrastructure planning to avoid costly and outdated assets. Climate impacts in other countries, like Mexico, could also affect the U.S. federal government due to more severe changes and lower adaptation capacity. The United States faces increasing pressure on migration, trade terms, and demands for disaster relief due to projected climate changes. Billions of dollars have been invested in researching climate change over the past five decades, with human emissions of greenhouse gases leading to unprecedented levels of carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth's climate has been warming and changing, with recent patterns attributed to elevated greenhouse gas levels. Scientists conclude that greenhouse gases emitted by human activities will induce global average warming by at least 1.8 o C over the 21st Century, possibly reaching 4 o C or more. Time lags in the climate system affect policy effectiveness, raising questions for further research to support public policy decisions. Policy-makers need key information from climate science to make decisions on addressing climate change. Research priorities should align with these needs, and realistic objectives and timetables should be established. Communication between researchers and decision-makers is crucial. Decision-makers must consider the risks and consequences of their options and determine how much confidence in the science they require. Researchers should understand what information decision-makers need and provide realistic estimates of when critical information can be delivered. Expectations should be consistent with the time needed for thorough research and assessment. Key information from climate science is necessary for rigorous research and assessment. Decision-makers need appropriate risk decision tools and management regimes in place to use the best scientific information for various decisions. Processes should be in place to incorporate learning over time and adapt to emerging scientific information. Communication channels are essential for relevant decision-makers to have access to reliable information for timely decisions. Effective cooperative mechanisms are needed to gain efficiencies and share insights that align with national goals. Key information from climate science is crucial for decision-makers to make informed decisions aligned with national goals. This includes considerations such as timing, timeframe for actions, options for action, effectiveness, benefits and costs, monitoring achievements, and refining strategies. Various approaches to address climate change and greenhouse gas reductions are being proposed in the 110th Congress, with hearings expected to continue. It is important to ensure that decisions are based on the best scientific underpinning available. The Earth's climate is influenced by various natural factors such as the Earth's orbit, solar activity, ocean variability, and human activities. Scientists understand these forces to varying degrees and human activities have significantly contributed to observed climate change in recent decades. This information is crucial for decision-makers to make informed decisions aligned with national goals. The Earth's climate is influenced by natural factors like the Earth's orbit and solar activity. Solar activity, including total solar irradiance, cosmic rays, and earth/solar magnetism, has been suggested as contributors to climate change, although their validity and magnitude remain disputed. The variability of the Sun's total irradiance influences Earth's climate, but its significance is disputed. Solar variability could have a large influence on long time scales, such as during the Little Ice Age. Quantification of the solar role in climate variability over centuries to millennia is poor. Some scientists suggest the Sun's activity was high during the Medieval Warm Period, while others disagree. One study found that solar variability may have accounted for 40% of climatic variability over the past 140 years. Solar variability, including sunspots and ultraviolet light, may have contributed to 40% of climatic variability over the past 140 years. However, since 1978, variations in solar output have been too small to significantly impact global warming. The Maunder Minimum during the Little Ice Age is believed to have been caused by reduced solar activity, leading to less ultraviolet light and a cooling effect on Earth due to decreased ozone in the stratosphere. The reduction of ozone in the stratosphere due to less ultraviolet light may have cooled the Northern Hemisphere by a few tenths of a degree centigrade. Some scientists found that estimated ultraviolet variance since 1915 correlates poorly with global average temperature. Ocean variability and the natural dynamics of ocean systems may influence regional or hemispheric climates. Understanding the oceans may elucidate factors triggering abrupt climate changes, such as increased freshwater flow to the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans from the Laurentide ice sheet. Certain aerosols from volcanic eruptions can reflect sunlight away. Certain aerosols can reflect sunlight away from the Earth, causing significant cooling for one to several years after an eruption. Historical eruptions like Mt. Toga 71,000 years ago and Mt. Pinatubo in 1992 have led to global temperature decreases. Methane clathrates, a form of ice with trapped methane, can also impact climate when released from ocean beds. Methane clathrates, found in cold temperatures and high pressures on the Earth's ocean floor and Arctic continental shelves, may have caused severe extinction events in the past. Releases of methane clathrates or carbon dioxide led to rapid warming and major extinctions, such as during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum. Sea surface temperatures rose significantly during these events, impacting marine and terrestrial species. The North Pole's mean annual temperature is -20 o C/-4 o F. Evidence suggests a halt in normal deposition of ocean calcite shells for 50 thousand years, possibly due to ocean acidification. Water vapor is a crucial greenhouse gas, responsible for two-thirds of Earth's additional warming. Changes in water vapor content can have warming or cooling effects, with warmer temperatures globally increasing water vapor in the atmosphere, amplifying warming. Climate scientists have identified positive and negative feedback mechanisms that can amplify or reduce warming, with water vapor playing a significant role. Cloud feedbacks are complex and not fully understood, leading to large differences in climate model results. Natural variability in the climate system adds uncertainty, with ongoing scientific advancements expected to reduce this uncertainty in the coming years. The climate exhibits random or unexplained behavior due to natural variability, which adds uncertainty to forecasts. Scientists can still make meaningful statements about the past and future, despite this uncertainty."
