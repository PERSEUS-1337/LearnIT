    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"America Stands with Israel Act\". Congress finds that a state of armed conflict exists between Israel and Hamas, with Hamas launching rockets and smuggling arms into Gaza. Israel has the right to defend its civilians and has imposed a maritime blockade to prevent Hamas rearmament, which is acceptable under international law. Hamas is recognized as a terrorist organization. Hamas, recognized as a terrorist organization by the US and EU, seeks Israel's destruction and controls Gaza. It uses rockets, mortars, and suicide bombs to target Israelis and Americans. Iran funds Hamas as a proxy against Israel, sending ships to break the Gaza blockade. Israel intercepted weapons shipments to Hamas in 2002 and Hezbollah in 2009. Israel allows 15,000 tons of supplies into Gaza. Israel allows approximately 15,000 tons of supplies to enter Gaza daily, totaling over a million tons in the last 18 months. Despite warnings, a flotilla was denied entry into Gaza as it aimed to end the blockade, not deliver aid. The Turkish Humanitarian Relief Foundation, linked to Hamas and other terrorist groups, organized the flotilla. The United Nations Human Rights Council, consisting of 47 countries, includes members with poor human rights records like China, Cuba, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. It produced the controversial Goldstone Report on the Gaza Conflict, rejected by the Obama Administration and Congress, along with numerous resolutions condemning Israel. Congress declares unwavering support for Israel's right to self-defense, its naval blockade of Gaza, and opposes UN investigations into the flotilla incident. The Secretary of State will end US participation in the United Nations Human Rights Council and prohibit contributions for investigations into the flotilla incident."
