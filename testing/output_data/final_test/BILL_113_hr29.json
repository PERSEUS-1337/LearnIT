    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Mobile Medical Homeless Health Improvement Act of 2013\". Congress finds that the number of people experiencing homelessness increased slightly from 2009 to 2010, with California, New York, and Florida accounting for a significant portion. The number of homeless families and individuals also saw an increase, while the number of chronically homeless individuals decreased. Substance abuse and mental health issues were prevalent among those in shelters. Mobile medical health care services can effectively reach homeless populations, providing primary care, screenings, dental care, medications, behavioral health care, immunizations, lab tests, case management, benefits assistance, and triage. These services can cater to homeless adults and children in various areas and offer cost savings of over $800 per visit compared to emergency department visits. SEC. 3. IMPROVING ACCESS OF HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS TO MEDICAL SERVICES. Amends the Public Health Service Act to establish partnerships for homeless individuals to access medical services. The Secretary may award grants to eligible entities to improve access of homeless individuals to mobile medical health care services. Eligible entities must be partnerships of hospitals and other local health care facilities. The Secretary may award grants for activities to increase access of homeless individuals to mobile medical services, including primary health, substance abuse, and mental health counseling. Hospitals or health care facilities can only be awarded for one partnership. Priority is given to applications from areas with high ratios. The grant awarded under this section must supplement, not supplant, the expenditures of the eligible entity and in-kind contributions for services to homeless individuals. Grantees can continue providing services to former homeless individuals in permanent housing for up to 12 months.
