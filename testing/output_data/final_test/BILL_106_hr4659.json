    "content": "The \"Stamp Out Domestic Violence Act of 2000\" allows for special postage stamps related to domestic violence. The \"Stamp Out Domestic Violence Act of 2000\" authorizes the Postal Service to establish a special rate of postage for first-class mail to support domestic violence programs. The rate can be up to 25% higher than the regular first-class rate and will be set by the Governors. The use of the special postage rate for domestic violence programs is voluntary for postal patrons. Amounts generated from this rate will be paid by the Postal Service to the Department of Justice at least twice a year, after deducting reasonable costs. The Postal Service will cover costs for printing, selling, and distributing stamps for domestic violence programs. Congress aims to ensure no decrease in funds for government agencies and no impact on regular postage rates. Special stamps will be available to the public as determined by the Postal Service. The Postmaster General will provide information on the operation of a section regarding special postage stamps in reports under section 2402. The section will be effective for a 2-year period, with details on funds received and their allocation. The Comptroller General of the United States will submit a report to Congress evaluating the effectiveness of a section on special postage stamps as a means of fundraising. The report will also detail the resources required by the Postal Service for implementing the section. The table of sections for chapter 4 of title 39, United States Code, is amended by removing the item relating to section 414 and inserting a new item. Section 414 of title 39, United States Code, is amended to include special postage stamps related to breast cancer and domestic violence."
