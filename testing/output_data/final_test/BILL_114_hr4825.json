To enhance national security interests, the President should formalize India as a major partner, appoint an official experienced in defense acquisition, and facilitate the transfer of advanced technology. This includes collaborating with India on missions such as humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, counter piracy, and maritime domain awareness, strengthening the effectiveness of defense initiatives, resolving issues hindering defense trade and security cooperation, and developing mechanisms for verifying the security of defense technology information and equipment. The President should prioritize enhancing defense and security cooperation with India by promoting efficient defense sales and exports, pursuing military transactions, and aligning export control regimes with the United States. Security cooperation with India is a priority for advancing US interests in South Asia and the Indo-Pacific region. The President is encouraged to coordinate with India annually to develop military contingency plans. An assessment of India's strategic operational capabilities for mutual military operations with the US should be carried out annually. This assessment will inform the review of applications for defense sales or exports. The Arms Export Control Act requires a review by the United States of applications to sell or export defense articles, services, or technical data. The assessment should be in classified form and include the definition of \"strategic operational capabilities.\" This Act is also amended regarding Foreign Military Sales and Export Status. The Arms Export Control Act is amended to include India in various sections, expanding the scope of the Act to involve India in defense-related matters."
