    "content": "The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new section for a tax credit for hydrogen fuel, known as the Hydrogen Credit under SEC. 30D. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 includes a new section for a tax credit for hydrogen fuel, known as the Hydrogen Credit under SEC. 30D. This credit allows a taxpayer to claim a credit against the tax imposed for the taxable year based on qualified hydrogen expenditure amounts for each qualified hydrogen device. The qualified hydrogen expenditure amount is the lesser of 30 percent of the amount paid for hydrogen consumed by the device or $1,500. If the device is not owned for the entire year, the $1,500 amount is reduced proportionally. The term 'qualified hydrogen energy conversion device' refers to a device wholly owned by the taxpayer after December 31, 2004, for the purpose of claiming a tax credit under SEC. 30D. If the primary user is provided a written statement as the owner, they will be treated as such for tax credit purposes. The term 'hydrogen energy conversion device' includes electrochemical devices converting hydrogen into electricity and combustion engines burning hydrogen as fuel. The credit allowed can be part of the general business credit or a personal credit after certain deductions. The tax credit for hydrogen energy conversion devices is limited by the taxpayer's regular tax liability minus certain credits, and cannot exceed the tentative minimum tax. Any amounts paid for hydrogen must be reduced by the credit allowed. This section expires after December 31, 2015. The tax credit for hydrogen energy conversion devices is limited by the taxpayer's regular tax liability minus certain credits, and cannot exceed the tentative minimum tax. Amendments are made to sections 38(b) and 55(c)(3) of the tax code regarding the hydrogen credit. The tax credits for fuel cell and microturbine properties are extended, with amendments made to the Internal Revenue Code regarding the expiration dates of these credits. Tax credits for fuel cell and microturbine properties are extended under the Internal Revenue Code. Additionally, new public buildings are required to have secondary fuel cell power sources. Section 3305 of title 40, United States Code, now mandates that new public buildings over 50,000 square feet must have a fuel cell as a backup power source for critical functions during peak hours and power outages. The Administrator shall consider using a fuel cell for base load power supply in public buildings, excluding those under construction after December 31, 2008. SEC. 4. UNIFORMITY OF HYDROGEN STORAGE AND TRANSPORTATION REGULATIONS. The purposes of this section are to prepare regulatory agencies for the commercialization of hydrogen and fuel cell devices, ensure coordination for developing necessary regulations, and facilitate the transition to a hydrogen economy. The Secretary of Transportation, in collaboration with other federal agencies, must establish a study and report by January 1, 2008. The Secretary of Transportation, along with other Federal agencies, will establish a task force and study team to identify regulatory actions needed for a safe transition to commercialization of hydrogen and fuel cell devices. State agencies may also participate in this effort to ensure public safety during the shift to a hydrogen economy. The task force and study team, led by the Secretary of Transportation, will identify regulatory actions for commercializing hydrogen and fuel cell devices. A report with proposed legislation will be submitted to Congress by January 1, 2010. The Secretary of Transportation, in cooperation with a task force and study team, will establish a training program to facilitate commercial development of hydrogen and fuel cell devices and fueling stations for a transition to a hydrogen economy. Cost-sharing agreements with states will be part of the program. The Secretary will enter cost-sharing agreements with State and local governments for training on uniform regulatory approach. Safety codes and standards from the Energy Policy Act of 2005 will be utilized. $4,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2008 through 2012."
