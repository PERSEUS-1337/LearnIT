    "content": "Members of the House of Representatives have various opportunities to participate in legislative processes, including discussing legislation, proposing changes, and suggesting actions to facilitate decision-making. They rely on standard procedures and phraseology developed over congressional history. The Committee of the Whole, a parliamentary device allowing greater debate participation, is composed of every Representative and meets in the House chamber to consider major measures. House rules mandate that revenue, appropriations, and authorization measures must first be considered in the Committee of the Whole. The House of Representatives uses the Committee of the Whole to consider revenue, appropriations, and authorization measures. This can be initiated by a special rule, unanimous consent, or a motion. The process involves five stages of consideration. The House of Representatives uses the Committee of the Whole to consider revenue, appropriations, and authorization measures in five stages: (1) House resolves into the Committee of the Whole, (2) Members engage in general debate, (3) Members offer, consider, and vote on amendments, (4) Committee reports back to the House, and (5) House votes on the recommendation and measure. Rules and procedures govern Members' participation in debate, amendments, motions, and requests. Members must be recognized by the chair before taking any action. The chair of the Committee of the Whole, appointed by the Speaker, has discretion in recognition. Measures are subject to debate and amendments conditions set by the House. Members may be limited in speaking time and actions in the Committee of the Whole. In the Committee of the Whole, speaking time is limited and distributed based on the stage of consideration of the measure. Members engage in general debate first, followed by the amendment process where they can offer and debate amendments. Time for debate is distributed in two different methods. In the Committee of the Whole, time for debate is either controlled or not. Controlled time involves a Member receiving a block of time from a manager who determines speaking order and duration. If time is not controlled, Members seek recognition from the chair. Time is usually controlled during general debate and distributed in five-minute portions during the amendment process. The House typically resolves into the Committee of the Whole under a special rule, which often includes controlled time. In the House, time for general debate is usually controlled by special rules or unanimous consent agreements. The chair and ranking minority member of the committee of jurisdiction typically divide the debate time. They may yield themselves a set number of minutes or state: \"I yield myself such time as I may consume.\" In the House, time for general debate is controlled by special rules or unanimous consent agreements. The manager controls the time until it expires or reserves the balance of time. Floor managers yield portions of time to Members who wish to debate the measure, usually alternating recognition between managers from each side. Managers do not refer to Members by name but designate them by state when yielding time. The floor manager in the House yields time to Members for debate, which cannot be taken back once yielded. Time is kept by clerks, and managers coordinate how time is distributed. The majority party's floor manager has the right to speak last in general debate. During general debate in the House, the majority floor manager reserves time until the minority manager yields back their time. Debate ends when all time has expired or been yielded back. The Committee of the Whole cannot extend general debate time set by the House. Members yield back time by stating, \"I yield back the balance of my time.\" During general debate in the House, the majority floor manager reserves time until the minority manager yields back their time. Debate ends when all time has expired or been yielded back. Members can yield time to speak to another Member, but only managers can yield portions of time. The chair announces when the time yielded to a Member has expired, and the Member can request additional time from the floor manager. During debates in the House, Members can yield time to another Member for questions or comments, but the yielding Member retains the floor. The time consumed by the Member yielded to is charged against the original time yielded by the manager. Members ask permission to use another Member's time by asking \"Will the gentleman yield?\" The Member speaking can decline or yield to the other Member, who retains the floor. During debates in the House, Members can yield time to another Member for questions or comments, but the yielding Member retains the floor. The time consumed by the Member yielded to is charged against the original time yielded by the manager. Members ask permission to use another Member's time by asking \"Will the gentleman yield?\" The Member speaking can decline or yield to the other Member, who retains the floor. If another Member wants to join the discussion, they must seek permission to interrupt from the yielding Member. Members can engage in a colloquy by yielding to one or more Members in turn to exchange information or debate an issue. The Member who has yielded can reclaim their time by interrupting and saying \"Reclaiming my time.\" During debates in the House, Members can yield time to another Member for questions or comments. If a Member yields, any time used by the other Member is charged against the original time granted. The Member speaking can reclaim their time at any point. Debate during the amendment process follows the five-minute rule unless specified otherwise. During House debates, Members can yield time for questions or comments. If a special rule allows controlled time, it usually designates who can offer amendments and how long they can be debated. Time for debate is typically divided between the sponsor and an opposing Member. The majority floor manager may control time in opposition if needed. The majority floor manager can control time in opposition during the amendment process. They grant available time to Members by specifying the number of minutes they will control. Controlled time operates similarly to general debate, with managers yielding time to discuss the amendment and reserving the balance for closing debate. The majority floor manager, usually the committee chair, has the right to speak last on an amendment. The House Rule XVII allows the committee of jurisdiction to defend the reported bill against amendments. The manager of an amendment with the right to close debate typically reserves their time until all other time has been used. Debate on amendments may be controlled under the \"five-minute rule\" in the Committee of the Whole. The House Rule XVII allows the committee of jurisdiction to defend the reported bill against amendments. The \"five-minute rule\" in the Committee of the Whole allows Members to speak for five minutes without time control or reservation. Certain special rules, like open rules, typically allow for amendments under this rule. The five-minute rule in the Committee of the Whole allows Members to speak for five minutes without time control or reservation. Members can extend their time by asking unanimous consent, and additional time can be secured through pro forma amendments, which are used solely to gain recognition to speak for five minutes. No substantive changes are proposed with pro forma amendments. When a Member wishes to speak in the Committee of the Whole, they can rise and state: I move to strike the last word. This allows them to speak for five minutes, either on a pro forma amendment or to continue debate on a substantive amendment. Pro forma amendments can be made to discuss the measure itself, but are not always allowed in the Committee of the Whole, especially if a special rule prohibits most or all amendments. Members under the five-minute rule cannot yield time to others or offer amendments. They can yield for questions or comments, with time deducted. Motions can be made to close debate on a portion of the text or a pending amendment. When the Committee of the Whole is considering a measure under a special rule, motions to close debate are not allowed unless by unanimous consent. Under an open rule, Members can move to close five-minute debate on the portion of the bill being discussed. Bills are typically read section by section, except for general appropriation bills which are read paragraph by paragraph. When the Committee of the Whole is considering a measure under a special rule, motions to close debate are not allowed unless by unanimous consent. A motion to close or limit debate on an amendment is in order after the proponent has spoken for five minutes. The motion can be made by any recognized Member and is amendable but not debatable. When the Committee of the Whole is considering a measure under a special rule, motions to close debate are not allowed unless by unanimous consent. A successful motion to close debate on a section or amendment does not prevent further amendments, but they cannot be discussed. The Committee of the Whole may agree to close or limit debate by unanimous consent, even on text not yet read. The Committee of the Whole can agree by unanimous consent to limit debate on an amendment not yet offered. Floor managers may engage in a colloquy to determine time needed for discussion. The chair can allocate remaining time among Members or make it controlled time. The Committee of the Whole can agree to limit debate on an amendment. The chair can allocate remaining time as controlled time, allowing sponsors and opponents to each have 15 minutes. Members can make motions to amend paragraphs or sections, with multiple amendments allowed to be pending simultaneously. In the Committee of the Whole, a motion to amend takes precedence over a motion to rise and report a bill. However, after a general appropriations bill has been fully read for amendment, a motion to rise and report can end consideration of the bill, precluding further amendments. Members may offer amendments proposing limitations not authorized in existing law while a general appropriations bill is being read for amendment in the Committee of the Whole. An amendment must be read in full before any action can be taken on it, but the reading may be dispensed with if the amendment has been printed in the bill or Congressional Record. Special rules may allow amendments to be considered as read without the need for a motion. During the consideration of a measure in the Committee of the Whole, Members can make motions and requests to raise questions, obtain more debate time, or move a measure closer to a final vote. Any Member can object to a provision violating a House rule, but special rules or unanimous consent agreements may apply. A point of order can be raised against an amendment that violates House rules or the Congressional Budget Act. The point of order must be made before debate begins, and the Member must explain why the amendment violates the rule. The chair has discretion on allowing arguments on the point of order. The chair has discretion on allowing arguments on a point of order, which is initially settled by a ruling on whether the matter cited violates the rule specified. The Parliamentarian provides guidance on applicable precedents in ruling on points of order. A Member may withdraw a point of order before the chair rules on it. A point of order can be waived by a special rule or unanimous consent agreement. Instead of making a point of order, a Member can reserve it to review the matter without missing the opportunity to raise it later. A Member can reserve a point of order without specifying the rule it may violate. The chair can require the Member to state the point of order at any time. After the chair rules on a point of order, any Member can appeal the ruling on the grounds of misinterpretation or misapplication of rules. In parliamentary procedure, a Member can appeal a ruling made by the chair in the Committee of the Whole. The appeal requires a majority vote to sustain or overturn the chair's decision, setting a precedent for future rulings. Appeals are debatable under the five-minute rule, and a Member can withdraw the appeal before action is taken. Unlike in the House, appeals cannot be tabled in the Committee of the Whole. A Member can make a parliamentary inquiry in the Committee of the Whole to ask for an explanation of procedural situations or House rules. The chair has discretion in recognizing these inquiries, which cannot be hypothetical or relate to rules not yet adopted. Unanimous consent requests require the support of all Members to set aside regular procedures. Members in the Committee of the Whole can request unanimous consent to bypass certain procedures, such as withdrawing an amendment or considering it as read. However, there are limitations to what can be done through unanimous consent, and actions that fall within the House's jurisdiction cannot be overridden. Special rules also restrict the types of unanimous consent requests that Members can make in the Committee of the Whole. Special rules limit unanimous consent requests in the Committee of the Whole. A single objection can defeat a request, which is not normally debatable. Members can explain objections by reserving the right to object. The chair decides on speaking time for objections. In the Committee of the Whole, unanimous consent requests are limited by special rules. A single objection can defeat a request, which is not debatable. Members can reserve the right to object and explain their objections. The chair decides on speaking time for objections. The House resolves out of the Committee of the Whole by the Committee \"rising\" with various forms of motions. A motion to rise in the Committee of the Whole is a privileged motion that takes precedence over other motions. It can be made by any Member and is not debatable. The chair immediately puts the question to the Committee, and a quorum is not required for adoption. Special rules in recent Congresses have sometimes restricted the ability to make this motion unless offered by the chair of the committee of jurisdiction. A motion to rise in the Committee of the Whole is a privileged motion that can be made by any Member and does not require a quorum for adoption. If the motion is agreed to, the Committee of the Whole converts back into the House, leaving the pending business unfinished until the House resolves back into the Committee of the Whole. When a motion to rise in the Committee of the Whole is agreed to, the Committee converts back into the House, leaving pending business unfinished until the House resolves back into the Committee of the Whole. The process involves reporting the measure with a recommendation, typically to adopt amendments agreed to in the Committee of the Whole, by motion. A Member may offer a motion to rise and report the measure back to the House, recommending that the House formally accept the Committee's actions. When a special rule allows, a motion to rise and report a bill is not needed. However, after a general appropriations bill is read for amendment, the majority leader can make a motion to rise and report, which takes precedence over further amendments. If this motion fails, a Member can propose a limitation on fund usage. A Member can also move to rise and report at any point during the bill reading for amendment. The five-minute rule allows a Member to move for the Committee of the Whole to rise and report with a recommendation to strike the measure's enacting clause. If successful and accepted by the House, the measure is rejected; if rejected, the House goes back to considering the legislation. The motion must be made in writing to avoid a point of order. Mr./Madam Chairman, motion to rise and report bill back to House with recommendation to strike enacting clause. Debate limited to 10 minutes. If motion rejected, can be offered again after modification or on subsequent day. Motion may be used to obtain debate time. The motion to strike the enacting clause is used to obtain debate time in the Committee of the Whole. A quorum of 100 Members is required for conducting business. Three types of votes can occur: voice, division, and recorded. In a voice vote, Members say aye or no, and the chair announces the outcome. In a division vote, Members in favor stand to be counted. During a recorded vote in the Committee of the Whole, Members use a card to vote as yea, nay, or present. The chair allows a minimum of 15 minutes for the vote. A division vote can be requested by any Member before the final result is announced. Quorum is presumed to be present for both voice and division votes. During a recorded vote in the Committee of the Whole, a Member can request a recorded vote by stating their request to the chair. The chair can postpone the vote on an amendment if requested by a Member. The chair in the Committee of the Whole can cluster or roll votes on amendments, and reduce the minimum time for an electronic vote. A Member can request a recorded vote and point out a lack of quorum if needed. The chair in the Committee of the Whole can postpone the vote under House Rule XVIII and order a quorum call if necessary. Members have 15 minutes to record their presence electronically. If there are 24 supporting Members, a recorded vote is held."
