    "content": "The Act titled \"Palestinian Peace Promotion and Anti-Incitement Act\" emphasizes that the Palestinian Authority needs to do more to end incitement and prepare for peace with Israel. It includes a limitation on assistance to the Palestinian Authority. The \"Palestinian Peace Promotion and Anti-Incitement Act\" limits funds for assistance to the Palestinian Authority to periods when a certification or recertification from the President confirms they have stopped incitement against the US and Israel and are actively working towards peace with Israel. The President must provide initial certification and recertification every six months to congressional committees regarding the Palestinian Authority's compliance with anti-incitement and peace promotion requirements. If unable to recertify, a report with reasons must be submitted. Additionally, a detailed justification report is required with each certification or recertification. The President must provide certification or recertification every six months to congressional committees regarding the Palestinian Authority's compliance with anti-incitement and peace promotion requirements. The report must detail the purposes for fund usage, accounting procedures, steps taken to combat terrorism, and definitions of terms like 'incitement'. The Palestinian Authority is prohibited from activities promoting violence, terrorism, or honoring terrorists in any sponsored or supported media, schools, mosques, or institutions. The Palestinian Authority is defined as the governing body in parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Peace preparation activities include communications supporting Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state. The Palestinian Authority must make firm public commitments to peaceful co-existence with Israel and display maps showing Israel alongside Palestine. This amendment applies to funds under the Foreign Assistance Act from 2014 onwards."
