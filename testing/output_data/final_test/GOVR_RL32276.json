    "content": "The international community has condemned the practice of torture by public officials through various treaties and declarations. The United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT) prohibits torture and requires parties to punish or extradite torturers. Over 140 states, including the United States, have become parties to the Convention since its opening for signature in December 1984. CAT defines torture as intentionally inflicting severe physical or mental pain on a person. The United Nations Convention against Torture (CAT) defines torture as intentionally inflicting severe physical or mental pain on a person, excluding pain from lawful sanctions. The definition is interpreted in a limited fashion to correspond to the common understanding of torture as universally condemned. CAT also obligates signatory parties to prevent other acts of cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment. The United Nations Convention against Torture (CAT) defines torture as intentionally inflicting severe physical or mental pain on a person. CAT requires parties to take measures to prevent torture within their jurisdiction and criminalizes all acts of torture, with no exceptions for war or emergencies. The United Nations Convention against Torture (CAT) prohibits torture under any circumstances, including during a state of war or public emergency. It also imposes obligations on signatory parties regarding the transfer of individuals to other countries to prevent torture. The United Nations Convention against Torture (CAT) prohibits torture under any circumstances and imposes obligations on signatory parties regarding the transfer of individuals to prevent torture. State parties must consider all relevant factors, including patterns of human rights violations, when deciding on transfers. The State Department interprets that competent authorities must determine the relevance of these factors in each case. CAT Article 3 does not explicitly forbid transferring individuals to countries where they may face cruel treatment not amounting to torture. The Committee Against Torture places the burden of proof on individuals seeking non-removal to show substantial grounds for fearing torture if returned to a specific country. The United States signed the United Nations Convention against Torture (CAT) on April 18, 1988, and ratified it on October 21, 1994, with certain declarations, reservations, and understandings. The Convention prohibits torture and imposes obligations on signatory parties regarding the transfer of individuals to prevent torture. The U.S. declared that CAT Articles 1 through 16 were not self-executing and required domestic implementing legislation. The Senate's advice and consent to CAT ratification included a declaration that the Convention was not self-executing. The Senate's advice and consent to CAT ratification included reservations regarding the non-self-executing nature of the Convention, specifically concerning Article 16 on cruel and unusual punishment. The U.S. also opted out of dispute-settlement provisions but reserved the right to agree to specific arbitration procedures. Additionally, detailed understandings were provided on the definition of torture within the Convention. The scope of the Convention's definition of torture under U.S. laws and regulations includes acts committed by public officials or those acting in an official capacity. Acquiescence by officials to torture requires awareness and a breach of legal responsibility to intervene. \"Willful blindness\" may also constitute acquiescence. The United States understands mental torture under the Convention Against Torture (CAT) to refer to prolonged mental harm caused by intentional infliction of severe physical pain, administration of mind-altering substances, threat of imminent death, or severe physical suffering. Acquiescence by officials to torture requires awareness and breach of legal responsibility to intervene. \"Willful blindness\" may also constitute acquiescence. The United States policy, as outlined in the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (FARRA), prohibits the expulsion or extradition of individuals to countries where there are substantial grounds to believe they would be subjected to torture. This policy is based on the understanding that torture includes mental harm caused by severe physical pain, mind-altering substances, threat of imminent death, or severe physical suffering. The standard used to determine the likelihood of torture is \"more likely than not.\" The Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (FARRA) prohibits the expulsion of individuals to countries where they may face torture. Regulations implementing the Convention Against Torture (CAT) must exclude certain aliens described in the Immigration and Nationality Act. This includes aliens involved in genocide, Nazi persecution, torture, or persecution based on race, religion, or nationality. Aliens who are considered a security threat under terrorism-related grounds for deportation, including those who have supported terrorist organizations, can be removed from the United States without the possibility of judicial appeal or review under FARRA. Judicial review is generally unavailable for CAT-based challenges in non-removal proceedings, such as extradition. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals allowed appeals under the APA in certain cases, while the Fourth Circuit held that judicial review is not available for CAT-based challenges to extradition orders. The requirements of CAT Article 3 involve a two-track system. The CAT Article 3 requirements involve a two-track system for withholding or deferring an alien's removal if they are likely to be tortured in the proposed receiving state. In 2007, immigration courts considered 28,130 CAT-based relief claims, granting relief in 541 cases. DHS estimated that approximately 1,700 aliens were granted deferral or withholding of removal based on CAT protections in the first four years of implementing regulations. Deferral of removal was granted in 92 cases in 2007. Regulations concerning the removal of aliens from the United States are covered under specific sections of the Code of Federal Regulations. The regulations prohibiting the removal of aliens to countries where they may face torture are primarily covered under specific sections of the Code of Federal Regulations. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) enforces these regulations, while the Department of Justice (DOJ) has adjudicative authority over detention and removal. \"Torture\" is defined according to the Convention Against Torture (CAT), with indefinite detention in substandard conditions not always constituting torture. EOIR or courts review rulings in certain circumstances. In certain circumstances, rape, domestic violence, and severe physical abuse may be considered torture under the Convention Against Torture (CAT) and prevent an alien's removal to a specific country. Applicants seeking non-removal under CAT Article 3 must prove it is likely they will be tortured if returned. Testimony alone can be sufficient evidence, and past torture experiences are considered. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) requires specific evidence of torture likelihood for CAT protection. If an alien is likely to be tortured in the proposed country, protection can be granted through withholding or deferral of removal. Protection is not granted if withholding is mandatory due to security or criminal reasons. Aliens subject to mandatory denial of removal under certain grounds cannot have their removal withheld but only deferred. Despite being unable to establish a claim for asylum, aliens may still be eligible for relief under CAT. Deferral of removal is a lesser protection than withholding, reflecting Congress's intent to exclude certain aliens from full CAT protections. Aliens granted deferral of removal to a country where they may face torture can be removed to another country where torture is unlikely. They may be detained post-removal as per regulations. Deferral can be terminated at the alien's request, if an immigration judge determines no torture risk, or if the Attorney General decides based on diplomatic assurances. Certain arriving aliens can be deemed inadmissible for security reasons, including terrorism involvement. The regulatory framework for proceedings to remove aliens engaged in terrorist activities is more streamlined, providing discretion to the Attorney General or DHS Secretary. CBP officers must temporarily remove suspected inadmissible aliens and report to the district director. Aliens must be notified of actions taken against them and their right to submit a written statement for consideration by the Attorney General. The CBP district director's report is sent to the regional director for further action, ensuring final decisions on removing aliens are made at the highest levels. The regional director can conduct further examination or refer the case to an immigration judge before ordering removal. The regional director's decision must be served to the alien, with confidential information redacted if necessary. The regional director has discretion in applying CAT Article 3 to removal decisions under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 235.8. The director must not execute a removal order that violates Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture. There is no clear guidance on determining if an alien is likely to be tortured in the proposed country of removal. For arriving aliens deemed inadmissible on security grounds, the regional director's decision is final with no further right to appeal. The final decision on removal orders for arriving aliens is served upon the alien, with no further administrative right to appeal. U.S. immigration regulations include a provision on \"diplomatic assurances\" that may end deliberation on an alien's non-removal claim. The Secretary of State can provide assurances from a specific country that an alien would not be tortured if removed there. If deemed reliable, the alien's claims under CAT Article 3 will not be further considered. In 2008, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that aliens facing torture have the right to challenge diplomatic assurances for their removal. CAT Article 3 lacks guidance on applying diplomatic assurances in removal decisions, requiring consideration of human rights records. The article obligates signatories to consider the receiving state's record, while the sending state must consider all relevant factors before removal. The use of diplomatic assurances by the U.S. in removing individuals to a proposed receiving state may not necessarily conflict with its obligations under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). However, the U.S. is required to exercise appropriate discretion in its use of diplomatic assurances under customary international law. If a country consistently acts contrary to its assurances, the U.S. must look beyond the assurances before permitting transfer. The CAT Committee has also emphasized the importance of good faith execution of Convention obligations. The CAT Committee has stated that diplomatic assurances without enforcement mechanisms do not fully protect against torture risks, and the sending country remains responsible under CAT Article 3. In 2006, the Committee recommended clear procedures for obtaining assurances with judicial review and post-return monitoring. CAT Article 3 also affects the U.S. extradition policy, where the Secretary of State decides on surrendering fugitives based on extradition laws. The State Department reviews torture allegations and prepares recommendations for extraditing fugitives based on CAT requirements. Before extradition, they must assess the risk of torture in the requesting state. The State Department reviews torture allegations and prepares recommendations for extraditing fugitives based on CAT requirements, considering diplomatic assurances. Extraditions are prohibited if torture is likely, but judicial review of extradition decisions varies. CAT obligates states to criminalize torture and establish jurisdiction over related offenses. The United States criminalizes acts of torture outside its territorial jurisdiction under chapter 113C of the US Criminal Code. Offenders face fines and imprisonment for up to 20 years, or life imprisonment or the death penalty in cases where death results. Jurisdiction is claimed over these actions if the offender is a US national or present in the US. Conspiring to commit torture carries similar penalties, excluding the death penalty. The Convention Against Torture (CAT) protects individuals from being removed to a state where they may be tortured, regardless of their criminal history. However, the US is not required to allow these individuals to stay in the country. In Zadvydas v. Davis, the Supreme Court ruled that deportable aliens can be indefinitely detained if their removal is blocked by CAT. The Supreme Court ruled in Zadvydas v. Davis that deportable aliens can be detained for a limited period after an order of removal, with a presumptively reasonable limit of six months. However, continued detention may be justified for dangerous individuals with strong procedural protections in place. The ruling also applies to aliens deemed inadmissible, including arriving aliens and those paroled into the country. The Zadvydas Court ruled that deportable aliens can be detained for a limited period after an order of removal, with a presumptively reasonable limit of six months. However, continued detention may be justified for dangerous individuals with strong procedural protections in place, including aliens deemed inadmissible. The Court suggested that aliens detained past the statutory period for removal might be warranted in limited cases where the alien was \"specially dangerous,\" such as those with mental illness or security-related concerns like terrorists. After the Zadvydas Court ruling, new regulations were implemented for the indefinite detention of certain deportable aliens deemed \"specially dangerous.\" Following a six-month detention period, aliens can request release with evidence that removal is not foreseeable, reviewed by ICE for a decision on continued detention based on special circumstances like security concerns or foreign policy consequences. The Zadvydas decision may lead to the eventual release of criminal aliens with non-refoulement protection under CAT, even if they are subject to removal from the US. DHS stated that in most cases, criminal aliens unable to be returned may be released after six months, with less than one percent released following a final removal order. The use of indefinite detention for such cases may be limited due to the Zadvydas ruling and subsequent legal interpretations. The potential obstacle to alien removal may increase over time due to the Zadvydas decision and subsequent jurisprudence. The Convention Against Torture (CAT) only prohibits expelling persons to states where they would likely be tortured. Agreements with countries to permit the removal of criminal aliens subject to the condition that they will not be tortured could be a possible solution. The government's interest in handling suspected foreign terrorists at ports of entry goes beyond just preventing entry. Security and criminal law enforcement concerns may also be involved, as seen in the case of Maher Arar, a Canadian citizen arrested in the U.S. on terrorism suspicions. Maher Arar, a Canadian citizen, was detained in the United States on terrorism suspicions. Despite denying any connection to terrorism, he was transferred to Syria where he was imprisoned and allegedly tortured for ten months. Upon his return to Canada, Arar claimed he was tortured by Syrian officials to confess to terrorist activities. Canada ordered a public inquiry into his transfer, and Arar filed a civil suit against U.S. officials for their role in his transfer and alleged torture. In late 2003, then-Attorney General John Ashcroft defended the removal of Maher Arar from the U.S., stating it was done within the law and treaties. The U.S. received assurances from Syria that Arar would not be tortured, and Syria denied torturing him. It is unclear if Arar's rendition followed legal procedures for covert renditions. Arar's lawsuit alleged violations of regulations on alien removal, while U.S. officials claimed the removal was lawful. The removal of Maher Arar from the U.S. may have been conducted as part of a law enforcement action related to the war on terror, rather than solely under immigration laws. The decision to remove Arar to Syria raises questions about potential violations of U.S. obligations under international laws. Arar's civil case was dismissed by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, citing national security and foreign policy considerations. The U.S. District Court dismissed Maher Arar's civil case citing national security and foreign policy considerations. The Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal, and a rehearing en banc was granted but no ruling has been issued yet. The Canadian government's commission report found that Arar was not a security threat to Canada, but inaccurate information provided by Canadian officials may have led to his transfer."
