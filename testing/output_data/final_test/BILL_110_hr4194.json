    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Underage Drinking Prevention Act of 2007\". The Congress finds that underage drinking remains a national concern, with 10.8 million Americans aged 12 to 20 reporting current alcohol use. Most youth obtain alcohol from noncommercial sources like family and friends, according to various research studies. Parents and school teachers should start discussing the dangers of underage drinking with children by age 11. Parental involvement reduces the likelihood of drinking by 67%. The Surgeon General's Call to Action recognizes the increased risk during social transitions like moving to middle or high school. Moving from middle school to high school can increase the chances of adolescents using alcohol due to heightened stress levels. Engaging in activities like volunteering, sports, music, academics, and leadership can reduce the likelihood of risky behaviors such as alcohol use. A 2004 study found that one in five teens reported drinking alcohol provided by a parent or friend's parent, leading to increased regular and binge drinking. A 2003 report recommended discussing the dangers of underage drinking with children by age 11 to reduce the risk. The Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine recommended addressing underage drinking by holding adults accountable for providing alcohol to teens. Teens find it easy to access alcohol from their homes or their parents knowingly. Surgeon General's 2007 Call to Action supports this approach, and some states are considering increasing penalties for adults who provide alcohol to those under 21. The Surgeon General's 2007 Call to Action emphasizes the importance of accurate data on youth alcohol consumption to develop prevention strategies. Reports highlight the need for improved data collection and evaluation of existing programs.
