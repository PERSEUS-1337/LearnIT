    "content": "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was established by the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-296) on November 25, 2002, combining components from 22 government agencies. Despite undergoing restructurings, DHS does not solely handle all homeland security missions, with some functions remaining in original executive branch agencies. Some functions of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) remain in original executive branch agencies like the Departments of Justice, State, Defense, and Transportation. Not all missions of DHS are strictly \"homeland security\" related, with components like the Coast Guard having non-homeland security missions. Congress has debated whether FEMA's disaster relief missions belong in DHS. Criminal justice elements could be considered part of homeland security, along with issues like military involvement in law enforcement and monitoring of money transfers. This report provides a survey of issues in homeland security policy debates, covering topics such as Counterterrorism, Border Security, Disaster Preparedness, Cybersecurity, and DHS Management. It includes contact information for authors and highlights specific CRS reports for more detailed information. The report is representative of the issues likely to be addressed by the 115th Congress. The report covers a broad array of issues likely to be addressed by the 115th Congress, including unresolved issues from the 114th Congress. It encourages readers to explore CRS resources for more information on various topics, but should be viewed as an introduction rather than a legislative tracker. Some current dynamic debates, such as the Administration's proposed border wall, are not included as focal points in this report. From FY2003 through FY2015, the U.S. government spent almost $807 billion on \"homeland security\" activities to detect, deter, protect against, and respond to terrorist attacks. Spending peaked in FY2009 at $73.8 billion. The Department of Homeland Security budget has grown from $31.2 billion in FY2003 to $63.5 billion in FY2015. Roughly 57.8% of the budget was considered \"homeland security\" spending. Some argue that the definition of homeland security should include immigration, border control, and disaster response. The Obama Administration requested $47.3 billion for DHS in FY2017. The Obama Administration requested $47.3 billion for DHS in FY2017, including funding for major disasters under the Stafford Act. Continuing resolutions were signed into law to fund the government at the same rate of operations as FY2016. The Trump Administration proposed an amendment to the FY2017 budget request, including $3 billion more in funding for DHS for a border wall and increased staffing for U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. President Trump signed the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2017 into law on May 5, 2017, which included $49.3 billion in discretionary budget authority for DHS for FY2017. The DHS appropriations aim to enhance transparency, but the U.S. Coast Guard's funding structure remains unchanged due to financial system complications. The current budget environment poses challenges for homeland security programs, DHS components, and the department as a whole. Ongoing capital investment efforts like the border wall and cybersecurity, border security, and immigration enforcement staffing needs will compete for limited funding. The potential impact of the changing budget environment is discussed in the report. The primary mission of the Intelligence Community (IC) includes homeland security, not just the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Efforts have been made to integrate intelligence and law enforcement capabilities post-9/11, breaking down barriers between foreign and domestic intelligence. Legislation and policies have been enacted to enhance information sharing across the U.S. government. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorist Prevention Act of 2004 aimed to improve information sharing and coordination in the U.S. government regarding terrorist threats. This included the establishment of the National Counterterrorism Center and the Director of National Intelligence position. Initiatives like the FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Forces and DHS's National Network of Fusion Centers have also been implemented to enhance collaboration at the state and local levels. The U.S. government has evolved to include 17 organizations/agencies across six departments and two independent agencies for intelligence-related activities. DHS's missions focus on preventing terrorism, securing borders, enforcing immigration laws, strengthening cyberspace, and enhancing national preparedness. DHS's Office of Intelligence and Analysis supports these missions by combining information collected from operational activities. The Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA) within DHS collaborates with various sources to develop homeland security intelligence on threats like terrorism, border security, human trafficking, and public health. OIA's customers range from the U.S. President to local first responders, with information sharing facilitated through the NNFC. The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) under DHS focuses on maritime security and homeland defense. The US Coast Guard (USCG) is responsible for maritime safety, security, and stewardship. The FBI acts as both an intelligence and law enforcement agency, with efforts to improve counterterrorism post-9/11 through various laws and executive orders. The FBI Intelligence Branch oversees intelligence policy and guidance, managing a national intelligence workforce with expertise in intelligence missions. This includes the Directorate of Intelligence, responsible for all Bureau intelligence functions and playing a crucial role in investigative work, particularly in countering national security threats through the FBI National Security Branch. The FBI National Security Branch, overseen by the FBI Intelligence Branch, includes divisions focused on counterintelligence, counterterrorism, high-value detainee interrogation, weapons of mass destruction, and the Terrorist Screening Center. These divisions work to prevent theft of sensitive information, conduct counterterrorism investigations, coordinate efforts to prevent the use of weapons of mass destruction, and maintain a watch list of known or suspected terrorists. In 2016, then-FBI Director James Comey emphasized the importance of sharing intelligence within the FBI's \"intelligence transformation.\" Steps taken include establishing an Intelligence Branch headed by an executive assistant director and providing joint training for special agents and intelligence analysts to enhance collaboration. The 115th Congress may address domestic surveillance issues related to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) of 1978, particularly provisions associated with Title VII set to expire in December 2017. FISA regulates government agencies' gathering of foreign intelligence through electronic surveillance, physical searches, and access to business records. Authorization for these activities is typically obtained through court orders. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) regulates government agencies' gathering of foreign intelligence through electronic surveillance, physical searches, and access to business records. Authorization for these activities is obtained via court orders from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC). Major revisions to FISA were prompted by the 9/11 attacks, leading to legislation such as the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and the FISA Amendments Act of 2008. The USA FREEDOM Act of 2015 reauthorized amendments to FISA, including the \"roving\" wiretap provision, the \"Section 215\" provision, and the \"lone wolf\" provisions. The \"roving\" wiretap provision in FISA allows wiretaps to follow an individual across different communication devices. Section 215 broadened the types of records accessible to the government. The \"lone wolf\" provision permits monitoring of individuals engaged in international terrorism, not U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Title VII of the FISA legislation, added in 2008, allows for targeting individuals outside the US for foreign intelligence information. It has a sunset clause that was extended in 2012 and will expire in 2017 unless Congress extends it. The provision is limited to non-US persons and has targeting procedures to prevent intentional acquisition of any information. The targeting procedures under Title VII of the FISA legislation must prevent intentional acquisition of communication where sender and recipients are in the US. Acquisitions can last up to one year, with no new orders under Section 702 after the sunset date. Efforts are ongoing to improve information sharing between intelligence and law enforcement entities. Efforts are underway to improve information sharing between the public and private sector, including initiatives like the White House-led Information Sharing and Access Interagency Policy Committee (ISA IPC), DHS's Critical Infrastructure Information Sharing and Collaboration Program (CISCP), FBI's InfraGard program, and the Department of State's Overseas Security Advisory Council. These programs focus on government-wide standards, security, threat sharing, and collaboration in critical infrastructure sectors. The Department of State collaborates with business and private sector interests globally through the Overseas Security Advisory Council. Congress may assess the effectiveness of information-sharing organizations like CISCP in areas such as cybersecurity, border security, and disaster response. It is important to determine agency leadership and accountability in collaborative efforts. The Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T) and the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) are key entities responsible for coordinating DHS research and development (R&D) activities related to nuclear and radiological threats. Various DHS components, including the Coast Guard, also fund R&D activities aligned with their missions. The Under Secretary for S&T and the Director of DNDO play crucial roles in coordinating homeland security R&D efforts both within DHS and across the federal government, addressing long-standing congressional concerns about internal and external coordination. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) highlighted challenges in DHS overseeing department-wide R&D in 2012. In 2014, DHS was directed to implement new policies for R&D prioritization and review department-wide R&D policies. While progress was made in defining R&D and conducting portfolio reviews, policy guidance for DHS-wide R&D oversight and coordination was still lacking. External coordination remains a challenge as most homeland security R&D is conducted by other agencies. The majority of homeland security R&D is conducted by other agencies, with the Department of Defense and the Department of Health and Human Services being notable examples. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 directs the Under Secretary for S&T to develop a national policy and strategic plan for homeland security R&D, but no such plan has been issued. The National Science and Technology Council has issued R&D strategies in certain areas, and the S&T Directorate has developed R&D plans with individual agencies in response to specific threats. Coordination provisions for R&D have been included in congressional report language and may also be part of DHS reauthorization legislation. Terrorism remains a transnational threat to U.S. global interests, with a focus on addressing threats from Al Qaeda and the Islamic State. The current Administration is primarily focused on detecting, deterring, and defeating these groups and their affiliates. Other terrorist groups also pose risks, but the main emphasis is on Al Qaeda and the Islamic State. Understanding how Al Qaeda and the Islamic State evolve into global entities is crucial for strategic policy. Recent terrorist attacks have been carried out by individuals or small cells with varying levels of affiliation to these groups. U.S. counterterrorism efforts, including the killing of Osama bin Laden, have weakened core Al Qaeda. Post-9/11 global military and intelligence actions have degraded Al Qaeda's ability to launch catastrophic attacks against U.S. interests. Al Qaeda has evolved into a philosophical movement, making it harder to detect. The Islamic State, a Sunni Islamist group, has expanded control in Iraq and Syria. Debate exists on the threat posed by overseas Islamic State members to U.S. facilities and personnel. The Islamic State, a Sunni Islamist group, has expanded control in Iraq and Syria since the 2011 U.S. withdrawal from Iraq. The organization has thrived in disaffected Sunni tribal areas affected by the civil war. IS forces have killed adversaries and hostages, drawing international ire and raising U.S. attention to Iraq's political problems and the war in Syria. The terrorist threat to U.S. global interests will likely continue. The terrorist threat to U.S. global interests remains a significant issue for the Administration and Congress. Numerous individuals have been arrested for planning attacks directed at U.S. national security interests, including lone attackers radicalized online, terrorist organizations targeting airliners, and individuals attempting mass shootings. The 114th Congress conducted hearings to better understand terrorism in different regions and assess counterterrorism efforts. The 115th Congress may assess the effectiveness of U.S. and partnering nations' counterterrorism efforts, including public diplomacy, sanctions, terrorism financing rules, and the nexus between international crime, narcotics, and terrorism. Assessments will consider balancing perceived risks to U.S. global security interests with non-security related policy priorities. The Islamic State (IS) has been the focal point for the majority of homegrown violent jihadist plots since 2014. IS supporters have been involved in 80 out of approximately 91 plots during this period, including plans to travel to Syria or strike domestic targets. The Islamic State has been the focal point for the majority of homegrown violent jihadist plots since 2014, including plans to travel to Syria or strike domestic targets. Plots can be categorized into three groups: The Departed - American foreign fighters leaving or left the US to fight for IS, The Returned - fighters who return to the US to potentially plan and execute attacks, and The Inspired - Americans influenced by IS propaganda to participate in terrorist plots within the US. The Islamic State has been the focus of many homegrown violent jihadist plots in the United States since 2014. 47 out of 80 IS-related plots involved individuals either leaving for Syria or considering it. IS propaganda has inspired attacks in the US, with cases dating back to 2014. The group has encouraged attacks during Ramadan and praised individuals involved in past attacks. The San Bernardino shooting in December 2015 involved a couple. American IS fighters pose a threat to U.S. interests, including The Lost and The Others - foreign IS adherents. Some American IS supporters may never return to the United States, while others may perish abroad. Foreign fighters linked to the Islamic State pose a potential threat to the United States. U.S. law enforcement focuses on preemption and monitoring of IS terrorist activity through interdiction, investigation, and countering violent extremism. Efforts include stopping suspected terrorists from entering the country, utilizing intelligence-driven screening by agencies like Customs and Border Protection. Coordination with other nations is also key in identifying and intercepting foreign fighters. The DHS enhances ESTA to vet travelers for security risks before boarding flights to the US. Trump Administration's revised Executive Order 13769 imposed a 90-day ban on certain aliens from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. Refugee admissions were also suspended and the annual cap reduced to 50,000. The discussion on counterterrorism investigation activities mainly focuses on Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTFs) led by the FBI and supported by various agencies. JTTFs play a key role in coordinating federal counterterrorism cases in the US, stopping individuals from joining the Islamic State, and investigating returnees from conflict zones. The FBI has legal attach\u00e9s worldwide to collaborate with foreign law enforcement in combating terrorism, while the DOJ expands its presence in transit countries for foreign fighters. The Obama Administration's program, countering violent extremism (CVE), focused on proactive actions to prevent extremists from recruiting and mobilizing followers to violence. It targeted potentially violent extremists from various ideological backgrounds, emphasizing addressing the factors driving radicalization. The program at DHS involved community engagement and partnership efforts to intervene with individuals on the path towards becoming violent extremists. The Trump Administration is considering focusing the program on homegrown violent jihadists. The 115th Congress may review federal efforts to counter CBRN threats and decide on continuing, modifying, or ending current programs. The research, development, and procurement of new CBRN medical countermeasures for civilian use involve a complex multi-agency process within the Department of Health and Human Services. Recent Congresses have provided new authorities to improve the process, but unresolved issues remain, including appropriations, interagency coordination, and countermeasure prioritization. Congress may decide on funding levels and whether to return to funding Project BioShield through multiyear advance appropriations. Policymakers may consider legislative changes to planning and transparency requirements. Policymakers and Congress are urged to consider the effectiveness of legislative changes in enhancing coordination of multiagency countermeasure development and oversight. Congress authorized DHS to regulate security at chemical facilities through the Protecting and Securing Chemical Facilities from Terrorist Attacks Act of 2014, with the new authority expiring in December 2018. The 115th Congress will likely consider reauthorizing, modifying, or allowing the DHS Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards program (CFATS) to expire. They will assess if the program balances homeland security and stakeholder needs, and evaluate DHS's implementation alignment with congressional intent. Previous concerns about regulatory exemptions for certain facilities have been raised by the Obama Administration and stakeholders. Environmental groups advocate for additional requirements for facilities to adopt security measures. Groups advocate for Congress to include requirements for facilities to adopt \"inherently safer technologies\" and disseminate security-related information. The regulated industry opposes granting DHS the ability to mandate specific security measures, questioning the maturity of the inherently safer technology concept. The Obama Administration and stakeholders have raised concerns about the broad dissemination of chemical security-related information. After the 2013 West Fertilizer Company explosion, DHS found ineffective sharing of chemical inventory information between federal agencies, prompting a review of information-sharing policies. The Obama Administration and stakeholders have raised concerns about the broad dissemination of chemical security-related information. After the 2013 West Fertilizer Company explosion, DHS found ineffective sharing of chemical inventory information between federal agencies, prompting a review of information-sharing policies. This led to reconsideration of existing information-sharing policies and Executive Order 13650, \"Improving Chemical Facility Safety and Security.\" Congress may consider reauthorizing the CFATS program and deciding whether to make it permanent or include another expiration provision. The electric utility industry operates an integrated system of generation, transmission, and distribution facilities in the United States. High voltage (HV) transformers are critical elements of the nation's electric power grid, carrying bulk volumes of electricity. They are considered vulnerable to intentional damage, with experts warning that a coordinated attack on multiple HV transformers could have severe implications for reliable electric service over a large area. A coordinated attack on multiple HV transformers could severely impact electric service over a large area, leading to widespread blackouts. Recent physical attacks on transformer substations have highlighted vulnerabilities and spurred efforts to enhance security and recovery measures. Grid security measures have been implemented to address physical security risks since 2002, with guidelines developed by NERC. In response to the Metcalf attack, FERC approved a new mandatory Physical Security Reliability Standard to assess critical facilities, evaluate threats, and implement security plans. NERC received initial risk assessments and security plans from transmission companies by December 2016. NERC received risk assessments and security plans from transmission owners by December 2016. Policymakers have suggested additional measures for grid recovery in emergencies, such as a DOE-led effort to develop a critical HV transformer reserve. The FAST Act of 2015 provides the Secretary of Energy with authority to order emergency measures for grid recovery. The FAST Act of 2015 grants the Secretary of Energy authority to order emergency measures to protect critical electric infrastructure during a grid security emergency. It also mandates the submission of a plan for a Strategic Transformer Reserve storing spare large power transformers for replacement in case of damage. Additionally, industry-led transformer-sharing programs are being developed to address vulnerabilities in the U.S. HV transformer system. The vulnerability of HV transformers in the United States to terrorist attacks has raised concerns among officials, utilities, and manufacturers. Recent security exercises and incidents like the Metcalf attack have prompted congressional interest in the physical security of HV transformers. The 115th Congress may focus on industry's implementation of new security standards, DOE's plan for a strategic transformer reserve, private sector efforts to enhance transformer design, and the quality of federal information on grid threats. Government continuity planning ensures recovery from operational interruptions, maintaining civil authority, supporting affected individuals, repairing infrastructure, and overseeing recovery efforts. Emergency response relies on a functional government to fund and support recovery. Government continuity planning ensures recovery from operational interruptions, maintaining civil authority, supporting affected individuals, repairing infrastructure, and overseeing recovery efforts. The government has contingency plans for various interruptions, including acts of nature, accidents, technological emergencies, and military or terrorist attacks. The 2007 National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD) on National Continuity Policy, NSPD-51, provides authority for executive branch continuity programs to ensure the preservation of essential government activities under all conditions. Executive Order (E.O.) 12656 assigns national security emergency preparedness responsibilities. Executive Order (E.O.) 12656, issued in 1988, assigns national security emergency preparedness responsibilities to federal departments and agencies. It requires continuity of essential functions in a national security emergency, including succession to office, safekeeping of resources, and establishment of emergency operating capabilities. Departments must carry out specific contingency planning activities in their areas of policy responsibility. Congress could review current authorities to ensure they align with government organization and goals, consider costs, and address potential conflicts among departments complying with different authorities. The U.S. Secret Service has faced increased congressional oversight due to concerns about terrorism threats, security breaches, and misconduct. Incidents have tarnished the agency's image and potentially affected its operations. The U.S. Secret Service has faced increased congressional oversight due to concerns about security breaches and misconduct. Incidents have tarnished the agency's image and potentially affected its operations, including unauthorized access to the White House, security protocol violations, and agents disrupting investigations while under the influence of alcohol. The USSS faced congressional oversight following security breaches and misconduct incidents, leading to reviews of training, technology, and operations. Congress held oversight hearings on USSS policy, including allegations of unpaid overtime for agents and technology failures affecting the protection mission. Criticisms included the burden of the USSS' investigative mission on agents, technology failures, promotions despite misconduct, and protection of sensitive material. USSS agents promoted to senior management positions despite alleged misconduct, with senior leadership withholding information from Congress. Congressional pursuit of USSS issues expected in the 115th Congress. Federal building and facility security decentralized and disparate, impacting daily operations and safety of employees and the public. The federal government is focused on securing over 446,000 buildings and facilities daily, with increased security operations following terrorist attacks and shootings. Federal facility security aims to reduce criminal and terrorist threats, tailored to each facility's unique needs and missions. Approximately 20 federal law enforcement entities are involved in this effort. The Interagency Security Committee (ISC) under the Office of Justice Programs (OJP) oversees security standards for approximately 20 federal law enforcement entities securing various federal facilities. Each facility may have different security measures based on specific needs and threats, making it difficult to gather comprehensive data on incidents. Since 1996, Congress has provided grant funding to states and localities for homeland security purposes, following incidents like the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. The Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Program was one of the first programs to offer funding for biological, chemical, and nuclear security to over 150 cities. Following the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, Congress increased focus on state and local homeland security assistance, leading to the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) after the 9/11 attacks. Policy questions regarding homeland security assistance programs remain unresolved, with ongoing congressional debate on related issues. Some may argue for further oversight and legislation on DHS assistance to states and localities, focusing on the purpose, number, and funding of grant programs. Grant programs have a range of eligible activities, and discretion is used in selecting projects for funding. The adequacy of DHS grant programs in addressing security needs is questioned. The adequacy of DHS grant programs in addressing security needs is questioned, with concerns about coordination challenges, program consolidation, and effectiveness of funding usage at the state and local level. Congress may address the issue of how effectively DHS's assistance is being spent, including evaluating the use of program funding by state and local jurisdictions. The effectiveness of federal funding for homeland security grant programs is under scrutiny by Congress. Over the past 13 years, approximately $33 billion has been allocated for state and local assistance, with funding ranging from $3.5 billion in FY2004 to $1.4 billion in FY2013. Congress is considering the need for continued support or potential reduction/elimination of funding. Kristin M. Finklea, a Specialist in Domestic Security, highlights the significant illegal drug market in the United States. The illegal drug market in the United States is dominated by Mexican drug trafficking organizations, sustaining a multi-billion dollar industry. An estimated 27.1 million Americans were current users of illicit drugs in 2015. Mexican TCOs control smuggling corridors across the Southwest border, introducing large quantities of heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine, marijuana, and fentanyl into the country. The DEA considers Mexican TCOs to be the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States. Mexican criminal networks dominate the illegal drug market in the United States, trafficking heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine, marijuana, and fentanyl. They transport or produce drugs across the border, distribute them within the US, and engage in other illegal activities for income. Heroin use and availability in the US have increased, partly due to Mexican traffickers. Mexican criminal networks dominate the illegal drug market in the United States, trafficking heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine, marijuana, and fentanyl. Some Mexican farmers have switched from growing marijuana to opium poppies due to declining marijuana prices in Mexico and increased U.S. heroin demand. Mexican heroin production and availability in the U.S. have led to a 350% increase in heroin seizures at the Southwest border between 2008 and 2015. The 115th Congress may consider options to reduce drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States. The Obama Administration's National Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy aimed to reduce illicit drug flow across the Southwest border. Policymakers may focus on federal drug control agencies like the DEA and the Office of National Drug Control Policy to combat Southwest border trafficking. Money laundering poses challenges to law enforcement and is linked to homeland security policy. Illicit funds generated in the United States, particularly from drug sales, amount to approximately $300 billion annually. A significant portion of this, around $64 billion, is generated from drug sales and is moved across the Southwest border into Mexico to fuel criminal activities of drug traffickers. This poses challenges to law enforcement and has implications for homeland security policy. Illicit funds from drug sales in the U.S., totaling around $300 billion annually, are often laundered through various methods such as bulk cash smuggling into Mexico and repatriation into the U.S. via couriers or armored vehicles. Interagency coordination is crucial to combat drug-related activities and the flow of illicit proceeds along the Southwest border. Various departments and agencies share responsibility for this, including the DEA, FBI, ICE, CBP, and FinCEN. Mexican traffickers use cross-border tunnels to smuggle drugs into the US, with at least 224 tunnels discovered along the Southwest border since the 1990s. Some tunnels are highly sophisticated. Operations targeting southbound firearms smuggling may also intercept cash proceeds from illicit drug sales. The more recently discovered tunnels for drug smuggling are highly sophisticated, with some equipped with rail, lighting, ventilation, and even an elevator. These tunnels can be over 800 yards long and have been used to smuggle large quantities of drugs such as cocaine and marijuana. U.S. law enforcement uses various tactics to uncover and dismantle these tunnels. U.S. law enforcement uses various tactics, including sonic equipment, seismic technology, and ground penetrating radar, to detect cross-border tunnels used for drug smuggling. However, these technologies have limitations, and officials rely more on human intelligence and tips to discover sophisticated tunnels. Cooperation between U.S. and Mexican law enforcement is crucial in detecting, investigating, and prosecuting criminals involved in creating and using these tunnels. The 115th Congress may consider helping U.S. law enforcement develop technologies to combat cross-border tunnels and improve bi-national partnerships. Policymakers may question the role of combating smuggling tunnels in the larger border security framework. Contact Lisa Sacco for more information. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) focuses on balancing trade efficiency with cargo security and enforcement of U.S. trade laws. The key policy question is how to minimize the risk of weapons of mass destruction, illegal drugs, and contraband entering U.S. ports of entry while reducing costs and delays. CBP's trade strategy emphasizes risk management and a multi-layered enforcement approach, segmenting importers based on risk levels and conducting enforcement at various points in the import process. The Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) is a voluntary program that focuses on cargo security and risk management in the import process, including scanning maritime cargo containers abroad. Congressional attention is also on spending levels for port of entry infrastructure and personnel. C-TPAT is a program for import-related businesses to register with CBP and perform security tasks. Members receive benefits like expedited import processing. Some criticize the program for inadequate benefits compared to the time and financial investments required. Trusted trader benefits include access to dedicated lanes at land ports for shorter wait times. Access to dedicated lanes at land ports for shorter wait times is a key benefit of the C-TPAT program. However, adding lanes at urban ports is challenging due to limited space and infrastructure. Trusted trader benefits for maritime imports include a reduced likelihood of secondary inspection, although only a small percentage of containers are selected for inspection. The Government Accountability Office has recommended improvements to CBP management of the C-TPAT program. Section 1701 of the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 requires all imported marine containers to be scanned by nonintrusive imaging and radiation detection equipment at foreign loading ports by July 1, 2012. DHS has requested an extension for all ports due to challenges in implementing the 100% scanning requirement. CBP identified three main obstacles to achieving 100% scanning at foreign ports. The main obstacles to implementing 100% scanning at all foreign ports include lack of support from some foreign governments and business groups, logistical difficulties in high-volume ports, and the high cost estimated at $8 million per shipping lane. Former DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson reviewed port security and stated that DHS's ability to comply with 100% scanning is highly improbable and expensive. DHS officials prefer a risk-based security strategy over 100% scanning, which is also opposed by major U.S. trading partners like the European Commission. CBP has tested scanning feasibility at overseas ports. The feasibility of scanning all U.S.-bound containers at overseas ports faces operational, technical, logistical, financial, and diplomatic obstacles, including opposition from host government officials. DHS officials oppose a 100% scanning strategy, preferring a risk-based approach to focus resources on high-risk containers. Scanning fewer containers allows for more thorough inspection, especially since reviewing scans is labor-intensive. Maintaining a lower threshold for opening containers with questionable scanning images is crucial. If illicit cargo is estimated to be less than 1% of incoming containers, CBP believes this alternative approach is more effective. An alternative enforcement strategy for dealing with illicit cargo in incoming containers, estimated to be less than 1%, involves focusing on a smaller set of likely containers through risk-based scanning and investment in intelligence. This approach could include increasing CBP personnel to conduct targeted special enforcement operations. Additionally, the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) is required for workers at U.S. ports to access secure areas of port facilities or vessels. The Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) is authorized under the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002. The card must be renewed every five years and involves a security threat assessment for each worker. The fee for the card is around $130 and it uses biometric technology for identification. Terminal operators are required to deploy card readers at gates for positive identification of workers entering port areas. The Coast Guard issued a final rule in August 2016 requiring only high-risk maritime facilities to install card readers for TWIC. This limited the facilities to about 16% of regulated maritime facilities. Other facilities would continue to use TWIC as a \"flash pass\" without using biometric data for worker identification. Federal investigators uncovered a fraudulent TWIC card operation in Los Angeles in 2016. The Coast Guard currently conducts spot checks using biometric readers during port security inspections. GAO and Inspector General audits have criticized the implementation of TWIC. A 2013 GAO audit raised concerns about incomplete and unreliable pilot test results for card readers. This audit was discussed in hearings by House Subcommittees on Government Operations and Border and Maritime Security. Another 2013 GAO audit examined TSA's Adjudication Center and made recommendations for improving security threat assessments for TWIC applicants and other transportation workers. The 2011 GAO audit found internal control weaknesses in the enrollment, background checking, and use of the TWIC card at ports, undermining its effectiveness in screening out unqualified individuals. A 2016 Inspector General audit criticized TSA for prioritizing customer service over careful scrutiny of applicants, leading to the issuance of TWIC cards to individuals with fraudulent identification documents. The Essential Transportation Worker Identification Credential Assessment Act (P.L. 114-278) requires TSA to improve its vetting process, including fraud detection. The TSA is working to enhance its vetting process, including fraud detection, and the DHS is tasked with assessing the benefits and costs of the TWIC card. CBP's Office of Field Operations conducts immigration, customs, and agricultural inspections at ports of entry to identify high-risk individuals and materials while facilitating access for low-risk travelers. The Drug Enforcement Administration has highlighted security risks at ports of entry. The Drug Enforcement Administration has cited security risks at ports of entry (POEs) due to transnational criminal organizations using various methods to transport drugs, with the most common involving vehicles. Travelers at POEs must present travel documents like passports or visas for admission, with foreign nationals undergoing security checks. CBP officers verify the authenticity of travelers' documents at U.S. POEs. CBP officers at U.S. POEs verify travelers' documents and confirm their identity through biometric checks against the DHS IDENT database. Database interoperability allows for checks against other government databases. Adequate resources are needed to minimize congestion and ensure efficient operations at the border. CBP faces pressure to process individuals quickly while also interdicting threats. Investment in POEs has not kept pace with rapid growth. Investment in Port of Entry (POE) infrastructure has not kept pace with the rapid growth in international travel and trade, leading to inadequate management of flows at some ports. To streamline admissions without compromising security, CBP has implemented trusted traveler programs like Global Entry and NEXUS, which require background checks and biometric data for expedited processing at POEs. The U.S.-Canadian program and SENTRI expedite screening at land ports. Congress faces resource allocation issues for POE personnel and infrastructure. CBP officers and agriculture specialists are front-line enforcement personnel at POEs. Since 2004, Congress has focused more on increasing U.S. Border Patrol agents between ports of entry (POEs) than on Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers at POEs. However, the Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2014 allocated $256 million to hire at least 2,000 CBP officers by the end of FY2015. CBP has faced challenges in recruiting, hiring, and retaining personnel, including competition with other agencies, remote job locations, and a lengthy hiring process. Despite these issues, CBP has implemented measures to improve recruitment and retention, such as pilot programs allowing donations from stakeholders and reimbursable service agreements. The Donations Acceptance Program (DAP) and Reimbursable Services Program (RSP) allow CBP to accept donations for border facility improvements and fund additional CBP officers. These programs provide alternative funding sources outside of congressional appropriations. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 mandated the development of an automated entry and exit control system to track nonimmigrants in the US. Despite amendments requiring biometric technology, the system remains incomplete, especially the exit component. Data collection is limited, with no exit data from southern border land ports of entry. CBP collects limited biographic data at POEs, relies on information sharing, and sees biometric data collection as a long-term goal. Pilot programs test new technologies for traveler identity verification. U.S. Border Patrol enforces immigration laws between POEs. The U.S. Border Patrol enforces immigration laws along the border to prevent unlawful entries, including terrorists, unauthorized migrants, and contraband. CBP has invested in border security personnel, infrastructure, and technology since the 1980s, with a budget of $13.3 billion in FY2016. Questions have been raised about the effectiveness of CBP's investments, and the Trump Administration has shown interest in increasing resources on the Southwest border. President Trump signed Executive Order 13767 on January 25, 2017, calling for the immediate planning, designing, and construction of a \"physical wall\" along the Southwest border and the hiring of an additional 5,000 Border Patrol agents. Congress has raised questions about measuring border security, with CBP using various metrics like the number of migrants apprehended and recidivism rate. Statistical modeling is now being used by CBP to estimate new border security measures. CBP has used statistical modeling to estimate a new border security metric for successful unauthorized entry of migrants into the United States. Congress may question the priority between the southern and northern borders, with concerns raised about the northern border's vulnerability to terrorism. Following the 9/11 attacks, Congress created the TSA to federalize airline security. Challenges remain in effectively screening passengers, baggage, and cargo for explosives, developing risk-based screening methods, utilizing intelligence to identify threats, and responding to security threats at airports. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandated 100% screening of checked baggage on domestic and international flights. The Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act mandated physical screening of all cargo on passenger flights. TSA does not routinely inspect air cargo but uses the Certified Cargo Screening Program for this purpose. The TSA collaborates with various entities to conduct screening inspections for U.S.-bound and domestic cargo on passenger aircraft. They work with Customs and Border Protection for risk-based targeting of cargo shipments, using the ATS-C system to identify high-risk shipments. This system has evolved in response to security threats, such as the 2010 cargo aircraft bomb plot from Yemen. The TSA uses Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) and Explosives Trace Detection (ETD) systems at passenger screening checkpoints to detect explosives on passengers and carry-on items. In response to security threats like the 2010 cargo aircraft bomb plot from Yemen, the Obama Administration accelerated the deployment of these technologies. TSA plans to procure AIT and ETD systems in small numbers in its FY2017 budget request. The TSA plans to acquire over 300 advanced technology X-ray imagers for carry-on items with upgraded capabilities. Privacy concerns regarding the use of AIT have been addressed by eliminating human analysis and not storing imagery. Medical risks from backscatter X-ray systems are no longer a concern as current millimeter wave systems emit nonionizing waves. The DHS Office of Inspector General conducted covert testing on passenger screening technologies, revealing failures in AIT and ATR effectiveness. Past legislative proposals aimed to prohibit whole body imaging for primary screening, but AIT is now commonly used at larger airports. Many smaller airports still lack advanced screening technology. The FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 directed TSA to develop recommendations for more efficient passenger screening and initiate pilot programs at large airports to increase efficiencies. TSA utilizes explosives detection system (EDS) and ETD technology for checked baggage screening. The TSA utilizes explosives detection system (EDS) and ETD technology for checked baggage screening, with different speed systems deployed based on airport needs. The focus is on replacing outdated systems and developing new algorithms to improve homemade explosives detection. TSA also funds airport modifications for accommodating explosives detection technologies. The TSA's National Explosives Detection Canine Team Program deploys trained canine teams at transportation facilities to detect explosives. There are approximately 320 TSA teams and 675 state and local law enforcement teams trained by TSA. Following airport bombings in 2016, there is interest in increasing deployments of canine teams in nonsterile areas of airport terminals. TSA has initiated initiatives to focus its resources on maximizing security effectiveness. TSA has implemented initiatives to focus resources on security risk assessments, including the PreCheck trusted traveler program for expedited screening. Participants vetted through a background check process can keep shoes on and liquids/laptops in carry-on bags in expedited lanes at over 180 airports. The PreCheck program allows expedited screening at over 180 airports for participants who pass a background check and pay an $85 fee for a five-year membership. TSA aims to process 50% of passengers through PreCheck lanes to reduce the need for standard security screening. Currently, about 10 million individuals are enrolled in PreCheck or other trusted traveler programs, with a goal to increase this number to 25 million. P.L. 114-190 mandates increased private-sector involvement in marketing PreCheck and requires PreCheck lanes to be open during peak travel times. One concern is the lack of biometric authentication for participant verification. The PreCheck program allows expedited screening at over 180 airports for participants who pass a background check and pay an $85 fee for a five-year membership. Currently, about 10 million individuals are enrolled in PreCheck or other trusted traveler programs, with a goal to increase this number to 25 million. One concern is the lack of biometric authentication for participant verification, which was previously attempted with the Registered Traveler program but was unsuccessful. In 2016, biometric identity authentication was reintroduced at 13 airports under a private trusted traveler program known as Clear, separate from PreCheck. This has improved screening efficiency and resulted in cost savings for TSA. TSA estimates annual savings of $110 million from PreCheck and other risk-based initiatives. A passenger behavior detection program called SPOT was initiated in 2003, deploying almost 3,000 officers at 176 airports by FY2012. Questions remain about the program's effectiveness and concerns about potential profiling. Despite some calls to shut down the program, Congress has not taken action. The failed attempt to eliminate funding for the program that requires airlines to check passenger names against terrorist watchlists led to TSA taking over watchlist checks under the Secure Flight program. DHS announced in November 2010 that 100% of passengers flying to or from U.S. airports are being vetted using the Secure Flight system. The Secure Flight system vets passenger name records against the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) and operates in coordination with watchlists by CBP's National Targeting Center-Passenger. TSA conducts risk-based analysis of passenger data through the Computer-Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS) and incorporates CAPPS assessments into Secure Flight. This system uses passenger information to perform risk-based analyses. The Secure Flight system uses data for risk-based analyses to determine screening levels at airport checkpoints. Key issues for Congress include updating watchlists quickly, utilizing all available information to assess threats, detecting identity fraud, providing redress for individuals wrongly identified, and coordinating with international partners to prevent terrorist travel. The TSA was directed to assess the use of fingerprint-based criminal background checks to enhance terrorist watchlist checks for PreCheck participants and expand checks for airport workers. Airport operators are responsible for perimeter security, access controls, and issuing Security Identification Display Area (SIDA) badges to workers. The TSA requires airports to secure access control points with security measures like guards and locks. Airports must train employees to check for proper identification and use surveillance technologies, access control measures, and security patrols to protect airport property. State and local law enforcement agencies patrol airport property and adjacent areas to prevent threats to aviation. TSA requires security background checks for airport workers with unescorted access to secure areas, including fingerprint-based criminal history records and security threat assessments. Certain criminal offenses within the past 10 years are disqualifying. P.L. 114-190 directed TSA to update eligibility criteria and disqualifying offenses for SIDA access credentials based on transportation vetting requirements and insider threat knowledge. The law proposes expanding the criminal history look-back period. The law proposes TSA expand the criminal history look-back period to 15 years and disqualify individuals released from prison within five years of their application. TSA is directed to establish a waiver process for denied credentials and implement recurrent vetting of airport workers using FBI's Rap Back services. Enhanced physical inspections of airport workers at SIDA access points are to be random, unpredictable, data-driven, and operationally dynamic. Covert testing of access controls is also to be increased. Incident response at airports is primarily the responsibility of the airport operator and law enforcement agencies, with TSA regulating response plans. After a shooting incident at LAX, TSA proposed actions to improve checkpoint security, including enhanced training for screeners and increased law enforcement presence during peak times. The Gerardo Hernandez Airport Security Act of 2015 requires airports to adopt security incident response plans and share best practices for training. It also aims to expand funding for checkpoint screening law enforcement support. TSA did not support proposals to arm certain employees or provide bulletproof vests. Law enforcement response at passenger screening checkpoints allows for flexibility in deployment. The Gerardo Hernandez Airport Security Act of 2015 mandates security incident response plans and funding for law enforcement support at passenger screening checkpoints. TSA provides funding for law enforcement hours and requires training exercises to enhance preparedness for security incidents at airports and other public locations. TSA also regulates foreign air carriers operating flights to the United States. The TSA regulates air carriers operating flights to the United States, including enforcing requirements for passenger, baggage, and cargo screening. TSA inspects foreign airports with preclearance facilities, allowing passengers to be admitted to the US before departure. Screening measures at these airports are a priority for TSA. The TSA prioritizes assessing screening measures at preclearance airports and increasing checked baggage preclearance processing to avoid rescreening at the airport of entry. Security risk assessments are required at all last point of departure airports, with equipment donations authorized to mitigate security vulnerabilities. The threat of shoulder-fired missiles to civilian aircraft remains a significant concern for aviation security specialists and policymakers, highlighted by the attempted downing of a chartered Israeli airliner in Mombasa in November 2002. The downing of a chartered Israeli airliner in Mombasa, Kenya in 2002 raised concerns about the threat of MANPADS to civilian aircraft. Efforts to reduce worldwide stockpiles of these missiles have been successful, but there are still worries about terrorist organizations obtaining them. Conflicts in Libya and Syria have heightened these concerns, leading to initiatives like the Counter-MANPADS program by the DHS to address the threat. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is testing systems to protect airliners from heat-seeking missiles, but high costs prevent deployment in the US. MANPADS pose a security threat to civil aviation overseas, and any attack in the US could impact the airline industry. Efforts to reduce vulnerabilities to MANPADS attacks face challenges due to limited resources and large vulnerable areas. Terrorist attempts to exploit these vulnerabilities could escalate the threat to national security. The operation of civilian unmanned aerial systems (UASs) in domestic airspace raises security concerns. The operation of civilian unmanned aerial systems (UASs) in domestic airspace raises security risks, including the potential for terrorists to use drones for attacks. Concerns also include the possibility of drones being targeted by terrorists or cybercriminals for data interception or disruption of command signals. Terrorists could use drones for small-scale attacks with explosives or as platforms for chemical, biological, or radiological attacks. An FBI-disrupted terrorist plot in 2011 involving model aircraft heightened concerns about potential drone attacks. The use of drones, including weaponized drones, by IS has renewed fears of potential terrorist attacks. Reports of drones flying near airports, restricted airspace, and sensitive locations have raised security concerns. The payload capacities of drones limit conventional explosive damage, but the threat of chemical, biological, or radiological attacks is more serious. FAA regulations require TSA to address these security risks. FAA regulations require TSA to conduct threat assessments of commercial UAS operators, but not recreational users. Law enforcement may lack training to respond to unlawful UAS operations. Technology like tracking mechanisms and \"geo-fencing\" can help manage security threats from unmanned aircraft. Unmanned aircraft can pose security risks but also have potential for homeland security operations, such as CBP border surveillance. The CBP employs a fleet of nine modified Predator UASs for border surveillance. State and local governments are interested in using UASs for various missions. Some agencies have acquired drones through federal grant programs and have FAA authorizations to fly them. However, many agencies are waiting for more specific guidance from the FAA on operating public-use unmanned aircraft in domestic airspace. The FAA is addressing legal issues related to privacy concerns with the use of drones for domestic surveillance. Congress is considering measures to require warrants for drone use, with exceptions for border patrols and terrorist threat investigations. The FAA is directed to establish a pilot program to detect and mitigate unmanned aircraft near critical infrastructure and develop an air traffic management system for small UASs to address safety and security threats. The FAA is urged to address safety concerns related to cybersecurity of government-owned air traffic control systems and certified aircraft systems. GAO recommends developing a comprehensive cybersecurity threat model, clarifying roles and responsibilities, improving security controls, and incorporating NIST guidance. Legislation mandates a strategic framework to reduce cybersecurity risks in the national airspace system and civilian aviation. The FAA is urged to address safety concerns related to cybersecurity of government-owned air traffic control systems and certified aircraft systems. Legislation mandates a strategic framework for reducing cybersecurity risks to the national airspace system, civilian aviation, and FAA information systems, including assessing costs, developing a threat model, and implementing security guidance. Passenger rail systems in the United States are vulnerable to terrorist attacks, with subway systems carrying significantly more passengers daily than airlines. Increased security concerns around air travel have raised worries about potential terrorist attacks on transit or passenger rail systems. Congress faces the challenge of balancing rail passenger security with efficient transit operations and other federal priorities. Due to the impracticality of screening all rail passengers like airline passengers, transit security measures focus on managing attack consequences. Steps have been taken to assess vulnerabilities, plan for emergencies, and reduce risks and consequences of potential attacks on transit systems. Security measures for transit systems include vulnerability assessments, emergency planning, training of personnel, increasing security personnel, installing video surveillance, and conducting random inspections. Securing bus passengers is more challenging than rail passengers due to the large number of buses. TSA oversees security in surface transportation, with transit and rail operators and local law enforcement agencies providing security. The TSA's role in overseeing surface transportation security includes coordination, intelligence sharing, training, and assistance. The 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 authorized $3.5 billion for grants for public transportation security and required high-risk targets to have approved security plans by DHS. In 2010, TSA completed a national threat assessment for transit and passenger rail, establishing goals for a secure transportation system. TSA inspectors assess transit systems to increase resilience, expand deterrence activities, and engage the public in the counterterrorism mission. Security inspectors assess transit systems through the BASE program and I-STEP. The House Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Transportation Security discussed the increase in inspectors from 175 to 404 between FY2008 and FY2011. Issues raised included the lack of surface transportation expertise among inspectors and the challenges of their management by airport-based federal security directors. The number of surface inspectors decreased to 260 in FY2016, reflecting a reduction in VIPR inspectors and focusing efforts on risk. GAO reported inconsistencies in reporting rail security incidents and poor data on incidents. TSA lacked guidance for inspectors and a systematic process for collecting feedback from stakeholders. DHS provides grants for security improvements in public transit. The Transit Security Grant Program, funded by DHS, has seen an 84% decline in funding since 2009. GAO identified potential duplication among security grant programs, including public transportation security grants. The Obama Administration proposed consolidating these programs from FY2013 to FY2016, but Congress did not support the proposal. Congress directed TSA to ensure security for all passenger transportation providers in P.L. 114-50. In P.L. 114-50, Congress directed TSA to ensure that all passenger transportation providers with high-risk facilities have plans to respond to security incidents. The majority of disaster assistance from FEMA is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is annually appropriated by Congress to fund recovery projects and create a reserve for emergencies and disasters. Normal appropriations have often not adequately funded the DRF, leading to reliance on emergency supplemental appropriations. The number and costs of disasters have been increasing over the last two decades. The upward trend in federal disaster costs over the last two decades has led to discussions on controlling spending. The Budget Control Act of 2011 introduced provisions for disaster relief spending, including adjustments for major disasters and emergency spending. The proportion of DRF funding in annual appropriations has increased since the BCA's passage. The Budget Control Act of 2011 has led to an increase in annual appropriations for disaster relief funding. Emergency funding for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) has only been provided once since FY2012, in response to Hurricane Sandy. Challenges remain in reducing emergency designations for disaster relief and calculating allowable adjustments for major disasters. The declining budgetary exemption for disaster costs may lead Congress to decide on emergency funding for the DRF after less catastrophic disasters. The federal government's disaster relief funding has been a congressional concern, with debates on justifying expenditures and reducing costs. Congress may need to decide on using emergency funding or adjusting the allowable calculation for major disasters to reduce the need for emergency funds. The allowable adjustment expires in FY2022, prompting Congress to assess its utility and impact on federal disaster assistance. In 2000, Congress established the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFG) to provide grants for firefighting equipment and training. The Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) program was established in 2003 to support firefighter staffing. In the 115th Congress, debate over firefighter assistance programs, such as AFG and SAFER grants, will focus on funding levels and reauthorization. Supporters argue for maintaining or increasing federal grant support due to inadequate state and local budgets, while others question the appropriateness of federal funding for local firefighting. Authorization for AFG and SAFER expires on September 30, 2017, prompting potential reauthorization legislation in the 115th Congress. The 115th Congress may consider reauthorization legislation for firefighter assistance programs, with a historical debate over funding distribution between different types of departments. The issue revolves around the effectiveness of grants in protecting public health and safety against fire hazards. Emergency communications systems play a crucial role in supporting first responders and disseminating alerts to residents in danger. The 115th Congress is likely to oversee federal programs supporting emergency communications systems, including investments in IP-enabled infrastructure. Notable examples include interoperable public safety networks, digital alerts, and Next Generation 9-1-1 networks. Key federal programs include First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet), Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS), and National 9-1-1 Program. The 115th Congress oversees federal programs supporting emergency communications systems, including investments in IP-enabled infrastructure such as interoperable public safety networks, digital alerts, and Next Generation 9-1-1 networks. Key programs include FirstNet, IPAWS, and the National 9-1-1 Program, which focus on improving emergency communication infrastructure. Coordination of these programs is guided by the DHS National Emergency Communications Plan. The DHS Office of Emergency Communications (OEC) is developing the Nationwide Communications Baseline Assessment (NCBA) to evaluate the nation's ability to communicate during various emergencies. The National Emergency Communications Plan aims to converge emergency communication platforms and coordinate across different agencies for incident response, alerts, public information exchange, and assistance requests. The top priorities for the plan in the next three to five years include identifying and prioritizing investments in communication capabilities. The priorities for the plan in the next three to five years include identifying and prioritizing areas for improvement in emergency responders' narrowband networks, facilitating the adoption of broadband technologies, and enhancing coordination among stakeholders in the emergency response community. The Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 aims to provide flood insurance to high-risk properties and reduce flood risk through management standards. Managed by FEMA, the NFIP has over five million policies in force, covering $1.2 trillion. The program saves an estimated $1.87 billion annually in flood losses. Floods are the most common natural disaster in the U.S., with all fifty states experiencing flood events. The U.S. and all fifty states have experienced flood events, with flood losses in 2016 totaling $17 billion. Congress made amendments to BW-12 but did not extend NFIP's authorization in HFIAA-14. NFIP does not have a comprehensive expiration provision, and unless reauthorized by Congress, new flood insurance contracts will expire on September 30, 2017. The NFIP's authority to borrow funds from the Treasury will be reduced to $1.5 billion, and the authorization for the flood hazard mapping program will expire. Congress may consider issues such as NFIP debt, affordability, and the role of private insurance in the program's reauthorization. FEMA was authorized to borrow up to $30.425 billion from the Treasury to operate the NFIP. The NFIP borrowed heavily from the U.S. Treasury after the 2005 hurricane season and Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Congress increased the borrowing limit to $30.425 billion and authorized a reserve fund assessment to cover future claim and debt expenses. Despite additional sources of income, the NFIP borrowed more in January 2017. As of March 31, 2017, the NFIP owed $24.6 billion in debt to the U.S. Treasury, with limited borrowing authority remaining. Congress may consider forgiving part of the debt or exploring additional funding sources. The NFIP's repayment of debt relies on premium revenues and payments from the Reserve Fund. The NFIP aims to provide flood insurance in flood-prone areas to property owners who cannot obtain it elsewhere and reduce government costs after floods. Congress is concerned about the affordability of flood insurance premiums and the balance between actuarial soundness and other goals of the NFIP. FEMA was required to commission a study on participation and affordability, leading to the development of a Draft Affordability Framework. The deadline for FEMA to submit the Framework based on the affordability study is September 10, 2017. Congress may consider defining 'affordability' and the role of the private insurance industry in the reauthorization of the NFIP. Private companies handle the day-to-day operations of the NFIP, authorized by statute and regulation. FEMA has established two different arrangements with private industry. The NFIP has two arrangements with private industry: the Direct Servicing Agent (DSA) and the Write-Your-Own (WYO) Program. The DSA acts as a contractor for individuals buying flood insurance from NFIP, while the WYO Program allows private insurance companies to write and service policies. The NFIP retains the financial risk for claims under both programs. Over 70 companies participate in the WYO Program, selling 86% of NFIP policies. Some private insurers are interested in offering primary flood insurance, raising issues for Congress to consider. The NFIP faces challenges in maintaining funding for flood mapping and insurance affordability. Private insurers entering the market raise concerns about cherry-picking lower-risk policies. Congress must address how private companies can contribute to mapping costs and prevent adverse selection. FEMA has important statutes like the Stafford Act, HSA 2002, and NFIA that may need reauthorization. The NFIA has authorities expiring in the 115th Congress, while revisions to the Stafford Act and HSA 2002 may also be considered. The 115th Congress could consider revisions to the Stafford Act and HSA 2002, as seen in past Congresses with bills like H.R. 1471. Legislative action may be prompted by future incidents like Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina, raising concerns about FEMA's authorization. The 115th Congress may consider revising FEMA's authorization through legislative action, potentially limiting or expanding federal disaster assistance. This could include reauthorizing the PDM program, revising the Administrator's authorities in homeland security, or appropriating funds for FEMA administration. The United States faces threats from natural disasters and terrorism. The United States faces threats from natural disasters, terrorism, and man-made disasters like the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The nation strategically prioritizes and allocates resources to prepare for hazards, guided by the Post-Katrina Emergency Reform Act of 2006. This Act requires the creation of a national preparedness goal and system to prevent, respond to, recover from, and mitigate disasters. Policy Directive 8: National Preparedness (PPD-8) was issued by President Barack Obama on March 30, 2011, rescinding the previous Homeland Security Presidential Directive 8 (HSPD-8) by President George W. Bush. PPD-8 establishes the National Preparedness System (NPS) with strategic component policies, national planning frameworks, and federal interagency operational plans to prepare the nation for all hazards. It identifies core capabilities necessary for achieving the nation's desired level of preparedness for both federal and nonfederal partners. The National Preparedness System (NPS) includes annual National Preparedness Reports that assess progress towards national preparedness objectives using the Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (THIRA) process. The NPS influences budget decisions, responsibilities, and policy objectives for disaster preparedness at federal, state, and local levels. The 115th Congress may oversee the NPS and the Administration has the discretion to modify the overarching guidance of PPD-8. Congress may monitor the NPS on various factors. Congress may oversee the National Preparedness System (NPS) to ensure it aligns with congressional objectives outlined in the PKEMRA statute. If the NPS does not meet these objectives, Congress could amend the statute to adjust the President's discretion in creating the NPS. The 115th Congress may adjust the President's discretion in creating the National Preparedness System by assigning preparedness responsibilities to federal agencies through authorizing legislation. National health security involves being prepared for incidents with health consequences, with public health emergency management laws expanding after the 2001 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The nation's readiness for public health emergencies has shown improvements since the 2001 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. However, there are persistent gaps in response plans, technology for threat assessment, availability of medical countermeasures, distribution capabilities, medical system capacity, and funding for response costs. The federal government, private sector, and state and local governments play robust roles in health security efforts. The federal government, private sector, and state and local governments collaborate in health security efforts. While the Stafford Act provides assistance for public health emergency response activities, there is no federal program to cover uninsured or uncompensated healthcare costs post-disaster. This lack of coverage may pressure healthcare providers to deliver care without clear reimbursement sources during mass casualty incidents. The HHS Secretary has authority for a Public Health Emergency Fund (PHEF), but no funds are currently available. Congress and the President have provided supplemental appropriations for disaster-related health care costs in the past, including incidents like Hurricane Katrina and the Zika virus outbreak. Policymakers are considering dedicated funding approaches for public health emergencies. The Obama administration proposed $110 million for the Public Health Emergency Fund (PHEF) in FY2016. Legislative proposals in the 114th Congress included various approaches to funding public health emergency response, but none were adopted. Cyberattacks pose risks to the U.S. economy and political system through disruption of economic activity and compromise of critical infrastructure. Cyberattacks targeting public and private sector data have become a significant concern for national security and the economy in the United States. Developing effective cybersecurity policies is a complex challenge for policymakers due to the technical nature of the issue and its impact on homeland security. The section provides an overview of the federal government's role in cybersecurity, including defining cybersecurity, securing networks and critical infrastructure, public-private sector collaboration, response to cyber incidents, and specific technologies in the policy debate. Examples from the transportation security sector are also discussed. The section closes with examples from the transportation security sector illustrating the importance of cybersecurity in maintaining stable operating environments. The United States government does not have a single definition for cybersecurity, but the Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity defines it as the process of protecting information and information systems to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Information security involves ensuring confidentiality, integrity, availability, and authentication of data stored, processed, and transmitted by IT systems. Cyberattacks can compromise these aspects, such as data breaches compromising confidentiality, malware compromising integrity, and denial of service attacks compromising availability. The Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) establishes roles and responsibilities for federal government computer network security. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) oversees agency adoption of cybersecurity practices, while NIST develops mandatory standards and guidance on security practices. DHS is responsible for overseeing agency adoption of cybersecurity measures. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) oversees agency adoption of cybersecurity programs, provides tools to protect agency networks, and coordinates government-wide efforts on federal cybersecurity. Inspectors General evaluate agency cybersecurity programs annually and provide recommendations for improvement. Agency heads are ultimately responsible for managing risks within their own agencies, with cybersecurity responsibilities often delegated to a chief information security officer. Federal agencies rely on third-party companies for developing and maintaining hardware and software, similar to industry practices. In Congress, oversight is exercised over federal agency management, including cybersecurity operations. Committees hold hearings following security incidents, and cybersecurity efforts are considered during the drafting of annual appropriations bills. Information technology modernization is a growing topic, with federal agencies spending over $80 billion annually on IT. In the 114th Congress, bills were passed to grant agencies a dedicated fund for technology modernization to reduce costs of securing and maintaining older technology. The national policy on critical infrastructure security aims to mitigate cybersecurity risks and threats from various actors, including nation-states, criminal organizations, and individuals. Attacks target entities for reasons such as stealing trade secrets or customer information. The government invests in modernization to reduce costs of securing older technology with security vulnerabilities. The government encourages owners and operators of critical infrastructure to adopt cybersecurity practices to manage cyber risks. The \"NIST Cybersecurity Framework\" provides a structure for this purpose. DHS leads in providing resources and facilitating information sharing on cyber threats among companies and federal agencies. DHS offers tools and technical assistance to the private sector for understanding and mitigating cyber risks. Each critical infrastructure sector has a sector-specific agency responsible for coordinating security efforts. Some agencies have developed cybersecurity programs, while others rely on partnerships for cybersecurity posture. The size and resources of the agency determine its ability to engage with the sector on cybersecurity. Cybersecurity for critical infrastructure is influenced by agency size, responsibilities, and executive prioritization. Owners and operators must assess risks and implement policies to reduce them, with support from IT vendors and industry associations. Policy options, including the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, are being reviewed for improvement. Debate continues on whether the Framework should be mandatory for industry adoption. Debate continues on whether cybersecurity regulations should be mandatory for critical infrastructure, with incentives like grants and tax credits being considered. Some experts suggest basing legislation on desired effects rather than specific technology regulations. Responsibilities for cybersecurity are not solely with the federal government but also with private firms and public utilities. The Obama Administration's cybersecurity policy emphasizes a shared responsibility between the government, private sector, and individuals to ensure proper cybersecurity strategies. The government can either regulate industry directly or collaborate with industry and academia to develop effective practices. The government can regulate industry directly or collaborate with industry and academia to develop effective cybersecurity strategies. Industry serves as the innovator in the shared responsibility model, contributing products and new thinking to the marketplace and national policy debate. In the wake of a cyber incident, having an established response plan is crucial. In the event of a cyber incident, having an established response plan is crucial. Presidential Policy Directive 41 (PPD-41) outlines key principles for cyber response, emphasizing shared responsibility among victims, private sector, and government. Response must be risk-based, respect affected entities, and enable restoration and recovery. Concurrent lines of effort will be led by the FBI for \"threat response activities.\" The government has concurrent lines of effort for cyber incident response. The FBI leads \"threat response activities\" to track down hackers, while DHS leads \"asset response activities\" to help victims. The National Cyber Incident Response Plan (NCIRP) was adopted following PPD-41, using a core capability approach and a Cyber Unified Coordination Group to address specific incidents. The National Cyber Incident Response Plan (NCIRP) is similar to a multi-agency group activated by the government in response to natural disasters. However, lacking specific responses or options, it may not have a deterrent effect on adversaries. Technological developments like encryption, automation, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things present challenges and opportunities for homeland cybersecurity. Encryption, used for centuries to ensure communication confidentiality, is now also deployed in the information age for security purposes. Encryption is a process that transforms information into an unreadable form to protect it from unauthorized access. It requires the original information (plaintext) and a key to produce ciphertext, which can be decrypted back to plaintext using the key. Encryption is crucial for safeguarding intellectual property, financial transactions, and critical infrastructure in today's cyberspace. Encryption is essential for data security, but it cannot be applied while data is being created or edited. Systems using encryption for integrity may require a \"signed command\" for operation. Encryption is crucial for data security and can be verified using encryption methods. Changes outside of the encryption method will trigger an error, alerting users to tampering. Encryption serves as a mitigating strategy against cyberattacks, providing confidentiality, availability, and integrity. It is an effective way to secure information. Encryption is essential for data security, providing confidentiality, availability, and integrity. Ransomware is a form of malware that encrypts a user's hard drive, making data unreadable without the decryption key. Automation in cybersecurity, like the government's program for sharing cyber threat indicators, can improve security by facilitating information sharing and mitigation actions. Cloud computing allows for constant, on-demand access to shared computing resources over a network. Migrating to a cloud architecture can free up company resources and provide dedicated security teams for data integrity. However, reliance on the public Internet exposes data to potential risks from cloud service hosts and internet service providers. The Internet of Things (IOT) devices pose security concerns as they can be targets for attacks and also serve as launch points for other attacks. These devices have the ability to control physical aspects through digital means, such as reporting power consumption to utilities. However, poorly secured IOT devices can threaten other devices on the network and the Internet as a whole. IOT devices are vulnerable to attacks and can be used as launch points for further attacks. Policy decisions on regulating evolving technologies are complex, with potential unintended consequences like product lock-in, increased costs, and reduced innovation. Government inaction may result in private sector control or loss of leadership in technology development to other countries with differing security interests. There is a growing concern over cybersecurity threats to aircraft, air traffic control systems, and airports. TSA's approach to cybersecurity involves voluntary collaboration with industry, including the formation of the Transportation Systems Sector Cybersecurity Working Group in 2012. Additionally, TSA launched the Air Domain Intelligence Integration Center in 2014 to analyze cyber threats to civil aviation. FAA has also developed a software assurance policy for all FAA-owned and controlled information systems in response to cybersecurity threats. The FAA has implemented a software assurance policy for its information systems, but lacks a formal cybersecurity threat model. Despite efforts to protect air traffic control systems, challenges remain in mitigating cyber threats, especially with the NextGen modernization initiative. TSA and the FBI have warned about the vulnerability of aircraft systems to unauthorized access and advised airlines to watch for tampering or network intrusions. In June 2015, the Coast Guard released a cyberstrategy document outlining plans to address cybersecurity in the maritime environment. The strategy includes developing guidance for vessels and ports to address cybervulnerabilities, incorporating cybersecurity into enforcement programs, and providing cybersecurity training for mariner licensing and port security officer qualifications. The Coast Guard will also modify an existing port risk assessment tool to include cybersecurity considerations. The Coast Guard plans to modify the existing port risk assessment tool, MSRAM, to include cyber risks. Legislation in the 114th Congress aimed to promote cybersecurity risk sharing among maritime stakeholders and require DHS to report on U.S. maritime cyber threats. The extent of department management involvement in departmental components remains an unresolved debate. The establishment of the Department of Homeland Security led to debates over the management structure of its components. Some experts favored a strong management function, while others preferred a smaller one. However, it became evident that a small management cadre was insufficient for effective coordination and oversight. Efforts were made to establish a unified identity and operational approach under the \"One DHS\" initiative led by various secretaries. Efforts to reform the Department of Homeland Security's way of doing business continued under secretaries Michael Chertoff, Janet Napolitano, and Jeh Johnson. Johnson issued a memorandum titled \"Strengthening Departmental Unity of Effort\" in 2014, outlining new processes for strategy development, planning, and joint requirements identification. This initiative aimed to promote greater coordination, centralized decision-making, strategic budgeting, and a department-wide approach to acquisition strategy. The Department of Homeland Security is focusing on a strategic approach to promote efficiency in operations and acquisitions. This includes bringing senior leaders together in two groups to discuss policy, strategy, and joint operations. The goal is to enhance coordination, decision-making, and budgeting across the department. The Department of Homeland Security is focusing on strategic reforms in acquisition, operational planning, and joint operations. Efforts include improving departmental management processes, developing a stronger strategy and analytic capability, and enhancing coordination of cross-component operations. Bipartisan support for these reforms has been evident in congressional hearings. The Department of Homeland Security has made progress in reorganizations, including establishing a Cost Analysis Division and developing a Southern Border and Approaches Campaign Plan. The FY2017 National Defense Authorization Act provided statutory authority for Unity of Effort initiatives, such as authorizing joint task forces and renaming the Office of Policy to the Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans. The Department of Homeland Security has made progress in reorganizations, including renaming the Office of Policy to the Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans. Gen. John Kelly and some Senators praised the progress of management reforms during his confirmation hearing. Congress may debate the appropriate role of departmental level management at DHS and the progress of reforms. The Department of Homeland Security is considering reorganizing current organizations and missions, potentially merging the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) and the Office of Health Affairs (OHA) into a new office focused on coordinating chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosives (CBRNE) efforts. This proposed reorganization was reflected in the FY2017 budget request. The Department of Homeland Security is considering restructuring CBRNE activities by merging DNDO and OHA into a new office. The House passed a bill for this reorganization, but the Senate did not. Supporters believe consolidation would improve coordination, while critics question the cost and compatibility of agency cultures and missions. When DHS was established in 2003, components of other agencies were brought together over a matter of months, in the midst of ongoing budget cycles. Congress and the Administration continued to provide resources through existing account structures when possible. In H.Rept. 113-481, the House Appropriations Committee emphasized the need for increased visibility and comparability in appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security. The Committee directed the DHS Office of the Chief Financial Officer to develop a common appropriation structure for the President's fiscal year 2017 budget request. This new structure would have four categories of appropriations: Operations and Support; Procurement, Construction and Improvement; Research and Development. The DHS appropriations request for FY2017 categorized its appropriations into Operations and Support, Procurement, Construction, and Improvement, Research and Development, and Federal Assistance. The Coast Guard was an exception as it was migrating its financial information to a new system. DHS proposed realigning its Programs, Project, and Activities (PPA) structure, possibly aligning PPAs into a mission-based hierarchy. The Senate Appropriations Committee did not use the new structure in its recommendations, while the House Appropriations Committee did. Sec. 130 of the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2017 provided specific authority for DHS to obligate resources under the continuing resolution. The Trump Administration's supplemental appropriations request for FY2017 indicated that DHS was organizing funding under a revised CAS. Division F of P.L. 115-31 provided appropriations under the new CAS for all DHS components except the U.S. Coast Guard. Congress will assess the transparency and detail of the new PPA structure and consider integrating the Coast Guard into the new funding structures in the future. The Department of Homeland Security's headquarters occupies over 7 million square feet in 50 locations in the DC area due to its rapid assembly from 22 federal agencies. This fragmentation leads to inefficiencies and costs. To address this, a $3.4 billion plan was approved to create a new unified headquarters at St. Elizabeths in Anacostia. The Department of Homeland Security approved a $3.4 billion plan to create a new unified headquarters at St. Elizabeths in Anacostia. The project, funded by DHS and GSA, has received over $2.5 billion in appropriations. Phase 1A, a new Coast Guard headquarters facility, has been completed. A revised construction schedule projects completion in FY2026 at a cost of $4.5 billion, criticized by GAO for not following capital decision-making practices. The DHS and GSA revised their plans for a new unified headquarters at St. Elizabeths, with a new completion date set for FY2021 and a cost of $3.7 billion. Despite cost increases, the project is expected to save over $430 million compared to leasing over 30 years. Discussions in Congress will focus on the project's revisions, resource competition within DHS and GSA budgets, and the use of available facilities at the campus. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and General Services Administration (GSA) are revising plans for a new unified headquarters at St. Elizabeths, with a completion date set for FY2021 and a cost of $3.7 billion. Congress will focus on resource competition within DHS and GSA budgets. The Chief Human Capital Officer (CHCO) at DHS plays a critical role in supporting the department's Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2014-2018. In the 115th Congress, oversight of personnel issues at DHS includes matters related to the CHCO position, human capital strategy, organizational culture, and collaboration. Hearings on DHS appropriations or management may review these issues. Public Service Recognition Week could be an opportunity for Congress to annually review human resource management at the department. Title XIII, Sec. 1302 of P.L. 107-296 authorizes the position of CHCO in Cabinet departments and selected independent agencies. The 114th Congress amended Section 704 of the Homeland Security Act to codify the responsibilities of the CHCO at DHS. Title XIX, Section 1904 of P.L. 114-328 specifies the Chief Human Capital Officer's duties. Fiscal Year 2017 law designates the Chief Human Capital Officer to report to the Under Secretary for Management. The CHCO has 10 responsibilities, including developing workforce planning policies, performance measures, and recruitment strategies for the Department. The Chief Human Capital Officer is responsible for managing human capital programs, developing career paths, overseeing employee resources, implementing initiatives, eliminating unnecessary policies, providing input on hiring and performance, and ensuring all employees are educated on programs. The Chief Human Capital Officer oversees human capital programs, career development, employee resources, and initiatives. Each DHS component must develop a five-year workforce strategy to support department goals. The DHS Secretary must report on workforce strategies to Congress within 90 days of the annual budget submission. Congress may review the CHCO's statutory responsibilities and program implementation. The Chief Human Capital Officer at DHS is responsible for human capital planning, which involves designing policies and programs to achieve the agency's strategic goals. Implementing the strategic human capital plan is crucial for building a high-performing workforce and driving continuous improvement within the agency. The DHS is currently planning recruitment strategies following a government-wide hiring freeze. President Trump's directives aim to hire 5,000 border patrol officers for CBP and 10,000 Immigration Officers for ICE. In September 2016, DHS CHCO Angela Bailey mentioned the \"DHS Strategic Outreach and Recruitment (SOAR) Plan\" focused on diverse workforce recruitment. Mission-critical occupations include TSA officers, CBP officers, FEMA Emergency Management personnel, analysts, and accountants. Congress may examine hiring freeze impacts, exemptions, Executive Order directives on ICE and CBP hiring, and recruitment strategies for critical roles. Millennials interested in federal employment, especially with DHS, may find the recruitment strategy relevant. Congress conducted oversight on millennials and federal employment in 2016, including a hearing by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Links to HRM policy documents on the OCHCO webpage could aid oversight. Senator Lankford and Senator Heitkamp discussed the need to recruit a new generation of federal employees, specifically targeting millennials. Angela Bailey, CHCO at DHS, highlighted that millennials make up 21% of the DHS workforce. Millennials represent 21% of the DHS workforce, with over 50% identifying as diverse, and 36% being women. Younger millennials under 30 make up 9% of the workforce, with 59% identifying as diverse and 42% being women. They are employed in mission-critical roles across the department, including TSA, CBP, and FEMA. The CHCO emphasized the acceptance of in-and-out government careers for recruitment. The DHS is open to in-and-out government careers for millennials, aiming to provide them with valuable experience before transitioning to the private sector. The DHS Excellence in Leadership (DEL) organization promotes professional development and community engagement. Congress may review HRM policies for millennials, including recruitment strategies. The DHS has HRM policies and programs for millennials, focusing on recruitment, retention rates, and demographics. In 2006, Secretary Chertoff directed the establishment of a Culture Task Force to improve the department's culture. The Task Force report issued in 2007 included recommendations for creating an empowering and mission-focused environment. The Culture Task Force report issued in January 2007 recommended implementing homeland security management and leadership models, creating leadership-empowered teamwork, and fostering a \"Blended Culture\" within the Department of Homeland Security. The Culture Task Force report in 2007 recommended adopting two models for DHS management: a closed-loop model for strategic accountabilities and a leadership and training model. DHS should leverage its Components' unique cultures to enhance organizational capacities. In 2016, DHS officials prioritized employee engagement and morale in a fact sheet titled \"Changing the Culture at DHS.\" DHS officials have prioritized employee engagement and morale, creating an engagement-supportive culture. The document outlines policies and action steps in five areas: involvement of an Employee Engagement Steering Committee, recognizing excellence, enhancing communication, increasing leadership accountability, and improving transparency in hiring and promotion. Congress may review the department's initiatives on organizational culture and employee engagement, including the implementation of Culture Task Force Report recommendations and the fact sheet on changing the culture of DHS. Coordination between department strategies on organizational culture can also be examined. The Homeland Security and Defense Business Council released a survey on the Homeland Security Enterprise, focusing on interagency collaboration as a key management practice within DHS. Coordination between department strategies related to organizational culture and the \"Unity of Effort\" initiative, as well as policies on joint duty assignments for employee development, are also areas of interest for analysis. The Employee Engagement Steering Committee (EESC) within DHS plays a central role in coordinating interagency collaboration among department components. Chaired by the Under Secretary for Management, the committee advises DHS leadership on department-wide approaches, shares best practices, and reports on areas for improvement. Testimony from the DHS CHCO highlighted how the committee's input informed a new employee action engagement plan. The Employee Engagement Steering Committee (EESC) at DHS influenced a new employee action engagement plan focusing on selecting and empowering leaders, developing leadership at all levels, and improving communication through various channels. Congress may want to review DHS policies on collaboration and the EESC's operations. They could also request the department to publish the employee engagement action plan and related HRM policies on the OCHCO's webpage."
