Medgar Wiley Evers, born in 1925 in Mississippi, served in World War II before completing his education at Alcorn State University. He married Myrlie Beasley and moved to Mound Bayou, Mississippi after graduation. Medgar Evers worked in Bayou, Mississippi, for Magnolia Mutual Life Insurance Company and established NAACP chapters in the Mississippi Delta. He applied to the University of Mississippi School of Law in 1954 but was denied enrollment. Evers became the first Field Secretary for the Mississippi NAACP chapter and organized voter registration efforts despite facing threats. Despite facing numerous threats against his life, Mr. Evers continued his work with dedication and courage, organizing rallies, building NAACP membership, and educating the public on Civil Rights. His efforts led to a lawsuit against the Jackson, Mississippi public school system, gaining national media attention as a leader in the Civil Rights Movement. Despite being arrested, beaten, and denied due process rights, Mr. Evers persisted in his advocacy for African-American rights in Mississippi through rallies, sit-ins, and protests. Medgar Evers faced threats against his life but continued his Civil Rights work, leading to a lawsuit against the Jackson public school system. He was shot and killed in 1963, leading to the arrest of Byron De La Beckwith, who was acquitted in two trials. Evers was buried with military honors at Arlington National Cemetery. In 1990, Mrs. Evers persuaded Mississippi prosecutors to reopen Medgar Evers' murder case, leading to the conviction and life imprisonment of his killer in 1994. Congress honored Myrlie Evers with the Congressional Gold Medal for her and her husband's contributions to the Civil Rights movement, which ultimately led to the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964. The Congressional Gold Medal was awarded to Myrlie Evers for her and her husband's contributions to the Civil Rights movement. The Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate will arrange for the presentation of a gold medal to Myrlie Evers-Williams for her and her husband's contributions to racial equality. The Secretary of the Treasury will design and strike the medal, which will then be given to the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum for display. The gold medal designed by the Secretary of the Treasury will be given to the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum for display or temporary loan. The Secretary is authorized to create and sell bronze duplicates of the gold medal at a price covering all expenses. The gold medal is considered a national medal and a numismatic item under specific codes."
