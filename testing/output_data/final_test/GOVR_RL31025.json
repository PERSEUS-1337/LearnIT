    "content": "In the United States, 27% of children live in one-parent homes, mostly maintained by the mother. This percentage has doubled since 1970. Research shows that children in one-parent homes are more likely to face academic, emotional, and financial challenges. Efforts are being made by governments to support children in one-parent homes, especially those with low-income noncustodial parents. Efforts by federal, state, and local governments, along with public and private organizations, support programs for noncustodial parents to promote financial and personal responsibility towards their children. These \"fatherhood initiatives\" aim to encourage parental involvement through counseling, training on relationship skills, and employment services for financial support. The programs are gender-neutral and focus on increasing the noncustodial parent's participation in their children's lives. The report provides an overview of the federal government's financial support for fatherhood initiatives, including the Responsible Fatherhood grant program. It includes a legislative history, allowable activities, research on demonstration programs, and the role of child support enforcement agencies. Initiatives aim to promote father-child interaction and work-oriented programs for noncustodial parents, especially those with low incomes. The 1996 welfare reform law established the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, which promotes responsible fatherhood and motherhood. States can use TANF funds to end welfare dependence through employment and marriage, reduce out-of-wedlock pregnancies, and encourage two-parent families. The 1996 welfare reform law allowed states to use TANF funds for fatherhood programs and services promoting two-parent families. Changes were made to the CSE program to include funding for access and visitation programs. Additionally, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 included a grant program for employment services for mothers leaving cash assistance. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 provided funding for Responsible Fatherhood grants and Healthy Marriage Promotion grants, totaling up to $50 million per year for RF grants and up to $100 million per year for HMP grants. 90 organizations were awarded RF grants to operate fatherhood programs, with an additional 13 organizations receiving reentry program grant funding. During the 111th Congress, the Claims Resolution Act of 2010 extended funding for reentry programs for incarcerated and formerly incarcerated fathers. The funding split between programs was altered to $75 million each. Subsequently, 55 organizations received three-year grants for RF programs, with an additional 5 organizations receiving reentry program grants. Funding extensions were provided through appropriations acts after FY2011. A third round of RF grant funding awarded five-year grants to 39 organizations in September 2015. Two organizations dropped out of the recent round of RF grant funding, reducing the total number of participating organizations to 37. Five other organizations received reentry program grant funding. Funding for the RF program was extended through the end of FY2018 by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017. There are various potential federal funding sources for fatherhood programs, including TANF funds and state maintenance of effort funding. The TANF block grant to states is currently funded through FY2018 at $16.5 billion annually. The TANF block grant to states is currently funded at $16.5 billion annually, with a MOE requirement of about $10.4 billion. Due to a reduction in cash welfare caseloads, funds are now available for other purposes. Some states use TANF funds for responsible fatherhood programs to support low-income parents in meeting their children's financial needs. The CSE program was established in 1975 to make noncustodial parents financially responsible for their children. The 1996 welfare reform law mandated states to require noncustodial parents to participate in TANF work activities if they were unable to pay child support for a child receiving TANF benefits. Fatherhood programs aim to strengthen father-child engagement, improve relationships, and enhance employment opportunities for noncustodial fathers. Federal law specifies requirements for the RF grant program. Activities specified by federal law for the RF grant program include promoting marriage, responsible parenting, and economic stability for fathers. This includes marriage preparation programs, parenting skills education, and assistance in improving economic status. Activities to promote responsible fatherhood include improving economic status through job training, employment services, and career-advancing education. A national clearinghouse provides resources to enhance the success of fatherhood programs. Many states, localities, private organizations, and nonprofits also operate fatherhood programs with their own funds, focusing on similar goals. Fatherhood programs emphasize the importance of emotional, physical, psychological, and financial connections between fathers and their children. These programs include parenting education, responsible decision-making, mentoring relationships, and mediation to address barriers to paternal involvement. Fatherhood programs offer various services such as mentoring, mediation, conflict resolution, coping with stress, job training, and developing values in children. These programs aim to support fathers in building strong relationships with their children. The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) awarded over $55 million in grants for fatherhood programs, including New Pathways for Fathers and Families and Responsible Fatherhood Opportunities for Reentry and Mobility (ReFORM). Two grantees dropped out, leaving 37 participating organizations. These grants are for FY2016-FY2020, with funding dependent on appropriations. The grants represent the third round of funding since 2006, offering insight into effective organizational structures and service delivery models. Many organizations, including government agencies, community-based groups, universities, and faith-based organizations, collaborate to support parents in meeting their responsibilities. Research shows that father absence impacts children's outcomes in various areas, regardless of income levels. Fatherhood programs often address child support issues and outcomes. Both advocates and critics of the CSE program agree that parents should be responsible for their children's well-being. Low-income noncustodial parents struggle to meet financial obligations and lack parenting skills. Research is being conducted on fatherhood programs to help men become responsible fathers through employment, life skills, and reconnecting with their children. The Parents' Fair Share (PFS) Demonstration project aimed to increase earnings and child support payments of unemployed noncustodial parents through job training, peer support groups, and other services. However, the final report concluded that the program did not significantly improve employment or earnings. The Parents' Fair Share (PFS) Demonstration project did not significantly increase employment or earnings overall, but it did boost earnings for a subgroup of men characterized as \"less employable.\" Low-income noncustodial fathers face severe barriers to finding jobs, often holding low-wage or temporary positions. Peer support was found to be crucial for these men and became a key aspect of the program. The Parents' Fair Share (PFS) Demonstration project faced challenges in implementing services like skill-building due to providers' lack of experience with disadvantaged men. Difficulty in finding employers willing to hire the men and the need for longer-term participation and job retention services were highlighted as recommendations for future programs. The HHS partnership with the private-sector initiative Partners for Fragile Families focuses on supporting low-income children born outside of marriage by providing employment services, legal assistance for fathers seeking visitation rights, and promoting collaboration between CSE agencies and fatherhood programs. This initiative began with planning grants awarded to 16 sites in 1996, leading to state waivers for 13 demonstration projects in nine states by March 2000. The HHS funded 13 PFF demonstration projects in nine states to help young noncustodial fathers aged 16 to 25 with employment, health, and social services, parenting skills, and child support payments. The projects lasted three years and received $7.1 million of the $9.7 million federal funding budgeted, with an additional $1.4 million spent on project evaluation. The evaluation of the PFF project noted that while it was unique when developed in 1996, by the time it was fully implemented, other fatherhood programs were already in place nationwide. The child support system had also started incorporating more \"father-friendly\" approaches around the same time. This made PFF seem less pioneering than initially conceived. The success of in-hospital paternity establishment initiatives in the mid- to late-1990s led to a decrease in young fathers without established paternity for their children. The Urban Institute conducted evaluations of the PFF demonstration projects, including case studies of selected fathers and an analysis of economic and child support outcomes. Service providers were interviewed, and client data was analyzed before and after the PFF projects. The Urban Institute evaluated the PFF program by analyzing client data matched with wage data. Employment rates for participants remained low and unchanged, with increased quarterly earnings but still poverty-level incomes. Child support orders saw a substantial increase from 14% to 35% of participants. The Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study followed 4,700 children born in 20 large U.S. cities between 1998 and 2000, with parents including 3,600 unmarried couples and 1,100 married couples. Average child support payments for PFF participants were $1,569 in the first year and $2,296 in the second year after enrollment. Parents were interviewed at the child's birth, and at ages one, two, and five. The Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study followed 4,700 children born in 20 large U.S. cities between 1998 and 2000, with parents including 3,600 unmarried couples and 1,100 married couples. Parent interviews were conducted at the child's birth, and at ages one, two, and five, along with in-home assessments at ages three and five. The study aimed to provide information on unwed parents' conditions, capabilities, relationships, and involvement in raising their children. The Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study followed 4,700 children born in 20 large U.S. cities between 1998 and 2000, with parents including 3,600 unmarried couples and 1,100 married couples. The study aimed to provide information on unwed parents' conditions, capabilities, relationships, and involvement in raising their children. A 2007 report found that 16% of participant mothers were married to the father at the time of the five-year interview, while about 40% of parents were still romantically involved at that time. The report also raised questions about the factors influencing unwed parents' relationships, the impact of public policies, and the long-term consequences for parents, children, and society. Fatherhood programs, including education, training, and support services, are recommended for unmarried fathers. These programs help fathers develop parenting skills and maintain positive connections with their children. A nine-year follow-up study funded by NICHD examined the wellbeing of children from unmarried couples. A $17 million grant from NICHD was used to combine telephone surveys, in-home studies, and teacher surveys into one project from 2007 to 2010. Summaries based on data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study have been prepared to highlight research findings on child well-being and the circumstances of unwed parents. The federal OCSE operates grant programs to support research and projects related to child support programs. In FY1999, OCSE provided $2.0 million for Responsible Fatherhood demonstration programs in eight states: California, Colorado, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Hampshire, Washington, and Wisconsin. The projects aimed to improve the employment and earnings of noncustodial parents and increase their involvement in their children's lives. The programs varied in service components and delivery, with OCSE also funding a $500,000 evaluation of the projects. The outcome report on the Responsible Fatherhood demonstration projects found challenges in recruiting and serving low-income noncustodial fathers. Participants found low-paying jobs with limited earnings growth. Issues with access to children and high child support orders were identified. Collaboration with fatherhood programs and routine enforcement activities were recommended. Criminal history was common among program participants. The outcome report on the Responsible Fatherhood demonstration projects highlighted challenges faced by program participants, including criminal history, ongoing substance abuse issues, lack of reliable transportation, and court-ordered visitation arrangements. The report also showed significant increases in employment rates, earnings, and child support compliance among noncustodial parents. Additionally, the National Child Support Noncustodial Parent Employment Demonstration aimed to improve child support payments by noncustodial parents through employment strategies led by CSE agencies. The OCSE required CSPED grantees to be child support agencies managing day-to-day operations. Eight state CSE programs participated in a five-year demonstration from October 2012 to September 2017. Each grantee received $775,000 in Section 1115 demonstration funds, totaling $2.3 million over five years with Federal Financial Participation. Under the CSPED demonstration, grantees received $2.3 million over five years to recruit noncustodial parents for services including child support, employment assistance, parenting education, and case management. Grantees partnered with community service providers and domestic violence consultants to develop a domestic violence plan. OCSE provided guidance on core services but allowed alignment with local policies and procedures. The Institute for Research on Poverty and Mathematica Policy Research are evaluating the CSPED program. Early lessons learned include the need to deploy child support workers, develop services for the target population, promote sustained participant engagement, and invest in strong partnerships. A final report will assess services received, impacts on participants' outcomes, and include a benefit-cost analysis. The National Evaluation of the Responsible Fatherhood, Marriage, and Family Strengthening Grants for Incarcerated and Reentering Fathers and Their Partners (MFS-IP) began in 2006 with government and private organizations receiving grants to support healthy marriages and families affected by incarceration. Thirteen grantees in 12 states implemented activities to assist fathers during and after incarceration, including support for reentry and parenting. The MFS-IP program supports reentering families and communities from prison, provides parenting support, and offers education and employment services during and after incarceration. An evaluation conducted from 2006 to 2014 assessed the effectiveness of the 13 MFS-IP grantees in building healthy relationship skills among families affected by incarceration. Many incarcerated individuals aim to improve their relationships with partners, children, and family members. The MFS-IP program aims to strengthen relationships among families affected by incarceration, including parent-child, officer-inmate, and employer-employee relationships. Research shows that healthy relationships contribute to successful reentry, but there is limited knowledge on improving relationship quality for couples impacted by incarceration. Relationship education focusing on healthy skills could enhance relationship quality during and after incarceration. Skills play a crucial role in relationship quality during incarceration and reentry. Communication and conflict resolution skills can lead to more supportive relationships, improved co-parenting, and increased familial contact, benefiting individuals upon release. HHS has invested in federal evaluations of fatherhood programs to provide valuable information to program operators and policymakers. RF program grants require comprehensive fatherhood programs integrating economic stability, healthy marriage activities, and responsible parenting. Grantees must fully participate in HHS-sponsored activities. According to HHS, 60 RF grants were awarded in September 2011 for three years, extended for an additional year. A 2012 report highlighted the need for more rigorous evaluations in fatherhood programs at the state and local level. Agencies need proper knowledge and tools for meaningful evaluations to accurately represent program outcomes and impacts. In recent years, there has been an increase in fatherhood research and evaluations, with some using an experimental design model. The outcomes and findings aim to provide information on effective programs and strategies for noncustodial parents, especially fathers. RF grants awarded in 2015 require grantees to participate in HHS-sponsored evaluations, focusing on key short- and long-term outcomes. These grants aim to enhance evaluation and program design, with the goal of increasing understanding of effective fatherhood programs among policymakers and others. In the late 1990s, concerns arose about federally funding responsible fatherhood programs leading to unintended consequences for single mothers. The policy debate emphasized the interconnected welfare of fathers, mothers, and children. Research over the past 20 years has highlighted how factors like economic opportunity impact fathers' abilities. The policy debate on responsible fatherhood now recognizes that addressing factors like economic opportunity can strengthen the custodial parent's household. Issues associated with federal support of fatherhood initiatives include promoting father involvement regardless of the relationship with the mother, support for parents with children from multiple partners, policies for incarcerated and recently released parents, and support for counseling and supervised visitation for abusive parents to reconnect with their children. The discussion below examines three issues that will likely impact the success of congressional fatherhood initiatives. The first issue deals with the role of the CSE agency in responsible fatherhood programs, with concerns about noncustodial parents' negative views. The second issue explores father involvement in relation to the child's mother, emphasizing the importance of formal marital relationships for long-term interaction between fathers and children. The CSE program has seen significant improvements in child support payments collected, parent locations, paternities established, and orders established from FY1978 to FY2016. Advocates highlight the indirect benefits of increased personal responsibility and welfare cost-avoidance. Critics argue against the program's effectiveness. Critics of the CSE program argue that despite enforcement tools like license revocation and income withholding, it only collects 20% of child support obligations and payments for 60% of its caseload. Noncustodial parents express a desire for more access to their children, improved relationship skills, and assistance with employment. Many feel the system disregards their financial situation. Noncustodial parents criticize the CSE system for prioritizing financial support over their ability to provide, leading to alienation and devaluation. Some argue that the differences between noncustodial parents and the CSE program may be irreconcilable, suggesting that clear communication of the program's purposes is essential. The CSE program should ensure noncustodial parents understand its purposes, requirements, and rights for modifying child support payments. It is suggested that the program needs to improve cooperation and trust with noncustodial parents, while also reaching out to provide supportive services through partnerships with community-based organizations. The 1996 welfare reform law emphasizes marriage as the foundation of a successful society and essential for promoting children's interests. However, some argue that marriage may not be the best option for all women and children, especially in abusive situations. Caution is advised against incentivizing or coercing marriage, particularly for youths or in response to pregnancy. Some argue that promoting marriage may not be suitable for all women and children, especially in abusive situations. Government programs are sensitive to domestic violence issues and support prevention efforts. Analysts suggest that policies favoring certain family structures may harm nontraditional relationships, emphasizing the need to support fragile families to stay together longer. A single-focus policy can put children in unfavorable situations. Promoting marriage may not be suitable for all families, especially in abusive situations. Analysts suggest that supporting fragile families to stay together longer is important, as unmarried couples are less likely to remain together compared to married parents. Responsible fatherhood programs should include skills on choosing a good partner and maintaining relationships to ensure lifetime involvement of fathers in their children's lives. Fatherhood programs aim for lifelong father involvement in children's lives, regardless of marital status. Some argue that initiatives promoting marriage may conflict with this goal. The 1996 welfare reform included a purpose to encourage two-parent families, sparking debate on whether this meant married couples or any involved parents. In 1999, the Clinton Administration issued guidance on funding for children. The Clinton Administration issued a guide on funding for children and families through the TANF program in late 1999, interpreting two-parent families broadly to include never-married, separated, and divorced parents. Many states classify fatherhood programs and visitation encouragement under TANF purposes. Low-income fathers, like mothers, lack education and training for sustainable jobs due to work requirements on TANF recipients. States are required to have child support officials seek orders from noncustodial parents owing past-due support. Representative Nancy Johnson emphasized the need to assist low-income fathers in finding sustainable employment and providing child support for children on TANF benefits. She highlighted that many of these fathers face similar challenges as mothers on welfare, such as lack of education and work experience. Johnson advocated for a more comprehensive approach to welfare reform to support both working mothers and struggling noncustodial fathers. The federal government should assist noncustodial fathers in meeting their financial and emotional obligations to their children by providing economic stability through job search, training, and education programs. Evaluations show that work-oriented strategies in responsible fatherhood programs lead to increased child support payments. According to a 2015 report on responsible fatherhood programs, fathers praised the job skills they gained but still faced challenges in finding steady employment and meeting financial obligations, with past incarceration being a major obstacle. The report suggests strengthening the economic stability component of these programs and providing assistance in expunging criminal records. Assistance in expunging or sealing criminal records should be included in work-oriented programs for noncustodial parents. In 2014, 30 states and the District of Columbia had programs for noncustodial parents with CSE agency involvement. Georgia, Maryland, and North Dakota operated statewide programs, serving roughly 30,000 parents in 2013. These programs were available to all noncustodial parents struggling with child support payments, not just those in the TANF program. Job training programs are not typically targeted towards noncustodial parents, with only some focusing on low-income individuals. In 2014, 30 states and the District of Columbia had programs for noncustodial parents with CSE agency involvement, including statewide programs in Georgia, Maryland, and North Dakota. These programs aimed to assist noncustodial parents struggling with child support payments, not limited to those in the TANF program. Job training programs for noncustodial parents are limited, with only some focusing on low-income individuals. A Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in November 2014 suggested revisions to CSE program operations, including the proposal to directly fund job services for noncustodial parents at a 66% federal matching rate. Advocates believe that utilizing TANF and MOE funds for work opportunities and supports for noncustodial parents is crucial in addressing the issue. The Obama Administration proposed providing federal matching funds for work-oriented programs for noncustodial parents, but there was concern about overstepping authority. The final rule issued in December 2016 omitted job service-related provisions, despite overwhelming support from states and Members of Congress. The final rule issued in December 2016 omitted job service-related provisions despite support from states and Congress. Further study is needed for federal IV-D reimbursement for job services, which may be implemented later. President Clinton's FY2001 budget included $255 million for a proposed \"Fathers Work/Families Win\" initiative to help low-income noncustodial parents and working families support their children. The initiative would have been administered by the Department of Labor, with $125 million for noncustodial parents and $130 million for low-income families. Neither the House nor the Senate versions of the FY2001 appropriations bill included funding for this initiative. The LHHS funding for the Fathers Work/Families Win proposal was included in the legislation. The proposed Fathers Count Act of 1999 and Child Support Distribution Act of 2000 would have authorized funding for fatherhood initiatives to promote marriage, successful parenting, and father involvement in children's lives. President George W. Bush supported responsible fatherhood initiatives during the 107th Congress (2001-2002). President George W. Bush supported responsible fatherhood initiatives during his presidency, proposing funding for programs to strengthen the role of fathers in families through competitive grants to community and faith-based organizations. This included support for unemployed or low-income fathers, promoting successful parenting, and encouraging healthy marriages. Several bills were introduced to promote fatherhood initiatives, but none were enacted. The programs aimed to promote marriage, successful parenting, and help noncustodial parents find employment. The structure of the fatherhood programs varied, with H.R. 4737 being passed by the House in 2002. President Bush's FY2004 budget proposed funding for responsible fatherhood and healthy marriage initiatives, including increasing funding for the CSE access and visitation grant program. His FY2005 budget proposed competitive grants for faith-based and community organizations to support fathers in avoiding welfare and improving family business affairs. Several bills were introduced to support responsible fatherhood, but none became law. The House passed a welfare reauthorization bill providing $20 million per year for a responsible fatherhood grant program. The Senate Finance Committee approved a version of the bill establishing a $75 million responsible fatherhood program for FY2004-FY2008. The Senate debated H.R. 4 in 2004 but did not complete consideration. President Bush's FY2006 budget proposed $40 million for a fatherhood grant program. The FY2007 budget included $100 million for marriage promotion grants. Several bills aimed at supporting responsible fatherhood were introduced but did not become law. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA) included provisions for responsible fatherhood activities, reauthorized the TANF block grant, and provided funding for competitive grants programs for fatherhood and marriage promotion. The DRA of 2005 allocated funds for responsible fatherhood initiatives, including marriage promotion, parenting activities, economic stability for fathers, and media campaigns to encourage parental involvement in children's lives. The 110th Congress allocated $150 million for marriage promotion and responsible fatherhood programs, with $50 million specifically for responsible fatherhood programs each year from FY2006-FY2010. Bills were introduced to increase funding for responsible fatherhood grants to $100 million per year for FY2008-FY2010. The Obama Administration's FY2011 budget proposed redirecting funds from the HMP and RF Grant Programs to create a $500 million Fatherhood, Marriage, and Families Innovation Fund. This fund would provide three-year competitive grants to states for innovative service models to support family functioning and child well-being. The Fatherhood, Marriage, and Families Innovation Fund proposal, along with three bills on responsible fatherhood, did not receive congressional action. The bills aimed to increase funding for RF grant programs, address domestic violence, and promote responsible fatherhood. The bills proposed expanded procedures for domestic violence, activities promoting responsible fatherhood, grants for healthy family partnerships, and changes to the CSE program. They aimed to address employment for noncustodial parents through employment demonstration projects and transitional jobs programs. The Protecting Adoption and Promoting Responsible Fatherhood Act of 2009 proposed establishing a National Putative Father Registry and educating men and women about their rights and responsibilities regarding paternity. States were required to develop a plan to receive grants for transitional jobs programs and public-private career pathways partnerships to help disadvantaged parents find employment. The Claims Resolution Act of 2010 extended the Responsible Fatherhood grant program through FY2011 with increased funding. The Obama Administration's budget proposed continued funding for fatherhood programs in FY2012 and FY2013, including changes to the purpose clause of the CSE program. The budget proposal aimed to establish access and visitation responsibilities in child support orders, with a cost estimate of $570 million over 10 years. The Julia Carson Responsible Fatherhood and Healthy Families Act of 2011, reintroduced as H.R. 2193, sought to reauthorize the RF grant program with $75 million per year for FY2011-FY2015, but did not receive congressional action. Programs were extended temporarily at FY2012 levels through three laws. The HMP and RF grant programs were funded through three laws, with the Obama Administration proposing continued funding of $150 million each for FY2014 and FY2015. The FY2013 budget proposed $580 million over 10 years for increased access and visitation services, while the FY2014 and FY2015 budgets proposed $448 million over 10 years for the same services. Funding for the HMP and RF grant programs was extended through various appropriations acts, providing $150 million per year divided equally between the programs. The HMP and RF grant programs were funded through various appropriations acts, including P.L. 113-46, P.L. 113-76, P.L. 113-164, P.L. 113-202, P.L. 113-203, and P.L. 113-235, with additional legislation introduced but not acted upon. H.R. 2359 reauthorized $75 million per year for RF programs from FY2014 to FY2018. The Obama Administration proposed $150 million for HMP and RF grant programs in FY2016 and FY2017. Funds were split equally between Healthy Marriage and Responsible Fatherhood activities. $448 million over 10 years was proposed for increased access and visitation services. Appropriations acts provided $150 million per year divided equally between the programs. In FY2016, programs were funded through interim continuing resolutions and full-year funding was provided via P.L. 114-113. For FY2017, programs were funded through two continuing resolutions. Legislation affecting Healthy Marriages and Responsible Fatherhood programs was introduced during the 114th Congress, but none received congressional action. In the 115th Congress, the Healthy Families Act of 2015 was reintroduced, proposing $75 million per year for responsible fatherhood programs for five fiscal years. Legislation was also introduced to prevent HHS from finalizing a proposed rule on child support enforcement programs. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget suggested maintaining funding for Healthy Marriages and Responsible Fatherhood programs at current levels. The Healthy Marriages and Responsible Fatherhood grant programs were extended through FY2018 at current law levels. Legislation reintroduced in the 115th Congress proposed reauthorizing the program through FY2023, but no action has been taken on it yet."
