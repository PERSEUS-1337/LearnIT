    "content": "The \"Kid Friendly TV Programming Act of 2005\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The findings section follows the short title. The Congress finds that exposure to violence on television is correlated with increased acceptance of aggressive attitudes and behavior. Adults who watched more violent programming as children are more likely to commit crimes and use violence against others. Additionally, 10% of violent acts committed by youths can be attributed to their exposure to violence on television. Exposure to violence on television can lead to symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder in children. Watching 2 hours of cartoons a day exposes a child to almost 10,000 violent acts a year. Teenagers who watch television with more sexual content are more likely to initiate sexual intercourse. 72 percent of teenagers believe that sex on television influences the sexual behavior of their peers. The Kaiser Family Foundation reported in 2003 that a high percentage of television shows contain sexual content, especially during prime time. Efforts to limit children's exposure to obscene, indecent, violent, or sexual content on TV have not been successful in protecting them. The majority of American households, around 85 percent, receive TV programming through cable or satellite providers. Within this group, about 95 percent subscribe to basic or expanded basic programs. However, efforts to protect children from harmful TV content have been unsuccessful due to the lack of authority for regulatory agencies to mandate child-friendly programming tiers. Parents require more effective methods to control children's exposure to harmful TV content. SEC. 641. KID-FRIENDLY PROGRAMMING TIER. Within 1 month of the Kid Friendly TV Programming Act of 2005, multichannel video programming distributors must offer a child-friendly tier of at least 15 channels. After 6 months, distributors must provide instructions on how to block unwanted channels. Non-compliance can result in a civil penalty of up to $500,000 per day. The term 'child-friendly tier' refers to channels that do not show inappropriate content for children."
