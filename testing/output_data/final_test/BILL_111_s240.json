    "content": "The \"Ready to Learn Act\" is cited as the short title. It amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to include Title X, which supports voluntary prekindergarten grants. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to eligible States for full day voluntary prekindergarten programs for 4-year-old children to promote school readiness. States must submit an application outlining their plan to provide prekindergarten for every 4-year-old, with the option to subgrant to eligible entities. A State receiving a grant under this title must use the funds to award subgrants to eligible entities, including community-based providers of prekindergarten programs. Eligible entities can be schools, child care entities, Head Start programs, or other community-based providers. A State receiving a grant under this title must use at least 85 percent of the funds for prekindergarten programs serving low-income children and limited English proficient children. Up to 15 percent of the funds can be used for quality investments at the State level. The grant recipient must ensure that each classroom is taught by a teacher with a degree in early childhood education or specialized training, use an appropriate curriculum aligned with state standards, and maintain a teacher-child ratio of 1 to 10 and a group size of 20. After fulfilling requirements, grant funds can be used for serving younger children, increasing salaries, providing additional services, and constructing or renovating facilities for prekindergarten programs. States must also use funds for activities ensuring the health and safety of children. The grant funds can be used to ensure the health and safety of children, provide professional development for teachers and staff, and offer comprehensive services in prekindergarten programs. \"SEC. 10002. ADMINISTRATION.\" The Federal share of a grant under this title is 50 percent of the costs, while the non-Federal share must be provided in cash. The Secretary cannot award a grant unless the State maintains or increases its per-child expenditure for prekindergarten programs. Grant funds should supplement, not replace, other Federal funds. The title is meant to supplement, not replace, other public funds for prekindergarten programs. Grant funds are provided to the Governor for distribution to improve the state's programs. The Secretary must coordinate with Health and Human Services regularly and states must submit annual reports. The Secretary shall receive an annual report on the effectiveness of prekindergarten programs funded under this title. The report will be submitted to Congress and include details on each State's program for prekindergarten education. The report must outline actions taken to provide high-quality prekindergarten education to all 4-year olds. The annual report on prekindergarten programs funded under this title must include measures to achieve full day high-quality prekindergarten for all 4-year olds, efforts to integrate prekindergarten programs with K-12 education, and initiatives to educate parents on their role in early childhood education. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2010 through 2015 is granted for the implementation of this title."
