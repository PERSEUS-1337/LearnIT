States have flexibility in designing their own Medicaid programs within federal guidelines. The federal government reimburses states for Medicaid expenditures based on the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) calculation. The FMAP rate, determined by a formula set in statute, is used to reimburse states for most Medicaid expenditures. Exceptions to the regular FMAP rate exist for certain states, situations, populations, providers, and services. Additionally, the FMAP rate is used for Medicare Part D clawback, child support enforcement collections, TANF contingency funds, CCDF, and foster care and adoption assistance. An enhanced FMAP rate is provided for services and administration under the State Children's Health Insurance Program. The E-FMAP rate is calculated by reducing the state share under the regular FMAP rate by 30%. It compares each state's per capita income to the U.S. per capita income, providing higher reimbursement to states with lower incomes and lower reimbursement to states with higher incomes. The formula ensures that a state with per capita income equal to the U.S. average receives an FMAP rate of 55%. The Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) publishes FMAP rates for upcoming fiscal years in the Federal Register during November, allowing states to adjust to rate changes. FMAP rates are based on state per capita income data from the three most recent calendar years available from the Department of Commerce. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) revises state per capita personal income annually using a three-year average to moderate fluctuations in FMAP rates. Components of personal income include earnings, dividends, interest, rent, and personal current transfer receipts. Comprehensive data revisions occur every few years, leading to upward and downward revisions in income components. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) revises state per capita personal income annually, which can lead to changes in FMAP rates. BEA's definition of personal income differs from that used for tax purposes, with BEA excluding capital gains and including transfer receipts. Factors affecting FMAP rates include the state economy's nature. The FMAP formula for states' rates considers the state economy's ability to respond to economic changes and per capita personal income in relation to the U.S. average. National economic changes impact all states differently based on their economic structure and business sectors. The national economy reflects the sum of all state economies' responses to economic changes. The national economy's decline affects states differently based on their economic structure. States with small declines or growth offset the national decline, resulting in a small annual change in U.S. per capita personal income. State FMAP rates can significantly change due to comparisons with U.S. income levels and revisions in personal income data every four to five years. Broad or selective changes in income definitions can impact FMAP rates. The Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) rates for FY2019 were calculated and published in November 2017. The rates vary among states, with 14 states having the minimum rate of 50.00% and Mississippi having the highest rate of 76.39%. Changes in FMAP rates are expected for 36 states from FY2018 to FY2019, with most changes being less than one percentage point. The FMAP rates for FY2019 show changes for 36 states, with most changes being less than one percentage point. Nine states will experience an FMAP rate increase of more than one percentage point, with Oklahoma having the largest increase of 3.81 percentage points. Oregon is the only state with a decrease of 1.06 percentage points. The District of Columbia's FMAP rate remains at 70% as set in statute since 1998. The FMAP rates for the District of Columbia have been set at 70% since 1998 for Title XIX and XXI of the Social Security Act. Exceptions to the regular FMAP rate have been made for certain states, populations, providers, and services, with additional exceptions added over the years, including those from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In FY2019, Medicaid reimbursement rates vary by state, with the highest FMAP rate at 76.39% in Mississippi. The ACA introduced exceptions for \"newly eligible\" individuals and \"expansion states\" to the regular FMAP rates. The ACA introduced exceptions to the FMAP for various services and populations, leading to an increase in the federal share of Medicaid expenditures. The federal share was 61% in FY2014 and is estimated to have increased to 63% in FY2015 and FY2016, with a projected decrease to 61% by FY2020 as the \"newly eligible\" matching rate phases down to 90%. In FY2019, FMAP rates range from 50% to 76%, with rates decreasing for 13 states, increasing for 23 states, and remaining the same for 15 states. Exceptions to the statutory formula have been added over the years, impacting Medicaid expenditures."
