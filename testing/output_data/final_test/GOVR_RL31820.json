The Salton Sea, located in southern California, is the largest inland water body in the state, formed in 1905 by a levee break allowing water from the Colorado River to flow into the Salton Basin. Interest in its ecological health has increased since 2002 due to proposed water transfers diverting agricultural water from farms in the Imperial Valley. The water transfers from farms in the Imperial Valley to San Diego and the Coachella Valley raised concerns about the impact on the Salton Sea's ecosystem. To address this, California enacted bills allocating $300 million for restoration efforts, secured through the Quantification Settlement Agreement in 2003. This agreement allows for a gradual reduction in California's reliance on the Colorado River. The Quantification Settlement Agreement in 2003 aims to reduce California's reliance on the Colorado River by transferring water from farms to urban areas. It includes measures to protect the Salton Sea's inflows and establish a restoration fund funded by water transfer fees. The agreement also mandates the creation of an advisory committee for restoration activities and a restoration study of the Salton Sea by 2006. The Salton Basin has a history of supporting various water bodies, with the last one, Lake Cahuilla, drying up 400 years ago. The Imperial canal was used to irrigate agricultural fields in the Salton Basin, with water flowing through the New Alamo River into the Imperial Valley. In 1905, spring floods caused water from the Colorado River to break through a levee, forming the Salton Sea as a closed basin with no outlets. The Sea's salinity increased due to evaporation, but water from the Colorado River was later diverted to the Imperial Valley for irrigation, preventing the Sea from completely evaporating. President Coolidge issued Public Water Reserve Orders in 1924 and 1928. In 1924 and 1928, President Coolidge issued Public Water Reserve Orders for the withdrawal of lands around the Salton Sea to manage water drainage. The Sea became increasingly saline due to dissolved salts from the Colorado River, leading to population reductions in freshwater fish species. By 1950, the Sea's salinity was equivalent to the ocean, prompting the transfer of saltwater fish species. Some species thrived, making the Sea a popular destination for sportfishing and tourism. However, changes such as resort area inundation, wildlife habitat loss, and bird and fish die-offs occurred. The decline in recreation and development around the Salton Sea in the 1960s was due to environmental problems such as bird and fish die-offs, health threats from untreated water, and pollution. By the mid-1980s, recreation had dropped by 50%. The current ecosystem faces issues like poor water quality and habitat loss, with water from the New River contributing to the Sea's problems. Water pollution in the Salton Sea has increased due to various sources like sewage treatment plants and agricultural runoff. Selenium and DDE levels in fish and wildlife have been found to be elevated, causing health issues. The Sea provides habitat for various species, but faces challenges like habitat loss and poor water quality. The Salton Sea is a crucial stopover for birds on the Pacific Flyway, hosting a large number of bird species, including threatened and endangered ones. It also supports a significant fish population, mainly tilapia, introduced to control weeds. The ecosystem of the Salton Sea is impacted by habitat loss and water pollution from sources like sewage treatment plants and agricultural runoff. The Salton Sea's ecosystem is influenced by water level, chemical concentration, and evaporation rate. 75% of water comes from agricultural run-off, leading to increasing salinity levels. Approximately 4 million tons of salt enter the Sea annually. High salinity levels, along with toxic substances like selenium, contribute to fish and bird mortality. In the 1990s, there were large-scale mortality events of fish and birds in and around the Salton Sea. Nearly 150,000 eared grebes died in 1992, with some scientists attributing it to high selenium levels in fish, while others blamed disease. In 1994, 20,000 more grebes died, followed by 20,000 American white pelicans and brown pelicans in 1996. Avian mortality was highest in the 1990s compared to other decades, with the death of brown pelicans being particularly significant as they are an endangered species. In the 1990s, there were large-scale mortality events of fish and birds in and around the Salton Sea. The cause of mortality in birds was largely attributed to microbes from contaminated fish. Dead fish had weakened immunity due to high toxin levels and low oxygen. High salinity levels also affected fish populations, with salinity levels beyond 40 ppt leading to limited reproductive success and physiological stress. The Salton Sea is a concern for the mortality of bird and fish species, including federally listed endangered species like the brown pelican and Yuma clapper rail. Other endangered species like the peregrine falcon and threatened species like the bald eagle are occasionally seen at the Sea. The desert pupfish is the only endemic fish species in the area and was listed as endangered in 1986. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued a Biological Opinion for the desert pupfish in 1986. The presence of endangered species in the Salton Sea, such as the desert pupfish, brown pelican, and Yuma clapper rail, has led to conservation efforts by the Salton Sea Authority. A Biological Opinion in 1992 concluded that drain maintenance activities would not harm the desert pupfish population, allowing for limited incidental take. Policymakers argue that the federal government has a responsibility to restore the Sea due to the presence of endangered species. The federal government is obligated to restore the Salton Sea due to the presence of endangered species. Scientists foresaw ecological problems in the 1960s, focusing on salinity levels that would make the Sea uninhabitable. Various entities have proposed restoration plans, primarily targeting salinity control and water level maintenance. Federal efforts were boosted by the Reclamation Projects Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992. The Salton Sea Restoration Act of 1998 authorized $10 million for research to control salinity levels, provide habitat for endangered species, enhance fisheries, and protect recreational values. The Salton Sea Recovery Act of 1998 expanded funding for feasibility studies and economic analyses to restore the Salton Sea. The Salton Sea Restoration Act of 1998 authorized funding for research to control salinity levels, provide habitat for endangered species, enhance fisheries, and protect recreational values. The federal government and the State of California have provided significant funding for restoration and management activities at the Salton Sea, with additional funds expected from water transfer fees in the future. Several federal management and restoration activities are conducted in and around the Salton Sea, with specific studies on biological and hydrological properties. The Salton Sea Authority oversees restoration projects to maintain the Sea as an agricultural drainage reservoir, restore wildlife habitats, promote recreational use, and support economic development. The Authority includes Riverside and Imperial counties, the Coachella Valley Water District, Imperial Irrigation District, and the Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Tribe. The Salton Sea Authority collaborates with federal and state agencies to address the restoration of the Salton Sea, presenting various alternatives for restoration. The process is complex and subject to debate among relevant agencies, with options studied by the Department of the Interior and presented to Congress in 2000. In 2003, the DOI submitted a Salton Sea Status Report with restoration alternatives including engineering feasibility and cost estimates. Various public and private entities have proposed plans to reduce the salinity level of the Sea, such as creating evaporation ponds or dividing it into sections with different salinity levels. Brine resulting from these processes is disposed of away from the Sea in most plans. The Salton Sea restoration plans include constructing a desalinization plant and a causeway to separate the sea into two basins. The estimated cost of the project is $738 million, with proposals ranging from $1.0 billion to $9.0 billion. The Salton Sea restoration plans aim to address the increasing salinity levels in the Sea, which threaten its ecosystem supporting diverse fish and wildlife. The Sea is crucial for migratory birds and other species, serving as one of the few remaining habitats in the region due to the loss of wetlands in California. Scientists emphasize the Sea's regional or national importance for various bird species, highlighting its role in maintaining the environmental health and population of these birds. The value of the Salton Sea can be measured in terms of its potential for recreation, economic development, and agricultural drainage. Some argue that the Sea is destined to evaporate and revert to a desert ecosystem, citing historical trends in the Salton Basin. Critics also raise concerns about increasing salinity levels despite restoration efforts and the high cost and scientific uncertainty of restoration proposals. Critics question the need for federal funds to restore the Salton Sea due to scientific uncertainty and suggest allocating funds to restore naturally occurring wetlands in California instead. The decision on whether to restore the Sea is pending negotiations over water allocation in southern California, with funding and restoration plan issues to be addressed if restoration becomes a priority."
