The Congress recognizes the significant achievements of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, which greatly advanced geographical knowledge of the continent and paved the way for future exploration. President Thomas Jefferson tasked Meriwether Lewis and William Clark with exploring the Missouri River and finding a practical water route to the Pacific Ocean for commerce. The Lewis and Clark Expedition, commissioned by President Jefferson, explored the newly acquired Louisiana Territory. They departed from St. Louis in May 1804, met with American Indians in Nebraska, wintered in North Dakota, crossed the Rocky Mountains, and wintered in Oregon before returning to St. Louis. The Lewis and Clark Expedition returned to St. Louis, Missouri in September 1806 after a 28-month journey covering 8,000 miles and traversing 11 future states. The expedition's journals and maps enhanced knowledge of the western continent and fostered friendly relationships with American Indian nations, representing diplomacy at its best. The Lewis and Clark Expedition, considered the most perfect of its kind in history, paved the way for the United States to become a world power. In commemoration of the bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, the Secretary of the Treasury will mint and issue up to 500,000 $1 coins made of 90% silver and 10% copper. The coins will weigh 26.73 grams, have a diameter of 1.500 inches, and be legal tender. The Secretary can obtain silver from various sources for minting. The design of the coins minted under this Act shall be emblematic of the Lewis and Clark expedition, with inscriptions including the value, year, and various words. The obverse of each coin will feature Meriwether Lewis and William Clark. The Secretary will consider appropriate elements in the design process. The design for the coins minted under this Act, emblematic of the Lewis and Clark expedition, shall incorporate elements from the Jefferson Peace and Friendship Medal presented to Native American Chiefs. The design will be selected by the Secretary in consultation with the Commission of Fine Arts and reviewed by the Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee. SEC. 6. ISSUANCE OF COINS. Coins minted under this Act will be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities at a single United States Mint facility.
