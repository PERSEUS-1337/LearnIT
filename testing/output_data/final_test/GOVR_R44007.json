    "content": "The 114th Congress introduced proposals to address human trafficking, focusing on sex trafficking. The legislation includes amendments to federal criminal law, bail provisions, supervised release limits, wiretapping authorization, and federal forfeiture and restitution laws. Key bills include the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act (H.R. 181, S. 178, H.R. 296), Stop Advertising Victims of Exploitation Act (H.R. 285, S. 572), and Combat Human Trafficking Act (H.R. 1201). The 114th Congress introduced legislation to address human trafficking, focusing on sex trafficking. Key bills include the Combat Human Trafficking Act (H.R. 1201) and other related acts amending federal laws on commercial sex trafficking, the Mann Act, and military sex offender reporting. The proposals aim to clarify legal provisions, such as confirming the coverage of customers of a sex trafficking enterprise and outlawing advertising for such activities. The legislation introduced by the 114th Congress aimed to address human trafficking, specifically focusing on sex trafficking. The proposed amendments to federal laws targeted commercial sex trafficking, the Mann Act, and military sex offender reporting. The legislation sought to clarify legal provisions, including the prohibition of advertising for sex trafficking activities and the imposition of harsh penalties, such as life imprisonment, for offenders. The legislation introduced by the 114th Congress aimed to address human trafficking, specifically focusing on sex trafficking. The proposed amendments targeted commercial sex trafficking, including harsh penalties for offenders. Suggestions were made to expand the law to cover advertisers and customers of sex trafficking schemes. The U.S. Court of Appeals found that the law applied to customers caught in a law enforcement sting trying to purchase the services of child prostitutes. The 114th Congress introduced legislation targeting human trafficking, particularly sex trafficking. Proposed amendments aimed to broaden the law to cover suppliers and purchasers of commercial sex acts. P.L. 114-22 confirmed this by amending \u00a71591(a) to include actions like recruiting, harboring, and patronizing individuals. Additionally, the amendment clarified the \"knowledge of age\" element in \u00a71591(c) for customers of sex trafficking ventures. The government is now absolved of proving knowledge of the victim's age if the defendant had the opportunity to observe the victim. The government is absolved of proving knowledge of the victim's age in cases of commercial sex trafficking, regardless of whether the defendant is a consumer or purveyor, as long as they had the opportunity to observe the victim. Proposed amendments aimed to broaden the law to cover suppliers and purchasers of commercial sex acts. Amending \u00a71591(a)(1) to outlaw knowingly advertising a person for prostitution, with evidence suggesting advertising could already be a crime. Aiding and abetting could be key for prosecution, with liability requiring embracing and contributing to the crime. Knowingly advertising child prostitutes could lead to charges of aiding and abetting sex trafficking. Profiting from such activity could result in charges under \u00a71591. However, \u00a71591 might pose a technical obstacle due to its distinctive features. Section 1591's action elements include recruiting, harboring, transporting, providing, and obtaining, which could be associated with aiding and abetting a prostitution enterprise. While the section does not explicitly outlaw operating a prostitution business, it targets activities leading up to it. Some courts have suggested that operating a prostitution business could be considered aiding and abetting a violation of \u00a71591. Advertising in support of the action elements may qualify as aiding and abetting, while advertising the availability of a prostitute may not. Pringler's involvement in aiding and abetting sex trafficking of a minor is supported by evidence showing his integral role in the criminal venture. He facilitated the prostitution by using the money earned to pay for hotel rooms, buying advertising equipment, driving the women to appointments, and taking photographs for advertisements. The addition of advertising to the commercial sex trafficking offense clarifies the role it plays in aiding and abetting such crimes. The amended sex trafficking offense now includes advertising as a means of recruiting, harboring, or transporting individuals for commercial sex acts. Traffickers can be held liable if they knew or recklessly disregarded the victim's status. Traffickers are liable if they knew of or recklessly disregarded the victim's status. Advertising profiteers are liable only if they knew of the victim's status and knowingly engaged in recruiting, advertising, or benefiting from a venture involving commercial sex acts involving force, fraud, coercion, or minors. The doctrine of willful blindness allows a jury to infer knowledge on the part of a defendant who sought to avoid guilty knowledge. Courts have rarely distinguished between knowing and reckless disregard in cases involving criminal offenses. Defendants sentenced for federal crimes may also face supervised release, similar to parole, with conditions such as curfews, employment requirements, and drug testing. The court can impose supervised release for up to five years. The court may impose supervised release for up to five years for federal crimes, with exceptions for certain offenses like commercial sex trafficking which can have a lifetime term. Victims of human trafficking have a 10-year statute of limitations, which can be extended for child victims. P.L. 114-22 extends the Mann Act's prohibitions. P.L. 114-22 expands the Mann Act's prohibitions to include activities related to child pornography, such as travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct. Offenses under the Act are punishable by up to 30 years in prison, including attempts or conspiracies. The definition of \"illicit sexual conduct\" now includes the production of child pornography. P.L. 114-22 expands the Mann Act's prohibitions to include the production of child pornography. It is now a federal crime to travel with the intent to produce child pornography, produce child pornography overseas, or facilitate overseas travel for child pornography production. The defense for cases involving commercial sex trafficking and illicit sexual activity has been limited to clear and convincing evidence of the defendant's belief in the victim's age. The Mann Act amendments in P.L. 114-22 involve prosecutors handling cases of transporting individuals for unlawful sexual activities. The Attorney General can designate a state prosecutor to handle such cases, and the designated prosecutor operates under the direction of the U.S. Attorney. Additionally, H.R. 1311 addresses taxable income from any source, lawful or unlawful. H.R. 1311 aims to increase penalties for tax offenses by sex traffickers and establish an office of tax law enforcement to investigate these crimes. Enforcement will target tax offenses related to various crimes including forced labor, sex trafficking, and transporting individuals for unlawful sexual purposes. H.R. 1311 aims to increase penalties for tax offenses by sex traffickers, including attempting to evade federal tax, failing to file a return, and making false statements in a tax matter. It would also expand liability for providing false W2 forms to employees. H.R. 1311 would increase potential liability for providing false statements related to sex trafficking offenses, directing the creation of a specialized IRS office for investigating and prosecuting these tax offenses. It authorizes an appropriation of $4 million for FY2016 and makes sex trafficking victims eligible for whistleblower rewards. The proposed legislation, H.R. 1311, aims to increase liability for false statements related to sex trafficking offenses and establish a specialized IRS office for investigating these crimes. It would also allow sex trafficking victims to receive whistleblower rewards, providing them with certain rights and the ability to seek relief through a writ of mandamus. The federal appellate courts are divided on the standard to apply in Crime Victims' Rights Act appeals regarding writs of mandamus. P.L. 114-22 resolves this by favoring the less demanding abuse of discretion or legal error standard for most appeals. It also allows parties to extend the three-day deadline for the appellate court to consider the petition for a writ of mandamus. P.L. 114-22 creates new rights for crime victims, including timely notice of plea bargains and information on victims' rights. It also clarifies Congress' intent for victims to be notified of plea agreements. Additionally, federal criminal convictions come with a special assessment deposited in the Crime Victims Fund for victim benefits. P.L. 114-22 establishes the Domestic Trafficking Victims Fund with a $5,000 special assessment for victims of trafficking and sexual abuse. The assessment applies to specific offenses under various U.S. codes, with funds transferred from the Treasury's general fund to support victim assistance and compensation. The Domestic Trafficking Victims Fund was established with a $5,000 special assessment for victims of trafficking and sexual abuse. Transferred amounts are to be made available to the Attorney General for services and benefits under specific U.S. codes, with appropriations from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The Attorney General, in coordination with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, can access funds for health care services under various U.S. codes related to trafficking victims' assistance programs, residential treatment, anti-trafficking enforcement, child advocacy centers, and assistance for U.S. victims of trafficking. Forfeiture involves confiscating property linked to criminal activities through either criminal or civil proceedings. Federal forfeiture proceeds are typically deposited accordingly. The proceeds from federal forfeitures are deposited in the Justice Department's Asset Forfeiture Fund or the Department of the Treasury's Forfeiture Fund for law enforcement purposes. Forfeiture applies to property involved in various crimes, such as financial crimes and human trafficking. Property linked to trafficking offenses is subject to criminal and civil forfeiture. P.L. 114-22 makes property involved in or proceeds traceable to a trafficking offense subject to forfeiture. Defendants convicted of human trafficking offenses must be ordered. Defendants convicted of human trafficking offenses must pay victim restitution, with the Attorney General able to transfer forfeited property for this purpose. The Justice Department Asset Forfeiture Fund can be used for informants' fees in drug and money laundering cases, while the Treasury Fund has similar authority. P.L. 114-22 expands this authority to include human trafficking cases, allowing access to funds for informants' fees. Existing federal law allows for pretrial detention of individuals charged with certain crimes, including human trafficking offenses. H.R. 296, S. 178, and P.L. 114-22 expanded the definition of \"a crime of violence\" to include human trafficking offenses. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act permits court-supervised surreptitious surveillance in the investigation of serious federal and state crimes. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act authorizes court-supervised interception of various communications for federal and state law enforcement officials. This includes investigations related to crimes such as commercial sex trafficking, peonage, involuntary servitude, forced labor, and trafficking-related document misconduct. State prosecutors can also conduct interceptions for cases involving human trafficking, child pornography production, and child sexual exploitation, as permitted by state law. The federal Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) requires individuals convicted of sex offenses to register with state or tribal authorities. SORNA allows public online access to sex offender registration information, including their location and activities. Jurisdictions must meet minimum standards for information provided. SORNA mandates sex offenders to provide detailed personal information, including name, address, employer, school, vehicle details, and more. Jurisdictions must also include physical description, criminal history, photo, fingerprints, DNA sample, and other required data in their registries. The Attorney General requires detailed information from military sex offenders for registration, as mandated by SORNA. Proposed legislation aims to enhance the role of the Department of Defense in managing a separate sex offender registry. Offenders must register with state or tribal authorities and the Secretary of Defense upon release. H.R. 956 proposes that military sex offenders must register with the Secretary of Defense upon release, in addition to registering where they live, work, or attend school. This requirement is similar to SORNA regulations for states and tribes. The Secretary of Defense must include detailed information about released sex offenders in a registry, including physical description, criminal history, fingerprints, DNA sample, and more. This information must be made publicly available online and reported to various law enforcement and public entities. The Attorney General is responsible for including this information in the national registry. The proposed amendment, H.R. 956, aims to establish a system for monitoring military sex offenders who fail to comply with the requirements of the Department of Defense registry. It raises questions about whether DOD officials would have jurisdiction over discharged military sex offenders. H.R. 956 expands the Attorney General's obligation to develop software for SORNA compliance to include a DOD registry and mandates registration for military sex offenders entering the US with the Secretary of Defense."
