Congress finds that on September 11, 2001, treacherous acts of violence were committed against the United States, necessitating the exercise of self-defense to protect citizens at home and abroad. The Federal Government has a duty to pursue enemies like al Qaeda using all available tools, including electronic surveillance, to prevent future attacks and destroy the enemy. The President has the authority to engage in electronic surveillance of the enemy outside the United States as Commander-in-Chief under Article II of the Constitution. Congress has the authority to regulate electronic surveillance within the United States, as guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court has ruled that monitoring private conversations constitutes a search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 also governs surveillance activities. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 and specified provisions of the Federal criminal code were enacted to provide legal authority for the Federal Government to engage in searches of Americans in connection with criminal investigations, intelligence gathering, and counterintelligence. Warrantless electronic surveillance of Americans conducted without congressional authorization may impact civil liberties. United States citizens, including journalists, are affected by such surveillance. United States citizens, including journalists, academics, and researchers studying global terrorism, who have made international phone calls post-9/11 attacks, may fear being surveilled. The secretive nature of the NSA program raises concerns for Americans making international calls for various reasons. The President has signed legislation to enhance surveillance tools in the fight against terrorism. The USA PATRIOT ACT and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Protection Act have expanded authorities under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. Amendments may be necessary to address new challenges in the Global War on Terrorism. The President can request legislation from Congress to modify electronic surveillance authority. The Authorization for Use of Military Force allows military action against those responsible for terrorism. The USA PATRIOT ACT and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Protection Act have expanded authorities under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. The Authorization for Use of Military Force allows military action against those responsible for the attacks on September 11, 2001, but does not approve of domestic electronic surveillance not authorized by relevant laws. SEC. 3 reiterates that chapters 119 and 121 of title 18, United States Code, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 are the exclusive means for conducting electronic surveillance. Any future authorization for electronic surveillance must be specifically enacted by Congress. SEC. 4 outlines disclosure requirements. The President must submit a report to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees within 14 days of the enactment of the Act. The report should cover the Terrorist Surveillance Program of the NSA and any program involving electronic surveillance of US persons without following the procedures of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act or relevant sections of the US Code. The President is required to submit a report to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees within 14 days of the Act's enactment. The report should include details on electronic surveillance programs not authorized under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act or relevant sections of the US Code, with a general description of each US person subjected to such surveillance. The report may be submitted in classified form, and members of the Judiciary Committees in both the House and Senate should have access to it. Access to the report shall be provided in accordance with security procedures for classified information. SEC. 5. FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE COURT MATTERS.

Section 105 is also amended to include the Director of National Intelligence or the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. SEC. 7. INTERNATIONAL MOVEMENT OF TARGETS.\n\nAn order issued under this section remains valid during surveillance even if the target leaves the U.S., unless the Government files a motion to end the order and the court approves it.\n\nSEC. 8. EXTENSION OF EMERGENCY SURVEILLANCE ORDERS.\n\nThe time limit for emergency electronic surveillance orders is extended from 72 hours to 168 hours.\n\nSEC. 9. ENHANCEMENT OF ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE AUTHORITY IN WARTIME. SEC. 9. ENHANCEMENT OF ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE AUTHORITY IN WARTIME. Section 111 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 is amended to include authorization for electronic surveillance under specific military force resolutions. SEC. 10. ACQUISITION OF COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN PARTIES NOT IN THE UNITED STATES. Amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act allow for the acquisition of communications between parties outside the United States. Sec. 112 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act allows for the acquisition of communications between parties outside the United States without a court order. If a communication involving a domestic party is inadvertently collected, minimization procedures must be followed. Sec. 112 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act states that communications involving a United States person must not be disclosed, disseminated, or retained for longer than 168 hours without a court order or unless there is a threat of harm. Communications acquired outside the US must follow minimization procedures set by the Attorney General. SEC. 11. ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL FOR APPLICATIONS FOR ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE APPROVAL.
