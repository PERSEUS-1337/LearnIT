    "content": "The FDA approved AquaBounty Technologies' application to produce genetically engineered Atlantic salmon for human consumption, the first GE animal approved for consumption in the US. FDA also proposed guidelines for labeling GE salmon products. Genetic modification involves altering an organism's genetic makeup, which can now be done through modern biotechnology like genetic engineering. Genetically engineered animals, modified by rDNA techniques, can transfer traits efficiently. These traits can reduce costs and enhance consumer appeal. GE plant varieties like herbicide-resistant corn and soybeans are widely adopted. Genetic modification is now used in aquaculture, with over 50 fish species modified. Genetically modified fish have been developed for various purposes, including reducing production costs, producing pharmaceuticals, and testing water contamination. Countries like China, Cuba, India, Korea, the Philippines, and Thailand are actively researching genetically engineered fish. Some believe that delays in FDA approval for GE salmon have hindered investment in the U.S. biotechnology sector. The development of genetically engineered fish raises environmental concerns such as accidental release, competition with wild fish, and interbreeding. Advocacy groups propose sterilization and bioconfinement to prevent genetic assimilation into wild populations. Food safety concerns have also been raised by consumer groups. Consumer groups and the fishing industry have expressed concerns about genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and genetically engineered (GE) salmon. They advocate for mandatory labeling of GE products to allow consumers to make informed choices. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to restrict the use and require labeling of GE organisms, including GE salmon. The bills H.R. 913 and S. 511 mandate labeling of GE food products, including GE salmon. H.R. 1599 would establish a voluntary National Genetically Engineered Food Certification Program, preempting state authority over GE labeling. FY2016 appropriations bills S. 1800 and S. 2129 allocate funds for implementing GE salmon labeling. H.R. 394 would restrict most uses of GE fish, requiring an environmental assessment for prohibited uses. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) requires an environmental impact statement (EIS) for genetically engineered (GE) salmon. S. 738 mandates an EIS before approval of GE salmon for human consumption. The Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology guides federal regulation of biotechnology products based on their characteristics, not production method. Regulatory approach aims to ensure biotechnology safety. The regulatory framework for biotechnology ensures safety using existing authority and agency experience. Lead agencies include USDA's APHIS, FDA, and EPA. The NRC's animal biotechnology report highlighted gaps in addressing new biotech applications. FDA regulates food, feed additives, and drugs. The FDA regulates food, animal feed additives, and drugs, including those from biotechnology, to ensure human health safety. Most gene-based modifications of animals fall under the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine as new animal drugs. Under the FFDCA, drugs are defined as articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in humans or animals. CVM released industry guidance for producers of GE animals, stating that a GE animal with an rDNA construct intended to affect its structure or function meets the FFDCA drug definition. An NAD is considered \"unsafe\" unless approved by the FDA through a new animal drug application. The industry guidance for producers of GE animals outlines the pre-market approval process, including required information for NADAs. This information is categorized into six sections, covering product identification, molecular and phenotypic characterization, durability assessment, and food/feed safety and environmental safety assessments. Food safety assessment includes examining direct and indirect toxicity potential of food from GE animals to ensure safety. The FDA requires GE animals' food and feed to be substantially equivalent to non-GE animals for safety. An FDA decision on NADAs is subject to NEPA, which mandates consideration of environmental impacts through an EIS. The FDA is responsible for determining if an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is needed for New Animal Drug Applications (NADAs). Applicants must provide documentation for a categorical exclusion or a preliminary Environmental Assessment (EA). If an EA shows no significant environmental impacts, a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) is issued. If significant impacts are anticipated, an EIS is prepared. The FDA's regulatory protocols require confidentiality for pending drug applications to protect proprietary information. Critics have called for more transparency in the pre-market approval process for Aquadvantage Salmon. FDA guidance does not mandate evaluation of genetically engineered organisms like GE salmon as food additives, which typically require pre-market approval unless determined to be \"generally safe.\" The FDA's regulatory protocols require confidentiality for pending drug applications to protect proprietary information. Critics have called for more transparency in the pre-market approval process for Aquadvantage Salmon. FDA did not evaluate AquAdvantage Salmon as a food additive before approval as an NAD. USDA agencies also have potential roles in regulating transgenic and cloned animals and their products. USDA has not clearly spelled out a policy in this area, including whether it intends to regulate GE animals. APHIS, in conjunction with FDA, requested information on the impact of GE animals on U.S. animal health. Over 670 comments were received by November 18, 2008. Most comments did not focus on APHIS's authority under the Animal Health Protection Act. FDA issued final guidance for developers of GE animals on January 15, 2009. APHIS has broad authority under the AHPA to regulate animals and their movement to control disease spread. The USDA oversees the safety of animal vaccines and biological products, including those of GM origin, as well as the humane treatment of warm-blooded animals used in research. The Food Safety and Inspection Service ensures the safety and labeling of food animals and meat products. Federal food labeling policies are regulated under various acts. The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act of 1966 governs food labeling, stating that a food is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading. The United States does not require mandatory labeling for genetically modified foods, following the notion of \"substantial equivalence\" in food labeling requirements. The FDA does not require labeling for genetically engineered (GE) foods if there is no material difference compared to non-GE foods. Companies can voluntarily label their products as not containing bioengineered ingredients if they can prove it. FDA generally does not find significant safety concerns or differences in nutritional value between GE and non-GE foods. The FDA does not mandate labeling for genetically engineered (GE) foods if they are deemed substantially equivalent to non-GE foods. Bioengineered ingredients like oil from soy and canola, soy protein, and high fructose corn syrup are prevalent in processed foods. FDA's 1992 policy statement did not require special labeling for bioengineered foods, stating they are not significantly different from non-bioengineered foods. The FDA advises that labeling requirements for bioengineered foods are the same as for other foods, with a focus on revealing \"material facts\" about the food. Special labeling is required for bioengineered foods with significantly different nutritional properties, allergens, or toxic ingredients. FDA's 2001 draft guidance addresses voluntary labeling for bioengineered foods, cautioning against terms like \"GMO free\" as potentially misleading. Mandatory labeling of bioengineered products has been proposed at national, state, and local levels in the United States. Vermont, Connecticut, and Maine have passed mandatory labeling laws, with Vermont's law set to go into effect in 2016. Proponents argue that consumers have the right to know what they are purchasing. Some argue that consumers should have the right to know if they are purchasing bioengineered products, despite FDA's \"substantially equivalent\" stance. Labeling proponents believe consumers should be able to choose between products with and without bioengineered ingredients, citing religious or ethnic reasons. Labeling opponents point out the logistical challenges and costs of segregating bioengineered products from non-bioengineered ones in the current global food system. Labeling opponents argue that labeling bioengineered products would be costly and lead to increased food prices for all consumers. They also believe that labeling a bioengineered food product as such could be prejudicial, as it may suggest to consumers that the product is unhealthy. Salmon is a type of anadromous species that migrate between fresh water and the ocean during different stages of their life cycle. Most salmon production in the United States comes from wild Pacific salmon species like Chinook salmon. The main species of Pacific salmon include Chinook, sockeye, coho, pink, and chum salmon. Over 95% of wild commercial salmon production is from Alaskan stocks, which are abundant due to minimal human disturbances. Stocks in the Pacific Northwest are in poor condition from historic overfishing and habitat degradation. Hatcheries enhance production in both regions. Total commercial landings of Pacific salmon were reported in 2014. In 2014, total commercial landings of Pacific salmon were 327,000 metric tons with a value of $616.7 million. Atlantic salmon runs are at historically low levels due to overfishing, dams, and degraded rivers. Remaining Atlantic salmon runs in Maine are endangered. Limited recreational and commercial fisheries exist, with high consumer demand for salmon products. Salmon aquaculture technology is well developed with commercial farming established in many countries. Atlantic salmon is the most produced species, growing well in various culture conditions. Production is mainly from net pens in coastal waters, but can also be grown in freshwater systems. Salmon farming provides a consistent fresh product year-round, with Norway leading in commercial farming during the 1970s, followed by other countries like Great Britain, Chile, and Canada. During the rapid expansion of salmon farming, production costs decreased due to improvements in various factors. Concerns arose regarding environmental impact, such as harm to wild fish stocks, disease transfer, and effects of fish waste. The industry has made progress in addressing these concerns by adopting best management practices. In 1996, global salmon farm production surpassed wild salmon harvest, and by 2013, aquaculture production continued to increase. In 2013, aquaculture production of salmon, trouts, and smelts reached 3.177 million metric tons (mmt) valued at $17.628 billion. Norway, Chile, and the United Kingdom were the top producers. The United States produced 18,685 metric tons of Atlantic salmon worth $105.4 million. Global trade of salmon products increased, with the US importing 234,000 metric tons of farmed Atlantic salmon valued at $2.082 billion. Genetic engineering technology can be utilized in salmon production. Genetic engineering technology involves transferring DNA from one organism to another, creating recombinant DNA in a laboratory. This process can introduce desirable traits, such as a growth hormone, into organisms like Atlantic salmon. The introduced DNA becomes part of the organism's genetic makeup and can be passed on to offspring. Promoters in the DNA sequence instruct the organism's cells when to produce certain substances. GE salmon were created by injecting rDNA with a promoter from an ocean pout and a growth hormone gene from a Pacific Chinook salmon into fertilized eggs of Atlantic salmon. The resulting AquAdvantage Salmon line produces growth hormone year-round, leading to continuous feeding and growth. This genetic modification increases efficiency in salmon production by promoting faster growth and better feeding efficiency compared to non-GE Atlantic salmon. GE salmon, specifically AquAdvantage Salmon, reach market size faster than non-GE Atlantic salmon, taking 16 to 18 months instead of three years. They consume 25% less feed to achieve the same size and exhibit traits like accelerated growth, elevated metabolism, and increased feeding efficiency. These characteristics make GE salmon advantageous for commercial aquaculture operations. The AquAdvantage Salmon, a genetically engineered (GE) salmon, is produced in land-based facilities in Panama to reduce environmental harm caused by traditional salmon cage culture. AquaBounty plans to produce only sterile female GE Atlantic salmon for retail sale in the United States, with no live fish being imported. AquaBounty plans to produce only sterile female GE Atlantic salmon through a process that manipulates salmonid reproductive biology. The production of monosex salmon is considered 100% effective, with pressure treatment inducing triploidy for sterility. All-female lines of triploid fish are seen as a reliable method to prevent breeding populations of GE fish. Growing GE marine fish in isolated onshore tanks can significantly reduce the risk of escape into the wild. AquaBounty's facilities confine production to land-based freshwater areas to minimize environmental impact. The egg production facility on PEI is licensed for research on GE fish with redundant containment measures. Security is in place to prevent unauthorized access. The grow-out facility in Panama is located at a high altitude, with water diverted from a river into grow-out tanks. Screens are used to prevent fish escape, and security deters intrusion. The Panama site is geographically isolated. The Panama site is geographically isolated and has security measures in place to prevent intrusion. The environmental conditions in the river's estuary and the Pacific Ocean are unfavorable for salmon survival. AquaBounty first approached the FDA in 1993 regarding the commercial use of GE salmon and formally applied for approval in 1995. In 2009, AquaBounty provided the FDA with the last required study for its new animal drug application. The FDA's Veterinary Medicine Advisory Committee met in 2010 to consider the safety and effectiveness of the NADA. On December 20, 2012, FDA announced the availability for public comment of the draft environmental assessment (EA) of impacts associated with AquaBounty's NADA submission and FDA's preliminary finding of no significant impact (FONSI). A 60-day public comment period was extended through April 26, 2013. Environment Canada granted AquaBounty permission to export up to 100,000 eggs a year to Panama in November 2013. FDA Commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg stated on March 13, 2014, that the Aquabounty NADA is still under consideration. FDA approved the Aquabounty application to produce GE Atlantic salmon on November 19, 2015. The FDA approved Aquabounty's application to produce GE Atlantic salmon on November 19, 2015. The VMAC briefing pack concluded that there are no food consumption hazards related to AquAdvantage Salmon. While similarities were found between AquAdvantage Salmon and non-GE Atlantic salmon, it was inconclusive if it would be more or less allergenic. FDA reiterated that food from AquAdvantage Salmon is as safe as non-GE salmon in a preliminary finding of no significant impact released on December 20, 2012. The FDA determined that AquAdvantage Salmon is safe for consumption and poses no significant food safety hazards. They also conducted an environmental assessment in consultation with relevant agencies, finding no adverse effects on wild fish stocks. Additionally, the FDA concluded that the approval of AquAdvantage Salmon will not harm the existence of Atlantic salmon under the Endangered Species Act. The FDA approved AquAdvantage Salmon as safe for consumption with no significant food safety hazards. Critics question FDA's expertise in identifying ecological damage from transgenic fish. The environmental assessment found no adverse effects on wild fish stocks, and FDA believes the escape of GE salmon into local environments is unlikely. The FDA found no evidence of significant environmental impacts in the United States from the approval of AquAdvantage Salmon. Potential effects on the environment in Canada and Panama were not considered, as NEPA does not require analysis of effects in other countries. Only potential exposure pathways causing significant effects in the US would be evaluated. The FDA did not find significant environmental impacts in the United States from the approval of AquAdvantage Salmon. Environmental groups called for an EIS and consultation on threats to wild Atlantic salmon, but FDA decided it was not necessary. Some members suggested an EIS might be needed for additional production facilities. A National Research Council study found a low to moderate food safety risk from GE seafood. The study found a low to moderate food safety risk from GE seafood due to concerns about introducing new allergens. Three organizations petitioned the FDA to review AquaBounty's application for AquAdvantage Salmon, citing elevated levels of Insulin Growth Factor-1 as a novel food additive. The petition requested FDA to conduct extensive pre-market testing on AquAdvantage Salmon and questioned the validity of data supplied by AquaBounty for risk assessment. FDA could require labeling if the GE salmon had different nutritional or health-related characteristics. The FDA could have required labeling for GE salmon, as concerns about potential harm from escaped organisms are raised by scientists and environmental groups. Transgenic fish, like AquAdvantage Salmon, pose significant environmental risks such as interbreeding with wild salmon and competition with other fish species. Farmed Atlantic salmon frequently escape from fish farms, providing insights into potential interactions with GE Atlantic salmon. Escaped farmed salmon, both within and outside their native ranges, have been found on spawning grounds during wild Atlantic salmon spawning. Successful spawning mainly occurs between farmed females and wild males, leading to hybrids that share habitats with wild salmon. The presence of farmed and hybrid juveniles may impact food resources and competitively displace native juveniles. The genetic composition of farmed salmon has been altered, reducing genetic variation due to domestication. The genetic composition and variation of farmed Atlantic salmon have been significantly altered due to limited breeding and selection for specific traits. This has led to the dominance of five Norwegian strains in farm production. Inter-breeding between farmed and wild salmon has resulted in changes to genetic variability in wild populations, impacting their survival. Experiments in Norway and Ireland have shown reduced survival and success rates of farmed and hybrid salmon compared to wild salmon. Opponents fear the negative effects of genetically engineered salmon based on past experiences with farmed salmon. Opponents fear that genetically engineered (GE) salmon, with potential higher feeding and growth rates, may escape and interbreed with wild salmon, leading to population-wide consequences. The \"Trojan gene hypothesis\" suggests that a gene conferring a reproductive advantage could also reduce offspring survival in the wild, potentially causing extinction. However, this effect only occurs when there is a conflict between mating success and viability fitness. Critics are concerned about the potential consequences of interbreeding between genetically engineered (GE) salmon and wild Atlantic salmon, fearing competition for resources and establishment of GE salmon in the wild. Previous attempts to introduce Atlantic salmon outside their natural range have failed, raising long-term conservation concerns. In British Columbia, escaped Atlantic salmon from fish farms have produced wild-spawned juvenile salmon, but it is uncertain if they have established self-reproducing populations. Experimental crosses between GE Atlantic salmon and wild brown trout have shown viability and growth advantages for the hybrid. Concerns include potential detrimental effects on wild salmon populations, competition for resources, and the possibility of GE salmon outcompeting wild fish for habitat and food. Laboratory experiments suggest that GE fish may outcompete wild fish for habitat and food. GE fish are more likely to feed in the presence of predators. Studies show no difference in territorial dominance, growth, or survival between GE and non-GE salmon fry under food-limited conditions. Proponents argue that escaped GE fish would struggle to survive in the wild. The consequences of competition depend on various factors. Once established, transgenic fish could be challenging to eradicate. The FDA has approved AquaBounty's application for GE salmon, but retains the authority to withdraw approval if significant concerns arise. Any changes to the approved conditions would require notification and potentially trigger environmental analyses under NEPA. Critics are concerned about the potential impact on wild Atlantic salmon populations, which are already at extremely low levels and vulnerable to ecological changes. If GE salmon were to become established in the wild, they could be difficult to eradicate, similar to many invasive species. Approval of GE salmon in the US may lead to more applications in other areas. AquaBounty is approved to produce GE salmon in Panama. Concerns arise about future proposals being less scrutinized and potentially located closer to wild salmon, increasing the risk of escape. AquaBounty denies using cage culture for GE salmon production. AquaBounty denies using cage culture for GE salmon production in the US. States have passed laws regulating the use of GE fish in state waters. If GE fish escape, they could spread from regulated to unregulated states, requiring consistent regulation. FDA approved AquaBounty's application for GE salmon and released draft guidance for voluntary labeling of GE salmon-derived food. The labeling issue is separate from the approval decision. FDA has determined that AquaBounty salmon is safe for human consumption and is \"substantially equivalent\" to non-GE salmon. Opponents argue for labeling as a GE product for consumer awareness, while proponents believe it could negatively impact retail demand. FDA has proposed guidance for voluntary labeling of GE Atlantic-derived food. FDA has proposed guidance for voluntary labeling of GE Atlantic salmon-derived food, offering examples of statements for both genetically engineered and non-genetically engineered products. The guidance does not establish specific labeling requirements, allowing industry to use alternative approaches as long as they comply with applicable statutes and regulations. The success of farm-raised Atlantic salmon has made some in the wild salmon fishing industry, particularly in Alaska, sensitive to potential impacts of GE salmon. Fishermen are concerned about further increases in salmon aquaculture production and environmental harm to wild stocks. The salmon fishing industry in Alaska does not produce intensively farmed fish in net pens and would not benefit from GE salmon. The rapid growth of farmed salmon and trout production has driven world salmon prices over the last three decades. Changes to salmon markets were complex due to various factors in addition to increased supply. GE salmon could potentially depress prices, but interactions with wild fisheries are hard to assess. Public acceptance, regulatory framework, production, markets, and public opinion are key drivers in the industry. The approval of GE salmon technology may not lead to a rapid increase in production initially due to limited capacity at AquaBounty Panama facility. Significant production growth would rely on approval of additional sites worldwide. The regulatory framework will determine production methods and locations, with land-based facilities potentially impacting aquaculture production. Economic viability of land-based facilities for salmon grow-out is a key consideration. The economic viability of land-based salmon grow-out facilities is uncertain due to limited available sites with sufficient water quality. Concerns exist in the commercial fishing industry regarding public acceptance of genetically engineered (GE) salmon, with requests for labeling to differentiate from wild salmon. Industry groups fear that labeling GE salmon may lead consumers to perceive wild fishery products as unsafe. Consumers are skeptical of genetically engineered (GE) fish products, with concerns about food safety, ethical issues, and environmental impact. Major grocery chains have pledged not to sell GE fish, citing public demand for wild-caught fish. Demand for high-quality fish products like Atlantic salmon has been increasing rapidly. Demand for high-quality fish products, such as Atlantic salmon, has been growing rapidly over the past three decades and is expected to continue increasing. Consumer skepticism towards genetically engineered (GE) salmon products is evident, with concerns about food safety and ethical issues. Price discounts may be necessary to encourage consumer acceptance of GE salmon, with varying requirements based on consumer characteristics. Increased production of GE salmon could lead to lower prices and health benefits for consumers. The potential benefits of widespread GE salmon use should be considered in the approval process. Members of the Alaska congressional delegation are disappointed with FDA's approval of AquaBounty's GE salmon. They support GE salmon labeling to inform consumers. Bills have been introduced for GE salmon labeling and GE food products. H.R. 1599 would establish a voluntary national GE food certification program. The appropriations bills include provisions for funding GE salmon labeling requirements. H.R. 394 would make it illegal to sell or possess GE fish in interstate commerce or engage in net-pen aquaculture. H.R. 394 defines covered fish as those modified through recombinant DNA technologies, with exceptions for research and supporting the act. Applications for prohibited uses require an EA or EIS, including an environmental risk analysis. The bill also mandates a report on environmental risks of GE seafood products. S. 738 would require an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for applications related to genetically engineered (GE) salmon for human consumption. Concerns about the approval process and implications of GE salmon approval were raised by Members of Congress during the 113th Congress. Letters were sent to FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg urging a halt to the approval process due to safety concerns for the environment and consumers, as well as potential precedent for future GE fish applications. Members also called for labeling requirements to distinguish GE seafood products. Members of Congress raised concerns about the production and labeling of genetically engineered salmon, with bills introduced in the 113th Congress. Some bills required labeling of genetically engineered fish and foods, but an amendment allowing states to require labeling was defeated. Critics argue that the FDA's evaluation of GE salmon has not fully considered potential impacts or risks. Critics argue that the FDA's evaluation of GE salmon has not fully considered potential impacts or risks, questioning the regulatory system's ability to keep pace with advances in GE technology. They support the development of a comprehensive EIS to assess the broader context of social, economic, and environmental implications of GE salmon. Some observers suggest that the regulation of transgenic animals as NADs reveals weaknesses in existing regulatory structures to respond adequately to complexities in animal biotechnology innovations. Some argue that AquAdvantage Salmon should undergo a more rigorous assessment by the FDA's Office of Food Additive Safety to address consumer and retailer skepticism of genetic engineering technology. This could set a precedent for future products needing greater scrutiny and prevent the US from losing its leadership in agricultural biotechnology. Delays in the approval process suggest political intervention in science-based regulatory oversight, potentially impacting other countries looking to commercialize this technology. AquaBounty has invested $50 million in developing the technology for AquAdvantage Salmon. Concerns arise about the lengthy and uncertain U.S. approval process affecting investor interest and global competitiveness. The approval of GE salmon sets a precedent for future transgenic candidates in aquaculture, prompting calls for a comprehensive evaluation of genetic engineering's social costs and benefits. Researchers emphasize the need for long-term effects assessment of GE salmon. Assessment of long-term effects of GE salmon requires a comprehensive analysis of production systems, markets, consumer acceptance, and regulatory framework. Questions remain about the current process's ability to provide adequate safeguards for the public and the environment while allowing for timely approval of new genetic technologies."
