A generative model called Conditional Relationship Variational Autoencoder (CRVAE) is introduced to expand high-quality medical entity pairs without external knowledge. This model can discover new relational medical entity pairs effectively. The proposed method, a Conditional Relationship Variational Autoencoder (CRVAE), can generate new relational medical entity pairs and relationship-enhanced entity representations. This model is effective in discovering meaningful and novel medical entity pairs, contributing to the accessibility of medical knowledge online. The paper discusses binary medical relationships, such as Disease Cause \u2192 Symptom and Symptom Belongto \u2192 Department. Understanding and reasoning about these relationships pose challenges for machines. Real-world medical entity pairs present challenging properties, including the need to discover new relationships as medical knowledge advances. An increasing number of relationships will be formed among medical entities, with various linguistic expressions used for the same entity. Relationships may vary in granularity and strength, such as coarse-grained entity pairs like <Rhinitis, Nose Plugged> and fine-grained pairs like <Acute Rhinitis, Nose Plugged>. Relationship strength can differ, with <Cold, Fatigue> having greater strength than <Cold, Ear Infections>. Relation extraction methods are proposed to identify semantic relationships between medical entity pairs in complex real-world scenarios. Existing methods struggle with data sparsity, making it difficult to obtain external knowledge covering all possible entity pairs. In the medical domain, it is crucial to discover meaningful relational entity pairs based on existing data without the need for external knowledge. Most relation extraction methods use a discriminative approach, which is labor-intensive and tedious. The goal is to understand medical relationships intrinsically from existing entity pairs. The REMEDY research problem focuses on discovering relational medical entity pairs solely from existing data without external knowledge. A generative model called CRVAE is proposed for this purpose, aiming to create meaningful and novel entity pairs related to specific medical relationships. CRVAE is a generative model that explores the capacity of Bayesian inference and deep learning for creating novel relational medical entity pairs. It encodes each pair into a latent space based on the relationship type, allowing for the reconstruction of high-quality and novel entity pairs. CRVAE is a generative model that directly models the intrinsic relations between medical entity pairs based on existing meaningful relationships. It utilizes pre-trained word vectors and existing entity pairs for training, allowing it to generate entity pairs for specific relationships without relying on external contexts. Unlike discriminative methods, CRVAE focuses on distinguishing relationships of entity pairs without the need for negative entity pairs. The CRVAE model, through hands-free feature engineering with deep neural networks, generates novel medical entity pairs based on intrinsic relationships. It aims to expand high-quality yet novel relational medical entity pairs without the need for large-scale context information. The model, named Conditional Relational Medical Entity-pair Discovery (REMEDY), focuses on discovering meaningful entity pairs that do not exist in the training data. The Conditional Relationship Variational Autoencoder (CRVAE) model is introduced for the REMEDY problem, consisting of encoder, decoder, and generator modules. It aims to discover relational medical entity pairs solely from diverse expressions without complex feature engineering, providing relationship-enhanced entity representations. The Conditional Relationship Variational Autoencoder (CRVAE) model generates meaningful medical entity pairs for specific relationships by sampling from a learned latent variable distribution. Pre-trained word embeddings are used to represent medical entities, obtained from a Skip-gram model trained on a medical corpus. The Conditional Relationship Variational Autoencoder (CRVAE) model utilizes pre-trained word embeddings to represent medical entities and their relationships. The encoder translates entity pairs to a latent space to capture relationship information, enhancing the initial embeddings with specific relationship details. The Conditional Relationship Variational Autoencoder (CRVAE) model enhances entity embeddings with relationship information using non-linear transformations. The relationship-enhanced entity representations are concatenated and mapped to a latent space through multiple fully connected layers to capture entity interactions. The CRVAE model incorporates relationship information by learning latent variables for medical entity pairs and relationships using Gaussian distributions. Weight and bias terms are used to model the mean and variance vectors, with the variance vector stabilized using its log form. The latent variables are then used by the decoder to capture entity interactions in the latent space. The decoder in the CRVAE model reconstructs relational medical entity pairs using latent variables and relationship indicators. A reparameterization trick is used to sample latent values from a standard normal distribution, making the sampling process independent of the network. Multiple non-linear fully connected layers are employed for an inverse mapping in the decoder. The CRVAE model uses fully connected layers for an inverse mapping in the decoder to obtain relationship-enhanced embeddings for medical entity pairs. The loss function minimizes the variational lower bound by approximating the true latent distribution using a Gaussian distribution. The CRVAE model utilizes fully connected layers in the decoder to generate relationship-enhanced embeddings for medical entity pairs. The loss function minimizes the variational lower bound by approximating the true latent distribution with a Gaussian distribution. The closed-form solution for the first term involves the mean vector \u00b5 and variance vector \u03c3 2. The second term penalizes the maximum likelihood by calculating the conditional probability of entity pairs given the latent variable and relationship indicator. The mean squared error is used to minimize the L CRVAE, with optimizers like Adadelta being applicable. The training in BID34 starts deterministically with a warm-up technique, gradually transitioning to variational by increasing \u03b2 from 0 to 1.0. A density-based sampling method is used for the generator to sample from the latent space based on a specific relationship r, generating meaningful medical entity pairs. The generator directly samples\u1e91 from P \u03b8 (\u1e91|r) to obtain the latent space value for a particular relationship r, bypassing the traditional encoding process. The decoder structure decodes the relational medical entity pair using the latent space value obtained for a relationship r. A sampling method based on the density distribution of P \u03b8 (\u1e91|r) is used to sample more from denser regions in the latent space. The resulting vectors \u00eambed h and \u00eambed t are mapped back to their entities in the initial embedding space. The dataset comprises 46.02k real-world relational medical data. The dataset used for training and validation consists of 46.02k real-world relational medical entity pairs in Chinese from an online healthcare forum. Word embeddings are utilized for entity representation, with hyperparameter configurations tested. Evaluation metrics are introduced to measure the generated relational medical entity pairs. Evaluation metrics are introduced to quantitatively measure the quality, support, and novelty of generated relational medical entity pairs. Human annotation is used to assess the quality, while a support metric measures the degree of belongingness of entity pairs to a relationship. The support score for medical entity pairs is calculated using distance measures like cosine distance. The relationship with the highest score is considered the estimated relationship, while the ground truth relationship is based on the generating process. The ability to generate novel relational medical entity pairs is a key contribution due to varying medical knowledge among individuals. The ability to generate novel relational medical entity pairs is a key contribution. Novelty is measured by the number of entity pairs not in the dataset. Different models are compared for the REMEDY problem, including CRVAE-MONO, RVAE, and CRVAE-RAND. The proposed method CRVAE-RAND samples randomly from the latent space, generating highly novel entity pairs not seen in the training data but of low quality compared to CRVAE. CRVAE-MONO demonstrates the power of generative models in learning intrinsic representations and generating new entity pairs with one type of relationship during training. The proposed method CRVAE-RAND generates novel entity pairs not in training data but with low quality compared to CRVAE. CRVAE-WA improves CRVAE performance with warm-up technique, showing consistent improvements in quality, support, and novelty. Qualitative examples of medical entity pairs are provided, showcasing the model's capabilities. The proposed method CRVAE-RAND generates novel entity pairs not in training data but with low quality compared to CRVAE. CRVAE-WA improves CRVAE performance with warm-up technique, showing consistent improvements in quality, support, and novelty. Validation of the effectiveness of density-based sampling for generating relational medical entity pairs is discussed in Table 3. The proposed method CRVAE-RAND uses random sampling, generating more novel entity pairs but with lower quality compared to CRVAE, which uses density-based sampling. The dense region in the latent space of CRVAE results in higher quality and support for generated entity pairs. The translating layer adjusts the original embedding to enhance entity representations in the experiments. The proposed method enhances entity representations by adjusting the original embedding space. It can generate relational medical entity pairs based on specific relationships and demonstrate conditional inference ability through visualization of latent spaces. Generative models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have been developed to generate data based on hidden parameters. VAEs model the underlying probability distribution of data using latent variables, allowing for sampling new data accordingly. These models have been applied to generating images and natural language texts. The relational medical entity pair discovery problem studied in this paper utilizes a VAE setting for generating specific relationships between medical entities. The paper discusses the generative approach to the medical entity pair discovery problem, which has not been explored before. Traditional relationship extraction methods require extensive external information, making it time-consuming. The proposed generative method aims to directly generate meaningful and novel relational medical entity pairs without relying on large text corpora. The paper introduces a novel generative model called Conditional Relationship Variational Autoencoder (CRVAE) for Relational Medical Entity-pair Discovery (REMEDY). Unlike traditional methods, this model does not require external corpus for entity pair discovery and can understand medical relationships from rational relational medical entity pairs. It aims to expand the scale of high-quality relational medical entity pairs by incorporating deep learning for feature engineering. The proposed method, CRVAE, utilizes deep learning for hands-free feature engineering in relational medical entity-pair discovery. It intrinsically understands medical relations from diverse entity pairs without external context, generating novel pairs. The method's performance is evaluated on real-world medical data quantitatively and qualitatively, with a loss function inspired by CVAE to minimize the variational lower bound. The proposed method, CRVAE, uses deep learning for relational medical entity-pair discovery. It minimizes the KL divergence loss between true and simple distributions to model entity pairs and estimate maximum likelihood. The method aims to sample from a simple distribution for ease of sampling. The proposed CRVAE method utilizes deep learning for relational medical entity-pair discovery by minimizing KL divergence loss between true and simple distributions. The model is trained with various hyperparameter configurations, including batch size, dimension for entity embeddings, hidden layers, activation functions, and optimizer choices. The proposed method generates meaningful entity pairs and enhances relationships between medical entities. It shows that original entity representations tend to cluster entities with similar contexts together. For example, a disease entity \"genital tract malformation\" is close to \"infertility\" and \"acyesis\", while a symptom entity \"muscle strain\" is near \"pull-up\" and \"amount of exercise\". The translation layer adjusts entity representations for the Relational Medical Entity-pair Discovery task. Nearest neighbors in the adjusted space are relation-wise similar. For example, heart malformations and chromosome abnormalities may serve similar functionalities in a Disease Cause-Symptom relationship. Validation data values are shown after being mapped into the \u00b5 space using RVAE and CRVAE. The RVAE model can map different relationships into various regions in the latent space without the relationship indicator. However, CRVAE incorporates the relationship indicator during training to unify latent representations for each relationship, enabling diverse generation capabilities. The CRVAE's generator uses the relationship indicator to generate categorical information on the type of relationship. The latent variables of RVAE and CRVAE are visualized in a two-dimensional space after dimension reduction using Primary Component Analysis."
