Haiti has struggled to establish democratic institutions since the fall of dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier in 1986. Haitians approved a new constitution in 1987 to transition to a democratic government after years of repression and corruption under the Duvalier dictatorship. In 1987, Haiti approved a new constitution to establish a democratic government after years of military rule. The first free and fair elections in 1990 led to the election of Jean-Bertrand Aristide as President. Despite initial political tensions, elections have helped strengthen government capacity and transparency in the long term. Elected governments have implemented development plans, reduced state employees, and improved fiscal management to qualify for debt relief. Despite improvements in governance and transparency reforms, Haiti still faces challenges such as weak judicial system, corruption, and political violence. The devastating 2010 earthquake further diminished governance capacities and exacerbated poverty and economic disparity. The nation struggles with limited government independence and ongoing stability threats. The United States and the international community support efforts for free and fair elections in Haiti to improve governance, services to citizens, and stability for development. Aristide was overthrown in a military coup but returned in 1994 under U.S. military intervention. In 1994, under the protection of 20,000 U.S. troops, President Aristide disbanded the army and trained a civilian police force. Haiti saw its first transfer of power between democratically elected presidents in 1996. Elections under Aristide and Pr\u00e9val were marred by irregularities and opposition boycotts, leading to periods without a fully functioning government. The international community tried to mediate negotiations between the government and the opposition. Since the 2000 re-election of Aristide, Haiti experienced political tension and violence, leading to his exile in 2004 amid allegations of corruption and drug trafficking. An interim government oversaw the 2006 elections, resulting in Pr\u00e9val's disputed re-election. Following the 2010 earthquake, political stability in Haiti remained uncertain due to significant loss of political figures, damaged infrastructure, and frustrations over slow recovery efforts. The recent election in Haiti involved the President, Chamber of Deputies, and Senators, crucial for reconstruction efforts. The Obama Administration provided $16 million in election support. The Obama Administration provided $16 million in election support through USAID for Haiti's parliamentary elections, which were postponed due to the earthquake. The legislature passed a State of Emergency law in April 2010, granting broad powers to the executive branch until October 2011. The Haitian constitution allows for the extension of the president's term in case of delays, with elections held every five years. Presidents can serve two non-consecutive terms, while there are no term limits for the legislature. The first round of elections took place on November 28, 2010, with a runoff held if no candidate receives an absolute majority. President Pr\u00e9val completed his second non-consecutive term in Haiti, with nineteen candidates competing to succeed him. The election focused on personalities rather than parties or issues, with efforts made to encourage substantive discussions through debates. After contested results and violence in the first round, Michel Martelly was declared the winner in the second round following international observer recommendations. Mirlande Manigat, Jude Celestin, and Michel Martelly were the top three candidates in the Haitian presidential election. Manigat, a former Senator and First Lady, describes herself as center-left. Celestin, a technocrat, was chosen by Preval to run as his successor. Martelly was declared the winner in the second round after a disputed first round. Jude Celestin, chosen by Preval as his successor, oversaw road construction projects but faced questions about his background. Michel Martelly, a popular kompa dance musician, aimed to stimulate the economy with foreign investments and tourism. Michel Martelly, a businessman and former musician, aimed to stimulate the economy with foreign investments and tourism. However, he faced personal financial issues, defaulting on over $1 million in loans and having properties in Florida go into foreclosure. Among the 16 remaining candidates were former government officials like Jacques-Edouard Alexis, Yvon Neptune, and Leslie Voltaire. International and domestic election observers noted disorganization and irregularities during November's election day. The election day in Haiti was marked by disorganization, dysfunction, irregularities, and incidents of intimidation and violence, especially in Port-au-Prince. The OAS observation team highlighted a toxic atmosphere of allegations of massive fraud. Despite serious irregularities, the electoral process was not deemed invalid. Haitian civil society groups and election observers criticized the shortcomings in their reports to the OAS mission. The OAS observation team criticized the shortcomings, irregularities, and fraud in the Haitian elections but did not call for their cancellation. Some critics called for new elections and accused the OAS of bias. The Lavalas party was not included in the elections as no faction submitted the required documents. The CEP announced preliminary results for the presidential elections in Haiti, with a low voter turnout of 22.8%. Mirlande Manigat received 31.37% of votes, Jude Celestin got 22.48%, and Michel Martelly had 21.84%. The results sparked controversy, leading to violent protests and accusations of fraud. The U.S. Embassy expressed concern over inconsistencies in the results. Tensions escalated as various actors proposed different actions in response to the controversial preliminary election results in Haiti. The OAS intervened by sending election experts to verify the results, finding irregularities in polling places with high voter participation rates. The expert mission recommended excluding votes from polling places with high participation rates and irregularities in the Haitian election. The revised tally showed Martelly with 22.2%, Celestin with 21.9%, and Manigat with 31.6% of the vote. Despite calling the elections problematic, a new national election was ruled out due to the impact on the top three candidates. The expert verification mission recommended improvements for the second round of the Haitian election, including better poll worker training and transparent verification processes. President Pr\u00e9val was displeased with the mission's methodology and leaked report, causing objections from advocacy groups and critics. Despite concerns, long-time Haiti observers saw no reason to doubt the mission's impartiality. The United States and others were worried Pr\u00e9val would push for his candidate to advance to the second round. The United States and other major donors pressured President Pr\u00e9val to accept OAS recommendations for the Haitian election. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited Haiti to urge acceptance, warning of potential consequences. The CEP agreed to implement technical recommendations for the second round and consider suggestions for resolving candidate disputes. Tension persisted over whether the CEP would comply with the OAS recommendations. The CEP accepted OAS recommendations for the Haitian election, releasing final results on February 3. Manigat and Martelly proceeded to the second round of presidential elections, with Martelly gaining support from Wyclef Jean. The final round of voting was held on March 20, 2011. Political tensions in Haiti increased after three men supporting Manigat were found dead with signs of mutilation. Manigat's priorities include solving the cholera problem, addressing displaced Haitians, and focusing on education for long-term development. Critics target her age (70) and comfort level. In the upcoming Haitian election, candidates face criticism for various reasons. Manigat, aged 70, is targeted for her age and language preference. Martelly, aged 50, is criticized for his lack of education and political experience, as well as personal financial issues. He is trying to change his image by wearing suits and hiring a PR firm for his campaign. Martelly hired a Spanish PR firm for his campaign. The OAS-CARICOM mission praised the second round of elections as more peaceful and well-organized. The Provisional Electoral Council addressed issues, and Martelly won with 68% of the votes. The CEP delayed announcing results due to irregularities. The second round of elections saw Martelly winning with 68% of the votes, but voter turnout was low at 22.8%. Only 15% of registered voters cast their votes for Martelly, unlike previous presidents who had stronger mandates. The legislative offices up for election included the entire Chamber of Deputies and 11 Senate seats. Fraud allegations were made in the first round, but the OAS mission only examined presidential results, not legislative ones. The CEP handled legislative disputes and challenges. During the second round of elections, Martelly won with 68% of the votes, but voter turnout was low at 22.8%. Legislative disputes and challenges were handled by the CEP, with some races determined by the first round and others proceeding to a second round. Charges of fraud in the second round led to violent demonstrations and deaths. The legislature sworn in on April 25 was incomplete. The legislature sworn in on April 25 was incomplete due to challenges in 19 districts. International observers reported changes favoring candidates linked to Pr\u00e9val's Inite coalition, demanding annulment of the results. The CEP endorsed 15 of the original results, allowing legislators to take their seats. President Martelly plans to address the remaining four seats once his cabinet is in place. Local elections for various posts are pending, with USAID suggesting mid-2011 for their scheduling. Michel Martelly was sworn in as Haiti's new President on May 14, 2011. Martelly was sworn in as Haiti's new President on May 14, 2011, marking the first peaceful transfer of power between Presidents of opposing parties in Haitian history. Concerns arise over his lack of political experience and connections to supporters of past dictatorships, raising doubts about his ability to fulfill promises of education, job creation, and rule of law. Some Haitians saw his election as a rejection of the traditional political class and previous reconstruction efforts after the earthquake. President Martelly faced criticism for his slow approach to reconstruction after the earthquake. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton endorsed him and suggested ways to speed up the process, such as simplifying land ownership transfers and streamlining business start-ups. Martelly called for a restructuring of foreign aid but struggled to form his government, with his first two nominees for prime minister being rejected by parliament. Bernard Gousse, a former justice minister accused of persecuting Aristide supporters, faced opposition from senators and a Haitian law firm. Martelly is still finalizing his cabinet appointments. The new legislature began work before Martelly's inauguration, focusing on constitutional reforms. The new legislature focused on constitutional reforms, including amendments allowing dual citizenship and increasing women's representation in public administration. Controversy surrounds the status of these amendments, which President Martelly plans to address. The Haitian legislature is comprised of multiple parties in both the Senate and Chamber of Deputies. The Inite coalition holds the majority, requiring President Martelly to negotiate with them for his proposals. Incumbents have a low re-election rate, with only a few retaining their seats in the recent election. The leaders of the chambers have varying levels of legislative experience. Jean Rodolphe Joazile, a former member of the Haitian Senate, immigrated to New York in 1979 and completed his college studies in Haiti in the late 1980s. He served as Treasurer in the Senate in 2000 but resigned in 2001. Joazile, a former captain in the Haitian army, studied at the U.S. Army School of the Americas in Fort Benning, Georgia. The Haitian legislature is currently focused on selecting a new prime minister amidst concerns about political stability and reconstruction efforts. The Organization of American States (OAS) /Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Joint Election Observation Mission monitored the recent election process in Haiti with 118 observers on election day. Elections in Haiti have contributed to government capacity and transparency in the long term, but have caused political tensions and instability in the short term. The OAS/CARICOM Joint Election Observation Mission in Haiti has been monitoring the electoral process and meeting with the Provisional Electoral Council and political parties. Despite criticism for not questioning the validity of the elections earlier, the mission deployed 200 observers for the second round elections. Some believed more long-term international observers were needed, but logistical challenges and Haiti's size led to a smaller mission. During the first round of elections in Haiti, various organizations and diplomatic missions, including the U.S. and Canadian embassies, provided technical assistance and monitored the voting process. The OAS/CARICOM observation mission expressed concerns about election security and urged candidates to campaign peacefully. Opposition candidates alleged distribution of weapons by supporters of the ruling party, prompting the OAS mission to call for evidence for investigations. In November, the OAS/CARICOM team expressed worry about election-related violence. Observers were concerned about potential violence or unrest affecting the elections in Haiti. Rumors of UN troops introducing cholera led to attacks on them in late 2010. MINUSTAH and Haitian National Police provided security for the election process. Security plans were revised for the second round, with MINUSTAH's role mainly being to observe and support the PNH. The U.S. State Department issued a travel warning after the first-round elections. The U.S. State Department issued a travel warning urging citizens to avoid non-essential travel to Haiti due to high crime, cholera outbreak, and limited police protection. Violent protests followed the first-round elections, leading to concerns about voter participation affecting the election's legitimacy. The joint observation mission expressed concerns about voter turnout and the use of state resources during the election campaign. They urged political parties to adhere to fairness provisions and ensure state agents are not involved in campaigning activities. The OAS/CARICOM mission also raised technical concerns, particularly regarding the distribution of voter identification cards. The distribution of voter identification cards was a major issue, with 400,000 new cards printed but slow distribution. Approximately 4.7 million people have registered to vote, representing about 95% of the adult population. The report estimated that 6% of those listed in the voter registry are deceased, mainly due to deaths during the earthquake without death certificates to remove their names. Safeguards like photos on the electoral list and voter ID cards were in place to prevent multiple voting. Registering internally displaced individuals was not as challenging as anticipated, as few requested replacement identity cards. The majority of displaced people in temporary camps live near their former residences and polling stations, reducing the need for additional polling places. Negative perceptions of the Provisional Electoral Council raised questions about the elections' credibility. President Pr\u00e9val formed a new movement, Inite, after cutting ties with Lespwa. The electoral council was accused of bias in favor of Inite and disqualified 15 rival political groups. An assessment found the CEP capable of organizing elections after the earthquake. The report recommended replacing the CEP due to lack of credibility, but the Preval administration chose not to do so. The OAS/CARICOM mission acknowledged widespread mistrust of the CEP, attributing some shortcomings to previous CEPs and the Preval administration. Previous controversies included barring Aristide's party from elections due to technical reasons. The council rejected all three lists of candidates from different factions within Lavalas because none had documents signed by Aristide, who lives in exile in South Africa. Some believed the decision was politically motivated to prevent Lavalas from gaining more seats in the National Assembly. Despite improvements in transparency and communication by the current CEP, no faction of Fanmi Lavalas attempted to register a presidential candidate for the 2010 elections. Following the first round of elections, improvements were made based on recommendations from observer missions, including firing poll workers involved in fraud, raising education requirements for workers, and cleaning up voter lists. The OAS/CARICOM mission reported positive results after the second round, with fewer issues related to electoral registers and voter intimidation. However, concerns arose about fraud in the tabulation process after the CEP announced results favoring the ruling coalition. After the second round of elections, the OAS/CARICOM mission demanded the annulment of results that favored the ruling coalition in 19 districts. The CEP reverted outcomes in 15 cases, with four seats still unresolved. Concerns were raised about the legitimacy of the government and the need to address irregularities, fraud, and violence. Despite improvements in the voting process, the integrity of the CEP's calculation of legislative election results was questioned. It remains to be seen how Haitian authorities will resolve these issues. The Haitian authorities are facing challenges in resolving disputes over contested legislative seats and preventing fraud in future elections. The ability of the government to conduct elections properly will have a significant impact on the political landscape in Haiti for years to come. Concerns also exist about the newly elected government's ability to manage international aid effectively. Martelly's nationalistic views during the campaign raise questions about his administration's approach to the Interim Haitian Recovery Commission. The Haitian government is facing challenges in managing international aid effectively. There are concerns about the Haitian Development Authority taking over from the Interim Haitian Recovery Commission. Donors worry about potential mismanagement of funds by the government and its impact on foreign assistance. Martelly aims to reduce dependency on foreign aid, but his plans are unclear. There are also concerns about the candidates' relations with the United States and other major donors. President Martelly's vague policy plans raise concerns among major donors and international organizations about potential changes to current development and recovery strategies agreed upon in 2010. Political violence persists during the electoral process, prompting support for reform in the Haitian National Police for citizen security. Martelly's proposal to recreate the Haitian army is met with skepticism due to its history of overthrowing elected leaders. The proposal to reconstitute the Haitian army raises concerns about diverting funds from development programs and respect for human rights, given the army's history of state repression and human rights violations. Both presidential candidates supported creating a national security force, with Martelly suggesting the military replace MINUSTAH and Manigat proposing a phased-out approach. Both presidential candidates in Haiti's final round had ties to de facto military regimes, with Manigat's husband being overthrown by the military after trying to introduce reforms. Martelly, once favored by thugs linked to the Duvalier dictatorship, was associated with sympathizers of a military coup in 1991. The reappearance of the Haitian army raises concerns about human rights violations and diverting funds from development programs. The return of Haiti's divisive leaders, Baby Doc Duvalier and Jean-Bertrand Aristide, has added to electoral tensions. Duvalier faces charges of corruption and human rights violations, while Aristide's return before elections was seen as a distraction by the Obama Administration. Aristide returned to Haiti before the second round of elections, greeted by thousands of supporters. Upon returning to Haiti, Aristide made a speech expressing dissatisfaction with the lack of representation for Lavalas in the elections. He refrained from directly supporting any presidential candidates and maintained a low profile on election day. Pr\u00e9val had previously stated that Aristide could return but would face corruption charges. Both Duvalier and Aristide are viewed as polarizing figures capable of inciting unrest. Haiti's decision to press charges against Duvalier marks a significant step in holding leaders accountable. Duvalier is currently restricted from leaving the country pending a trial. However, prosecuting Duvalier and/or Aristide would strain Haiti's fragile judicial system. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights has offered assistance in the prosecution process. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights has offered to assist Haitian authorities in prosecuting crimes committed during Duvalier's rule. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon emphasized the importance of pursuing legal avenues to hold those responsible for crimes against the people of Haiti accountable. The return of Jean-Claude Duvalier has brought attention to the country's history of State-sponsored violence, and it is crucial for the incoming Administration to continue the progress made in ending political violence and promoting freedom of association and expression. Candidate Martelly's stance on clemency for former leaders in Haiti, citing national reconciliation as a reason, has raised concerns about the impact on the judicial system. The U.N. Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights has suggested the creation of a truth commission to promote national reconciliation in Haiti. Haiti's political instability and fragile economy make it a constant policy issue for the United States. The United States considers Haiti a top priority in the Latin America and Caribbean region, focusing on strengthening democracy, improving security, and promoting economic development. Congressional concerns include aid effectiveness, human rights protection, combating trafficking, addressing migration, and reducing poverty. Congress closely monitors Haiti and has set conditions on assistance, such as supporting the Haitian National Police and ensuring free and fair elections. The United States and other international donors have been involved in Haiti to support the Haitian National Police, ensure free and fair elections, develop human rights monitoring capacity, privatize state-owned enterprises, promote sustainable agricultural development, and establish an economic development fund to encourage U.S. investment. Congress closely monitors Haiti's national election process and provides financial support for long-term development. The United States and other international donors provided $16 million in election support through USAID for Haiti's recent elections. This aid included support for organizing free and fair elections, training for voting center staff, voter education campaigns, and improving communication with the public. Support was provided for various election-related activities in Haiti, including improving communication with the public and press, establishing a call-in information center for voters, supporting community action groups for civic education and voter turnout, assisting political parties in competing effectively, organizing election observation, and facilitating presidential debates for voter information access. USAID supported election-related activities in Haiti, including presidential debates, procurement of election materials, and programs for electoral reform. Minor additional costs were expected for improvements in the second round based on recommendations from observers. Additional funding was sought from other donors by UNDP and OAS."
