    "content": "CONVEYANCE TO LANDER COUNTY, NEVADA. Congress finds that the historical use of Kingston Cemetery predates Forest Service jurisdiction, and it is appropriate for local ownership. The Forest Service has conveyed 1.25 acres to the Town of Kingston for historic gravesites, with additional parcels for unmarked gravesites and future space. The Forest Service will convey approximately 8.75 acres to Lander County, Nevada for the Kingston Cemetery, as part of the original permit issued. The conveyance is subject to conditions and must be completed within 90 days of the enactment of the Act. The parcel of National Forest System land known as \"Kingston Cemetery\" will be conveyed to Lander County, Nevada, consisting of approximately 10 acres. The county will be granted an easement for access to the cemetery, and must continue to use the land as a cemetery. If the county fails to do so, the land may revert back to the Secretary of the Interior. If the county uses the land for any purpose other than as a cemetery, the parcel will revert to the United States and the easement granted to the county will be revoked. The Secretary has the authority to waive these provisions if it is in the best interests of the United States. The conveyance to Eureka County, Nevada is outlined in Section 2. Congress finds that the historical use of Maiden's Grave Cemetery predates the Bureau of Land Management's jurisdiction. It is deemed appropriate for local public ownership rather than federal permitting. The Secretary of the Interior is required to convey the cemetery to Eureka County, Nevada within 90 days. The United States will convey the Maiden's Grave Cemetery, a 10-acre parcel of public land in Eureka County, Nevada, to the county for no cost. The county will receive an easement for access to the cemetery, and must ensure its appropriate use and maintenance. The county must continue using the conveyed parcel as a cemetery. If the county uses the parcel for any other purpose, title reverts to the United States and the easement is revoked, unless the Secretary waives this requirement in the best interests of the United States. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
