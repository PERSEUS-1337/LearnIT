Section 21200 of the Financial Code is amended to set limits on pawnbroker charges, including a maximum of 3% per month on unpaid loan balances and a $3 monthly charge when the 3% rate is lower. Additionally, a loan setup fee of $5 or 3% (up to $30 maximum) can be charged for each loan. The Schedule of Charges for pawnbrokers includes a maximum of 3% per month on unpaid loan balances and a $3 monthly charge when the 3% rate is lower. Additionally, a loan setup fee of $5 or 3% (up to $30 maximum) can be charged for each loan. The Schedule of Charges for pawnbrokers allows for varying charges on loans based on the loan amount for a maximum of three months. Charges range from $3 for loans up to $19.99 to $12 for loans of $75 or more, but not exceeding $99.99. The Schedule of Charges for pawnbrokers allows for fees ranging from $15 on loans of $100 or more, up to $9 percent on loans of $175 or more, not exceeding $2,499.99 for a maximum of three months. Charges for contract extensions must follow Section 21200 guidelines and be posted visibly. Section 21200.6 of the Financial Code is amended to allow pawnbrokers to collect handling and storage charges for pawned articles at redemption or when issuing a replacement loan. Charges range from $1 for items within one cubic foot to $20 for items exceeding six cubic feet, with additional charges for each extra cubic foot. Section 21201 of the Financial Code is amended to require pawnbrokers to provide a written contract for loans secured by pledged goods, with a minimum loan period of four months. The contract must inform the pledgor of their right to redeem the pledge during the loan period and include a notice in boldface type above the pledgor's signature space. \"You can redeem your pledged property by paying the loan amount and charges accrued until the redemption date, which must be at least four months from the loan start date.\" Every pawnbroker must keep pledged items for the loan period. The pledgor can redeem the items by paying the loan amount and charges. If agreed in writing, pawned property can be stored off premises and must be returned within two business days upon redemption request. If a pledged article is not redeemed during the loan period, the pawnbroker must notify the pledgor within one month. Failure to notify within this time frame means no interest can be charged. The pledgor must be notified by mail or electronically, with a 10-day redemption period. The pawnbroker must provide electronic notice of the termination of the loan period to the pledgor, who must confirm their current electronic address. The 10-day notice must be sent in a specific format and includes an extension if the tenth day falls on a closed day for the pawnshop. The pawnbroker must inform the pledgor that they can request a notice of loan termination by registered mail. If the pledged item is not redeemed within 10 days, the pawnbroker gains ownership and can sell it. Selling pledged property without ownership is a misdemeanor. The Financial Code is amended to allow pawnbrokers to charge a fee for preparing notices if the pledgor fails to redeem pawned items. Representatives of the pawnbroker industry must gather data on the financial condition of the California pawn industry annually. The Financial Code is amended to allow pawnbrokers to charge a fee for preparing notices if the pledgor fails to redeem pawned items. No reimbursement is required by this act as it creates new crimes or infractions, changes penalties, or definitions of crimes."
