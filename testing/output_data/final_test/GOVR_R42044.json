    "content": "When awarding franchises for cable television service, local jurisdictions often require cable companies to reserve channel capacity for public access, educational, or governmental use (PEG channels). These channels offer a variety of programming beyond city council meetings and are available to subscribers of over 1,500 U.S. cable systems. PEG channels are not federally mandated but are allowed by the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984. The environment for PEG channels has been impacted by policy and budget changes, as well as technological advancements in cable networks. Over 100 PEG access centers have closed since 2005, with others facing funding cuts. Without programming from these centers, PEG channels may struggle to operate. Some subscribers now have difficulty accessing PEG programming, but not all centers and channels are affected, as many still have stable funding sources. American Community Television estimates that over 1,500 PEG access centers in the US manage 5,000 cable television PEG channels, airing 20,000 hours of local programs weekly. Despite outnumbering public broadcast TV stations, PEG channels have small audiences. Most centers have minimal staff and rely on volunteers, with one-third operating on budgets under $100,000. Several PEG Access Centers in the US with budgets under $100,000 have closed since 2005, with more facing financial threats due to state franchising laws. These closures are linked to laws allowing cable systems to obtain statewide franchises, impacting funding for PEG access channels. Some state franchising laws have impacted PEG provisions in local franchise agreements, leading to closures of PEG Access Centers with budgets under $100,000 in the US since 2005. The laws allow cable systems to obtain statewide franchises, affecting funding for PEG access channels. The FCC determined that local franchise authorities had set overly burdensome requirements for PEG support, concluding that LFAs could require cable systems to provide \"satisfactory or sufficient\" PEG support but not \"significant\" support. The FCC also stated that any PEG-related assessment not a capital cost must be subtracted from the 5% franchise fee cap, defining capital costs as those associated with the construction of PEG access facilities. Payments in support of PEG access facilities are considered franchise fees and subject to the cap. PEG access facilities are subject to a 5 percent cap on franchise fees, affecting funding for PEG operations by cable companies. Some local jurisdictions are facing budget cuts, especially those without franchising authority. This has led to a reduction in PEG funding support. According to the ACD/Benton Survey, many PEG access centers have seen a decrease in funding between 2005 and 2010 due to state laws. However, some centers have experienced an increase in public access funding, with 55% reporting an increase in funding over the past two years. Systematic data on the financial strength of PEG access centers is lacking. Many PEG access centers face funding challenges, with some experiencing significant reductions. Cable systems incur costs for providing PEG channels, leading them to minimize capacity allocated to PEG channels. Data on the extent of these costs is lacking. The PEG provisions in the Communications Act impact cable service providers like Comcast, Time Warner, AT&T, and Verizon. AT&T has argued that its video service should not be subject to cable franchise agreements, but courts have ruled otherwise. The Connecticut legislature enacted a new Video Franchise Act requiring AT&T to obtain a video franchise before providing service in the state, rendering a district court decision moot. Cable service providers are transitioning from analog to digital transmission, offering popular channels in both formats while choosing not to allocate network capacity for less popular programming like PEG channels. Many cable operators are moving PEG channels to digital tiers, requiring subscribers with analog TVs to get a set-top box. Some operators charge for these boxes, leading to objections from PEG advocates and local jurisdictions. They argue that this goes against franchise agreements and the Communications Act's requirement for basic programming to be available at a low price. AT&T and other cable industry players are facing petitions from groups requesting PEG channels to be included in basic service tiers. AT&T's U-verse service uses IP technology to deliver video streams, but offering PEG programming through this method is deemed costly. The FCC has not yet issued any rulings on these petitions. AT&T has chosen to offer PEG programming in a different fashion by placing all PEG programming for a metropolitan area on a single channel (99). Viewers must navigate through menus to access specific programs, leading to difficulties for visually impaired viewers and limitations such as inability to record on a DVR and impaired picture quality. Some PEG advocates and local jurisdictions argue that this method is inferior and discriminatory, not meeting the requirements of local franchise agreements or the Communications Act. The Alliance for Community Media and other parties petitioned the FCC regarding AT&T's discrimination against PEG programming. AT&T argued that U-verse is not subject to PEG requirements and meets all necessary standards. The FCC has yet to issue a ruling on the petition. PEG access channel requirements do not apply to DBS systems like DirecTV and DISH Network. DBS, a satellite service, is not subject to cable franchising requirements and does not need public rights of way. Satellite operators must offer local broadcast TV station signals but not PEG channels. PEG programming can be distributed online, but this may not align with the goal of promoting localism as Internet access is not universal. The Communications Act has four key sections related to PEG access channels, allowing franchising authorities to establish requirements for PEG use. Enforcement includes ensuring channel capacity is designated for PEG use and enforcing franchise provisions for services related to PEG use. Section 621 of the Communications Act allows franchising authorities to require cable operators to provide adequate PEG access channel capacity, facilities, or financial support. Section 622 sets a cap on franchise fees at 5% of gross revenues, excluding payments for PEG access facilities or capital costs. Franchise authorities can impose PEG costs on cable providers above the 5% franchise fee limit. Cable operators must offer a basic service tier with PEG access programming, subject to price regulation if there is no FCC determination of effective competition. In the 112th Congress, the CAP Act was introduced to preserve community access. LaTourette introduced the Community Access Preservation (CAP) Act, H.R. 1746, to address state franchising laws impacting PEG access centers and consumer access to PEG channels. The bill allowed local governments to require cable companies to provide a certain number of channels for PEG use. The cable operator must provide support to the subdivision for PEG use, not exceeding certain limits based on previous support amounts or a percentage of gross revenues. This support can be in the form of cash payments, in-kind support, or free services, and must be adjusted for inflation. The support provided must be dedicated to PEG use of channel capacity. The definition of \"franchise fee\" was modified to exclude payments for PEG access facilities. Local jurisdictions can impose PEG-related fees in addition to the 5% franchise fee. Cable operators must carry PEG signals without degradation or altering content. Signals must be viewable by all subscribers. The cable operator must provide PEG signals to all subscribers without extra charges, prohibiting them from moving PEG channels to a digital tier and charging for set-top boxes. They must also offer transmission services to local governments for free. Local jurisdictions and states have the authority to enforce these provisions. The FCC must analyze the impact of state franchising laws and digital technology on PEG use of cable systems. Recommendations for preserving localism and PEG use in advanced communication systems, including broadband, are required. Additionally, recommendations for PEG channel accessibility and placement after cable systems convert to fully digital delivery are needed. The definition of cable service was modified to include AT&T's U-verse service. The National Cable & Telecommunications Association opposed the bill, while PEG advocates supported it. The National Cable & Telecommunications Association (NCTA) opposed the bill, while PEG advocates supported it. Limited data exist on the impact of public policy, budgetary, and technological changes on PEG channels. Comprehensive data on PEG financial support sources are not available. The FCC did not measure the extent of cable companies' contributions to PEG operating expenses. The FCC and stakeholders have not estimated the scale of funding cutbacks for PEG access centers due to state laws and budget constraints. The impact of funding cuts has led to some centers closing, but the opportunity costs of allocating channels for PEG use have not been quantified by the cable industry or the FCC. The funding cutbacks for PEG access centers due to state laws and budget constraints have led to some centers closing. The opportunity costs associated with PEG channels are likely small, as they attract small audiences. Despite challenges, PEG programming is valued by some viewers and seen as having public benefits by Congress. However, public policy changes are threatening the financial viability of PEG access centers. Since 2006, 21 states have enacted laws establishing statewide cable franchises, impacting the financial viability of PEG access centers. These laws were motivated by the desire to streamline the franchising process and reduce the role of local jurisdictions. Some state laws were implemented to facilitate market entry for telecom companies like Verizon and AT&T by allowing them to obtain a single statewide franchise. These laws also aim to provide competitive parity for incumbent cable systems by allowing them to transition to statewide franchises. Differences exist among state laws regarding requirements for cable companies, including PEG channel capacity and financial support. Some laws have sunset provisions for PEG support, while others set caps on support without eliminating it. Some state laws set caps on PEG support requirements for cable operators, such as Texas with 1% of gross cable revenues and Virginia with 1.5%. In California, local jurisdictions can still require a PEG fee of up to 1% of franchisee's gross revenues but cannot mandate non-cash support like PEG studios. PEG advocates claim that major cable companies have stopped providing studios in California, leading to the closure of access centers in 51 communities. In California, 51 communities have closed access centers due to major cable companies stopping support. Some communities like Long Beach have reopened access centers with the help of local arts organizations and foundations. State laws in Indiana, Illinois, Georgia, Texas, and Michigan have affected PEG requirements, leading to closures of PEG access centers by cable operators. Some states have set minimum programming requirements for PEG channels while eliminating or capping cable company support. For example, Georgia has eliminated PEG support requirements, while Texas and Michigan have capped support requirements. Time Warner stopped airing San Antonio Public Access in Texas. In Texas, Time Warner ceased airing San Antonio Public Access due to the channel's inability to meet the 8-hour non-repeat daily programming requirement. LFAs and PEG advocates argue that new laws have led to limitations on PEG fees, elimination of free access to video equipment and studio space, removal of cable company staff from access centers, degraded signal quality, and inferior channel placement for PEG channels. Some advocates and local governments believe statewide requirements do not adequately serve their communities. State laws have had a significant impact on PEG support in local communities, with reductions in funding and resources. Alternative sources like private donations may not be enough to replace the loss in cable company support, potentially threatening the existence of PEG access centers and channels. The CAP Act legislation introduced in the 112th Congress addresses some of these concerns. The CAP Act legislation introduced in the 112th Congress aimed to address the impact of state laws on PEG support. It included provisions allowing local governments to require cable operators to provide a certain number of channels for PEG use, even if state laws limited such requirements. The cable industry opposed these provisions. The CAP Act proposed PEG requirements beyond state laws, opposed by NCTA for cost concerns and competitive disadvantage. FCC rules in 2007 restricted local franchising authorities on cable service provider applications. The FCC's actions in 2007 aimed to promote competition in cable services by preventing franchising authorities from unreasonably refusing competitive franchises. The orders were intended to facilitate entry of new competitors into video service markets and enhance broadband development. The FCC acknowledged limited evidence for some restrictive requirements and cited disputes over contributions to PEG services as potential barriers to video deployment. The FCC's actions in 2007 aimed to promote competition in cable services by preventing franchising authorities from unreasonably refusing competitive franchises. The orders were intended to facilitate entry of new competitors into video service markets and enhance broadband development. The support of PEG services and equipment was seen as impeding video deployment and leading to unreasonable refusal of competitive franchises. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the FCC's decision, stating that costs related to PEG equipment should be considered capital costs.

The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the FCC's decision, stating that costs related to PEG equipment should be considered capital costs. PEG advocates argue for a broader interpretation of franchise requirements beyond the 5% fee cap, citing legislative history that suggests cable franchisees can be required to pay for non-capital PEG-related requirements. The Communications Act does not clearly define capital costs or service costs, leading to uncertainty about additional assessments that LFAs may impose on cable franchisees. Many franchise agreements historically required payment for non-capital PEG-related costs like salaries, training, and maintenance. Cable franchisees may deduct these PEG costs from the 5% franchise fee they pay LFAs. The impact of FCC rules on PEG funding and financial viability remains difficult to measure due to a lack of data collection by the FCC, PEG community, and cable industry.

The CAP Act introduced in the 112th Congress aimed to remove funding limitations and set higher caps on PEG funding that local jurisdictions could require. The CAP Act introduced in the 112th Congress aimed to remove funding limitations and set higher caps on PEG funding that local jurisdictions could require. NCTA opposed these provisions, claiming they would increase cable company costs and put them at a competitive disadvantage with satellite operators. AT&T offers its U-verse service using an all-IP technology platform, which is a less capital-intensive alternative. AT&T's U-verse network uses IP technology to deliver video streams to subscribers, allowing them to select specific channels from a centralized video hub office. The network's main limitation is the capacity of the copper loop, currently supporting up to two high-definition channels per household. AT&T's U-verse network delivers video streams using IP technology, limited by the capacity of the copper loop. Currently, it can only provide up to two high-definition channels per household. To offer this service, AT&T must encode program signals using MPEG-4 compression methods, incurring additional costs for equipment and server capacity for each additional video stream. AT&T incurs additional costs for encoding equipment and server capacity for each additional video stream on its U-verse network, which is limited to two high-definition channels per household. The incremental equipment cost for offering multiple PEG channels in a large metropolitan area is lower compared to cable or broadcast networks. AT&T incurs additional costs for encoding equipment and server capacity for each additional video stream on its U-verse network. The upfront incremental cost of offering multiple PEG channels could be several million dollars. Instead of offering multiple PEG channels, AT&T has created a separate platform with a single channel, channel 99, for subscribers to access PEG programming. Subscribers can choose from PEG programs by selecting their local jurisdiction from a menu on channel 99. The selected program is then downloaded to the user's set-top box. PEG advocates have raised concerns about this system. PEG advocates have raised concerns about AT&T's PEG platform, citing issues such as substantial delays in accessing PEG programs, lack of seamless integration with non-PEG programming, absence of PEG programming on AT&T's program guide, and limited accessibility for hearing-impaired and visually-impaired viewers. The AT&T PEG platform lacks DVR recording capability and has lower picture quality compared to commercial channels. PEG advocates have filed petitions with the FCC regarding the distribution method of PEG channels over AT&T's U-verse system. In September 2010, the Commission received petitions regarding PEG inaccessibility for the blind and visually impaired over AT&T's U-verse service. American Community Television called for specific PEG commitments as a condition for the AT&T/T-Mobile merger approval. AT&T has opposed the petitions, citing differences in network architecture. AT&T argues that its U-verse service meets PEG requirements despite not being a cable service. It provides benefits such as access to PEG programming from all local jurisdictions, a prime channel location on channel 99, and digital format for easy web use. Dueling videos online showcase differing views on the virtues and vices of AT&T's U-verse service. The CAP Act introduced in the 112th Congress did not directly address issues related to PEG accessibility on AT&T's U-verse service. However, it would have ensured that PEG channels provided by AT&T included closed captioning for the hearing impaired. A network transmits video, voice, and data signals over fiber or cable to governmental and educational users. Local governments may require cable operators to support an institutional network as a condition for franchise approval. Cable operators can allocate channel capacity for educational or governmental use as per the Communications Act. In the past, cable systems were designed for one-way TV transmission, but now operators dedicate channels or build separate systems for educational and governmental purposes. Cable systems today are built as hybrid fiber/coaxial networks with high capacity and two-way capabilities. Local governments are acquiring \"dark\" optical fibers to provide broadband capacity at low cost. These new I-nets support high-speed internet, data sharing, and video transmission among city departments. The curr_chunk discusses the various uses of I-nets, including video conferencing, distance learning, vocational training, medical imaging, and more. According to a fact sheet by the Baller Herbst Law Group, 56% of communities with I-nets reported benefits such as direct access to long distance providers and advanced library services. In 48 communities with I-nets, the cable operator, telephone company, or local government built and owns/maintains the I-net. Statewide franchising laws may not require new entrants to provide I-nets if the incumbent cable company already has them. Statewide franchising laws may reduce or eliminate I-net requirements in local franchise agreements, potentially impacting educational and governmental access channels. A survey by the Alliance for Community Media found that 26% of respondents reported a loss of public cable drops and 41% reported a reduction in services to I-nets connecting PEG facilities to schools and government institutions. The online survey on cable providers' I-net requirements was likely influenced by reductions in support and recent FCC orders creating ambiguity about capital costs."
