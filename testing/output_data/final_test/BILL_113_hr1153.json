    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Water Infrastructure Now Public-Private Partnership Act\" or the \"WIN P3 Act\". Congress recognizes the importance of investing in water infrastructure for property protection, economic growth through inland waterways maintenance, and the need for innovative financing to address fiscal challenges. This includes projects like lock and dam modernization on the upper Mississippi River. Lock and dam modernization on the upper Mississippi River and Illinois River is a long-term project with benefits not expected until 2047. The Corps of Engineers has a backlog of over $60 billion in projects. Any public investment in water infrastructure projects must be safeguarded when exploring innovative financing options. The Water Infrastructure Now Pilot Program is established under Section 3. The Secretary of the Army will establish a pilot program to assess cost-effectiveness and efficiency by allowing non-Federal entities to carry out flood damage reduction, hurricane and storm damage reduction, and navigation projects. The program aims to identify project delivery alternatives, evaluate efficiencies of non-Federal entities managing projects, and explore decentralization of decision-making processes within the Corps of Engineers. The Secretary will identify up to 15 flood damage reduction, hurricane and storm damage reduction, and navigation projects for a pilot program. The Secretary will notify relevant committees upon project identification and consult with non-Federal interests. The Secretary will develop project management plans for identified projects in consultation with non-Federal interests. They may enter into project partnership agreements for non-Federal interests to have control over construction. The Secretary will transfer unobligated project funds to non-Federal interests for construction, retaining enough for Corps of Engineers responsibilities. Additional funds may be provided from section 5. The Secretary will transfer unobligated project funds to non-Federal interests for construction, monitoring each project to ensure compliance with approved plans and reasonable costs. Up to 12 projects with delays or missed schedules may receive Federal funds. The Act specifies that projects with delays, missed deadlines, or unobligated funding balances in the Corps of Engineers construction account may not receive Federal funding for recapitalization and modernization if they are deemed significant to the national economy by the Secretary. The Secretary may provide technical assistance to non-Federal interests for projects significant to the national economy, including studies, engineering activities, design, and permit acquisition. Waivers may be granted for such projects. The Secretary has the authority to waive or modify federal regulations for projects in the pilot program if it provides public and financial benefits. The Secretary must notify specific committees each time a waiver or modification is issued. Additionally, a public benefit study must be conducted before entering into a project partnership. Before entering into a project partnership agreement, the Secretary must arrange for an independent assessment to determine if the agreement would provide better public and financial benefits than traditional funding. The assessment must be completed within 90 days, consider input from various stakeholders, and make recommendations on the partnership. The Secretary must conduct an independent assessment before entering into a project partnership agreement to determine if it will benefit the public and provide financial advantages. A report detailing the pilot program's results must be submitted to the relevant committees within 2 years of the Act's enactment. The Secretary must conduct an independent assessment before entering into a project partnership agreement to determine if it will benefit the public and provide financial advantages. A report detailing the pilot program's results must be submitted to the relevant committees within 2 years of the Act's enactment. The program under this section, including any recommendations from the Secretary, should be evaluated for national implementation. All laws that apply to the Secretary also apply to a non-Federal interest carrying out a project under this Act. The authority to commence a project under this Act terminates 5 years after its enactment. SEC. 4. APPLICABILITY.\n\nNo privatization of Federal assets authorized.\n\nSEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\nSums necessary for Act implementation authorized."
