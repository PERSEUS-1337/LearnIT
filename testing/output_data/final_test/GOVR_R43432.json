    "content": "The EXPIRE Act (S. 2260) aimed to extend expired tax provisions, including bonus depreciation, through 2015. However, the bill did not progress in the Senate as a motion to end debate on it was rejected on May 15, 2014. Another bill, the Tax Extenders Act of 2013 (S. 1859), introduced by Senate Majority Leader Reid, sought to extend expiring tax provisions through 2014. In the House, Chairman Dave Camp's Tax Reform Act of 2014 made some extenders permanent but not bonus depreciation, while also restricting depreciation deductions. The Jobs for America Act (H.R. 4) combined separate bills, including bonus depreciation, which was not in the original draft. Temporary tax provisions, known as \"extenders,\" have been repeatedly extended without evaluation, leading some to believe they are actually permanent. The latest extenders bill includes bonus depreciation for an extension. The latest extenders bill includes bonus depreciation for an extension, creating ambiguity about its temporary nature and effectiveness. House proposals add to this ambiguity by either eliminating or making bonus depreciation permanent. The status of bonus depreciation as a temporary provision is in question if included in the extenders package. The report discusses bonus depreciation as either a temporary stimulus provision or a permanent part of the tax code, with implications for capital income treatment, tax rates, reform proposals, and revenue issues. Tax depreciation rules determine how investment costs are deducted over time to match profits accurately. The tax law contains rules for deducting asset costs over time, with methods like straight line and declining balance. Faster methods apply higher rates to the undepreciated balance, allowing for a switch to straight line depreciation at any time. Depreciation rules, set in the Tax Reform Act of 1986, allow for accelerated deductions to offset inflation. For non-residential buildings, inflation effects are offset by increased tax lives. Tax depreciation is more generous than economic depreciation, with costs deducted over short periods and under accelerated methods. The effective tax rate for the firm is equal to the statutory rate for an equity investment if tax depreciation equals economic depreciation in present value. Most equipment is depreciated over 5 or 7 years using the double declining balance method. Tax depreciation rules vary depending on the asset's lifespan, with longer-lived assets depreciated over 10, 15, or 20 years, and shorter-lived property over 3 years. Assets over 10 years are depreciated using the 150% declining balance method. A half-year convention is applied, allowing only half of the full year's depreciation in the first year. Buildings are depreciated using the straight-line method, with commercial and industrial buildings over 39 years and residential buildings over 27.5 years. Bonus depreciation allows immediate deduction of a fraction of the cost, such as half of equipment purchased in 2013. Bonus depreciation, similar to accelerated depreciation, allows for immediate deduction of a portion of the cost of an asset purchased and placed in service in 2013. This lowers the tax burden on new investments, with half of the cost deducted immediately and the remaining amount deducted over 10 years. Although general bonus depreciation has expired for most property, certain types of property are still eligible through 2014. Bonus depreciation is often discussed alongside provisions for more generous depreciation and expensing of a limited dollar amount of investment. Bonus depreciation was first enacted in 2002 at a 30% rate to stimulate investment during an economic slowdown. It was increased to 50% in 2003 but expired in 2005. In 2008, a single year of 50% bonus depreciation was enacted to stimulate the economy. In 2008, a single year of 50% bonus depreciation was enacted to stimulate the economy. Bonus depreciation was extended through 2009 as part of a larger stimulus package that included individual tax credits and spending increases. It was further extended retroactively through 2010 by the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010. The 2010 Small Business Jobs Act included bonus depreciation, which was more beneficial to large firms due to higher allowances for small businesses. The extension of bonus depreciation was mostly retroactive, providing a windfall to firms rather than a stimulus. Additionally, at the end of 2010, various tax provisions, including the Bush tax cuts and stimulus provisions from 2009, were set to expire. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Compensation Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended the Bush tax cuts, education provisions, child credit, and earned income credit for two years. It also increased bonus depreciation to 100% for 2010-2011 and 50% for 2012, along with extending Section 179 expensing. The legislation reduced the employee's share of the payroll tax by two percentage points, aiming to stimulate the economy during a slow recovery. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-240) made most of the Bush tax cuts permanent and extended bonus depreciation for another year, among other things, to address concerns about a potential \"fiscal cliff\" at the end of 2012. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 made most of the Bush tax cuts permanent and extended bonus depreciation for another year, among other things, to address concerns about a potential \"fiscal cliff\" at the end of 2012. The legislation introducing bonus depreciation was associated with fiscal stimulus bills, creating uncertainty about its future as either a temporary stimulus or a permanent provision. Investment incentives may be ineffective during a recession with idle capital. The temporary nature of bonus depreciation makes it a more effective fiscal stimulus during a recession with idle capital. However, the continual extension of the provision for six years may undermine its future effectiveness. Evidence suggests that the temporary bonus depreciation enacted in 2002 had little to no effect on business investment. The temporary bonus depreciation enacted in 2002 had little to no effect on business investment. Several reasons were suggested for this small effect, including firms without taxable income not benefiting from the timing advantage, the subsidy being ineffective for many firms due to losses and loss carry-overs, and the incentive effect reducing the user cost of capital by only about 3%. Compliance costs and long planning periods were also cited as factors contributing to the limited impact of the provision. The temporary bonus depreciation enacted in 2002 had limited impact on business investment due to various factors. Studies by House and Shapiro, Cohen and Cummins, and Hulse and Livingstone showed mixed results on the effectiveness of bonus depreciation, with differing views on its overall economic effect. Cohen and Cummins' surveys indicated that a majority of firms saw no effect on investment timing. Forecasters also varied in their assessments of the impact of different tax and spending provisions. Forecasters vary in the multipliers they assign to different tax and spending provisions. CBO indicated a multiplier of 0.15 for business tax cuts and 0.6 for expensing during the fiscal cliff discussion. Bonus depreciation had a multiplier of 0.2 according to Zandi, which was less effective in providing short-term economic stimulus compared to other provisions like payroll taxes and unemployment insurance. Bonus depreciation may not be very effective in providing short-term economic stimulus compared to other alternatives. Concerns exist about its effectiveness when extended retroactively, as it can result in a windfall that does not impact investment. Enacting a retroactive extension for 2014 would have windfall elements. If bonus depreciation is made permanent, it can affect the size and allocation of the capital stock by lowering the tax rate on equipment relative to other depreciable assets. The impact of depreciation rules on tax burdens is typically measured by considering the influence on the required return to break even on an investment. The effective tax rate is the pre-tax return minus the after-tax return, divided by the pre-tax return. Table 1 shows estimated effective tax rates for nonresidential equipment and structures with and without bonus depreciation. Equipment assets generally have favorable tax depreciation rules, with effective tax rates falling as low as 17% but generally around the mid-20s, well below the 35% statutory rate. Public utility structures and farm structures are treated as equipment in the tax. The tax code treats public utility structures and farm structures as equipment with lower tax rates. Non-residential buildings are taxed at or above the statutory rate, while residential buildings are taxed at around 32%. Bonus depreciation benefits equipment, resulting in effective tax rates ranging from 9% to 21%. Tax rates for equipment tend to be higher for less durable assets due to inflation. Bonus depreciation reduces effective rates more for assets with higher initial rates. For example, autos are initially taxed at a 34% rate. The tax code treats different types of assets differently, with bonus depreciation benefiting equipment the most. This results in effective tax rates ranging from 9% to 21%. Bonus depreciation reduces tax rates more for assets with higher initial rates, such as autos taxed at a 34% rate. With bonus depreciation as a permanent part of the tax cost, the effective tax rate on equipment falls from 26% to 15%. Partial expensing reduces taxable income by 9% for domestic production in certain industries, resulting in a 3.15 percentage point reduction in the statutory tax rate. It lowers the effective tax rate for equipment by about 2.5 percentage points to around 23%, and with bonus depreciation by 1.6 percentage points to around 13%. Full expensing of investments is favored by some as a step towards a consumption tax. Expensing of investments under a consumption tax proposal by President Bush's Advisory Panel can lead to negative tax rates on debt-financed investments. Interest payments would no longer be deductible for firms, resulting in no taxes collected at the firm level if economic depreciation and no inflation are present. Accelerated depreciation methods like expensing can cause a negative tax rate at the firm level, as profits are taxed at a lower rate while interest is deducted at the statutory rate. The tax rate and interest deductions can lead to potentially negative tax rates with inflation. The individual tax rate on interest is 23%, resulting in an after-tax nominal interest of 6.64%. The firm's after-tax real cost of debt is 2.875%. The effective tax rate can result in negative tax rates on debt-financed investments, especially with accelerated depreciation. Bonus depreciation can further increase the negative tax rate, from -19% to -37%. The U.S. corporate tax rate is criticized for being the highest in the world, discouraging investment. The combined federal and state statutory tax rate is 39.2% in the U.S. compared to 28.4% in other OECD countries. The domestic production activities deduction could lower the U.S. rate to 36.3%. Marginal effective tax rates for different asset categories are estimated to be similar. The U.S. effective marginal tax rate is 22.2% compared to 16.4% in the OECD. With the Section 199 deduction, it drops to 20.2%. The domestic production activities deduction applies to manufacturing, construction, and extraction, reducing the effective tax rate by 4-6 percentage points. The largest differences are seen in inventories. Incorporating bonus depreciation reduces overall tax rates by two percentage points, leaving effective marginal rates very close together. For equipment, tax rates are two to four percentage points larger; bonus depreciation lowers the U.S. rate to six to seven percentage points below the OECD average. Various income tax reform proposals, including the Wyden-Coats bill, Senate Finance Committee discussion draft, and a draft proposal by Dave Camp, aim to broaden the base and lower the rate. The tax reform proposals by Dave Camp, Wyden-Coats, and the Senate involve broadening the base to lower rates and reforming depreciation. Camp's proposal aims to lower the tax rate to 25%, while Wyden-Coats suggests a 24% rate. The Wyden-Coats bill proposes returning to the alternative depreciation system with longer lives and straight-line depreciation, resulting in estimated effective tax rates of 36% for equipment and 34% for structures. The Senate Finance Committee discussion draft proposes a system with open-ended pools of aggregated assets, applying depreciation rates to achieve economic depreciation. Chairman Camp's tax reform draft also suggests moving to the alternative depreciation system, indexing depreciation for inflation, and limiting deductions to recovery of the original basis. This would result in accelerated depreciation dependent on the inflation rate, with a slight acceleration due to current low inflation. The estimated tax rates for equipment, structures, and overall would be lower by about one percentage point compared with a move to the alternative depreciation system. The Wyden-Coats bill and the Camp proposal would reduce the statutory tax rate to 24% and 25% respectively, imposing a 24% effective rate on equipment and structures overall. Some suggest that temporary extensions of traditional provisions are preferred due to lower revenue costs compared to permanent extensions. The cost of bonus depreciation and Section 179 expensing would be slightly larger each year, but overall cost is lower compared to a 10-year budget horizon. Table 4 shows initial revenue loss from bonus depreciation, offset by gains in following years. Table 5 shows a new round of investment each year with declining revenue loss. The estimates in Table 4 and Table 5 show the cost of bonus depreciation and Section 179 expensing, with bonus depreciation accounting for about 90% of the total cost. The latest CBO estimate indicates a revenue cost of $263 billion for a permanent extension of bonus depreciation for FY2014-FY2024, making bonus depreciation about 76% of the total cost. The cost of a one year extension of bonus depreciation for FY2014-FY2024 is $5 billion, less than 2% of the cost of a permanent provision which is $263 billion. The Joint Committee on Taxation confirmed the estimate for the extension. The cost of a permanent extension is larger than the steady state cost due to interactions with other provisions. The cost declines over time as more revenue gain occurs from previous investments. The cost of a one-year extension of bonus depreciation for FY2014-FY2024 is $5 billion, less than 2% of the cost of a permanent provision which is $263 billion. The cost declines over time as more revenue gain occurs from previous investments. The permanent cost would be around 40% of the totals in Table 5, or $140 billion, with bonus depreciation at $105 billion. Most expiring provisions see revenue costs rise over time under a permanent extension. The analysis involves determining the pre-tax rate of return by discounting after-tax profit flows using a continuous time method with continuous compounding. The formula derived from this method is used to calculate the pre-tax rate of return. The method for calculating the pre-tax rate of return involves factors such as after-tax real discount rate, economic depreciation rate, statutory tax rate, and present value of depreciation deductions. The effective tax rate for different financing methods is also considered, with equations for equity and debt financing outlined. The after-tax real rate of return is calculated using various factors such as dividend rate, growth rate, tax rates, and total tax rate. Assumptions include interest rate, inflation rate, real return to equity, corporate rate, and individual marginal tax rate on investment income. For a detailed methodology and data sources, refer to [author name scrubbed], The Economic Effects of Taxing Capital Income, MIT Press, 1994. The average individual marginal tax rate on investment income is 23%, with tax rates on dividends and capital gains at 15%. Half of corporate stock is sold, the remaining half held until death, with a holding period of five years. Half of financial assets are held in tax-exempt forms. The effective tax rate can be calculated for 50% expensing by measuring z in equation (1) as 0.5(1+z), transforming the effect into a relationship between effective tax rates. The effective tax rate can be reduced by somewhat over 40% with the 50% bonus depreciation provision. By solving equations, the new tax rate with bonus depreciation is calculated as 0.5 times the effective tax rate under normal circumstances. Determining the useful life in the Camp Depreciation Proposal involves estimating the present value of depreciation. The formula to calculate the useful life in continuous time is T* = (ln(1+ \u03c0T))/ \u03c0, where T* is the point where 100% of the cost is recovered, T is the life for determining the straight line rate, and \u03c0 is the inflation rate."
