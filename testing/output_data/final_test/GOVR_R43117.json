It oversees industry self-regulatory organizations and requires registration of industry firms and personnel. The CFTC was established in 1974 to regulate commodities futures and options markets, overseeing industry self-regulatory organizations. Since the Dodd-Frank Act, its jurisdiction has expanded to include OTC derivatives, requiring registration of swap market participants and clearing of certain swaps. The CFTC does not directly regulate the securities market like the SEC. The CFTC, established in 1974, regulates commodities futures and options markets, with expanded jurisdiction post-Dodd-Frank Act to include OTC derivatives. It does not directly regulate securities like the SEC. Derivatives trading mostly involves financial variables, overseen by congressional Agriculture Committees. CFTC appropriations fall under Agriculture and Financial Services subcommittees. Additional funding has been requested since FY2011 for oversight of swaps. P.L. 112-10 provided $202 million for the CFTC in FY2011, a 20% increase. The CFTC has received varying appropriations since FY2011. In FY2012, the President requested $308 million, but P.L. 112-55 provided $205.3 million. The enacted amount for FY2013 was also $205.3 million, reduced to about $199.7 million due to rescissions. The Administration is requesting $315 million for FY2014. The Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration and Related Agencies approved a bill providing $194.6 million for the CFTC. The CFTC is led by five commissioners appointed by the President, with staggered five-year terms. The agency is organized into four divisions: Clearing and Risk, Enforcement, Market Oversight. The CFTC is organized into four divisions: Clearing and Risk, Enforcement, Market Oversight, and Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight. The agency faces various issues related to rulemakings under the Dodd-Frank Act and overseeing derivatives markets, sparking debate and legislation. The CFTC faces challenges related to rulemakings under the Dodd-Frank Act and overseeing derivatives markets, including regulating swaps that extend beyond U.S. borders. CFTC Chair Gary Gensler emphasizes the importance of bringing swaps market reform to transactions with overseas branches and affiliates guaranteed by U.S. entities to protect American jobs. Overseas branches and affiliates guaranteed by U.S. entities could lead to job loss and market movement offshore, with potential risks to the U.S. economy during crises. Examples include derivatives trading by overseas affiliates causing significant losses to U.S.-based entities, like AIG's London-based Financial Products Group and J.P. Morgan's \"London Whale\" trading losses. Industry warns that without modifications, swap business may shift away from U.S. financial institutions. The CFTC issued proposed guidance on the cross-border application of Title VII of Dodd-Frank, clarifying who would count as a \"U.S. person\" for meeting requirements. The agency also issued a temporary exemption, extending the deadline for meeting all requirements for cross-border swaps. The SEC proposed a rule and interpretive guidance on cross-border \"security-based swaps\" on May 1, 2013. The SEC proposed a rule on cross-border security-based swaps, taking a narrower approach to defining \"U.S. person\" compared to the CFTC. Legislation (H.R. 1256) mandates joint rules by the CFTC and SEC on cross-border swaps involving U.S. or non-U.S. persons, potentially superseding current rules. H.R. 1256 mandates joint rules by the CFTC and SEC on cross-border swaps involving U.S. or non-U.S. persons. Opponents argue it could weaken Dodd-Frank requirements on swaps, while supporters believe it would harmonize U.S. swaps requirements for U.S. and foreign businesses. H.R. 1256 aims to harmonize U.S. swaps requirements for U.S. and foreign businesses by addressing conflicting regulations between U.S. and overseas jurisdictions. It was passed by the House on June 12, 2013, with a roll call vote of 301 to 124. The bill requires swap contracts to be cleared through a clearinghouse regulated by federal agencies, with margin requirements in place to safeguard against undercapitalized exposures. The undercapitalized exposure of firms, like AIG with $1.8 trillion in credit default swaps, can have systemic consequences. Clearing derivatives limits position size based on capital to cover potential losses, protecting trading partners and the system. However, this imposes the cost of posting margin on derivative traders. For example, a grain farmer hedging with futures may need to post additional cash or securities while the position is open. The Dodd-Frank Act includes a broad exemption from the clearing requirement for non-financial firms using derivatives, known as \"the end user debate.\" These firms may incur temporary borrowing costs to cover margin requirements for futures positions. H.R. 634, a bill proposed in the 113th Congress, aims to prevent regulators from imposing margin requirements on swaps for non-financial firms. The bill was passed by the House with a vote of 411 to 12 and a companion bill, S. 888, was introduced in the Senate. Legislation introduced in the 113th Congress, such as H.R. 677, addresses concerns about swaps between affiliates within large organizations and the potential risks involved. The question of whether these trades should be subject to Dodd-Frank requirements is being debated, including the risks of losses and conflicts of interest between affiliates. The CFTC issued a rule exempting certain inter-affiliate swaps from Dodd-Frank Act requirements, despite concerns about risks and conflicts of interest within large organizations. The CFTC issued a rule exempting inter-affiliate swaps from Dodd-Frank Act requirements to address risks within large organizations. Affiliates must be majority owned, have consolidated financial statements, and follow a centralized risk management program. Swaps and trading relationships must be documented. H.R. 677 creates a statutory exemption from Dodd-Frank requirements for certain swaps between affiliates, as long as neither affiliate is a swap dealer that is an insured depository institution. The bill was marked up in the House Agriculture Committee on March 20, 2013, and in the House Financial Services Committee on May 7, 2013. Proponents argue that regulatory requirements on inter-affiliate swaps can be burdensome and pose little risk to external parties, while critics believe the CFTC final rule already addressed industry concerns. The CFTC final rule addressed industry concerns over reducing regulatory burden on inter-affiliate swaps. Large corporate conglomerates with thousands of subsidiaries may face challenges in the case of subsidiary bankruptcy. The bill could create a loophole from the Dodd-Frank Act's clearing requirement, particularly in relation to the Volcker Rule's prohibition of proprietary trading by banking entities. Depository banks accessing taxpayer-assisted safety nets face challenges in distinguishing between self-speculation, customer actions, and hedging for safety. Regulators, including the CFTC, work on finalizing the Volcker rule to prevent banks from speculating in financial markets. The CFTC's proposed rule aligns with other regulators' efforts to implement the Volcker rule, posing ongoing challenges for all involved. The CFTC proposed a rule on swaps trading under the Dodd-Frank Act to promote price transparency. Swap trades must be reported to data repositories for regulators to have complete information. The rule has faced criticisms for being too strict and burdensome, and not going far enough to prevent proprietary trading by banks. The CFTC proposed a rule on \"Core Principles and Other Requirements for Swap Execution Facilities\" in 2011, with a final rule issued in 2013. The challenge was balancing transparency with market disruption. Swap execution facilities were introduced to address the trading of customized or illiquid swaps. The Dodd-Frank Act introduced \"swap execution facilities\" as multilateral swap trading platforms with pre-trade and post-trade price transparency. Legislation in the 112th Congress aimed to amend SEF definitions. The CFTC's final rule on \"Core Principles and Other Requirements for Swap Execution Facilities\" may address industry concerns. Concerns about derivatives trading have been fueled by sharp rises in commodity prices, such as the doubling of oil prices in 2008. No SEF legislation has been introduced in the 113th Congress. In 2008, oil prices doubled to over $145 per barrel, then dropped by 80%, and rebounded. In 2011, there was a 20% increase in gasoline prices. Speculation in derivatives may be causing price volatility in commodities, attracting congressional interest. Excessive speculation was found to influence wheat and natural gas prices. Addressing excessive speculation is seen as a solution. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform believes that addressing excessive speculation is key to reducing gas prices for consumers. Economists are divided on whether financial trading in derivatives contributes to commodity price volatility. The CFTC is attempting to impose position limits on commodities under Dodd-Frank to control speculators' positions. Position limits aim to restrict the size of derivatives positions taken by individual speculators, with exemptions for commercial hedgers. The CFTC, under Dodd-Frank, aims to impose position limits on commodities to control speculators' positions. The CFTC approved rules for certain commodities in 2011, but industry groups challenged them in court. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia vacated and remanded the CFTC's position limit rules in 2012, finding ambiguity in Dodd-Frank. MF Global filed for bankruptcy in 2011, leading to concerns over segregated funds. The MF Global bankruptcy in 2011 raised concerns over the segregation of customer funds. Despite initial reports of missing funds, 93% of customer funds were eventually returned by February 2013. This event highlighted issues with the enforcement of segregation requirements for futures market customer funds and the need for regulatory cooperation during financial institution failures. Policy questions arose regarding the sufficiency of enforcement mechanisms and the potential need for insurance similar to SIPC for futures customers. The CFTC regulates futures markets with strict rules on customer fund segregation. Customer funds must be held in segregated accounts and not commingled with the broker's funds. Recent cases like MF Global and Peregrine Financial Group highlight the importance of enforcing these rules to protect customers from losses. The failure of Peregrine in July 2012 highlighted the need to protect futures customers' funds. The CFTC proposed a rule to increase disclosure requirements for futures brokers to give customers better accounting for their funds. Industry groups have raised concerns about the potential excessive costs of the proposed rule. The CFTC proposed a rule to improve protections for customer funds in response to concerns raised after the failure of Peregrine. Industry groups have complained about potential excessive costs. Barclays admitted to manipulating the LIBOR and EURIBOR indices, leading to settlements with the CFTC and DOJ. The bank admitted fault and paid a large fine, followed by UBS and Royal Bank of Scotland settling with the U.S. government for fines totaling $2.5 billion related to manipulation of LIBOR. CFTC Chair Gensler called for reforms to how LIBOR is calculated to be more tied to actual transactions. High frequency trading (HFT) involves computerized trading based on algorithms. High frequency trading (HFT) involves supercomputers executing trades within milliseconds, comprising over 60% of all futures volume in 2012 on U.S. futures exchanges. HFT proponents argue it increases market liquidity and narrows bid-ask spreads, but concerns about fairness and market stability persist. Concerns have arisen regarding the advantage of hedge funds and large investment banks with the latest technology in high-frequency trading (HFT). Questions have been raised about whether institutions serving small investors pay more for futures contracts or stocks due to HFT traders. Regulators, such as the CFTC, are investigating the use of HFT to flood markets with \"wash trades\" to influence prices or trading volumes temporarily. Wash trades are prohibited under the Commodity Exchange Act. The impact of HFT on market stability has raised concerns, highlighted by events such as the \"flash crash\" in 2010 and Knight Capital Group Inc.'s loss in 2012. Regulators are investigating the use of HFT to manipulate markets through wash trades. The CFTC and SEC oversee trading, including HFT, on futures and securities exchanges. The CFTC investigates wash trades related to HFT and holds meetings of its Technical Advisory Council. The CFTC issued guidance on disruptive trading practices, including \"spoofing,\" prohibited by the Dodd-Frank Act. The CFTC prohibits \"spoofing\" in HFT, where bids or offers are canceled before trade execution intentionally. This practice is also known as \"violating bids and offers.\" The CFTC prohibits \"spoofing\" in HFT, where bids or offers are canceled before trade execution intentionally, known as \"violating bids and offers.\" The CFTC's new guidance on this practice remains unclear, and the agency follows a two-step process for funding through appropriations. The CFTC's annual appropriations process is controlled by the Appropriations Committees in the House and Senate, while reauthorization falls under the jurisdiction of regular standing committees. The most recent CFTC Reauthorization Act was approved in 2008, authorizing appropriations until 2013. Between fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2008, the CFTC relied on unauthorized appropriations as its prior authorization had expired in 2005 and was not renewed until 2008. Reauthorization laws were passed in 2000, 1995, 1992, 1986, 1983, and 1978, leading to changes in commodities laws. The 2000 reauthorization resulted in the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, which addressed derivatives regulation. In 2013, the House and Senate agriculture committees began holding CFTC reauthorization hearings, including one on \"The Future of the CFTC: Market Perspectives.\" Some in Congress have pushed for increased cost-benefit analysis requirements in the CFTC's rulemakings. The House Agriculture Committee marked up a bill, H.R. 1003, to amend the Commodity Exchange Act and mandate cost-benefit analysis in CFTC rulemakings. Critics argue that the CFTC already conducts such analyses under Section 15(a) of the Act. Critics argue that conducting cost-benefit analyses in CFTC rulemaking may lead to overestimating costs, especially for intangible benefits like safer financial markets. Concerns were raised about industry groups challenging CFTC rules in court based on inadequately performed cost-benefit factors. Derivative contracts, including futures, options, and swaps, are financial instruments linked to underlying variables like commodity prices or interest rates. Derivatives contracts like futures, options, and swaps are used by firms to manage risk by gaining or losing value based on underlying rates or prices. They can protect against price increases and provide liquidity to the market. Southwest Airlines used derivatives to hedge against rising jet fuel prices in 2008. Some use derivatives to seek profits by predicting price movements. Derivatives markets provide liquidity and price discovery through the trading activities of hedgers and speculators. Today, most derivatives are linked to financial variables like interest rates, foreign exchange, and stock prices. The market is worth hundreds of trillions of dollars with billions of contracts traded annually, playing a role in the development of complex financial instruments. Synthetic securities can be created using derivatives to replicate returns on individual securities or portfolios. The derivatives market has seen explosive growth since 2000, with a significant increase in the volume of contracts traded on exchanges and the notional value of contracts traded in the over-the-counter market. This growth far outpaced the increase in corporate bonds and home mortgages outstanding during the same period. Financial engineering has led to the creation of complex mathematical models to understand market movements and financial interactions. Synthetic securities are created using derivatives to replicate returns on individual securities or portfolios. The total notional value of OTC derivatives contracts grew significantly from $548 trillion to $707 trillion between 2008 and 2011, before decreasing to $649 trillion by the end of 2012. The estimated credit risk from these trades was $24.7 trillion in 2012, down from $32 trillion in 2008. Different types of derivatives are traded on various markets, with futures contracts regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Derivatives are traded on regulated exchanges like the CFTC for futures contracts and the SEC for stock options, while swaps and some options are traded over the counter. Before the Dodd-Frank Act, OTC contracts were unregulated, with deals made bilaterally between parties. The OTC market lacked transparency, with no requirement to disclose contract details to regulators or the public. Derivatives are known for their volatility, leading to significant gains and losses among traders. The Dodd-Frank reforms addressed the issue of credit risk in derivatives trading by introducing clearinghouses. These clearinghouses guarantee payment to both parties, eliminating the need for traders to worry about counterparty default. The clearinghouse ensures its ability to meet obligations through a system of margin or collateral. The clearing process in derivatives trading involves margin payments to cover potential losses. Traders must deposit initial margin with the clearinghouse, and additional margin may be required at the end of each trading day. Failure to meet margin calls can result in positions being closed out. This system prevents large paper losses that could harm the clearinghouse in case of default. In the OTC market, dealers act as hubs in a network rather than a centralized marketplace. They take long or short positions, earning money on spreads and fees while absorbing credit risk. Large institutions like JP Morgan Chase dominate the market, viewed as too big to fail since 2008. Some contracts require collateral or margin, but practices vary. In the OTC market, dealers act as hubs in a network rather than a centralized marketplace, taking long or short positions and earning money on spreads and fees while absorbing credit risk. Some contracts require collateral or margin, but terms are negotiable. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) publishes best practice standards for collateral use, but compliance is voluntary. Collateral and margin are forms of downpayment against potential losses, with margin requiring immediate cash or liquid securities deposit, while collateral arrangements involve perfecting a lien against a wider range of assets. In the OTC market, collateral agreements allow a wider range of assets compared to margining arrangements. A notable example is AIG, which faced uncollateralized losses due to credit default swaps on mortgage-backed securities. As the subprime crisis deepened, AIG's credit rating downgrade led to calls for additional collateral it couldn't meet, risking bankruptcy. The Federal Reserve and Treasury injected billions of dollars into AIG to prevent bankruptcy and global financial chaos. AIG's massive OTC derivatives position posed a systemic risk, highlighting the need for derivatives reforms such as mandatory clearing and margin requirements. Dodd-Frank aimed to address the lack of regulatory oversight in OTC markets. The lack of reporting OTC contracts to regulators before Dodd-Frank left the Fed and Treasury unaware of institutions exposed to AIG and the extent of those exposures. This uncertainty worsened credit market freezes during the crisis, as banks hesitated to lend to each other. Derivatives reform proposals aimed to make the OTC market more like the exchange market by clearing swaps through a third-party organization and trading on an exchange or swap execution facility to reduce counterparty risk. The clearinghouse's role in preventing risk build-ups and improving transparency is crucial for avoiding systemic disruptions. While centralized information on trades and positions helps regulators respond to crises, there are costs associated with requiring all participants to post margin. This can lead to losses for firms using derivatives to hedge business risks, as seen in the example of Southwest Airlines and its derivatives position during fluctuating energy prices. The Dodd-Frank Act's Title VII on derivatives reform included an exemption from clearing requirements for non-financial firms to address concerns about posting margin for OTC derivatives. This exemption aimed to prevent liquidity problems for commercial firms using derivatives for hedging, ensuring they are not exposed to greater business risks."
