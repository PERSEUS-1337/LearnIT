    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Food Biotechnology Information Initiative Act\". Congress finds that biotechnology has been used for years to develop new products in various industries. It has the potential to benefit mankind by transferring genes between organisms, creating plant varieties with improved taste, nutrition, and shelf life. This will lead to more efficient farming, lower costs for consumers, and better environmental protection. The National Research Council released a report on genetically modified pest-protected plants, stating that there is no evidence of their harm but recommended more research to address public concerns. Federal agencies were advised to expand information on the regulation of these products. Consumers in the United States are increasingly worried about the lack of adequate food safety measures regarding the use of biotechnology in foods. It is crucial for all foods, including those derived from biotechnology, to undergo a rigorous government regulatory process based on state-of-the-art scientific standards. Sharing scientific information and regulatory frameworks with consumers should be a key component of food and agriculture programs in the United States. The program of public education on biotechnology in food production is essential to address consumer concerns about food safety. The Secretary of Agriculture, in collaboration with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, will develop a program to communicate with the public about the safety and benefits of using biotechnology in food production. This program will provide science-based evidence on food safety, data on human outcomes, and an analysis of environmental risks and benefits. The Food Safety Initiative, part of the President's program, involves collaboration between the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Department of Agriculture, and the Environmental Protection Agency. Up to $10,000,000 may be used annually for this initiative in fiscal years 2001 and 2002. Grants for research on economic and environmental risks and benefits of using biotechnology in food production. The purpose of the amendment is to expand the current research program on biotechnology in food production to evaluate its effects on the farm economy and environment, address public concerns, and help regulators develop policies. The Secretary of Agriculture will establish a grant program for this research. The Secretary of Agriculture will establish a grant program for research on biotechnology's impact on the farm economy, competitiveness in foreign markets, and consumer confidence in agricultural products. The Secretary of Agriculture will establish a grant program for research on biotechnology's impact on the farm economy, competitiveness in foreign markets, and consumer confidence in agricultural products. Priority will be given to projects developing improved methods for identifying potential allergens in pest-protected plants. Amendments are made to prioritize projects with human immune-system endpoints and more reliable animal models. The Secretary of Agriculture will establish a grant program for research on economic and environmental risks and benefits of using biotechnology in food production."
