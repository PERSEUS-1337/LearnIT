    "content": "Since 1998, weak or failing states have been a concern for U.S. national security. The threats include providing safe havens for terrorists, causing conflict, and undermining democracy and governance. The President's directive in 2005 emphasizes the need to anticipate and respond to state failure effectively. The Administration aims to transform U.S. national security institutions to address challenges of the 21st century, including strengthening weak and failing states. However, there are concerns about the effectiveness of current policies towards these states, with competing visions for addressing state weakness. Congressional involvement in U.S. policy towards weak and failing states is driven by funding and oversight responsibilities. This debate is likely to continue into the next presidential term, with significant consequences for U.S. national security policy. Advocates of a \"Whole-of-Government\" approach see weak states as presenting challenges to political stability, security capabilities, and humanitarian needs. They propose interagency planning to coordinate U.S. policy towards weak states, potentially leading to significant reforms in funding and organizational structures. Some critics question the focus on state weakness in U.S. national security policy, recommending strategies to combat specific threats like ungoverned territories, terrorism, and nuclear proliferation. They also argue against costly stabilization and reconstruction efforts, suggesting that strengthening states may impose a Western model that is not always suitable. The U.S. national security policy focuses on weak and failing states, with debates on the necessity and effectiveness of programs to combat these threats. The Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS) leads efforts in conflict prevention and response in failing states, while the Department of Defense (DOD) has expanded its role in stability operations. The Department of Defense has expanded its role in conflict prevention and stability operations, elevating these activities to primary missions and establishing new institutions for training personnel. However, U.S. weak states initiatives are limited by interagency cohesion and unclear resources, leading to questions about the commitment to strengthening weak states. Possible oversight questions for Congress include the need for interagency coordination. The report serves as a primer on weak and failing states and related U.S. policy issues, addressing questions about interagency coordination, effectiveness of U.S. programs, international cooperation, and unintended consequences of policies to strengthen weak states. The report discusses challenges and key U.S. programs addressing threats from weak states, highlighting potential legislative issues for Congress. State weakness is defined as the erosion of state capacity, with some countries exhibiting varying degrees of weakness. Failing states show more pronounced weaknesses, but there is no single pathway to failure. Weak and failing states can experience gradual decay or rapid collapse due to political instability, natural disasters, or economic crises. These states are often among the least developed and face challenges in peace, governance, territorial control, and economic sustainability. Peace and stability are crucial as failing states are often in conflict or at risk of instability, compromising other state functions. Weak and failing states can face challenges in governance, corruption, and provision of public services, leading to instability. Territorial control issues and porous borders can create ungoverned spaces where instability can thrive. Examples include Sudan, Iraq, North Korea, Zimbabwe, Pakistan-Afghanistan border, and the Sahel region of Northern Africa. Weak and failing states, such as those in Sub-Saharan Africa and Bangladesh, are often among the poorest countries in the world. Concerns about failed states have been present in U.S. National Security Strategy documents since 1998, with analysts recognizing their role in transnational crime, nuclear proliferation, civil conflict, and humanitarian emergencies. The U.S. National Security Strategy has highlighted the threat weak and failing states pose since 9/11, emphasizing their role as pathways for criminals and terrorists. Osama bin Laden's 9/11 attack from Afghanistan underscored the danger these states can pose to national security. U.S. interest in weak and failing states has increased post-9/11 due to national security concerns. Analysts link state weakness to various security threats like terrorism, nuclear proliferation, infectious diseases, environmental degradation, and energy security. U.S. national security documents focus on weak states in relation to terrorism, international crime, nuclear proliferation, and regional instability. However, some analysts argue that weak states may not always pose direct threats to U.S. national security, and relatively functional states with some weaknesses could be more significant threats. Weak and failing states are seen as primary bases for foreign terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda, Hamas, and Hezbollah. These states provide opportunities for terrorists to engage in illicit activities, access weapons, and establish training grounds. Conflict-ridden states also offer paramilitary experience for terrorists. However, not all weak states serve as safe havens for terrorists. The Political Instability Task Force found that terrorists operate in both \"caves\" (failed states) and \"condos\" (states with infrastructure for illicit activities). Weak states may not always be safe havens for terrorists, as countries with some governmental effectiveness can also support terrorist activities. International criminal organizations also benefit from safe havens in weak and failing states. According to the U.S. Interagency Working Group report on international crime, weak states can be useful sites for criminals to move illicit contraband and launder their proceeds due to unenforced laws and high levels of corruption. The international community has seen a rise in transnational crime groups in safe havens of weak states since the Cold War, especially in the Balkans, Central Asia, and West Africa. Criminal groups exploit the needs of failing states, with regimes and rebel groups using illicit arms trafficking networks to fuel conflicts in countries like Afghanistan, Angola, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Sudan during arms embargoes imposed by the UN and other international bodies. Links between transnational crime and terrorist groups are evident, with Al Qaeda and Hezbollah collaborating with various criminal actors. In 2008, a U.S. DEA official noted that 19 out of 43 Foreign Terrorist Organizations have ties to drug trafficking. Some researchers argue that weak states may not always be the most attractive to international criminals due to the lack of necessary infrastructure. Weak and failing states are often associated with international crime, particularly narcotics trafficking and illicit arms smuggling. These states may also facilitate underground networks for smuggling nuclear, chemical, biological, and radiological materials. Endemic corruption and weak border controls in these states increase the risk of being used as transshipment points for illicit trafficking. The International Atomic Energy Agency reported 1,080 confirmed cases of nuclear and radiological material trafficking by member states from 1993 to 2006, with the majority originating in Central states. The majority of smuggled nuclear material reportedly originates in Central Asia and the Caucasus where known stockpiles are inadequately monitored. Concerns also exist in Africa due to lax regulations and weak governments, making the trafficking of radioactive substances a real prospect. Weak and failing states may facilitate underground networks for smuggling WMDs, but most lack the technological sophistication for handling such equipment. According to recent research, the spread of instability across a region can increase state vulnerability to threats, posing significant challenges for the United States. Weak and failing states not only present transnational security threats but also development challenges, which the U.S. National Security Strategy has prioritized alongside defense and diplomacy. Weak and failing states struggle to achieve U.N. development goals and qualify for U.S. assistance programs, hindering their progress. Fragile states grow slower, have lower income, higher debt, and double the poverty rates compared to other low-income countries. The World Bank notes that most fragile states identified in 1980 remain fragile today, showing the challenge of achieving sustained progress. Statistical estimates by World Bank analysts suggest that a fragile state is likely to remain so for 56 years, with a low probability of experiencing a sustained turnaround. The United States lacks an official strategy for dealing with weak and failing states, but post-9/11 programs aim to prevent state failure, strengthen weak states, and counter threats. These initiatives cover identifying threats, engaging in diplomacy, providing foreign assistance, and implementing stabilization efforts. The U.S. lacks an official strategy for weak and failing states but post-9/11 programs aim to prevent state failure, strengthen weak states, and counter threats. U.S. policy makers may apply programming areas to weak states based on resources and political considerations. Some analysts criticize recent U.S. programs addressing state weakness. The government uses early warning systems to predict state failure and assist in international crises preparation. The U.S. government utilizes early warning systems to identify and monitor potential threats from weak and failing states. The National Intelligence Council, Department of State's Office of Early Warning and Prevention, USAID, and DOD play roles in this process. A warning list of weak and failing states is prepared twice a year since 2005, based on classified and unclassified sources. The U.S. government uses early warning systems to identify threats from weak and failing states. Various agencies like the National Intelligence Council, USAID, and DOD are involved in creating lists of fragile states. These lists inform programming agendas and assess threats to national security. Interagency coordination for conflict assessment is praised in a 2007 State Department report. Coordination for early warning conflict assessment involves multiple U.S. government agencies like S/CRS, DOD, USAID, and the intelligence community. However, the government's ability to respond to crises based on these assessments is unclear due to lack of political will, resources, and capabilities. Observers note that S/CRS, responsible for conflict prevention in failing states, is limited by its small size and resources, hindering its effectiveness. The United States aims to engage weak states through international diplomacy to prevent transnational threats. Transformational diplomacy, introduced in 2006, focuses on promoting democracy, good governance, and bolstering state capacity against security threats in weak countries. Approximately 300 U.S. diplomats were designated to strategic posts in regions like the Near East, Asia, Africa, and Latin America under this initiative. The Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2007-2012 aims to confront security threats in weak states and strengthen state capacity. There is debate over whether transformational diplomacy requires new legislation, with the Administration claiming it does not. Some experts and foreign governments have raised concerns about the initiative. The Bush Administration's transformational diplomacy initiative has raised concerns about democracy promotion being used as a pretext for intervention in other countries. The lack of legal requirements for this initiative may lead to its reconsideration by the next Administration. Various foreign aid initiatives have been introduced to help fragile states build or strengthen institutions and infrastructure, sparking debates on the use of foreign assistance for national security purposes. Debates on using foreign assistance for national security, including weak states, involve modifying the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the role of the U.S. military in funding to strengthen weak states, and training foreign police. The State Department's 2006 initiative created the Director of Foreign Assistance (DFA) and a new Foreign Assistance Framework, categorizing aid recipients. The new Foreign Assistance Framework categorizes aid recipients into rebuilding, developing, and restrictive countries, with five development objectives. It aims to improve alignment of foreign assistance with foreign policy priorities, particularly in weak and failing states. However, strategic guidelines for aid allocation have not yet been developed by the Office of the Director for Foreign Assistance. In CY2005, 48% of U.S. Official Development Assistance (ODA) was controlled by agencies outside of the State Department and USAID, including the Departments of Defense, Agriculture, Energy, Health and Human Services, Labor, and Treasury. DOD alone disbursed more than one-fifth of U.S. foreign assistance. S/CRS supported projects in 18 crisis or at-risk countries from 2006 to 2007, including Kosovo, Haiti, Colombia, Mali, Sudan, Lebanon, Iraq, and Afghanistan. Funding for projects in Lebanon, Iraq, Nepal, and Afghanistan was supported through traditional foreign assistance accounts and DOD under Section 1207 funds. Some express concern over DOD's role in approving civilian stabilization assistance programs, citing potential encroachment into foreign assistance policymaking previously under the State Department's purview. Supporters argue that DOD's involvement in civilian stabilization assistance allows for whole-of-government approaches, enhances interagency programming, and improves civil-military coordination. This budgetary arrangement between the State Department and DOD is seen as practical and necessary for national security purposes. USAID has been proactive in addressing underlying weaknesses to prevent state failure. In 2003, USAID established the Office of Conflict Mitigation and Management to address political instability, conflict, and extremism. They also created Crisis, Stabilization, and Governance Officers in 2004 for fragile states, with specialized training and shorter tours. In 2005, USAID unveiled its Fragile States Strategy to enhance rapid crisis response capabilities. The 2005 Fragile States Strategy aimed to improve crisis response capabilities and strategic planning for unique country conditions. However, it was overshadowed by the 2006 development initiative. U.S. support for foreign military and counter-terrorism assistance is crucial in preventing security threats from weak states by strengthening partner nations' security sector capabilities. The U.S. has implemented counter-terrorism programs in weak states through military assistance and training, supported by Congress with funding for foreign security forces. Concerns have been raised about the growing role of the Department of Defense in security sector assistance, traditionally handled by the State Department and USAID. The Administration has established the Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS) to coordinate civilian post-conflict operations in failing states, with support from Congress and the President. This initiative aims to go beyond traditional peacekeeping activities and involve the State Department in coordinating stabilization and reconstruction efforts. The Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS) was established to coordinate civilian post-conflict operations in failing states. In response to the President's directive, S/CRS proposed a \"Civilian Stabilization Initiative\" to create a cadre of volunteer civilians with unique skills for deployment in crisis situations worldwide. This initiative includes an \"Active Response Corps\" of full-time government employees and a \"Standby Response Corps\" of volunteers. The Secretary of Defense issued Directive 3000.05 in November 2005, elevating stability operations to a core U.S. military mission and calling for military readiness to conduct tasks necessary for establishing or maintaining order, including those typically performed by civilians. This directive outlines the creation of a \"Standby Response Corps\" of 2,000 federal government employees who can be deployed within 45 to 60 days of a crisis, and a \"Civilian Reserve Corps\" of 2,000 individuals from the private sector and state/local government who can be deployed within two months of a crisis. Since 2005, the Department of Defense has focused on stability operations, including peacekeeping, humanitarian aid, and counter-terrorism efforts. New positions and offices have been created to oversee these operations, with ongoing efforts to incorporate stability operations into military doctrine. Tensions have arisen in DOD's relationship with civilian agencies during post-conflict stability operations. The Defense Science Board Task Force found that DOD's progress in stability operations outpaced other government agencies. DOD's efforts to compensate for civilian agencies' shortcomings may lead to increased reliance on the military in future stabilization operations, raising concerns about potential conflicts with broader U.S. foreign policy goals. The creation of S/CRS in 2004 demonstrates increased cross-agency collaboration on U.S. projects in weak states. S/CRS serves as the lead coordinator for civilian and military activities related to conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction. It is also leading the Interagency Management System to improve coordination for stability operations. Prior to S/CRS, President Clinton's PDD 56 governed interagency management of post-conflict situations. The current interagency approach to weak states is criticized for being a messy amalgam of programs and policies, lacking strategy-level guidance and coordination. Foreign assistance to fragile states is noted to be uneven and fragmented, with overlapping responsibilities and programs working at cross-purposes. Confusion remains about which agencies should be involved in policy planning discussions on weak state issues. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) reports fundamental problems with the S/CRS Interagency Management System for post-conflict situations, including unclear guidance on roles and responsibilities, lack of a common definition for stability operations, and concerns about its effectiveness and redundancy. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) reports issues with the S/CRS Interagency Management System for post-conflict situations, including unclear guidance on roles and responsibilities. There is skepticism among interagency participants about the effectiveness of new planning processes in fragile states. Recent U.S. projects in weak states are testing interagency coordination, such as Provincial Reconstruction Teams in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Trans-Sahara Counter-Terrorism Initiative, and counter-extremism projects in the Horn of Africa. Civilian and military officials are collaborating to strengthen state capacity in security sector reform, institutional capacity building, and economic development. For example, USAID funded an assessment on extremism in the Horn of Africa and worked with the Department of State and DOD's Combined Joint Task Force. USAID collaborated with the Department of State and DOD to counter extremism in the Horn of Africa region. DOD provided infrastructure support, while the Department of State and USAID focused on educational and medical training. USAID has been working on civilian-military relations since 2005, with initiatives like the Office of Military Affairs and the Tactical Conflict Assessment Framework. The creation of U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) shows increasing civil-military collaboration. The U.S. aims to apply the AFRICOM model to transform SOUTHCOM by 2016, focusing on legislative issues related to weak and failing states. Key areas include civilian post-conflict management, DOD transfer authority to the State Department, global train and equip authorities, foreign police training, and interagency policy effectiveness. Congress is considering new authorizations to develop civilian post-conflict stabilization capabilities. The Reconstruction and Stabilization Civilian Management Act of 2008 seeks to authorize funding for stabilization and reconstruction assistance in failing states, including the creation of a Response Readiness Corps. Congress has allocated funding for the Response Readiness Corps and the Civilian Reserve Corps, contingent upon specific authorization. The State Department requested $248.6 million in FY2009 to establish these initiatives. The State Department requested $248.6 million in its budget to establish the Civilian Stabilization Initiative and other costs associated with S/CRS. The Department did not include funding for a Conflict Response Fund in its FY2009 request, instead seeking DOD's authority to transfer funds for security and stabilization assistance. Supporters argue that the lack of a conflict response fund and civilian reserve corps hinders the State Department's ability in post-conflict situations, while critics are hesitant to provide additional funding to a new office. The Department of Defense has secured congressional funds for U.S. stabilization operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, including the Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP) for humanitarian relief. International support for civilian post-conflict capabilities is slowly growing, with proposals for rapid reaction forces in fragile states. The U.S. stabilization efforts in fragile states are funded by the Department of Defense through a temporary transfer authority, as stated in Section 1207 of the National Defense Authorization Act. This provision allows the State Department to receive DOD funds for reconstruction, security, or stabilization assistance in foreign countries. The FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act included a \"pilot project\" for transfer authority from DOD to State Department. The transfer authority was extended to September 30, 2008, with a request to increase the cap to $200 million for FY2009. DOD also seeks to extend the authority to other U.S. agencies. Supporters argue for increased funding for State Department's stabilization capabilities, while critics question long-term funding from DOD to State Department. The FY2008 defense authorization extended transfer authority from DOD to State Department, with funding capped at $100 million. Congress debated DOD's role in strengthening weak states' militaries for counter-terrorism efforts. The authority under Section 1206 of the National Defense Authorization Act allows DOD to train and equip foreign military forces for counter-terrorism and stability operations. Concerns have been raised about a perceived shift in funding control from the State Department to DOD, but supporters argue that DOD may be better suited for these programs. The Administration has requested Congress to broaden DOD's authorities to include training and equipping various foreign forces. The National Defense Authorization Act allows DOD to train and equip foreign military forces for counter-terrorism and stability operations. Congress is considering increasing funding authorization levels to $750 million and making the authorities permanent. The House version of the National Defense Authorization Act would extend these authorities to FY2010. The House version of the National Defense Authorization Act, H.R. 5658, passed on May 22, 2008, would extend Section 1206 authorities to FY2010. The Senate version proposes extending the authorities to FY2011, increasing the funding cap to $400 million per year, and expanding the use to include building the capacity of foreign country's coast guard, border protection, and security forces engaged in counter-terrorism missions. The U.S. government's ability to assist foreign countries in law enforcement is crucial for stabilizing weak states, but restrictions under Section 660 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 limit the use of foreign assistance funds for training foreign police. Some analysts suggest repealing restrictions under Section 660 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to enhance strategies for addressing weaknesses in foreign police forces in weak and failing states. Congress has granted exemptions to this section over the years, indicating recognition of the importance of foreign police training assistance. The broader issue of interagency coordination in national security affairs is also highlighted, with recommendations from the bipartisan \"HELP Commission\" to rewrite the Act to improve foreign assistance policy. The HELP Commission recommends rewriting the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to improve coordination between security and development priorities in failed and failing states. This includes linking trade, democratic governance, and security with traditional assistance. Other groups are exploring options for reforming interagency coordination on national security issues, potentially rewriting the National Security Act of 1947 and revising congressional rules for better oversight. Enhancing U.S. government interagency processes could have significant implications. Advocates of interagency reform call for institutionalized mechanisms to require strategic and operational planning, coordinated resource allocation, and execution. Critics caution that such proposals could involve significant reform of congressional funding and authorizing responsibilities for national defense, foreign operations, and intelligence. USAID defines \"fragile states\" as those falling along a spectrum of \"failing, failed, and recovering from crisis,\" with the most severe being \"crisis states.\" The National Intelligence Council describes \"failed or failing states\" as territories devoid of effective government control due to internal conflicts. The National Security Council defines \"weak states\" as lacking capacity to fulfill their duties. The National Security Council (NSC) defines \"weak states\" as lacking the capacity to fulfill their sovereign responsibilities, while the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) defines \"failed or failing states\" as nations where governments do not effectively control their territory and citizens do not perceive them as legitimate. The U.S. Interagency Working Group on International Crime also addresses the issue of failing states in their reports. The Crime Threat Assessment report defines \"failed states\" as those unable to meet sovereign control standards, leading to economic deterioration and political unrest. The OECD's DAC defines \"fragile states\" as lacking capacity to engage with citizens for security and development, characterized by weak governance and social tensions. The Political Instability Task Force (PITF) was commissioned by the CIA in 1994 to study \"state failure,\" which is defined as severe political conflicts leading to the collapse of central authority. The U.S. Commission on Weak States, sponsored by the Center for Global Development, defines \"weak states\" as governments unable to protect their citizens and meet international expectations. The World Bank's Fragile States Initiative, previously known as the Low-Income Countries Under Stress (LICUS) Initiative, defines \"fragile states\" as countries with poor governance, internal conflicts, weak security, corruption, and insufficient mechanisms for legitimate power. These states are low-income with a GNI per capita of $905 or less. They are expected to protect people from threats, deliver basic health and education services, and provide responsive institutions."
