In the United States, pollinators contribute $24 billion annually, with honey bees alone accounting for $15 billion. Native pollinators like bumblebees and mason bees add over $3 billion to the agricultural economy. One-third of food in North America, including fruits like almonds and apples, relies on bee pollination. The decline in bee populations has led to record high incidents of colony collapse disorder and excess bee mortality, with beekeepers experiencing significant annual hive mortality rates. The national honey crop reported in 2013 was the lowest in decades, highlighting the critical role of bees in pollination for crops like avocados, cranberries, and apples. According to scientists, current losses of honey bee colonies are too high to ensure the US can meet pollination demands for crops. Native pollinators like bumble bees are also declining, with over 40 species listed as threatened or endangered. The use of neonicotinoids is linked to the rapid decline of pollinators and their health. These insecticides cause sublethal effects such as impaired foraging and feeding behavior. Recent global reviews have highlighted the harmful impacts of neonicotinoids on beneficial invertebrate species, bees, and biodiversity. Studies have shown that these pesticides can lead to impaired behavior, weakened immunity, delayed development, and increased susceptibility to diseases in insects. Additionally, neonicotinoids have been linked to acute lethal effects and high levels of freshwater contamination. Research has also demonstrated that even a single corn kernel coated with a neonicotinoid can be toxic enough to kill a songbird. Research from the Netherlands showed severe bird population declines in areas with high neonicotinoid pollution, affecting starlings, tree sparrows, and swallows. The European Union suspended the use of neonicotinoids on agricultural crops due to hazards to bees. Bumblebees were killed by neonicotinoid exposure on linden trees, leading to bans in various cities like Eugene, Oregon, and Thurston County. In June 2014, a Presidential memorandum established a Pollinator Health Task Force to address pollinator decline, which threatens food production systems, the agricultural economy, and the environment in the United States. In July 2014, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service announced plans to phase out neonicotinoid pesticides in national wildlife refuges by January 2016 due to their harmful effects on non-target species. In October 2014, studies found that neonicotinoid seed coatings are unnecessary in 80-90% of row crop uses, violating integrated pest management principles. In November 2014, Ontario announced plans to restrict neonicotinoid-coated corn and soybean seeds with an 80% reduction goal by 2017. SEC. 3. URGENT REGULATORY RESPONSE FOR HONEY BEE AND POLLINATOR PROTECTION. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must suspend the registration of certain neonicotinoid insecticides for use on bee-attractive plants until it is determined that they will not harm pollinators. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must suspend certain neonicotinoid insecticides for use on bee-attractive plants to protect pollinators, including native bees, honey bees, birds, bats, and other beneficial insects. Additionally, new pesticide registrations for seed treatment, soil application, and foliar treatment that may harm pollinators will not be issued. The Secretary of the Interior, in coordination with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, will monitor the health and population status of native bees in various habitats to protect pollinators. The Secretary of the Interior, along with the EPA Administrator, will monitor native bee health and population in different habitats to safeguard pollinators. The focus is on ornamental plants, residential areas, and landscaped areas. Additionally, they will investigate unusual bee mortality causes and provide annual reports to Congress and the public."
