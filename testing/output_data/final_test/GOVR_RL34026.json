    "content": "The report provides an overview of the Department of Defense's acquisition process for weapon systems and recent efforts to improve system performance. Acquisition involves acquiring goods and services to support military operations, encompassing design, engineering, testing, deployment, sustainment, and disposal. Federal regulations and law often use acquisition and procurement interchangeably. The Department of Defense's acquisition process for weapon systems is complex and often does not meet cost or performance expectations. Congress has long been concerned about the system's structure and performance, with the House Armed Services Committee stating that the DOD acquisition process is broken. The ability to conduct large-scale acquisitions for national security is a significant concern. The House Armed Services Committee is concerned about the rising costs and delays in major defense acquisition programs, impacting national security. Congressional oversight has focused on all aspects of the acquisition process, from requirements generation to financial management. Legislation has been enacted to improve defense acquisition practices under Title 10 of the United States Code. The Armed Forces of the United States are governed by Title 10 of the United States Code, which includes provisions for procurement responsibilities, acquisition procedures, and reporting to Congress. The National Defense Authorization Acts are key in modifying the defense acquisition structure, with DOD procurement activities regulated by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and other federal government regulations. The regulations governing procurement in the Department of Defense (DOD) are found in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement. DOD components have their own unique FAR Supplements. Program managers must adhere to these regulations during the planning and execution of programs. Every weapon system in the U.S. arsenal must meet specific military requirements, be funded by the federal budget, and go through a three-step process of identification, budget establishment, and acquisition. The Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) is a process for identifying military requirements and prioritizing capabilities. It is part of the three-step acquisition process in the Department of Defense, along with the Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution System and the Defense Acquisition System. JCIDS helps determine if changes in doctrine, training, organization, or new acquisitions like weapon systems are needed to fulfill mission requirements. The JCIDS process, established in 2003, shifted DOD from a threat-based to a capabilities-based approach in identifying warfighter needs. This change focuses on meeting strategic direction and priorities outlined in high-level strategy documents. The previous threat-based approach led to each military service developing independent weapons in response to identified threats. The JCIDS process, established in 2003, shifted DOD from a threat-based to a capabilities-based approach in identifying warfighter needs. This change promotes a collaborative method of identifying capability gaps across services, leading to joint development of weapon systems. JCIDS is governed by CJCSI 3170.01 H and involves conducting a Capabilities Based Assessment (CBA) to analyze military capability needs and gaps. If a materiel solution is needed, an Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) is prepared to justify the need for a weapon system. The Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) justifies the need for a materiel solution to address a capability gap. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) must approve the ICD by reviewing the required capabilities, the identified gap, and how it will be addressed. The JROC may recommend a non-materiel solution or approve a materiel solution, leading the program into the Defense Acquisition System. The documentation from the JCIDS process guides decisions in the acquisition process, although the JROC lacks binding authority. The JROC serves in an advisory role to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and does not have binding authority. The Chairman advises the Secretary of Defense on priorities and budget proposals, with the Secretary ultimately having authority over requirements and acquisitions. The Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution system develops DOD's proposed budget for all acquisitions, including MDAPs, within fiscal constraints. The PPBE is an annual process consisting of planning, programming, budgeting, and execution stages to develop DOD's proposed budget for acquisitions within fiscal constraints. Planning involves defining a national defense strategy and setting priorities for programs. Programming fleshes out proposed programs and submits a Program Objective Memorandum outlining missions and budget requirements. Budgeting occurs concurrently with programming. The Defense Acquisition System is the management process by which DOD develops and buys weapons and other systems, governed by Directive 5000.01 and Instruction 5000.02. It is not a rigid, one-size-fits-all process and utilizes procedures described in the Defense Acquisition Guidebook. Acquisition of information technology systems differs from acquiring missiles. The Defense Acquisition System, governed by Directive 5000.01 and Instruction 5000.02, tailors procedures to the product being acquired. Despite differences in acquisition processes, the general framework remains the same. Milestones are used to oversee and manage acquisition programs. Milestones serve as gates in the acquisition process for programs like the F-35, Littoral Combat Ship, and Joint Light Tactical Vehicle. There are three milestones: A for technology maturation, B for engineering development, and C for production. Program managers, who can be military officers or civil servants, lead acquisition programs and report to a Program Executive Officer. The Program Executive Officer oversees program managers, who can be military officers or federal civil servants. They report to a Component Acquisition Executive, who in turn reports to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. The Milestone Decision Authority determines if a program meets milestone criteria to proceed in the acquisition process. The Materiel Development Decision review determines if a new weapon system is needed, based on JROC requirements. The MDA approves the plan for developing an Analysis of Alternatives and designates the DOD component to lead the program. Decisions made at this review are documented in an Acquisition Decision Memorandum. During the Materiel Solution Analysis Phase, competing systems are analyzed to determine the best option to meet requirements. The Analysis of Alternatives explores different methods based on effectiveness, cost, schedule, risks, and technologies. A program manager is selected, and a program office is established. This phase ends when a specific solution is chosen to continue through the acquisition process. During the Materiel Solution Analysis Phase, a specific solution is chosen to proceed through the acquisition process. The program must pass Milestone A to enter the acquisition system, requiring approval of the proposed materiel solution, acquisition strategy, cost estimate, full funding, and readiness for technology maturation contracting. Milestone decisions are documented in an Acquisition Decision Memorandum. During the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction phase, nascent technologies and system design are matured to ensure a system can meet military requirements within affordability caps. Requirements are refined, cost caps finalized, Capability Development Document and Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability strategy developed. Competitive prototyping occurs with industry teams creating prototypes. Development RFP Release Decision Point is held during this phase. During the Development RFP Release Decision Point, the acquisition strategy is initiated and industry is invited to bid for the development contract. This milestone marks the start of the program becoming a program of record, ensuring program requirements are firm, risks are reduced, and the program structure, schedule, and funding are executable. Upon passing Milestone B, a program becomes a program of record by meeting various requirements such as validated and approved requirements, full funding, mitigated risks, and an approved Acquisition Strategy. The MDA then approves the Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) detailing performance, schedule, and cost goals. During the Engineering and Manufacturing Development Phase, a system is designed, technologies are integrated, and preparations for manufacturing are made. The Developmental Test and Evaluation office tests the design maturity, and system integration combines subsystems into one system. During system integration, various subsystems like the aircraft launching system, radar, and nuclear reactor are integrated onto the ship. Operational testing and evaluation are conducted to assess operational effectiveness, suitability, and survivability. Passing Milestone C is necessary to proceed to the Production and Deployment phase, which requires stable production design, successful testing, software maturity, interoperability, cost control, funding, and approval of the Capability Production Document. During the Production and Deployment phase, the Milestone Decision Authority approves the updated Acquisition Strategy. MDA decisions are documented in an Acquisition Decision Memorandum. Low-rate initial production begins to prepare for higher production rates and provide test models. Full-rate production requires completion of operational testing, control over manufacturing processes, and MDA approval. Initial Operating Capability is achieved when predefined criteria are met, allowing for some operations. Full Operational Capability is attained when the system is ready. During the Operations and Support phase, the weapon system is fully deployed, operated, supported, and ultimately retired. Up to 70% of the total life cycle costs can occur in this phase. Programs are categorized into acquisition categories (ACATs) based on program cost, with higher costs requiring more management oversight. The most significant DOD and congressional oversight activities apply to MDAPs, categorized as ACAT I programs. Concerns over defense acquisitions include cost overruns, schedule delays, and equipment availability for troops in the field. Many analysts believe that cost overruns and schedule delays in defense acquisitions have a debilitating effect on the nation's military and threaten America's technological advantage. Despite numerous attempts to improve defense acquisitions over the past 50 years, DOD's reform efforts have failed to control cost and schedule growth. Recent initiatives by DOD and Congress aim to improve the acquisition process, with some analysts considering them the most comprehensive in over 20 years. In recent years, DOD has undertaken initiatives to improve the process for buying weapon systems, including issuing updated instructions and manuals. A comprehensive effort to enhance the defense acquisition system was initiated in 2010 with the memorandum Better Buying Power, outlining 23 principal actions for greater efficiency and productivity in defense spending. The memorandum outlined 23 actions to improve efficiency in defense spending, including affordability, competition, and faster system acquisition. Better Buying Power 2.0, launched in 2012, aimed to enhance productivity in the Department of Defense and the industrial base. Better Buying Power 3.0 is currently in development, focusing on rewriting rules for a more efficient acquisition process. Efforts to improve defense acquisition include rewriting rules for a more efficient process and enhancing professionalism. Congressional reforms through the National Defense Authorization Act aim to improve acquisition programs and overall structure. The Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009 (S. 454 / P.L. 111-23) made significant changes to weapon system acquisitions, including the appointment of key positions within the DOD to oversee cost assessment and program evaluation. The Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009 made changes to weapon system acquisitions, including appointing key positions in the DOD for oversight. This includes a Director of Developmental Test and Evaluation advising the Secretary of Defense, a Director of Systems Engineering for systems engineering guidance, and requirements for technological maturity assessments and combatant commander influence. Changes to the Nunn-McCurdy Act were also included. Changes to the Nunn-McCurdy Act involve rescinding milestone approvals for programs with cost growth, tightening conflict of interest regulations for contractors on MDAPs, and assigning a DOD official to assess major defense acquisition programs with significant cost growth."
