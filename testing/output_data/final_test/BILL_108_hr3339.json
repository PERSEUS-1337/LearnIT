The National Defense Energy Savings Act of 2003 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to enter into energy savings performance contracts for the purpose of achieving energy savings. The contract can last up to 25 years and must be awarded competitively. The National Defense Energy Savings Act of 2003 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to enter into energy savings performance contracts lasting up to 25 years, awarded competitively. The contract must meet specific criteria, including availability of funds, adherence to Federal Acquisition Regulation, and notification to Congress if the cancellation ceiling exceeds $10,000,000. The contractor incurs costs for implementing energy-saving measures, including energy audits. An energy savings performance contract involves costs for energy audits, equipment installation, and personnel training in exchange for a share of energy savings. The contract also includes terms for annual audits, government payments, and maintenance responsibilities. Annual payments under the contract are limited by the Secretary. The Department of Defense's maintenance costs under an energy savings performance contract are capped at the estimated amount they would have paid for energy, operations, and maintenance without the contract. The contract must guarantee savings to the Department and establish payment schedules reflecting this guarantee. The Secretary will issue final rules within 90 days to establish procedures for selecting, monitoring, and terminating energy savings performance contracts in a cost-effective manner. The Secretary, with the concurrence of the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council, will determine and formulate substitute regulations consistent with laws governing Federal procurement to achieve the intent of this section in a cost-effective manner. The procedures and methods established shall provide for the calculation of energy savings based on sound engineering and financial practices, and allow the Secretary to request statements of qualifications from firms engaged in providing energy savings services. The Secretary can presume contractor qualifications based on past contracts with the Federal Government or listing by a Federal agency. A list of qualified firms for energy savings services will be prepared and updated annually. Selected firms will engage in discussions for proposed energy projects. The Secretary can select the most qualified firm for an energy savings project based on technical and price proposals. Additionally, the Secretary can consider unsolicited proposals from qualified firms for energy savings performance contracting services. The Secretary can choose qualified firms for energy savings projects through a competitive proposal process. Firms not designated as qualified can request a review of the decision. Transition rules apply to energy savings performance contracts under the National Energy Conservation Policy Act. The Secretary can maintain energy savings performance contracts under the National Energy Conservation Policy Act, with modifications as necessary. A pilot program allows up to 10 contracts for energy savings in nonbuilding applications to demonstrate benefits. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress on the progress and results of a pilot program for energy savings performance contracting in non-building applications. The report will include project descriptions, energy and cost savings, and recommendations for extending or expanding the program. The term \"energy savings performance contract\" refers to a contract that involves services for energy conservation through design, acquisition, installation, testing, operation, and maintenance of energy-efficient equipment in federally owned buildings or facilities. The term \"energy savings performance contract\" involves services for energy conservation through design, acquisition, installation, testing, operation, and maintenance of energy-efficient equipment in federally owned buildings or facilities. Contracts for maintenance and repair of energy conservation measures may include software licensing agreements and must comply with prospectus requirements for public buildings. The term \"nonbuilding application\" refers to vehicles, devices, or equipment that consume energy from any fuel source and are transportable by land, sea, or air. The term \"secondary savings\" refers to additional energy or cost savings resulting from energy efficiency improvements financed and implemented through energy savings performance contracts. These savings may include reduced fuel delivery needs, personnel cost savings, and environmental benefits. The term \"secondary savings\" refers to additional benefits, such as increased efficiency in electricity production and revenue from electricity sales to the Federal Government. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Defense."
