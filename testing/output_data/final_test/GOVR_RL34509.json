    "content": "President Robert Mugabe, 86, has been ruling Zimbabwe with his party, the Zimbabwe African National Union--Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF), since 1980. The opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) was formed in response to rising inflation and unemployment rates in the late 1990s. The MDC successfully campaigned against a referendum in 2000 that would have expanded the president's powers and allowed the seizure of white-owned land without compensation. Despite winning nearly half the parliamentary seats in the 2000 election, ZANU-PF has taken undemocratic actions to maintain power. The 2008 elections in Zimbabwe were highly controversial and marked by serious political violence, highlighting the deep divide between ZANU-PF and the opposition. After a power-sharing deal in 2008, ZANU-PF and the MDC formed a coalition government in 2009. Despite initial reforms stabilizing the economy, challenges remain. South Africa mediated to address concerns, and national elections are planned for 2012, expected to be tense. This report gives an overview of recent developments in the transitional government. Zimbabwe's economy collapsed with GDP declining over 50% between 2000 and 2009. Hyperinflation led to prices doubling in less than 24 hours. President Mugabe blamed Western sanctions, while critics point to poor governance. Today, Zimbabwe faces political and economic challenges with over 90% unemployment and declining life expectancy. Over 90% of Zimbabwe's population lacks formal employment, leading to economic challenges. Life expectancy has significantly decreased in the past 20 years due to high HIV/AIDS prevalence. In 2009, 7 million Zimbabweans needed food aid, and despite improvements, localized food insecurity persists. The country's water and sewage systems breakdown caused a cholera outbreak in 2008, resulting in thousands of deaths. Despite donor interventions, one in three rural Zimbabweans still lack access to clean drinking water. Over 3 million people have emigrated in the last decade, including many healthcare professionals. Many hospitals and clinics in Zimbabwe lack medicines, supplies, and functioning equipment, affecting up to half of the country's doctors and nurses. The public education system has deteriorated, with teachers receiving low wages. Flawed elections in 2008 led to political violence, leaving the government isolated internationally. The legitimacy of the Zimbabwe government was questioned after the 2008 elections, leading to political uncertainty. President Mugabe delayed the formation of a new cabinet until a power-sharing agreement, the Global Political Agreement (GPA), was signed with opposition leader Tsvangirai. This agreement established a unity government and outlined a new constitution. In a new unity government in Zimbabwe, Mugabe would remain head of state while Tsvangirai would lead the day-to-day government affairs. Tsvangirai was expected to control the police force, but ZANU-PF refused to give up oversight. The MDC accused the government of abducting and torturing opposition leaders, including Jestina Mukuko. On February 11, 2009, Morgan Tsvangirai was sworn in as the prime minister of Zimbabwe in a transitional coalition government. Arthur Mutambara and Thokozani Khupe were also sworn in as deputy prime ministers as part of a constitutional amendment. The coalition government in Zimbabwe was formalized through a constitutional amendment, with the MDC gaining control of key ministries. However, the MDC's ability to bring about change within the police force, still led by a ZANU-PF loyalist, remains uncertain. Despite being a co-equal partner in government, the MDC and ZANU-PF have struggled to agree on necessary reforms. International donors have emphasized the need for economic and democratic reforms, rule of law, and respect for human rights in Zimbabwe to resume significant aid. Without foreign funds, analysts predict challenges in restoring pre-crisis economic and social indicators. Political uncertainty surrounds the coalition government's future, with a timeline for elections not specified in the power-sharing agreement. Zimbabwe's transitional government has seen economic reforms led by finance minister Tendai Biti, resulting in positive growth and single-digit inflation since 2009. Despite encouraging macroeconomic reforms, the IMF warns of fragile conditions and decelerated growth in 2011 without further policy adjustments. The adoption of hard currencies, mainly the U.S. dollar and the South African rand, has contributed to economic stability. The adoption of hard currencies stabilized prices in 2009 and curbed inflation. The local currency has become worthless, leading to the \"dollarization\" of the economy. Shopkeepers restocked shelves with basic goods, but the cost of living remains high. Retailers are offering credit again, and government \"salaries\" in $100 vouchers were issued to civil servants to combat absenteeism. The government's effort to encourage Zimbabweans, including teachers, to return to work with vouchers. Despite some salary progression, wages remain low. A cash budgeting policy restored fiscal discipline, but revenue limitations and wage overruns have led to deficits since 2010. Revenue generation has improved, but a large public wage bill hinders public services and infrastructure repairs. A payroll audit was conducted with World Bank assistance to address concerns of ghost workers collecting salaries. The audit found 38,000 positions with irregularities, including potentially 14,000 ghost workers, rejected by President Mugabe and ZANU-PF. The ghost worker issue, along with concerns about the government's policies and bank liquidity, are impeding an agreement with the IMF. In 2009, the STERP program aimed to stabilize Zimbabwe's economy by focusing on priority areas like agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and tourism. The STERP program aimed to stabilize Zimbabwe's economy by focusing on agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and tourism. STERP II aimed to consolidate recovery efforts and move towards growth and development. The Finance Ministry introduced a Medium Term Plan (MTP) for longer-term fiscal planning. Regional electricity shortages and infrastructure upgrades complicate economic recovery. Zimbabwe may need donor assistance and foreign investment for recovery. Zimbabwe's Finance Ministry is struggling to attract significant donor financing for key sectors like healthcare and education. Some donors are providing off-budget assistance to avoid contributing to the country's patronage system. The Ministry is coordinating with donors to identify budget lines for targeted assistance in water, education, and sanitation. The World Bank, AfDB, and UNDP have developed a multi-donor trust fund focused on water, sanitation, and power infrastructure in Zimbabwe. Off-budget assistance is seen as a short-term solution until donor confidence improves. Central bank governance, particularly the activities of RBZ Governor Gideon Gono, remains a concern for donors. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, led by Governor Gideon Gono, was responsible for the surge in money supply up to 2008. Price controls implemented by the government in June 2007 led to a decline in manufacturing output, closure of firms, shortage of basic goods, and worsening social indicators. Land reform efforts and local ownership regulations created uncertainty over property rights, deterring foreign investment and lowering consumer confidence. Gono admitted to borrowing over $1 billion from private foreign exchange accounts in the Reserve Bank to pay government expenses in April 2009. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, under Governor Gideon Gono, faced criticism for borrowing from foreign exchange accounts to pay government expenses. Despite calls for Gono's replacement, Biti's reforms have reduced his influence. The IMF acknowledges improvements in governance and restructuring efforts at the bank, focusing on core tasks like monetary policy and financial supervision. Southern African countries, including Zimbabwe, have faced food insecurity due to various factors like drought and HIV/AIDS. Zimbabwe has experienced food insecurity due to severe crop failure and government policies like land reform and price controls. The redistribution of commercial farms to black Zimbabweans has been inefficient, with some land not actively farmed. The government has taken steps to liberalize grain marketing and requested donor assistance for the agriculture sector. Property rights and land reform remain contentious issues. The government faces challenges with property rights and land reform in Zimbabwe, impacting farmers' ability to use land as collateral for loans. A land audit is expected to be slow and contentious, hindering support from donors. Efforts to attract foreign investment are hindered by government policies, with plans to require foreign-owned businesses to offer a majority share to locals. In March 2008, parliament approved plans to \"indigenize\" foreign-owned businesses by requiring them to offer a majority share to local black investors. Initially, the government stated it would not expropriate foreign-owned companies and the law would be based on capital and employment levels. However, in early 2010, new regulations demanded businesses worth $500,000 or more to transfer at least 51% ownership to black Zimbabweans. Prime Minister Tsvangirai dismissed these regulations as unauthorized, leading to a deadline extension and reevaluation by the government. The government is reexamining regulations that may affect major international companies in Zimbabwe, particularly in the mining industry. The proposal to transfer majority ownership of the mining sector has sparked controversy and criticism from various parties, including the IMF and the MDC. Despite progress on economic reforms, political reform benchmarks outlined in the GPA have not been fully met. The GPA outlines benchmarks for political reform in Zimbabwe, including issues like police harassment, repressive legislation, MDC governor appointments, farm invasions, and security sector reform. While some progress has been made in stabilizing the economy and restoring basic services, the MDC criticizes the slow pace of reform and ongoing abuses of power. Development challenges persist due to inadequate energy supply. Development challenges, compounded by inadequate energy supply and lack of infrastructure, have eroded confidence in the current government. International donors share these concerns. In October 2009, the MDC suspended cooperation with ZANU-PF due to unresolved issues hindering the implementation of the GPA. The MDC, led by Tsvangirai, disengaged from executive branch forums following the re-arrest of senior official Roy Bennett. Pressure within the party over the lack of political progress on reforms also influenced this decision. Prime Minister Tsvangirai sought intervention from SADC leaders, including South African President Jacob Zuma. SADC leaders, including South African President Jacob Zuma, are pressuring parties in Zimbabwe to implement the GPA and resolve disputes. Botswana's president refuses to recognize Mugabe as president outside the transitional government. Despite some progress in resolving disagreements, key reforms demanded by the MDC remain outstanding, with negotiations ongoing under Zuma's mediation. Mugabe has yet to accept MDC appointees for key positions, leading to continued protests. The Zimbabwean government has refused to replace key officials despite protests, leading to restrictions on freedoms of speech and association. Efforts to repeal these laws have stalled, with several MDC officials arrested. Analysts suggest arrests were made to overturn the party's parliamentary majority. Civic activists, including Farai Maguwu, have faced scrutiny for their investigations. Civic activists, including Farai Maguwu, investigating abuses in Marange diamond fields, detained by police. Reports of violence by ZANU-PF militia against MDC supporters. Regional heads of state express concern over political issues in Zimbabwe. South African President Jacob Zuma leads regional mediation efforts. JOMIC monitors progress of political accord but lacks enforcement authority. SADC has proposed placing regional representatives in the JOMIC structure to improve effectiveness. President Zuma urges parties to hasten reforms but refrains from criticizing Mugabe. Under SADC mediation, ZANU-PF and MDC agree to a \"roadmap\" for new elections, but tensions persist over proposed reforms. Reports indicate hardline elements within ZANU-PF are undermining the transitional government through farm invasions and detentions of MDC officials. Officials and civic activists are part of the effort to address the concerns surrounding Mugabe's control of the security sector. Security service chiefs have publicly declared their loyalty to Mugabe, raising concerns about a potential violent succession struggle or military coup in the event of his death. The question of presidential succession remains a topic of discussion, with analysts highlighting the possibility of power struggles within Mugabe's party. In 2004, Joice Mujuru became the second vice president, defeating Emmerson Mnangagwa, who is now the minister of defense. Mnangagwa, a key party figure, has been accused of leading purges in the 1980s. Joseph Msika was the other vice president until his death in 2009. Mnangagwa reportedly tried to replace Mujuru as vice president, but failed as the party reconsidered its leadership. In December 2009, delegates at ZANU-PF's party congress reelected Joice Mujuru as vice president and chose John Nkomo to replace Joseph Msika. The recent death of Mujuru's husband, Solomon \"Rex\" Mujuru, has highlighted internal party tensions, with speculation about Mugabe's possible political exit and death. The revelations of human rights abuses in Zimbabwe have embarrassed the president and may impact his decision on reelection. The State Department has accused the former ZANU-PF government of widespread human rights violations, including excessive force, torture, and unlawful killings. Reports show numerous deaths and injuries from political violence in 2008, with no prosecutions or convictions to date. The 2008 politically related killings in Zimbabwe have not resulted in any prosecutions or convictions. Despite a decrease in human rights violations after the formation of a coalition government in 2009, reports of violence between ZANU-PF and MDC supporters persist. Incidents of violence against MDC activists have increased in 2010, possibly linked to the constitutional review process. Allegations suggest that ZANU-PF supporters may still operate \"torture centers\" in the country. The State Department's 2011 report highlights ongoing human rights abuses by security forces, police, and ZANU-PF elements. ZANU-PF's control through manipulation and abuse negated citizens' rights. Security forces tortured and abused non ZANU-PF activists with impunity. Cases of harassment and intimidation increased with projections of an early election in 2011. Security forces failed to document political violence by ZANU-PF loyalists. Activists, journalists, and others were arbitrarily arrested and detained. The government in Zimbabwe continued to suppress freedom of speech, press, assembly, and movement using repressive laws. High-ranking officials threatened violence against demonstrators and activists. Human Rights Watch criticized the MDC for not holding perpetrators of human rights abuses accountable. However, a Supreme Court ruling in 2009 suggested victims may find justice through the justice system. The Supreme Court ruling in Zimbabwe granted Jestina Mukoko and her co-defendants a permanent stay of prosecution after she testified that their confessions were obtained through torture by security forces. The court found that the state violated their constitutional rights. Concerns persist over laws enacted by the previous ZANU-PF-dominated parliament, such as the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA) and the Public Order and Security Act (POSA), which critics argue are used to suppress dissent and influence political developments. The South African-led SADC negotiations in January 2008 resulted in amendments to AIPPA and POSA, which critics argue did not adequately address human rights concerns. The MDC has introduced legislation to repeal POSA, but it remains stalled in parliament. Civic activists have called for judiciary reforms, and the government has yet to prosecute those responsible for crimes related to Operation Murambatsvina or subsequent evictions. At Zimbabwe's independence in 1980, the white minority owned most arable land. Reforms were needed for equitable land distribution. Britain funded a land redistribution program, but dissatisfaction led to violent farm invasions in the 1990s. The government faced political and economic challenges. In response to rising challenges, the government of Zimbabwe implemented aggressive land expropriation policies, leading to withdrawal of financial support from Britain and other donors. Despite a failed referendum in 2000, white-owned farms were invaded by veterans and ruling party supporters, prompting the president to expropriate land without compensation. Attacks against white farmers ensued, with sporadic farm invasions continuing, and a renewed effort to remove remaining white farmers possibly starting in 2009. The land expropriation policies in Zimbabwe led to violence against white farmers, despite a 2008 ruling declaring the program illegal due to racial discrimination. Prime Minister Tsvangirai called the evictions acts of theft but police compliance with his orders is lacking. The World Diamond Council raised concerns about conflict diamonds. The World Diamond Council raised concerns in December 2008 about rough diamonds from Zimbabwe being illegally exported, bypassing the Kimberly Process. Reports indicate serious abuses by security personnel in the Marange diamond fields, with villagers forced to work and stones smuggled out. Questions have been raised about the transparency of revenues from the mines, with critics suggesting illicit profits may be funding political campaigns. The European Union called for an investigation. The European Union called for an investigation into Zimbabwe's compliance with its Kimberly obligations in early 2009. A high-level KP delegation visited Zimbabwe in March to address concerns of violence and smuggling in the Marange area. The KP Secretariat refrained from suspending Zimbabwe from the certification scheme. During a KP Plenary meeting in late 2009, stringent export controls on diamonds from Marange were called for. The Zimbabwe government reported security forces withdrawing from the area, with a judge ordering the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe to hold all diamonds until legal claims were resolved. Calls were made for Zimbabwe to be suspended from the Process if recommended controls were not implemented. In June 2011, the KP Chair announced that exports from Marange could resume, leading to protests from the United States and other Western governments. The Kimberly Process had previously investigated allegations of \"blood diamonds\" from the DRC being smuggled with rough stones from Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe has been linked to conflict diamonds in the past, with senior officials named in a 2003 U.N. report for profiting from illicit trade during military operations in the DRC. The international community remains divided on how to respond to Zimbabwe's political troubles, with Western governments critical of ZANU-PF policies. African governments support the transitional government but call for further reforms. China urges Western governments to lift sanctions against Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe is in arrears to major financial institutions, making it ineligible for new loans. International donors provided $540 million in the first year of the transitional government for social services and humanitarian assistance. Analysts suggest Zimbabwe will need foreign donor assistance for economic recovery. IMF warned of economic deterioration without cash budget support and humanitarian aid. The IMF warned of economic and social deterioration in Zimbabwe. Donors are hesitant to provide large-scale funding until free and fair elections are held. Mugabe and ZANU-PF officials linked political concessions to the removal of sanctions. International organizations and foreign governments' reactions to Zimbabwe's 2008 elections and transitional government are discussed. Critics fault SADC for inaction during Zimbabwe's crisis. Zambia's President Levy Mwanawasa called Zimbabwe \"a sinking Titanic.\" Levy Mwanawasa, as head of SADC, convened a meeting in 2008 to address Zimbabwe's elections, urging for timely release of results and a secure runoff environment. He emphasized the need for the people's verdict to be heard for a new beginning in Zimbabwe's history. Mugabe dismissed the meeting as a British show. After Tsvangirai's withdrawal, Mwanawasa commented on the election process. President Mwanawasa criticized the undemocratic environment of Zimbabwe's elections and passed away in August 2008. Botswana refused to recognize Mugabe as president and called for international isolation. International leaders, including Kofi Annan, criticized SADC's response to the crisis. In late January 2009, SADC heads of state met to mediate a final settlement on Zimbabwe amidst regional criticism. The Troika, consisting of three SADC heads of state, including South African President Jacob Zuma, addressed outstanding political issues in Zimbabwe. In March 2011, the Troika met in Livingstone, Zambia, where President Zuma briefed counterparts on the latest developments, including Prime Minister Tsvangirai's appeal for intervention to resolve political disputes and pave the way for credible elections. In a meeting in Livingstone, Zambia, the Troika expressed disappointment with the lack of progress in implementing the GPA in Zimbabwe and noted a resurgence of violence and intimidation. They called for an end to the violence and for SADC to assist Zimbabwe in preparing for peaceful elections. President Mugabe and his party were displeased with the Troika's findings. President Zuma later reiterated these concerns in a report at a SADC Summit in South Africa. Zuma issued a report on Zimbabwe, reiterating the findings from the Livingstone Communiqu\u00e9 and calling for an end to violence and harassment. SADC heads of state decided to appoint three officials to support Zimbabwe's GPA monitoring mechanism, despite objections from ZANU-PF. The MDC is pushing for SADC to take a stronger stance on security sector reforms. The Obama Administration supports SADC's mediation efforts but opposes lifting sanctions against Mugabe and ZANU-PF officials. The African Union criticized the violence in Zimbabwe in 2008 but lacked consensus on how to address it. At the 2008 AU Summit in Sharm el Sheikh, Botswana, Kenya, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Ghana called for punitive measures against the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe. The AU failed to reach agreement on sanctions but issued a public call for talks toward a unity government. Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete encouraged a greater role on Zimbabwe by the United Nations. Kenya's prime minister, Raila Odinga, called on AU leaders not to allow Mugabe to attend the summit and for peacekeepers to be sent to Zimbabwe. Odinga received widespread attention for his comments on Zimbabwe. Odinga called for peacekeepers to be sent to Zimbabwe and later visited the country as a keynote speaker at the MDC's 2011 party congress. South Africa has a large population of illegal immigrants, mainly from Zimbabwe, leading to tensions and xenophobic violence in 2008. The government deployed the army internally to address the situation. Periodic attacks against Zimbabweans continue, with concerns over human rights abuses reported in Zimbabwe. South Africa has resumed deporting undocumented Zimbabwean migrants. Former South African President Thabo Mbeki faced criticism at home for his reaction to Zimbabwe's 2008 elections. Public pressure led Mbeki to take a stronger stance on the violence, sending retired generals to investigate. The ruling ANC party condemned Zimbabwe's government for violating democratic rights. The ANC condemned Zimbabwe's government for violating democratic rights and expressed support for President Mbeki's mediation efforts. South Africa's current president, Jacob Zuma, criticized the 2008 elections and called for action to address the crisis in Zimbabwe. Jacob Zuma criticized the 2008 elections in Zimbabwe, questioning the electoral commission's credibility and calling for African leaders to assist in resolving the crisis. He emphasized the need for reforms in 2011 but refrained from publicly criticizing Mugabe. Zuma also condemned Western governments for withholding financial assistance from the coalition government. In response to delayed release of electoral results, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and other Western nations called on the U.N. Security Council to address the Zimbabwe situation. The U.N. Security Council held a special session on April 29, 2008, to discuss Zimbabwe, with some members pushing for a U.N. envoy to visit the country. President Mugabe denounced the Council's actions as \"sinister, racist, and colonial.\" On June 22, the Council issued a statement condemning violence and political repression by the government of Zimbabwe. The Group of Eight (G8) nations imposed sanctions on the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe in July 2008 due to ongoing violence. A U.S.-sponsored resolution in the U.N. Security Council called for targeted sanctions and an arms embargo, but it was vetoed by Russia and China. South Africa expressed reservations about the sanctions, arguing that Zimbabwe did not pose a threat to international security. Some criticized South Africa's stance on Zimbabwe, arguing that the crisis had regional implications. The EU maintains sanctions against Zimbabwe's former administration, including a ban on weapon sales. Queen Elizabeth revoked Mugabe's Knighthood. In 2009, the EU sent a delegation to Zimbabwe to renew diplomatic engagement, but sanctions would remain until the GPA was fully implemented. In January 2010, Foreign Secretary David Miliband faced criticism for implying that the EU would only ease sanctions on Zimbabwe based on Prime Minister Tsvangirai's recommendation. MDC officials found Miliband's comments unhelpful and undermining Tsvangirai's position in negotiations with Mugabe. The UK clarified that any change in sanctions would be determined by progress on political reforms. The EU renewed targeted sanctions but removed some individuals and entities from the list, while still providing humanitarian and limited development assistance. The US government has been critical of the situation. The US government has imposed targeted sanctions against President Mugabe and his former regime for poor human rights record. Despite criticism, the US remains a major donor of humanitarian aid to Zimbabwe. The George W. Bush Administration was highly critical of the ZANU-PF government. Frazer accused Mugabe of election theft and urged him to step down. The US condemned violence orchestrated by Mugabe's regime and called for African governments to resolve the political impasse. Condoleezza Rice criticized the power-sharing talks as a \"sham.\" In December, Condoleezza Rice criticized the power-sharing talks as a \"sham.\" The Obama Administration supports the transitional government but is cautious in its engagement, pressing for full implementation of the GPA. President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Prime Minister Tsvangirai in June 2009. President Mugabe is prohibited from traveling to the United States, except for U.N. events. The State Department emphasized that additional development assistance and easing sanctions depend on effective governance. In late 2009, President Obama presented Women of Zimbabwe Arise (WOZA) with the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award. Mugabe blames Western sanctions for the country's economic collapse. Zimbabwean officials blame Western sanctions, particularly the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act (ZDERA) passed in 2001, for the country's economic collapse. The United States has enforced targeted sanctions against top government officials and associates since 2003 to punish those responsible without harming the population. These sanctions ban travel to the U.S. by senior government members and individuals benefiting financially from them. President George W. Bush issued an executive order in 2003 freezing assets of over 70 high-ranking Zimbabwe officials and President Mugabe's wife, Grace. The order allows the Secretary of the Treasury to block property of those undermining Zimbabwe's democratic processes. President Obama renewed the sanctions in March 2011, targeting some ZANU-PF members in government positions. Congress opposed Zimbabwe's economic mismanagement and undemocratic policies, calling for sanctions. The Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001 (ZDERA; P.L. 107-99) imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe due to economic mismanagement and undemocratic policies. The legislation prohibits U.S. support for financial assistance until certain conditions regarding rule of law, democratic elections, and land reform are met. Zimbabwe was already ineligible for loans from the IMF and World Bank due to debt arrears. The Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001 (ZDERA; P.L. 107-99) imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe for economic mismanagement and undemocratic policies. If the President certifies ZDERA's conditions are met, the Secretary of the Treasury will review restructuring Zimbabwe's debt held by the U.S. government. Congress has influenced U.S. policy towards Zimbabwe for over a decade, with key figures like President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton introducing legislation in response to political violence. Members of the 110th Congress criticized the Mugabe Administration after the 2008 elections and passed a resolution calling for release of presidential results and a peaceful transition to democratic rule. The Senate and House of Representatives passed resolutions condemning the 2008 violence in Zimbabwe and calling for a peaceful transition to democratic rule, international arms embargo, and targeted sanctions against the Mugabe regime. They also encouraged the creation of a comprehensive political and economic recovery package in the event of a democratic government assuming power. Members of Congress called for the postponement of the 2008 runoff election and discussed the possibility of a unity government. The 111th Congress monitored developments in Zimbabwe, considering resolutions to sever diplomatic ties and declaring the crisis a threat to international security. Senate Foreign Relations Africa Subcommittee discussed U.S. policy towards Zimbabwe, emphasizing the need to support reformers in the transitional government. In May 2010, Senators introduced legislation aimed at promoting democracy and economic recovery in Zimbabwe. Representative Payne also introduced a bill for debt forgiveness for Zimbabwe. Another bill aimed at repealing sanctions on Zimbabwe was reintroduced in October 2011. The United States has been a significant donor of humanitarian assistance to Zimbabwe, providing around $1 billion in aid since 2002. In FY2008, U.S. assistance totaled over $325 million, including food aid, health programs, and democracy support. President Obama pledged $73 million in new assistance in 2009. U.S. aid to Zimbabwe in FY2010 was over $168 million, with $80 million in humanitarian aid. The Obama Administration requested almost $110 million for assistance in the following year. The Obama Administration has requested almost $110 million for non-humanitarian aid in FY2012 for Zimbabwe, including funds for health, governance, and economic growth programs. Zimbabwe is not eligible for certain U.S. aid programs due to loan defaults, which prohibit direct assistance to the government based on past due indebtedness. ZDERA prohibits U.S. support for loans to Zimbabwe's government by international financial institutions. U.S. assistance to Zimbabwe's central government has been restricted since FY2010, except for health, education, and macroeconomic growth aid. President Obama requires effective governance before lifting sanctions or providing significant financial support for Zimbabwe's economic recovery. The IMF and other donors expect economic and political policy changes in Zimbabwe, including an end to farm disruptions, politically motivated violence, and media intimidation. Initial economic reform conditions have been met, such as price liberalization and central bank transparency reforms. Zimbabwe's Finance Ministry is working towards meeting other reform conditions for credible stewardship of the Reserve Bank. Credible stewardship of the Reserve Bank and restoring Zimbabwe's relationship with the IMF and World Bank will take time. U.S. officials expect progress on governance and democracy through constitutional reform and elections. The parties to the GPA may have reached their limit until new elections resolve the transitional government. Deployment of international monitors could help prevent potential violence. The deployment of international monitors could prevent potential violence related to the planned constitutional referendum or upcoming elections in Zimbabwe. The Mugabe government has a history of denying entry to similar delegations, including the Elders group in 2008 and the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture in 2009. SADC is pushing for regional representatives to be included in Zimbabwe's joint monitoring commission, JOMIC. In October 2011, the Archbishop of Canterbury visited President Mugabe to discuss grievances of Zimbabwe's Anglican clergy. SADC is pushing for regional representatives to be included in Zimbabwe's joint monitoring commission, JOMIC, to improve effectiveness and impartiality. Calls for justice for members of the Mugabe government are being considered cautiously. Donors are hesitant to provide financial support for economic recovery due to political uncertainty. The IMF warns that real GDP growth may not continue without policy changes. Zimbabwe's economy is in crisis with unsustainable debt levels, leading to a suspension of World Bank and IMF lending for over a decade. Various sectors like agriculture and manufacturing have declined, while the mining sector shows potential but requires significant investments. Government policies like land reform and economic empowerment have created uncertainty, deterring foreign investment. This situation puts pressure on both the people and the government of Zimbabwe. The economic crisis in Zimbabwe, exacerbated by unsustainable debt levels and government policies like land reform, has created uncertainty over property rights and deterred foreign investment. The current government faces challenges in countering the entrenched patronage system and addressing the lasting repercussions of past policies, such as mass urban evictions in 2005. Donor pressure and support, along with potential reconstruction options, may help alleviate these development challenges. The World Bank, IMF, and Britain may provide funds for land redistribution in Zimbabwe post-Mugabe. Donor assistance is crucial for rebuilding the health and education sectors. Reviving agriculture requires addressing land distribution issues. Foreign currency flow for salaries is essential for stability, but donor concerns remain. The IMF has noted positive steps towards fiscal discipline in Zimbabwe but will not renew lending until debts are repaid and sound policies are implemented. IMF has resumed technical assistance to improve revenue collection and bank payment systems. No meaningful assistance will be offered without a positive new image projected by the government. The IMF has resumed technical assistance to improve Zimbabwe's revenue collection and bank payment system, with the goal of addressing external debt arrears and pursuing debt relief. The State Department has highlighted the need for capital infusion and program investment for Zimbabwe's successful transition. Zimbabwe's transition requires capital infusion and program investment in the short- and long-term. The government seeks technical assistance on trade policy and regulatory reforms, with caution that progress is needed to receive further aid. Foreign governments debate lifting sanctions against Zimbabwe and ZANU-PF elite members. Some suggest lifting sanctions against Zimbabwe and ZANU-PF elite, while others argue they are necessary for democratic reforms. Restrictions include travel and financial limitations on individuals, donor aid bans to the government, and restrictions on supporting IMF and World Bank lending. IMF and World Bank policies also hinder financial flows due to Zimbabwe's debt arrears. Zimbabwe's outstanding debt arrears are a key issue, with the IMF and other multilateral banks requiring a track record of sound fiscal policy before addressing the arrears. Some policymakers question whether debt forgiveness should be considered now or delayed until a new democratically elected government takes office. In 2007, South Africa mediated negotiations between the government and opposition to create conditions for free and fair elections. In 2007, negotiations in Zimbabwe led to some laws being amended to address press freedom and political activity. However, talks were halted when President Mugabe set an election date without consulting the opposition. The opposition party, MDC, remained divided, and despite internal dissatisfaction with Mugabe, ZANU-PF nominated him as their presidential candidate. The central committee also proposed holding all elections simultaneously and reducing terms for public offices. In 2007, the parliament in Zimbabwe passed a controversial Constitutional Amendment Bill that reduced the term of public offices and aimed to increase the number of parliamentarians. Critics accused the ruling party of gerrymandering by creating new constituencies in rural areas where they had stronger support. The bill was supported by MDC MPs, with some changes made to appease the opposition. Simba Makoni, a senior member of ZANU-PF, announced his candidacy against President Mugabe in the upcoming elections but was expelled from the party and ran as an independent. Simba Makoni was expelled from ZANU-PF and ran as an independent candidate with support from senior party officials. He had previously served as finance minister and criticized the administration's economic policies. Civic activists reported pre-election irregularities, and observers from over 40 countries were invited, but some were allegedly barred. Western media organizations were denied permission to cover the elections. Zimbabwe's first \"harmonized\" elections took place on March 29, 2008. Zimbabwe's first \"harmonized\" elections were held on March 29, 2008. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) announced the National Assembly results four days after the election, with the MDC factions winning 109 seats over ZANU-PF's 97. Tsvangirai received more votes than Mugabe in the presidential race but failed to avoid a runoff. Tsvangirai agreed to stand against Mugabe in a second round of voting despite opposition accusations of result manipulation. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission declared a runoff election to be held three months after the initial results were announced. Reports of political violence increased, with critics alleging government involvement to ensure a Mugabe victory. Security service chiefs publicly declared support for Mugabe, leading to Tsvangirai withdrawing from the race citing attacks against MDC supporters and lack of a fair playing field. Despite concerns raised by African observer missions and the UN Security Council, the government proceeded with the runoff as scheduled. Despite concerns of political violence and lack of a fair election, Mugabe won the runoff with over 85% of the vote. His victory was deemed illegitimate by several countries. Prior to the election, there were discussions about forming a transitional coalition government, but ultimately a unity government was deemed \"not feasible.\" Bank governor Gideon Gono attempted to persuade the president to accept a unity government, but was overruled by senior security officials. ZANU-PF hardliners are concerned about immunity for human rights abuses. Both parties expressed willingness to negotiate after the elections, but ZANU-PF insisted that Tsvangirai acknowledge Mugabe's victory first. Tsvangirai refused, leading to increased violence post-election. The MDC claimed over 500 supporters were killed. The MDC alleged that over 500 of its supporters were killed in the months after the election, with the ruling party implicated in orchestrating the attacks. Various groups, including the army, police, and intelligence service, were also implicated. Self-styled war veteran leader Jabuli Sibanda warned of a potential reinvasion of the country, echoing fears of a white takeover reported in the state-owned Herald newspaper. In the wake of the election, white former commercial farmers are threatening resettled black farmers with eviction. Farm invasions have led to over 100 white farmers being forced off their lands. Rural areas in Zimbabwe have been heavily affected by post-election violence, with thousands fleeing to urban areas. Medical clinics in Harare were overwhelmed during the violence. The number of white farmers in the country may have decreased to less than 250 due to further evictions in 2009. The largest farmers' union in Zimbabwe reported that militias displaced over 40,000 farm workers, with widespread reports of burned homes, granaries, and livestock. The United Nations' representative noted a pattern of political violence targeting suspected MDC followers. An SADC mission confirmed the level of violence, with reports of torture and destruction. Some Zimbabwean officials accused the MDC of rigging and inciting violence, leading to arrests of MDC legislators and officials on terrorism charges. Activists were charged with terrorism and sabotage, while over 100 election officers were arrested for fraud and abusing public office in favor of the MDC. Teachers, who held many election officer positions, were specifically targeted by government supporters."
