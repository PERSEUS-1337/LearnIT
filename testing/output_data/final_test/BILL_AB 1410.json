    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The State of California has recognized the Armenian Genocide annually and urged Turkey to acknowledge the genocide, honor international treaties, end religious discrimination, and return church properties. Genocide is defined by the UN as the intent to destroy a group, and denial perpetuates its effects even after active phases have ended. The government of Turkey denies responsibility for the Armenian Genocide, engages in genocide denial and historical revisionism, and actively works to rewrite history and defeat legislation recognizing the genocide. Efforts to effect Armenian cultural erasure include ethnic cleansings and destruction of sacred Armenian sites. Mentioning the genocide in Turkey can lead to criminal prosecution under Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code. The State of California, with the largest Armenian-American population in the US, has legislation to divest from countries like South Africa, Sudan, and Iran for human rights violations. Armenians in California, descendants of genocide survivors, contribute to various fields but still face the effects of Turkey's denial campaign. The State of California invests public funds in Turkey, which denies the Armenian Genocide and funds its denial campaign. This contradicts California's recognition of the genocide and its call for Turkey to acknowledge its responsibility. The government of Turkey, not the people, is responsible for human rights violations and genocide denial. California invests in Turkish bonds, enabling denial of the Armenian Genocide. Divesting funds would show non-complicity and encourage acknowledgment and reparations. Section 7513.75 is added to the Government Code, defining terms related to the government of Turkey and public employee retirement funds. The board is prohibited from investing public employee retirement funds in any investment vehicle in Turkey issued or controlled by the government. By June 30, 2016, the board must identify which Turkish investment vehicles require divestment. If a Turkish investment vehicle meets the criteria, it will be subject to specific regulations. The board is prohibited from investing public employee retirement funds in Turkish government-controlled investment vehicles. If an investment vehicle does not meet specified criteria, the board must report the reasons for non-compliance to the Legislature. The board must request removal of investments in a company from a commingled fund if limited to that fund. If a new fund without prohibited investments is created by June 30, 2016, transferring investments to the new fund will satisfy the requirement. If the board's investment in a fund is limited to certain vehicles, the fund manager can create a new fund without those vehicles. Transferring investments to the new fund will meet the requirement, unless the board determines the new fund is not financially equivalent. The board must make efforts to identify private equity investments involving specific investment vehicles or linked to the government of Turkey. If such investments are identified, the board may choose to subject them to certain regulations. If no action is taken, the board must provide reasons for its decision in a report. The board, as a shareholder or investor, must notify investment vehicles linked to the government of Turkey and request them to disassociate within 90 days. If substantial action is taken within this period, the investment vehicle is not subject to further regulations. The board will monitor progress until substantial action is taken in Turkey. Investment vehicles linked to the government of Turkey must disassociate within 90 days of notification by the board. Failure to take substantial action within one year will result in penalties. If an investment vehicle linked to the government of Turkey fails to disassociate within 90 days, the board will take actions such as ceasing new investments and liquidating existing ones within 18 months. A report must be filed annually with the Legislature detailing these actions. The board must provide a list of investments in vehicles meeting specific criteria, including details on any association with the government of Turkey. They must also disclose if investments have been reduced and explain any reasons for not completely divesting. Additionally, any relevant information from other sections must be included in the report. The board must report on investments transferred to non-Turkish funds, annual financial results, and actions taken regarding Turkish investment vehicles. If all investments in a Turkish vehicle are sold, a report must be filed with the Legislature. The board is not required to take action if it would not meet fiduciary responsibilities. This section is known as the California Public Divest from Turkey to End the Perpetuation of the Armenian Genocide Act. Section 16642 of the Government Code is amended. Board members, officers, employees, research firms, and investment managers of the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System or the State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System are indemnified and held harmless by the State of California from all claims and liabilities related to investment decisions. SEC. 4 of the act states that its provisions are severable, meaning if any part is deemed invalid, it will not affect the rest that can still be enforced."
