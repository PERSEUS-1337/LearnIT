    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Travel Regional Investment Partnership Act\". The importance of travel and tourism is highlighted by Congress, with over 8 million domestic jobs dependent on the industry. The US travel and tourism sector generates over $691 billion annually, contributing significantly to the GDP. The industry is resilient to outsourcing and has faced challenges due to the current economic downturn. The domestic travel and tourism industry has been struggling since the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks. In 2009 alone, the industry contracted by nearly $130 billion, with a 4.5% decline in the domestic tourism economy. Spending on travel and tourism has been decreasing since 2008, leading to a decline in industry employment. Public-private partnerships are seen as a valuable tool in promoting domestic tourism growth. The Domestic Regional Tourism Grant Program is established. The Secretary of Commerce establishes a grant program to promote domestic regional tourism growth. Grants range from $100,000 to $1,000,000. Eligible entities include Convention and Visitors Bureaus and partnerships between government and tourism entities. Application process involves submission by eligible entities. An eligible entity must submit an application to the Secretary for a grant under this section, including a description of tourist promotion activities and details of partnerships with local tourism entities. The grant recipient must provide non-Federal matching funds, either in cash or in-kind, equal to the grant amount. In-kind contributions are limited to 25 percent of the total matching funds required. Reports are due six months after the end of each fiscal year. The Secretary of Commerce must submit a report to Congress on travel-generated expenditures, tax receipts, and employment within 6 months after each fiscal year. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Commerce, and \"local tourist entity\" refers to businesses engaged in tourism activities. $10,000,000 is authorized for grants for the first 5 fiscal years after enactment, with funds remaining available until expended."
