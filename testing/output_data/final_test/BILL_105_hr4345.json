The Council on Environmental Quality waived requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 to expedite tree removal in affected areas. The approval of alternative arrangements by the Council is commendable for addressing the urgent situation. The Council on Environmental Quality approved alternative arrangements to prevent wildfires and insect infestations in national forests and public lands. Similar catastrophic forest conditions exist nationwide, warranting treatment equivalent to the approved arrangements. The Council on Environmental Quality approved alternative arrangements to prevent wildfires and insect infestations in national forests and public lands. SEC. 2. WAIVER OF NEPA REQUIREMENTS FOR TREATMENT OF DEAD, DOWNED, AND SEVERELY ROOT-SPRUNG TREES. The Secretary of Agriculture may remove dead, downed, or severely root-sprung trees in specified areas in accordance with approved alternative arrangements for National Forests and Grasslands. The areas include blowdown forests in Colorado and bark beetle infested forests in Utah. Approximately 25,000 acres of insect and fuel-loading conditions in the Tahoe Basin, California, 28,000 acres of fire-damaged trees in the Malheur National Forest, Oregon, 10,000 acres of gypsy moth infestation in the Allegheny National Forest, Pennsylvania, 5,000 acres of ice-damaged forests in the White Mountain National Forest, New Hampshire, and the Green Mountain National Forest, Vermont, 10,000 acres of Mountain pine beetle damaged forests in Idaho, and 10,000 acres of ice-damaged forests in the Daniel Boone National Forest, Kentucky. Approximately 15,000 acres of fire-damaged, dead, and dying trees in the Osceola National Forest and Apalachica National Forest, Florida. The Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary of the Interior shall request the Council on Environmental Quality to approve alternative arrangements for the removal of dead trees on national forest or public domain lands affected by catastrophic forest conditions. The Council on Environmental Quality must promptly consider and approve or disapprove requests for alternative arrangements for the removal of dead trees on national forest or public domain lands affected by catastrophic forest conditions. The Chairman of the Council shall issue regulations within 180 days to govern the approval process and establish criteria for consideration of such requests."
