    "content": "The Act refers to Title 38, United States Code for amendments or repeals. Section 2 establishes benefits for children of Vietnam veterans born with Spina Bifida, known as the Agent Orange Benefits Act of 1996. The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the special needs of certain children of Vietnam veterans born with spina bifida due to herbicide exposure during active service in Vietnam, through health care, vocational training, and monetary benefits. Definitions include a child as a natural child of a Vietnam veteran conceived after the veteran entered Vietnam, and a Vietnam veteran as a veteran who served in Vietnam. The term 'Vietnam veteran' refers to a veteran who served in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era. 'Spina bifida' encompasses all forms except spina bifida occulta. Health care, including various forms of care, is provided by the Secretary to children of Vietnam veterans suffering from spina bifida. The term 'health care provider' includes specialized spina bifida clinics, healthcare plans, insurers, organizations, institutions, or any entity providing covered health care services. 'Home care' refers to outpatient care. The term 'home care' includes outpatient care, habilitative and rehabilitative care, preventive health services, and health-related services provided in a person's home or residence. It also defines 'hospital care' as treatment for a disability for a patient admitted to a hospital, 'nursing home care' as treatment for a resident in a nursing home, 'outpatient care' as treatment outside of hospitals or nursing homes, and 'preventive care' as services to prevent disability or illness. The term 'respite care' refers to intermittent care provided in a Department facility to individuals residing primarily in private residences, helping them to continue living at home. The Secretary may provide vocational training to a child of a Vietnam veteran with spina bifida if feasible. The program is tailored to the child's needs and outlined in a written plan. It includes vocationally oriented services, placement assistance, and work adjustment training. The vocational training program for children of Vietnam veterans with spina bifida includes vocationally oriented services, placement assistance, and work adjustment training. The program may last up to 24 months, with a possible extension if needed to achieve vocational goals. Loan or subsistence allowances are not provided, and education at a higher institution is only included in specific cases. The Secretary may determine vocational training eligibility for children of Vietnam veterans with spina bifida. Assistance cannot be received concurrently with another program, and the total assistance period is limited to 48 months. A monthly allowance is provided for disability resulting from spina bifida. The allowance paid for disability resulting from spina bifida is based on the degree of disability, with three levels established by the Secretary. The monthly allowance ranges from $200 to $1,200 depending on the level of disability. Additionally, any increase in benefit amounts under the Social Security Act results in a corresponding increase in the allowance provided. The Secretary increases allowance rates under this section in line with Social Security benefit increases. The Secretary publishes new rates in the Federal Register and may round them for ease of administration. Receiving an allowance here does not affect a child's right to other benefits. The amendments made by this section, effective October 1, 1996, ensure that the allowance paid to a child under this section does not impact eligibility for other federal benefits. Benefits for children of Vietnam veterans born with spina bifida are clarified for entitlement to disability benefits resulting from treatment provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Section 1151 is amended to award compensation for qualifying additional disability or death of a veteran resulting from hospital care or treatment provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs, as long as it was not due to the veteran's willful misconduct. Section 1151 is amended to award compensation for additional disability or death of a veteran resulting from hospital care or treatment provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs, due to fault or unforeseeable events, or as a result of training and rehabilitation services. The amendments to section 1151 of title 38, United States Code, govern eligibility for benefits for claims filed on or after the date of enactment of this Act, including original applications and applications for benefits based on disability or death resulting from VA hospital care or treatment."
