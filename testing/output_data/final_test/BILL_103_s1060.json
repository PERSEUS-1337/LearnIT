    "content": "METALLURGICAL COAL MINING CREDIT: A new section, SEC. 45A, is added to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, providing a credit for metallurgical coal mining. The metallurgical coal mining credit under section 38 is determined as the lesser of the premiums paid for coal industry health benefits or 7.5% of gross revenue from qualified metallurgical coal sales to an unrelated person. Taxpayers must have sold at least 20% qualified metallurgical coal in the past 4 years to qualify for the credit. The applicable percentage for the metallurgical coal mining credit is the percentage of qualified metallurgical coal sold to unrelated persons, not exceeding 75%. Qualified metallurgical coal is bituminous coal used in iron and steel production from an economic interest held by a signatory operator. The term 'unrelated person' has the same meaning as in section 29. Affiliated groups are treated as one taxpayer for the credit allocation. 'Economic interest' refers to an interest eligible for depletion allowance. 'Bituminous coal' is classified according to ASTM D 338. The term 'qualified coal' refers to bituminous coal produced and processed by a signatory operator from an economic interest. A 'signatory operator' includes all members of the affiliated group. The term 'ton' is defined as 2,000 pounds. These definitions are part of the general business credit. The amendment adds a new paragraph regarding the metallurgical coal credit to the tax code. It allows the credit to offset 90 percent of the minimum tax for taxpayers eligible for the credit. The amendment allows the metallurgical coal credit to offset 90 percent of the taxpayer's tentative minimum tax for the year. The portion of the credit not used against the normal limitation is the excess of the credit attributable to metallurgical coal over the limitation, reduced by other factors. The metallurgical coal credit can offset 90% of the taxpayer's tentative minimum tax, with any excess credit reduced by other factors. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code. The amendments for metallurgical coal mining credit will be effective on January 1, 1993."
