A task force concluded that many detainees pose a severe and permanent threat to national security and should be held indefinitely without trial. Despite the conclusion by US national security agencies, the Obama Administration plans to transfer more detainees to other countries. A report found that a rehabilitation center in Saudi Arabia had a 20% recidivism rate among former Guantanamo detainees. Additionally, it was reported that at least 30 former detainees engaged in anti-coalition militant activities after leaving US detention, with some being killed in combat in Afghanistan and Pakistan. According to the Department of Defense, the recidivism rate of former Guantanamo detainees was 14 percent in May 2009. Some countries and organizations have expressed reluctance to accept additional detainees due to security concerns. Australia and Hungary have rejected requests citing stringent national security criteria. Hungarian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Zsuzsanna Matrai announced on June 19, 2009, that Hungary will prioritize the safety of the country and its citizens in studying each detainee case. In Switzerland, a vote on January 12, 2010, by the Parliamentary Security Committee rejected accepting more Guantanamo detainees due to heightened security concerns after the Christmas Detroit bombing attempt. The European Parliament highlighted that detainees who attended terrorist training camps in Afghanistan after September 11, 2001, were not tourists but potential threats. Harthmuth Nassauer, a German member of the European Parliament, stated on February 4, 2009, that detainees who attended terrorist training camps in Afghanistan after September 11, 2001, were not tourists but potential threats.
