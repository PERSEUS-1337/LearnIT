    "content": "The Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 (TSCA) is being reexamined due to recent legal, scientific, and technological developments. This change comes after years of little interest from legislators in amending the law, despite past experiences with chemicals like DDT, leaded gasoline, and asbestos showing adverse effects due to insufficient information about toxicity and exposure. The Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 (TSCA) is under review due to recent legal, scientific, and technological advancements. Despite long-standing concerns, legislators have shown little interest in amending the law. Proposed bills in the 110th Congress aimed to reshape U.S. chemical regulation. Federal legislation for chemical regulation was first suggested in 1971 by the President's Council on Environmental Quality. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) was passed in 1976 to regulate dangerous chemicals not covered by other environmental laws. Controversies over screening, costs, and other regulations delayed its passage. Environmental contamination incidents and cost estimates eventually led to its final approval by President Ford. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) was signed into law by President Ford on October 11, 1976. It established federal policies for regulating chemical substances and mixtures in U.S. commerce, focusing on developing data on health and environmental effects, regulating substances presenting risks, and ensuring authority is exercised without impeding. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) aims to regulate chemical substances and mixtures in U.S. commerce to prevent unreasonable risks to health and the environment. Congress intends for the Administrator to consider environmental, economic, and social impacts when implementing the Act. TSCA covers all chemical substances, defined broadly as any organic or inorganic substance with a specific molecular identity. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) regulates chemical substances in U.S. commerce to prevent health and environmental risks. TSCA defines chemical substances broadly as any organic or inorganic substance with a specific molecular identity. The law excludes substances already regulated, like mixtures, pesticides, and food, drugs, cosmetics, and devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. TSCA Section 4 directs EPA to require tests for existing chemicals if they pose unreasonable risks to health or the environment, or if they are produced in large volumes with potential for environmental release or human exposure. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) requires EPA to issue test rules for chemicals with insufficient data and testing needs. A special interagency committee helps determine priority chemicals for testing. The Interagency Testing Committee (ITC) recommends chemicals for EPA action every six months. EPA must respond to new listings on the Priority Testing List by conducting tests. EPA must publish a Federal Register notice within 12 months for chemicals on the Priority Testing List, proposing a test rule or providing reasons for not doing so. TSCA Section 8 allows EPA to collect information on chemicals for risk evaluation, including issuing rules for record keeping and reports by manufacturers and importers. Required report elements may include chemical identity, use categories, amount manufactured, environmental and health effect data, and disposal methods. TSCA Section 8 requires chemical manufacturers to maintain records of adverse reactions to health or the environment caused by the substance, submit unpublished health and safety studies, and inform EPA of any substantial risks. EPA is directed by TSCA Section 10 to conduct and coordinate research programs. EPA conducts research programs through federal agencies as directed by TSCA Section 10. Section 27 authorizes research and development of test methods for chemicals. EPA is required to prevent future risks through pre-manufacture screening and regulatory tracking of new chemical products. Manufacturers must notify EPA 90 days prior to introducing a new chemical product into the US and provide relevant information for evaluation. The EPA requires manufacturers to notify them 90 days before introducing a new chemical product into the US to evaluate potential risks to human health and the environment. Exemptions may be granted under certain circumstances, and the EPA has the authority to prohibit or limit activities that pose unreasonable risks. The EPA has up to 90 days (or 180 days with an extension) to evaluate the potential risks of a new chemical product. The EPA may determine that a substance presents an unreasonable risk based on scientific evidence, and if so, they must establish requirements to protect against that risk. Structure-activity relationship analysis is often used when data is lacking. If there is inadequate data on hazard and exposure potential, and the substance is produced in large quantities or poses a risk during manufacture, distribution, use, or disposal, the EPA must take action. EPA may issue a proposed order to prohibit or limit activities for chemicals with substantial environmental release or human exposure potential until sufficient data are submitted. TSCA prohibits blanket testing requirements for all new chemicals to avoid stifling innovation in the industry. EPA must decide which chemicals warrant testing costs under TSCA Section 6 to control unreasonable risks from existing chemicals. The EPA is required to take action within 180 days if there is information indicating a significant risk of harm from a chemical substance. This includes regulating manufacturing, processing, distribution, use, or disposal under TSCA if a chemical poses an unreasonable risk to health or the environment. EPA can also refer cases of chemical risk to other federal agencies. TSCA Section 6 provides regulatory alternatives for EPA to prohibit or limit production, distribution, or use of a substance, impose warning labels, require record-keeping, specify disposal methods, and more. EPA can combine these requirements or apply them to specific regions. EPA is mandated by TSCA to regulate only to a certain extent. The EPA is required by TSCA to regulate chemicals to protect against risks and use the least burdensome approach. Section 8(b) of TSCA mandates EPA to gather and disseminate information on chemical production, use, and adverse effects. EPA has authority to collect information from industries, including chemical identities, amounts manufactured, byproducts, and environmental impacts. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) regulates chemicals to protect against risks and requires EPA to gather and disseminate information on chemical production, use, and adverse effects. TSCA provides broad protection of proprietary confidential information about chemicals in commerce, with limited disclosure permitted for health and environmental protection. Unauthorized disclosure of confidential data may result in criminal penalties. TSCA mandates are federal, with no provision for state programs to implement basic provisions. TSCA Section 18(a) prohibits state or local laws that restrict chemicals regulated by EPA. State laws must align with federal requirements or petition EPA for exemption under TSCA Section 18(b) if they offer higher protection without hindering interstate commerce. EPA implements TSCA by developing data for risk assessment, regulating chemicals posing risks, and ensuring rules are supported by substantial evidence for judicial review within 60 days. EPA's efforts aim to balance risk assessment with innovation and commerce, as mandated by TSCA. The first version of the inventory of existing chemicals under TSCA was compiled between 1978 and 1979, identifying approximately 62,000 chemicals in U.S. commerce. EPA has added roughly 22,000 new chemical substances to the inventory since November 2008. Some chemicals have been removed due to reporting errors. As of November 2008, EPA estimated that there were 84,000 chemical substances on the inventory, including 50,000 organic substances, 30,000 polymers, and 3,000 inorganic chemical substances. EPA collects information every four years on chemicals produced in amounts greater than 10,000 pounds per year. About 2,500 facilities submitted inventory updates for 9,000 chemicals in 2006. The EPA updates reports for approximately 9,000 chemicals every five years, with the next update scheduled for 2011. The new rule requires reporting for inorganic chemicals and raises the threshold for chemical production volume triggering reporting to 25,000 pounds per year. Facilities producing or importing over 300,000 pounds of a chemical per year must provide information on current uses and exposures. EPA is also developing a reset of the TSCA inventory. The EPA is developing a reset of the TSCA inventory to identify chemicals still in commerce in the US. This reset would only include chemicals reported by the regulated community, allowing EPA to review substances removed from the inventory. The public comment period for this proposal ended in January 2009. The EPA is developing a reset of the TSCA inventory to identify chemicals in commerce in the US. Chemicals not on the TSCA inventory are considered \"new\" and subject to PMN provisions. EPA rules provide exemptions for new chemicals produced or imported at 10,000 kilograms or less annually, with low human exposure or certain polymers meeting requirements. EPA has received around 44,000 PMNs since 1976, with 1,000 to 2,000 annually. Test data on chemical properties is included in roughly 33% of PMN submissions. The EPA has developed QSAR models and expert systems to estimate chemical properties for new chemicals due to the lack of data in PMN submissions. QSAR models are based on experimentally measured data and describe relationships between molecular structures and chemical properties. EPA's OPPT has published category statements for 55 classes of chemicals. The EPA's Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT) has published category statements for 55 classes of chemicals based on experience from the New Chemicals Program. These categories help identify initial hazard concerns and potential risks for chemicals within them. As of September 30, 2005, EPA had taken 3,899 regulatory or voluntary actions on roughly 10% of all PMNs, issuing 1,320 Consent Orders. The EPA has taken various actions to gather data and restrict the use of roughly 10% of all PMNs. This includes issuing 1,320 Consent Orders, subjecting 575 new chemicals to SNUR requirements, taking actions to protect against unreasonable risks, and receiving information from voluntary testing for at least 300 chemicals. Additionally, the EPA has encouraged the development of less hazardous chemicals by sharing models like the P2 Framework with manufacturers to avoid designing problematic chemicals. The EPA has utilized models like the Cancer Expert System to analyze chemical structures for cancer-causing potential. The TSCA Interagency Testing Committee has reviewed over 40,000 chemicals, selecting 4,500 for further testing due to concerns about toxicity or exposure. These chemicals were added to a Priority Chemicals List for regulatory action by the EPA. The EPA has categorized 61,000 existing chemicals based on risk levels from information reported by manufacturers in the late 1970s. The Interagency Testing Committee reviews thousands of chemicals annually for potential testing and regulatory action. The EPA has categorized 61,000 existing chemicals based on risk levels from information reported by manufacturers in the late 1970s. Many chemicals are considered low priority for evaluation due to low production quantities or being polymers. Roughly 15,000 organic and inorganic chemicals are produced at significant volumes, with about 3,000 classified as High Production Volume (HPV) chemicals, receiving greater EPA scrutiny. Many High Production Volume (HPV) chemicals are subject to greater EPA scrutiny due to their potential for human and environmental exposure. While some HPV substances are considered benign, others like chlorine gas and hydrogen peroxide pose well-understood risks. When EPA is concerned about a chemical's risk, they gather data through reporting rules like the Preliminary Assessment Information Reporting (PAIR) rules to assess exposure levels and determine if there is an unreasonable risk. The EPA uses reporting rules like PAIR to assess exposure levels and determine unreasonable risks for chemicals. EPA has issued multiple rules under TSCA Sections 8(c), 8(d), and 8(e) to collect data on adverse reactions, health and safety studies, and substantial risk information for various chemicals. Since 1977, the EPA has received over 16,500 initial notices and 7,750 supplemental notices regarding substances posing health or environmental risks. Approximately 200 new 8(e) submissions and 100 supplemental submissions are received annually. The confidentiality of chemical identities in these studies reduces their value. To monitor TSCA inventory chemicals, the EPA implemented a \"Master Testing List\" in 1990. The EPA implemented a \"Master Testing List\" (MTL) in 1990 to prioritize testing for substances posing health or environmental risks. The online MTL has not been updated since 1996. EPA has issued test rules under TSCA Section 4 for approximately 254 existing chemicals, using various agreements and rules. EPA Assistant Administrators for OPPTS have criticized TSCA provisions concerning data collection. Former Assistant Administrator Lynn Goldman criticized TSCA provisions for data collection, stating that proving chemicals are risky before testing creates high transaction costs due to legal challenges. In one instance, a TSCA section 4 multi-chemical toxicity test rule was sued by the Chemical Manufacturers Association in 1993. The Chemical Manufacturers Association sued a TSCA section 4 multi-chemical toxicity test rule in 1993. Settlement negotiations are ongoing for two of the four chemicals involved. The National Research Council agreed that toxicity testing requirements for industrial chemicals in the United States have not progressed much in the last 20 years. EPA can require testing for chemicals meeting specific criteria, but in vitro and whole-animal tests are rarely mandated. The United States' progress in toxicity testing requirements for industrial chemicals under TSCA has been limited over the last 20 years. Assistant Administrator James Gulliford highlighted TSCA's authority in ensuring new chemicals are reviewed, existing chemicals are assessed, and unreasonable risks are controlled. EPA has developed regulatory and voluntary tools to protect human health and the environment, making effective chemical management decisions. EPA utilizes voluntary programs to gather data on chemical properties, including High Production Volume (HPV) testing programs. These programs offer flexibility under TSCA and have been in place since the late 1980s, with OECD leading a voluntary program for chemicals produced in large volumes. The OECD listed 4,843 high production volume (HPV) chemicals in 2004. OECD countries agreed in 1990 to gather data on the hazard potential of these chemicals, known as the Screening Information Data Set (SIDS). EPA's HPV Challenge Program started in 1998 to collect health and environmental effects data for 2,782 chemicals produced in or imported to the United States in amounts over one million pounds per year. The EPA's HPV Challenge Program was initiated in response to a lack of health and safety data for chemicals in U.S. commerce. The program aimed to collect data on 2,782 chemicals by the end of 2004, with 340 submissions received so far. Environmental Defense has issued reports on the program's progress. According to Richard Denison of Environmental Defense, as of July 2007, data was incomplete for 536 out of 1,300 high volume chemicals. Manufacturers had not committed to providing information for 265 chemicals. More than 500 additional chemicals later qualified as HPV chemicals. EPA planned a final report on the HPV Challenge program. The U.S. HPV Challenge Program, similar to the ICCA initiative, aims to assess chemicals produced in high volumes. The Voluntary Children's Chemical Evaluation Program focuses on 23 chemicals with manufacturers conducting basic tests. The chemical industry has submitted data for over 95% of all chemicals in commerce through the HPV program. The EPA's High Production Volume program collects data on about 2,000 chemicals, but most existing chemicals lack toxicity data. Data on production volume, use, and health effects are also lacking, hindering risk assessments and priority setting for EPA action. TSCA may act as a disincentive to data production and submission. TSCA is seen as a disincentive to data production and submission by punishing failure to report adverse health impacts without requiring testing. EPA has used its Section 6 authority sparingly to regulate chemicals like metalworking fluids, hexavalent chromium, PCBs, and asbestos. EPA's Chemical Control Division states that the agency has been cautious in using its Section 6 authority due to concerns about unreasonable risks. EPA has used its Section 6 authority sparingly to regulate chemicals, referring some for regulation to other federal agencies like OSHA and FDA. Lynn R. Goldman testified that the formal referral mechanism of Section 9 has been burdensome for EPA. In 1991, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated an EPA rule under TSCA Section 6 that banned asbestos in products, citing insufficient justification. Legal commentators see TSCA Section 6 as imposing high evidentiary hurdles on EPA regulators, limiting its regulatory impact. The U.S. Court of Appeals found EPA's rulemaking on asbestos inadequate, suggesting EPA may avoid rulemaking altogether. Requiring a balancing approach for tough policy choices could improve administrative decisions. TSCA's structure, not its necessity, was highlighted in the court's remand of the asbestos rule. The EPA's struggles with regulating toxic substances under TSCA have been highlighted, with a study noting the agency's inability to meet the statute's requirements after a decade of effort. Despite criticisms, a legal scholar from the George W. Bush Administration defended TSCA's scope of judicial review. Corrosion Proof Fittings case study highlights the importance of substantive protections in toxic substances regulation. Recent legal, scientific, and technological developments have increased legislative interest in TSCA. Many states have enacted laws restricting the sale or use of certain chemicals. Many states have enacted laws restricting the sale or use of various chemicals under TSCA. State laws regulating bioengineered organisms show a lack of confidence in TSCA's ability to protect public health and the environment. California legislators are looking to other nations' laws for guidance, such as a recent law restricting formaldehyde emissions similar to the EU. The California Assembly and Senate have referenced Canadian or Dutch law in legislative proposals derived from a University of California report. The report highlighted the information deficit caused by TSCA, leading to challenges in choosing safer chemicals and affecting market efficiency. Toxic properties take a backseat to function and price in driving the market, perpetuating the cycle. The report suggests that new chemistry graduates may lack understanding of toxicology, advocating for California to lead in chemicals policy. State and local restrictions on chemicals are increasing, making compliance costly for manufacturers. Some chemical companies may support TSCA reform to preempt local regulations. Globalization is also prompting a reevaluation of TSCA due to international commerce in chemicals. The international growth of the chemical industry is leading to a reevaluation of TSCA, with multinational firms advocating for harmonization of regulations. The Executive Branch is working to support American businesses abroad while reducing its own regulatory burden through informal agreements and treaties. Business interests and NGOs are involved in negotiations for domestic implementation of these efforts. Between 1998 and 2001, the United States signed international agreements to regulate toxic chemicals, but domestic implementation is hindered by U.S. environmental statutes. TSCA Section 12(a) excludes chemicals intended for export from regulation, requiring amendments to allow regulation for export. Despite broad U.S. support for the agreements, stakeholders and policymakers have not taken action. Legislators in the U.S. have not been able to agree on implementing legislation specifically for necessary changes to TSCA despite broad support for international agreements. Multinational chemical companies and environmental groups are expected to continue pushing for legislative action, while recent EU legislation addresses broader questions on chemical regulation. The EU law known as REACH shifts responsibility for chemical safety to manufacturers, reverses default status for certain chemicals, and requires reduced use of toxic chemicals when safer alternatives exist. U.S. chemical exporters and manufacturers must comply with REACH requirements phased in over 11 years, sparking debate over its impact on the economy and international commerce. The implementation of REACH in the EU will demonstrate its approach to chemical regulation and potentially influence TSCA reform in the US. Some argue that not amending TSCA will diminish the US's global environmental leadership. Others defend TSCA, stating it is based on sound, risk-based science. The American Chemistry Council supports the US chemical management system, emphasizing its use of credible scientific information and precautionary measures. The Montebello Agreement is seen as a US alternative to REACH, focusing resources on high-risk chemicals. The implementation of REACH in the EU will influence future US chemical policy, including TSCA. Multinational firms must provide toxicity data to market products in Europe, which could also be shared with the EPA. Toxicology studies how chemicals impact health. Comparisons of REACH and TSCA can be found in various reports. Toxicology is the study of how chemicals affect health, with its modern form emerging in the 1960s and 1970s. The science has rapidly developed since the first toxicology textbook was published in 1972. TSCA, enacted in the early days of toxicology, focuses on individual chemicals and does not consider the variety of metabolic processes leading to toxicity. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) enacted in the early days of toxicology focuses on individual chemicals and does not account for the variety of metabolic processes leading to toxicity, individual differences in sensitivity, effects on neurological development, reproduction, immune system, or endocrine systems. Congress directed EPA in the 1990s to consider vulnerability of developing human embryos and children, disrupt endocrine systems, exposure from various sources, and cumulative exposure from chemicals with similar effects. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) does not fully consider various factors influencing toxicity. Computational toxicology, a recent innovation, uses mathematical models to estimate risks to human health and the environment based on scientific knowledge about chemicals and biological organisms. This approach is valuable for analyzing large amounts of biological data, such as the human genome. Computational toxicology utilizes mathematical models to assess risks to human health and the environment based on scientific knowledge of chemicals and biological organisms. It helps identify genetic variations that affect vulnerability to chemical exposure and improves the scientific basis for EPA decisions on data collection and regulation of chemicals. High-throughput biochemical tests generate data on biological effects of exposure, which are analyzed to inform decision-making. Computational toxicology uses mathematical models to analyze databases for patterns that can predict environmental and toxicity characteristics of untested chemicals. By matching biological response data with genomic information, scientists can identify genetic variations that affect susceptibility to toxic effects. Proposed amendments to TSCA aim to require such tests for faster development of toxicity assessment tools. EPA relies on QSAR models to set priorities and conduct risk assessments based on molecular substructures and chemical reactivity correlations. The use of Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models in predicting chemical properties and reactivity is being questioned for its reliability. While some argue that the empirical basis for SAR is weak, others see it as a potentially powerful tool that could reduce costs and the need for animal-based toxicity tests in the long term. The strengthening of the empirical basis for SAR over time may lead to a more positive view of its utility. The EPA now routinely models long-term, low-level exposure to multiple chemicals and considers cumulative exposure with similar modes of action. Exposure timing is crucial, especially for fetal or infant development. The EPA considers cumulative exposure to multiple chemicals with similar modes of action, especially for fetal or infant development. TSCA does not address aggregate or cumulative exposure or provide guidance on regulatory decisions regarding unreasonable risks from exposure to multiple chemicals. Amendments to TSCA may be needed to address these issues. The enactment of TSCA led to the application of managing unreasonable risks to new forms of chemical substances like GMOs and nanoparticles. The Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology was established in 1986 in response to public concerns about the potential health and environmental effects of GMO products. The Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology, established in 1986, sets federal policy for regulating GMOs that are not naturally occurring and combine genetic material from different genera or are capable of causing disease. Federal agencies regulate GMOs based on their properties and intended uses under existing statutory authority. For example, EPA regulates GMOs that produce or contain pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. GMOs that are not pesticides are regulated as new chemical substances under TSCA, unless they fall outside the TSCA definition. EPA also oversees new commercial uses of existing microbes under TSCA Section 5. EPA's policy on bioengineered organisms is based on its 1986 interpretation. EPA's policy on bioengineered organisms is based on its 1986 interpretation of what constitutes a \"new\" microorganism, formed by combining genetic material from different genera. Intergeneric microorganisms are considered new and warrant review due to the likelihood of expressing new traits. Critics have questioned whether living microorganisms developed for deliberate release fall under the TSCA definition of 'chemical substances'. The EPA's policy on bioengineered organisms is based on its 1986 interpretation of what constitutes a \"new\" microorganism, formed by combining genetic material from different genera. Intergeneric microorganisms are considered new and warrant review due to the likelihood of expressing new traits. Critics question if living microorganisms developed for release fall under the TSCA definition of 'chemical substances'. EPA includes microorganisms not intergeneric on the inventory of existing \"chemical substances\" and requires PMNs for intergeneric microorganisms. Critics believe the policy is dated, especially with the use of biotechnology to engineer large animals. They question if cloned mammals or their substances are also \"new chemical substances\" under TSCA. Investment in developing markets for bioengineered livestock and products is hindered by unclear federal rules. Supporters of the current regulatory framework argue that risks of genetically modified organisms are controlled, despite the possibility of creating dangerous new microbes. Scientists are now exploring materials at the nanoscale, where particles exhibit varying properties based on size and shape. Recent advancements in biochemistry, physical chemistry, and materials science have led to a surge in commercial applications of nanomaterials. Many patents and products, such as cosmetics, sunscreen, and clothing, are already in the market. However, concerns about the potential risks of nanoparticles, including toxicity to microbes, have been raised by scientists, policymakers, and industry groups. EPA studies have shown that nanoparticles can be more toxic than larger particles in some cases. Studies have found nanoparticles to be generally more toxic than larger particles of the same composition, but research on their properties and behaviors in living organisms is still in its early stages. The EPA recognizes the need to better understand and address potential risks from exposure to nanoscale materials. Different stakeholders have varying opinions on which TSCA provisions should apply to nanomaterials. Some groups argue that all nanotechnology products should meet PMN requirements. There are calls for thorough testing and assessments before commercializing nanotechnology-based products. EPA's regulation focus may shift to specific nanotechnology products rather than generic nanomaterials. The determination of a nanomaterial's \"new\" status under TSCA depends on its unique properties. EPA released guidelines in 2008 on assessing chemicals for TSCA inventory inclusion. EPA uses a case-by-case approach to determine if nanoscale substances are new or existing chemicals under TSCA. A substance with a molecular identity not on the TSCA Inventory is considered new, while one with the same identity as a listed substance is existing. The EPA uses a case-by-case approach to determine if nanoscale substances are new or existing chemicals under TSCA. Carbon nanotubes are considered distinct from graphite and may require submission of PMNs. EPA has taken steps to control exposures and require testing for health and environmental effects data. Particle size is not a factor in determining a chemical's identity. The EPA considers nanoscale substances with the same molecular identity as non-nanoscale substances to be the same chemical substance, despite differences in particle size and potential physical/chemical properties. However, EPA has not mandated notification for new nanoscale uses of existing chemicals, raising concerns about evaluating nanoscale applications for potential hazards before entering the U.S. market. EPA is working to stay informed about existing and new nanotechnologies. The EPA has been gathering data on nanotechnologies through the Nanoscale Materials Stewardship Program, launched in 2008. Stakeholders were asked to submit information, with 22 organizations participating and 3 in-depth. J. Clarence Davies, former EPA Assistant Administrator, evaluated the law as a means of addressing nanomaterials. The original legislative proposal for TSCA, which regulates nanotechnology, was found to be deficient and in need of amendment. Berkeley, California has implemented an ordinance requiring disclosure of information on engineered nanoscale materials. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce held a hearing on revisiting the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce held a hearing on February 26, 2009, to review the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976. Witnesses agreed that TSCA should be revised, with differing views on using REACH as a model for reform. Bills in the 110th Congress aimed to reshape U.S. chemical management, including the Kid-Safe Chemicals Act of 2008 to eliminate harmful chemical exposure by 2020. The proposed safety standard for chemicals in commerce aims to ensure no harm from exposure to sensitive groups and protect public welfare from adverse effects. Chemical manufacturers must submit information on their products to EPA for evaluation and categorization based on human exposure, health effects, and environmental persistence. EPA would identify at least 300 high-priority chemicals for further scrutiny. The Kid-Safe Chemicals Act aimed to evaluate 300 high-priority chemicals within a specified timeframe. EPA would assess manufacturers' safety statements and data, prohibiting chemicals that did not meet the safety standard. EPA could also regulate specific uses of chemicals. H.R. 6100 / S. 3040 aimed to change the default status of chemicals lacking toxicity data from generally permitted to generally banned, incentivizing manufacturers to conduct safety studies. Failure to submit safety data would result in the inability to market chemicals in the US. The bill also included programs to inform the public about chemical hazards and fund the development of safer chemicals, potentially reducing the use of toxic chemicals over time. Reduced use of toxic chemicals has long been a goal of environmental groups. H.R. 6100 / S. 3040 had strong support from environmental and public health advocacy groups but faced opposition from trade groups representing the chemical industry. The 110th Congress made amendments to TSCA to address concerns about exports of elemental mercury and school environments. Other proposals aimed to ban asbestos, eliminate chlorine manufacture using mercury cells, and restrict sodium fluoroacetate. Additionally, bills were introduced to establish a grant program to reduce lead exposure in child-care facilities. The 111th Congress is considering proposals to reduce exposure to mercury and other toxic chemicals through TSCA regulations. EPA announced an agreement with Mexico and Canada to coordinate efforts on chemical risk assessment. The EPA is working on assessing and managing risks of thousands of chemicals, including high production volume (HPV) and moderate production volume (MPV) chemicals. They are using Canada's Chemical Management Program as a starting point for their efforts. The EPA is using Canada's Chemical Management Program as a starting point to assess the hazards and risks of moderate-volume chemicals in the U.S. They are not collecting new data but summarizing existing data for public access. Risk-based characterizations for HPV chemicals have been posted online, with prioritizations for 220 chemicals. It is important to regulate chemicals based on sound science, cost-benefit analysis, and stakeholder involvement in risk-reduction measures. The Toxic Substances Control Act was enacted in 1976 to provide scientific information for chemical risk assessment. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) was enacted in 1976 to regulate chemicals for public health and environmental protection. Analysts are evaluating TSCA's performance over the past 30 years and considering future adjustments. Some support TSCA as flexible and effective, while others advocate for amendments to address its shortcomings in achieving Congress's goals. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) has shown limited success in gathering information about new chemicals but has been creative in categorizing them based on hazard potential to reduce risks. EPA has regulated only a few existing chemicals, likely due to stakeholder support and the competitiveness of the U.S. chemical industry. The agency has avoided imposing burdens that stifle innovation and commerce, raising questions about whether current chemical regulations effectively control risks. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) has faced criticism for not adequately controlling unreasonable risks posed by certain chemicals. Congress has amended TSCA multiple times to address risks from asbestos, lead, elemental mercury, and radon. Some are still unsatisfied with TSCA's effectiveness, leading to proposed bans on asbestos-containing materials. States and other nations have taken additional actions to regulate chemicals not covered by TSCA, highlighting limitations in the current provisions of the law. The European Union's new law, REACH, changes the regulation of chemicals by requiring manufacturers to identify hazards and manage risks for all chemical uses. This may lead multinational companies to comply with multiple regulations. There are concerns about the adequacy of the 1976 TSCA law in light of scientific advancements, especially regarding nanotechnology and GMOs. In 1991, the U.S. Court of Appeals vacated an EPA rule on asbestos regulation. The U.S. Court of Appeals vacated an EPA rule in 1991 that prohibited the manufacture, importation, processing, and distribution of asbestos in most products. The court found that the EPA failed to justify the ban adequately, as it did not consider less burdensome regulatory options as required by the TSCA law. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in 1991 that the EPA must consider less burdensome regulatory options before implementing a ban on asbestos products. The court found that the EPA did not adequately justify the ban, especially for products with available substitutes. EPA's failure to assess the harm from substitute products undermines the basis for the ban and raises concerns about workplace safety. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in 1991 that EPA must consider less burdensome regulatory options before implementing a ban on asbestos products. The court found that EPA did not adequately justify the ban, especially for products with available substitutes. EPA's failure to assess the harm from substitute products undermines the basis for the ban and raises concerns about workplace safety. EPA must consider the comparative toxic costs of each substitute and whether its chosen option increases workplace safety. The court also criticized EPA for not adequately considering the costs imposed by the ban, suggesting that the high costs on industry compared to the predicted lives saved were not given serious consideration. The court examined the failure to consider intermediate options and insufficiency of evidence regarding specific asbestos products covered by the ban. For example, EPA did not study the effects of non-asbestos brakes on automotive safety for friction products, despite evidence suggesting they could increase highway fatalities."
