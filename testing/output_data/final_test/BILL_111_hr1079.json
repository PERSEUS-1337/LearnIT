    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Pulmonary Fibrosis Research Enhancement Act\". Congress finds that pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a fatal lung disease affecting over 128,000 individuals in the US, with 48,000 new cases annually and 40,000 deaths. PF prevalence has increased by 150% since 2001, with a median survival rate of 2.8 years. Over 50% of cases are misdiagnosed initially. Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is often misdiagnosed, with over 58% of patients experiencing symptoms for more than a year before correct diagnosis. The cause of PF is largely unknown, but environmental or occupational exposure to pollutants may play a role. There is currently no FDA-approved treatment or cure for PF, and public awareness of the disease is low compared to other rare diseases. Despite increasing prevalence, there has been no federally funded national awareness effort for PF. Education and research groups have started raising awareness for pulmonary fibrosis. The first federal legislation supporting PF research, H. Con. Res. 182, was passed by Congress in 2007. SEC. 3. PULMONARY FIBROSIS REGISTRY. Part B of title III of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section, SEC. 317U, establishing a Pulmonary Fibrosis Registry. The Secretary will establish a National PF Registry to collect data on pulmonary fibrosis and related interstitial lung diseases in consultation with experts and patients. The National PF Registry is established to collect data on pulmonary fibrosis and related interstitial lung diseases in the United States. It includes a population-based registry of cases and aims to gather data on the incidence, prevalence, environmental factors, demographics, and family history of individuals with PF. The National PF Registry will collect data on pulmonary fibrosis, including the history of diagnosed individuals, pathogenesis of PF, and other relevant matters determined by the Secretary. Implementation will begin within 180 days, and an Advisory Board will be established within 90 days to oversee the registry. The National PF Registry Advisory Board will include members appointed by the Secretary representing various organizations and stakeholders, including the National Institutes of Health, Department of Veterans Affairs, patient advocates, clinicians with expertise on PF, and others with an interest in the registry. The National PF Registry Advisory Board will include experts in PF, epidemiologists, geneticists, and others with research and care expertise. Their duties include reviewing and making recommendations on the development and maintenance of the National PF Registry and the type of information to be collected. The National PF Registry Advisory Board will consult with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the National Pulmonary Fibrosis Action Plan, including data collection methods, data use guidelines, and information on lung diseases essential for PF research. A report is due within one year of the Advisory Board's establishment. The Advisory Board will submit a report with recommendations to the Secretary and relevant committees. The Secretary may award grants for data collection on PF and related lung diseases. Coordination with state, local, and federal registries is required for the National PF Registry. The Secretary will establish the National PF Registry by coordinating with existing data systems, surveys, and registries, including those at universities, medical centers, government agencies, State-based PF registries, NIH registries, and VA registries. The Secretary will establish the National PF Registry to collect and maintain information on interstitial lung diseases. Research access to PF data will be provided in accordance with privacy regulations. Information obtained will be shared with the NIH and Department of Veterans Affairs. $5,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2010, and $2,500,000 for each fiscal year from 2011 to 2014. SEC. 4 amends the Public Health Service Act to encourage the expansion of research on pulmonary fibrosis. SEC. 5 establishes a National Pulmonary Fibrosis Action Plan. The Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with input from the National Pulmonary Fibrosis Advisory Board, will create the National Pulmonary Fibrosis Action Plan. This plan must be submitted to specific congressional committees within one year of the Act's enactment. The National Pulmonary Fibrosis Action Plan, created by the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will focus on increasing public education, accelerating patient education, improving physician education, assessing costs, and developing strategies in partnership with patients and experts. $1,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2010. The National Pulmonary Fibrosis Action Plan includes a National Summit. The National Pulmonary Fibrosis Action Plan includes a summit convened by the Secretary of Health and Human Services every three years to discuss current research activities and potential collaborations for research, prevention, and treatment of pulmonary fibrosis. The National Pulmonary Fibrosis Action Plan includes a summit focusing on research activities, clinical research, translational research, information and education programs, priorities among Federal agencies, and challenges and opportunities related to pulmonary fibrosis. The Director of the summit must report to Congress within 180 days after the summit convenes. The Director of the National Institutes of Health will submit a report to Congress summarizing the pulmonary fibrosis summit proceedings and research activities. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will provide public information on pulmonary fibrosis research and related activities supported by the National Institutes of Health."
