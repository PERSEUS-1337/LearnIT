    "content": "The Act titled \"Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis Research, Cure, and Care Act of 2009\" includes sections on the short title, table of contents, findings, expansion of biomedical research, data collection, national patient registry, national summit, study and report by the Institute of Medicine, and authorization of appropriations. The Congress finds that psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are chronic, inflammatory diseases affecting millions of people, often overlooked and misunderstood as mere annoyances. Treatment is wrongly categorized as \"life-style\" rather than medically necessary. Psoriasis is linked to various co-morbidities like Crohn's disease, diabetes, obesity, and heart disease. It can cause physical and mental disability comparable to cancer and depression, with elevated rates of depression and suicidal thoughts. Severe psoriasis increases the risk of premature death by 50%. Total healthcare costs for psoriasis are significant. Total direct and indirect health care costs of psoriasis exceed $11.25 billion annually, with work loss contributing to 40% of the cost burden. Early diagnosis and treatment of psoriatic arthritis can help prevent irreversible joint damage. Treating psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis is challenging due to the lack of universal treatment effectiveness, potential loss of effectiveness over time, the need for combination therapies, and the risk of unique side effects. Despite advancements in treatments, many individuals still lack access to therapies that could significantly improve their quality of life. Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are significant health issues that require a coordinated response from governments, healthcare providers, patients, and public health communities to improve quality of life. Expansion of biomedical research. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will expand research on psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis through the National Institutes of Health. The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases will conduct research to understand the causes and find a cure for these conditions, including basic research on pathogenesis and pathophysiology. Research on psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis will include expanding molecular biology and immunology studies, global association mapping with single nucleotide polymorphisms, identifying environmental triggers and autoantigens, elucidating specific immunologic cells and their products, conducting pharmacogenetic studies, identifying genetic markers for psoriatic arthritis susceptibility, and increasing understanding of joint inflammation and destruction. Research on psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis includes developing new treatments and diagnostic tests, understanding co-morbidities, and coordinating activities with other national research institutes. The curr_chunk focuses on activities of national research institutes and agencies related to psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis. The Secretary will collaborate with a national organization to collect data on psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis and establish a patient registry. Additionally, a national summit will be held. The Secretary is encouraged to convene a summit on psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis research, treatment, education, and data collection activities, involving various stakeholders. The summit convened under this section should focus on a broad range of research activities relating to biomedical, epidemiological, psychosocial, and rehabilitative issues, clinical research for new treatments, translational research, information and education programs, priorities among Federal agencies, and challenges and recommendations for stakeholders. The Secretary will report to Congress within 180 days after the summit with a description of the proceedings and recommendations for research, treatment, education, and quality-of-life activities related to psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. SEC. 7. STUDY AND REPORT BY THE INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE. The Secretary will contract the Institute of Medicine to study insurance coverage for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis treatments, including payment structures and coverage policies' impact on patient access. The Institute of Medicine will submit a report to the Secretary and Congress within 18 months, detailing the study results, conclusions, and recommendations on issues related to insurance coverage for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis treatments. Authorization of appropriations is granted for fiscal years 2010 through 2014 to carry out the Act."
