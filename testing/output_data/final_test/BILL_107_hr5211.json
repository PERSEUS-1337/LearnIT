Chapter 5 of title 17, United States Code, is amended to include a new section on remedies for infringement on peer-to-peer computer networks. Copyright owners are not liable for actions to prevent unauthorized distribution of their works on these networks, as long as the integrity of computer files is not compromised. The new section on remedies for infringement on peer-to-peer computer networks allows copyright owners to take action to prevent unauthorized distribution of their works without compromising the integrity of computer files. The new section on remedies for infringement on peer-to-peer computer networks allows copyright owners to take action to prevent unauthorized distribution of their works without compromising the integrity of computer files. This includes provisions for economic loss and notification requirements for copyright owners. The new section allows copyright owners to impair unauthorized distribution on peer-to-peer networks by notifying the Department of Justice of specific technologies at least 7 days prior. Copyright owners must provide notice to affected file traders of the reason for impairing trading in the copyrighted work. The new section allows copyright owners to impair unauthorized distribution on peer-to-peer networks by notifying the Department of Justice of specific technologies at least 7 days prior. Copyright owners must provide notice to affected file traders including the name and address of the copyright owner, and the right to take legal action. The notification by a copyright owner shall not be seen as an admission of wrongdoing. If a copyright owner knowingly impairs the distribution of a computer file without reasonable belief of copyright infringement, and an affected file trader suffers economic loss exceeding $250, the trader can take legal action. The affected file trader can seek compensation for economic loss by filing a claim with the Attorney General within 1 year. The claim will be investigated, and if found to be untrue, legal action can be taken. If the Attorney General finds a claim to be true, they will notify the affected file trader and copyright owner. The determination must be made within 120 days of filing the claim. The affected file trader can seek compensation for economic loss. The affected file trader can seek compensation for economic loss, including attorney's fees, by filing a lawsuit in the appropriate United States district court within 60 days of being notified of the Attorney General's determination. This cause of action is only available against impairing actions that would not be lawful without this provision. The Attorney General may also seek injunctive relief in court. States can seek injunctive relief in federal court to stop a copyright owner from impairing the distribution of computer files without reasonable belief of infringement. This does not limit a copyright owner's ability to enforce their rights or prevent other legal remedies under state or federal law. Actions taken by a copyright owner under subsection (a) are not admissible for any other purpose in court. Information in a notification under subsection (c)(1)(A) cannot be disclosed to the public. Definitions in this section include 'economic loss' as monetary costs only and 'peer-to-peer file trading network' as connected computers transmitting files. A peer-to-peer file trading network allows connected computers to request and transmit files without routing through a central computer in the US. Publicly accessible networks are open to the public and enable file transmission over the Internet. The term 'file trader' refers to an individual using a peer-to-peer file trading network to share or download computer files. 'Distribution' on such networks involves making files accessible to other connected computers. 'Copyright owner' is defined as a legal entity owning the rights to a file. The term 'copyright owner' refers to a legal or beneficial owner of an exclusive right under section 106 and any authorized party acting on behalf of the owner. A conforming amendment is made to the table of sections for chapter 5 of title 17, United States Code. Remedies for infringement: use of technologies to prevent infringement of copyrighted works on peer-to-peer computer networks."
