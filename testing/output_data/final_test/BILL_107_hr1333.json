    "content": "The \"Patent Improvement Act of 2001\" may be cited as the short title. It introduces opposition procedures in Title 35 of the United States Code through a new chapter called \"Opposition Procedures.\" The \"Patent Improvement Act of 2001\" establishes an Administrative Opposition Panel comprised of 18 judges with legal and scientific expertise to handle opposition procedures in Title 35 of the United States Code. The \"Patent Improvement Act of 2001\" establishes an Administrative Opposition Panel to handle opposition procedures in Title 35 of the United States Code. Any person can file a request for opposition to a patent within 9 months of issuance, accompanied by the opposition fee. The \"Patent Improvement Act of 2001\" establishes an Administrative Opposition Panel for handling opposition procedures in Title 35 of the United States Code. Within 60 days of receiving a valid request for opposition, the Director must schedule an opposition proceeding with an opportunity for a hearing. The patent owner has at least 60 days to respond to the grounds for opposition, including any amendments or new claims. The \"Patent Improvement Act of 2001\" establishes an Administrative Opposition Panel for handling opposition procedures in Title 35 of the United States Code. In the opposition proceeding, the patent owner can file a statement for consideration, which must be served on the third-party requester. The third-party requester can then file a reply within 2 months. Each opposition is heard by one administrative opposition judge, who may consider relevant evidence, including oral presentations. No ex parte communication is allowed with the judge. In an opposition proceeding under the \"Patent Improvement Act of 2001,\" relevant evidence can be presented, including oral testimony, exhibits, expert testimony, depositions, and affidavits. Amendments to patent claims can be proposed, but no claim enlargement is allowed. The administrative opposition judge must make a determination within 18 months of the request for opposition. The administrative opposition judge determines patentability in the opposition proceeding. The decision is recorded in the patent file and shared with the patent owner and third-party requester. Parties can appeal to the Administrative Opposition Panel and seek court review for patentability decisions. In an opposition proceeding, the Director issues a certificate canceling unpatentable claims and confirming patentable claims. Amended or new patentable claims incorporated have the same effect as specified in the title. Sec. 322 states that proceedings under section 321 will not affect parties' rights to pursue remedies under other laws. Court proceedings can consider matters independently of opposition proceedings. In future opposition proceedings, if a final decision establishes that a party has not proven the invalidity of a patent claim, they cannot request an opposition based on those issues. In opposition proceedings, if a final decision favors the patentability of a claim, the party or requester cannot later maintain an opposition on the same issues. In civil actions or inter partes reexaminations, a third-party requester or their privies can challenge a patent claim based on previously raised issues. However, if new evidence of invalidity is discovered, it can still be asserted in a civil action or by a third-party requester. In civil actions or inter partes reexaminations, a third-party requester or their privies can challenge a patent claim based on previously raised issues. However, if new evidence of invalidity is discovered, it can still be asserted in a civil action or by a third-party requester. The Patent and Trademark Office may issue an order for an opposition proceeding, allowing a stay of any pending court proceeding involving patentability issues, unless the court determines a stay would not serve justice. Amendments are made to Section 41(a) of title 35, United States Code regarding fees. Amendments to Section 41(a) of title 35, United States Code involve changes to fees for opposition to patents based on prior art or obviousness, with fees of $200 and $5,000 respectively. A fee of $35 is required for a proceeding to determine the validity of an invention claimed in an application. The Director has the discretion to waive fees in the public interest. Amendments to Section 41(a) of title 35, United States Code involve changes to fees for opposition to patents based on prior art or obviousness, with fees of $200 and $5,000 respectively. A fee of $35 is required for a proceeding to determine the validity of an invention claimed in an application. The table of chapters for part III of title 35, United States Code is amended to include this fee. Opposition Procedures are outlined in Section 321, with fees ranging from $200 to $5,000 for challenges based on prior art or obviousness. A $35 fee is required for validity proceedings. SEC. 3. NONOBVIOUSNESS.\n\nAn invention is presumed obvious if the only significant difference from prior art is its use with computer technology, unless the application or technology itself is novel. Applicants can rebut this presumption by showing the invention is not obvious to persons of ordinary skill in relevant arts.\n\nSEC. 4. REQUIREMENT TO DISCLOSE SEARCH. The Director of the Patent and Trademark Office must publish notice of rulemaking proceedings to amend rules requiring patent applicants to disclose prior art search efforts. Penalties will be imposed for non-compliance, and the amendment must be implemented promptly. (a) Definitions.--Section 100(e) of title 35, United States Code, is amended to include opposition under section 321. \n(b) Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences.--Section 134 of title 35, United States Code, is amended to include opposition proceedings in subsection (b) and (c). In opposition proceedings, amendments are made to sections 141 and 143 of title 35, United States Code. Section 141 now includes any party in an opposition proceeding, while section 143 requires the Administrative Opposition Panel to provide written grounds for their decision in an opposition proceeding. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act applies to pending patent applications and patents issued after its enactment. A request for opposition to a patent issued before the establishment of the Administrative Opposition Panel can be filed within 9 months after the panel's notice is published.
