    "title": "SB 523",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature has previously funded schoolbus replacement programs in small and disadvantaged communities in the Bay Area and Los Angeles Basin to reduce harmful emissions for schoolchildren. Air districts evaluate qualified projects in disproportionately impacted communities based on regional poverty level, particulate matter exposure, toxic exposure, and disproportionate impact mapping to promote schoolbus replacement in densely populated areas. Funding is also needed for schoolbus replacement in less populated areas with disadvantaged communities. The Schoolbus Replacement for Small and Disadvantaged Communities Grant Program is created to fund the purchase of new schoolbuses for eligible school districts with less than 2,501 average daily attendance and over 50% of students qualifying for free or reduced-price lunch programs. Five million dollars annually is appropriated for this program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with Section 39712. The Schoolbus Replacement for Small and Disadvantaged Communities Grant Program allows eligible applicants, including school districts, county offices of education, and the Division of State Special Schools, to apply for funding to replace old school buses. The State Department of Education will prioritize funds based on vehicle age and mileage, requiring applicants to submit inspection reports and repair estimates. The State Department of Education estimates the cost of a replacement school bus, with program funds not exceeding that cost. Applicants can use other funds to purchase a more expensive bus. The purchased bus must meet federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 222 requirements. A disposed school bus is not eligible for replacement under the program. The program does not replace disposed school buses. A school bus can be considered disposed of if designated as a temporary school bus with limited annual mileage. The Department of General Services handles school bus purchases funded by the program, with the title in the applicant's name. Funds for special education school buses must be allocated in proportion to the total number of school buses in the state. The State Department of Education will determine this proportion and may establish regulations for implementation. Delinquent fees for operating a vehicle on state highways must be paid within 30 days of first operation, as per the Vehicle Code. Fees are delinquent if renewal application is made after expiration date or 60 days after notification. Transfer fee is delinquent if not paid within 10 days of receiving ownership certificate. License and special plate fees are delinquent if not paid before becoming a dealer or transporter."
