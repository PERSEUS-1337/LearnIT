    "content": "Domestic violence, including intimate partner violence (IPV), is a significant public health issue monitored by the CDC. Statistics show that a significant number of women and men have experienced severe physical violence from an intimate partner. IPV is a major factor in U.S. homicide cases, with a high percentage of female victims killed by a current or former male partner. Criminal offenses related to IPV are typically prosecuted at the state level, but federal law also imposes penalties on some offenders, including military personnel who may face prosecution in civilian courts. IPV offenders may face prosecution in civilian courts and military justice system under UCMJ provisions. IPV can impact military effectiveness, leading to productivity losses, readiness issues, and costs to DOD. Victims may experience mental and physical trauma affecting deployment and unit capabilities. Congress mandates domestic violence prevention policies for the Armed Forces. The report discusses domestic violence prevention and response in the Armed Forces, including risk factors, prevalence, prevention activities, intervention strategies, victim support, and law enforcement response to allegations of domestic abuse. Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a crime characterized by recidivism and escalation, with offenders likely to be repeat abusers and the abuse intensity increasing over time. IPV can result in physical injury, mental health issues, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Victims often struggle with stress and anxiety long after incidents occur, with a significant percentage experiencing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Perpetrators may also face decreased productivity at work and loss of income. Domestic violence can lead to decreased productivity, loss of income, and incarceration for perpetrators. It can also impact the well-being of future generations, with children in such environments at higher risk for behavioral, cognitive, and emotional disorders. Perpetrators often have a history of abuse or witnessing abuse in their families. Military service can exacerbate risks due to frequent relocations, which can lead to social isolation and stress on intimate partnerships. A victim of domestic abuse facing challenges in seeking help due to limited options for temporary relocation, military-related stressors, and financial dependence. Prior interpersonal trauma is also a risk factor for both perpetrators and victims. Some data suggest that women with a history of childhood abuse may join the military to escape a violent home environment. Military service can provide access to healthcare, stable pay, and family support services, which may help prevent intimate partner violence. Military commanders have the authority to impose sanctions on abusers, leading to more immediate consequences compared to civilians. Military commanders play a crucial role in IPV intervention, creating a safe environment for victims and holding perpetrators accountable. In response to a 1979 report, DOD established the Military Family Resource Center (MFRC) to address family violence prevention programs' inconsistencies and understaffing. Congress allocated funds for DOD family violence prevention between 1981 and 1983, transitioning program funding to DOD's sole responsibility. The Military Family Resource Center (MFRC) was established by DOD in response to a 1979 report on family violence prevention programs. Funding for the program transitioned to DOD's sole responsibility, leading to the establishment of the Family Advocacy Program and an Advocacy Committee. The Military Family Act of 1985 formalized the Office of Family Policy under the Office of the Secretary of Defense to coordinate programs for military families. The Office of Military Family Readiness Policy, under the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, oversees military family programs, including domestic violence prevention through the Family Advocacy Program (FAP). Military law enforcement activities are managed by USD (P&R) and DHRA, with incident databases housed in DMDC. FAP addresses domestic abuse, child abuse, neglect, and problematic sexual behavior within DOD and the services. The Family Advocacy Program (FAP) addresses domestic abuse, child abuse, neglect, and problematic sexual behavior in children and youth through prevention, awareness, treatment, and rehabilitation services. FAP managers collaborate with civilian agencies and provide annual reports to Congress on these issues in military families. Funding for FAP comes from the Defense-wide Operation and Maintenance budget for DOD dependents education. FAP funding supports various programs and services for military families, including a DOD hotline for reporting abuse, training for responders, public awareness activities, and research on prevention. The total defense-wide funding request for family assistance and advocacy in FY2020 was $877 million. The total defense-wide funding request for family assistance and family advocacy for FY2020 was $877 million, a 5.5% increase from the previous year. DOD policy requires specific credentialing for FAP managers, including a master's or doctoral degree in behavioral sciences, state licensure, and experience. Service Secretaries establish criteria for FAP personnel and oversee accreditation and certification of installation FAPs. The FAP is supported by over 2,000 government and contracted personnel. The CDC uses the term intimate partner violence (IPV) to describe various forms of abuse by a current or former spouse or dating partner, while DOD often refers to IPV as domestic violence or domestic abuse. The DOD defines four types of abusive behavior in the context of domestic violence: physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, and neglect of spouse. Victims of domestic violence can be current or former spouses, intimate partners, or individuals with whom the abuser shares a child. The CDC's definition of intimate partner does not require a shared domicile or child. The DOD's SAPR program handles sexual violence cases involving military personnel without shared relationships. Congress mandated DOD to maintain a centralized database for domestic violence incidents in 1999. The military services collect data on domestic violence incidents at the installation level and submit reports to the DMDC. Data elements include demographic information, incident details, and severity of abuse. An incident determination committee decides if the incident meets criteria for tracking in the database. Incidents that don't meet criteria are still included in the database. The DOD maintains the FAP Central Registry and the Defense Incident-Based Reporting System (DIBRS) to track domestic violence incidents involving military servicemembers. The FAP Central Registry is used for producing annual reports, analyzing trends, and supporting budget requests, while DIBRS captures criminal activity related to domestic abuse. Despite concerns about gaps and overlaps in these databases, DOD has resisted making changes. DOD maintains the FAP Central Registry and DIBRS to track domestic violence incidents involving military servicemembers. Despite concerns, DOD resists consolidating them, citing different purposes. DSAID captures data on sexual abuse incidents, while WGR surveys may capture intimate partner sexual assault. The total active duty population is over 1.3 million, with approximately 16% being women. In FY2018, there were 16,912 reported incidents of spouse and intimate partner abuse, with roughly half meeting the criteria for abuse under DOD definitions. Physical abuse accounted for 73.7% of all met criteria incidents, followed by emotional abuse at 22.6%. There has been little change in the rate or number of reported incidents that met criteria for domestic abuse since FY2009. The total number of incidents in FY2018 is 19% lower than the number at the peak in FY2011, but the rate of incidents for spouse abuse has remained consistent since FY2008. The number of reported incidents involving sexual abuse has gradually increased since FY2009. Since FY2009, there has been little change in reported incidents of domestic abuse, with a slight drop in FY2018. Factors contributing to this change include an increase in incidents, cultural shifts in perception, and greater awareness of reporting avenues and resources. Two-thirds of reported abuse victims are female, with half of spouse abuse victims and two-thirds of intimate partner abuse victims being military members at the time of the abuse. In FY2018, there were 15 domestic abuse fatalities reported by DOD. In FY2018, DOD reported that 57% of spouse-abuse offenders were servicemembers, with nine offenders being civilians. Female offenders were more likely to be civilians and accounted for 40% of physical spouse abuse incidents. Women were reported as the primary physical abuse offenders, which is higher than expected in the general population. Sexual abuse cases were predominantly perpetrated by men (96%). Perpetration of intimate partner violence in military partnerships may be underrepresented in DOD incident data, especially if the victims are civilians, unmarried to the perpetrator, or not residing on a military installation. Incidents outside of military installations are less likely to be witnessed by military first responders, and unmarried civilian intimate partners of servicemembers may not be eligible for treatment at military facilities. Coordination between civilian and military officials for domestic violence reporting is crucial. National data shows that intimate partner violence often starts at a young age, with a high percentage of females and males reporting their first experience of sexual violence. Approximately 71% of females and 58% of males reported experiencing sexual violence, intimate partner physical violence, or stalking before age 25. 23% of female victims experienced intimate partner violence before age 18. Rates of domestic abuse in the military are highest among junior enlisted families aged 18-24. In FY2018, offenders in grades E-1 to E-3 had a rate of 15.1 per 1,000 married couples, compared to the overall rate of 5 per 1,000. Comparing military and nonmilitary IPV data is complicated due to differences in reporting and data collection processes. Since 2010, the CDC has conducted the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS) to collect data on sexual violence, stalking, and intimate partner violence among adult men and women at state and national levels. Some studies have compared IPV prevalence data across military and civilian populations, noting similar rates among military women, spouses, and civilians. Active duty women and military spouses have similar prevalence rates of intimate partner violence (IPV) compared to the civilian population. However, active duty women deployed in the past three years are at a higher risk of experiencing physical and sexual IPV. The Department of Defense (DOD) has implemented various activities to prevent IPV and reduce the escalation of violence. The CDC has identified multiple risk factors for domestic violence, some of which are present in the military environment, such as the age of servicemembers. The Department of Defense (DOD) uses medical and cognitive standards to screen individuals aged 17-26 seeking entry into the Armed Forces for intimate partner violence (IPV) risk factors. Factors such as history of personality disorders, drug/alcohol abuse, misconduct, and criminal convictions can disqualify individuals. Those disqualified may request a conduct waiver with specific information and letters of recommendation. Convicted domestic violence offenders are typically ineligible for conduct waivers under the Lautenberg Amendment Gun Control Act of 1968. The use of conduct waivers has increased in recent years as recruiting targets have risen. While those with conduct waivers may have higher rates of alcohol and drug-related offenses, they are not significantly associated with substantiated incidents of domestic abuse. Prevention programs for domestic violence include education and training components required by law and policy. The Family Advocacy Program promotes awareness of domestic abuse through training for commanders, troops, counselors, and health care personnel on IPV warning signs and appropriate responses. Training for troops may include workshops on healthy relationships and family resiliency, but is not mandatory. The military services have implemented tailored education programs for higher-risk demographics, such as the Navy's workshops on relationship abuse awareness and prevention for junior enlisted members. DOD offers no-cost, confidential counseling services through the Military and Family Life Counseling program, which includes relationship counseling, anger/conflict management, and deployment adjustment support. DOD provides deployment adjustment services through a contractor for active and reserve personnel and their families at military installations worldwide. Family life counselors do not handle domestic abuse cases, which are referred to the FAP and medical providers. Members can also participate in service-level programs like marriage retreats or family resiliency workshops. Interventions target high-risk couples or individuals after a first alleged offense, including removing individuals from immediate harm and initiating investigations. The response to domestic abuse involves coordination among military commanders, law enforcement officials, health care personnel, social workers, and legal representatives to ensure safety and prevent future incidents. Multidisciplinary teams on military installations, as required by the FY2019 NDAA, include judge advocates, personnel from military criminal investigation organizations, mental health professionals, family advocacy caseworkers, and other appropriate personnel to assess and manage domestic abuse cases. The Family Advocacy Program (FAP) team, consisting of professional social workers, assesses and manages domestic abuse cases in the military. Commanders are responsible for holding perpetrators of domestic violence accountable and protecting victims by issuing military protective orders (MPO) to ensure the victim's safety. Servicemembers must obey MPOs at all times. Military commanders issue military protective orders (MPO) to protect victims of domestic abuse, which must be obeyed by servicemembers at all times. Violations can result in court martial or other punitive measures. In cases where the victim is a servicemember and the abuser is a civilian, commanders cannot issue an MPO for civilians but can arrange temporary housing on the installation for the victim and restrict the accused civilian's access. Coordination between military and civilian law enforcement is often necessary for cases involving military personnel living off-base. In 2002, Congress mandated that civilian protection orders (CPOs) hold full force on military installations, allowing disciplinary actions under the UCMJ for violations. Military commanders can issue military protective orders (MPOs) to support CPOs or provide victim protection. MPOs are not enforceable by civilian law enforcement, but commanders must notify civilian authorities of MPO issuance, changes, or terminations. In 2011, Congress required DOD to develop policies for station changes or unit transfers of active duty members reporting sex-related offenses. Commanding officers must approve or disapprove transfer applications within 72 hours, with a review option by a general officer. Transfer decisions must be made within 72 hours. The FY2018 NDAA expanded transfer policies to cover military servicemembers who are victims of physical or sexual IPV. The FY2014 NDAA allows reassignment of individuals alleged to have committed sex-related offenses for maintaining good order and discipline within the unit. Reassignment is not punitive but for disciplinary purposes. Covered offenses under expedited transfer include sex-related offenses. The Department of Defense has developed methods for incident reporting and data collection on intimate partner violence trends, but there is evidence suggesting underreporting. While annual surveys on sexual assault and harassment are conducted, similar surveys on domestic abuse within military spouse population are not. IPV prevalence is challenging to measure, with a wide range in academic literature. Intimate partner violence prevalence among military servicemembers is difficult to measure, with varying estimates. A VA meta-analysis found 12-month IPV perpetration rates at 22% and victimization at 30%, higher than reported incidents in the DOD. A 2017 survey by a military family advocacy group revealed that 15% of military and veteran families felt unsafe in their relationships. 87% of military spouses who experienced abuse did not report it, citing reasons like not wanting to harm their partner's career. Partner abuse is often linked to coercive control and monitoring of the victim's activities, creating barriers for victims to seek help. Congress and DOD have taken steps to reduce these barriers and increase access to support services, including establishing policies for maximum confidentiality in reporting incidents of domestic abuse. The Department of Defense has developed distinct reporting streams for domestic abuse, with unrestricted reporting to law enforcement, FAP, or the chain of command triggering a criminal investigation. To address confidentiality concerns, a restricted reporting option allows victims to disclose information to specific individuals without it being shared with other authorities, giving victims time to access support services. Victim advocates play a crucial role in supporting victims of domestic violence by providing access to 24/7 victim advocacy services, developing safety plans, and referring them to ongoing care. They also offer information on resources like chaplain or legal services. Special Victims' Counsel (SVC) or Victims' Legal Counsel (VLC) can also provide legal support to victims. Special Victims' Counsel (SVC) or Victims' Legal Counsel (VLC) provide legal assistance to victims of sexual assault in the military justice process. Recent proposals aim to extend these services to victims of domestic violence, but expanding eligibility would significantly increase workload for SVC/VLC programs. Expanding SVC/VLC services to victims of domestic violence in the military may require additional authorizations and training. Financial dependence on military partners can deter some victims from reporting abuse. In the past, military families were left without support when a member was incarcerated for violence. Congress addressed this issue in the FY1994 NDAA by authorizing transitional compensation. The FY1994 NDAA authorized transitional compensation, providing monetary benefits to dependents of servicemembers separated from the military due to IPV. This benefit aims to offer financial security to spouses or former spouses and is codified in 10 U.S.C. \u00a71059. Transitional compensation payments are tax-exempt and provided at the DIC rate. Transitional compensation benefits are tax-exempt and provided at the DIC rate for 12 to 36 months to current or former dependents of servicemembers. Eligible individuals include spouses, former spouses, or dependent children. Intimate partners not married to servicemembers are generally ineligible. Recipients also receive military benefits and TRICARE healthcare. Payments require annual eligibility certification and cease if the spouse remarries or cohabitates with the servicemember after adverse action. Under the Uniformed Services Former Spouses Protection Act (USFSPA), up to 50% of a military servicemember's disposable retired pay may be awarded to a former spouse in a divorce settlement. Spouses or former spouses must choose between transitional compensation and court-ordered retired pay. Military servicemembers become eligible for a pension after 20 years of service, and payments may cease under certain circumstances. In cases where a military member's eligibility for retired pay is terminated due to misconduct, court-ordered payments of disposable retired pay can be made to abused spouses or former spouses. For example, if a retired member loses eligibility for retired pay due to domestic violence misconduct, DFAS may still pay a portion to the spouse or former spouse. This allows the spouse to receive benefits even if the member is no longer eligible for retired pay. The spouse or former spouse of a retired member may receive benefits, including medical and dental care, commissary privileges, and Survivor Benefit Plan. Commanding officers can restrict perpetrators of violence to barracks or issue Military Protective Orders to protect victims. Victim advocates help provide shelter for victims when commanders have less control over housing options. Military families often rely on various housing options during frequent relocations. Moving expenses are covered by the Department of Defense for families under a member's orders. In cases of domestic abuse, some spouses may struggle to afford independent household moves, especially when stationed overseas. Congress has provided certain travel benefits for abused dependents without military orders for a permanent move. The Secretary of the military department may authorize movement of household effects and baggage at the government's expense for victims of domestic abuse without military orders for a permanent move. The Crime Victims Fund was established in 1984 to provide funding for state victim compensation and assistance programs, funded by sources like criminal fines and forfeited bail bonds. The Crime Victims Fund (CVF) is funded by criminal fines and supports victim compensation and assistance programs administered by the Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) within the Department of Justice. The OVC awards CVF money through formula and discretionary grants to states, local governments, individuals, and other entities, with most funding going towards victim compensation and assistance programs. Grants are distributed according to guidelines established by the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA). Victim assistance formula grants support various services for crime victims, including reimbursement for expenses like medical and mental health counseling, lost wages, funeral costs, and other authorized expenses. These grants prioritize underserved populations of victims of violent crime and victims of child abuse. In FY2017, the majority of applications were related to domestic and family violence. In FY2017, victim assistance formula grants served over five million crime victims, with 43% being victims of domestic and/or family violence. DOD has specific policies for responding to domestic abuse, requiring commanders to treat reports of domestic abuse like any other crime. In response to domestic violence, military law enforcement officials are required to investigate and respond to reports as they would for any other crime. The law mandates reporting incidents involving physical injury or the use of deadly weapons within 24 hours to the appropriate commander and a local Family Advocacy Program representative. The Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) and Military Criminal Investigative Organizations (MCIOs) are responsible for investigating domestic violence incidents. A 2019 report by the Department of Defense Inspector General (DODIG) found that DCIOs did not consistently comply with DOD policies when responding to nonsexual domestic violence incidents involving adult victims. The audit revealed that responders often lacked necessary equipment for evidence collection and incident reports lacked proper supervisory review. Law enforcement failed to report incidents to the FAP in 22% of cases and did not submit criminal history data in 82% of those cases. NCIS actions were more compliant than military law enforcement, with Army and Air Force MCIOs not distinguishing between ILEs and MCIOs. The DOD IG found that military service law enforcement, particularly ILE, did not consistently comply with policies when responding to nonsexual domestic violence incidents. MCIOs are not responsible for investigating domestic violence, except for NCIS. ILEs are less proficient at domestic violence responses compared to MCIOs like NCIS. Military law enforcement must provide crime reports to DOD and national crime databases during investigations. The Services must maintain automated information systems that comply with the Defense Incident-Based Reporting System (DIBRS), which is linked to the FBI's N-DEx system. DIBRS captures domestic violence incidents in compliance with various laws and reports data to the FBI's NIBRS. The National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) is a repository for federal and state crime data used to analyze trends and develop policy approaches. The Defense Central Index of Investigations (DCII) stores specific investigation records for DOD agencies, helping determine security clearance status and file locations. MCIOs are responsible for titling and indexing subjects of criminal investigations in the DCII. The military justice system, separate from federal criminal statutes, requires reporting disposition information promptly. Servicemembers investigated for UCMJ violations must have fingerprint cards and investigation details submitted to the FBI CJIS. Active duty personnel worldwide can be held accountable for domestic violence offenses under military jurisdiction. The military justice system operates independently of the federal criminal justice system. Congress enacts authority through the UCMJ under Title 10, U.S. Code, and the President implements it through the Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM), which establishes detailed rules for administering justice, including jurisdiction, criminal procedure code, rules of evidence, and punitive articles. The UCMJ criminalizes specific conduct and includes procedures for nonjudicial punishment. Commanders have the authority to prosecute or refer charges to court martial and make disposition decisions regarding misconduct. All commanders are required to refer cases to the appropriate level of command for action. The UCMJ criminalizes specific conduct and includes procedures for nonjudicial punishment. Commanders have the authority to prosecute or refer charges to court martial and make disposition decisions regarding misconduct. DOD requires all commanders to refer allegations of domestic violence to law enforcement for investigation. Law enforcement must provide a detailed report to the alleged offender's commander for review and possible referral to court-martial. There are three levels of courts-martial with varying jurisdiction over UCMJ offenses. A general court-martial has jurisdiction over felony offenses and can impose maximum punishments under the UCMJ. It consists of a military judge, prosecutor, defense counsel, and members who act like a civilian jury. Congress added a specific punitive article for domestic violence in 2019, Article 128b, allowing for prosecution of such offenses. Article 128b of the UCMJ allows for prosecution of violent offenses against spouses, intimate partners, or immediate family members, including threats, intimidation, violation of protection orders, and assault by strangulation or suffocation. Strangulation is a risk factor for intimate partner homicide. Court-martial punishments for UCMJ offenses include reprimand, forfeiture of pay, confinement, and death. Domestic violence is now a nominative offense under Article 128b. The maximum punishment for assault under Article 128 ranges from three months to dishonorable discharge, total forfeitures, and 20 years' confinement. Domestic violence is distinguished by harsher punishment. The Military Rules of Evidence include rules specific to domestic violence. The Military Rules of Evidence include specific rules for domestic violence cases, such as privileged conversations with victim advocates and testimony of children who witness events. Victims of sexual or violent offenses have the privilege to refuse disclosure of confidential communications with victim advocates or DOD Safe Helpline staff, made for the purpose of advice or assistance. In cases involving child victims or witnesses of domestic violence, a military judge may allow remote live testimony to protect their welfare. The military judge may allow remote live testimony for child witnesses in domestic violence cases if it is necessary to protect the child's welfare and if the emotional distress from the accused's presence is significant. This can be done in chambers with the presence of the child, prosecution, defense, and child's attorney. Accused individuals can voluntarily exclude themselves from the courtroom to avoid remote live testimony. Congress has taken actions to address the severe consequences of intimate partner and domestic violence on servicemembers and families. In the 116th Congress, proposals have been made to enhance services for military-connected IPV victims. Ongoing issues for oversight include community coordination, coverage of victim services, law enforcement response, data collection, and mitigating risk factors in IPV cases involving the military. The UCMJ applies worldwide to active duty servicemembers, but incidents involving civilians can occur both on and off military installations. Local law enforcement, state, and foreign governments may have overlapping jurisdiction for domestic violence response. Insufficient coordination between military and state/local authorities threatens victim safety when moving between installations and civilian communities. DOD regulations require information sharing between installation commanders and local authorities, but consistency across bases and addressing gaps is unclear. For example, victims may not know whom to notify on the installation regarding their situation. Efforts to improve victim services on military installations include clear registration procedures, but there are still barriers to coverage and access. A 2019 study found variation in services offered, with smaller installations sometimes lacking programs. FAP offices are open five days a week for about 41 hours, with limited weekend hours. Some personnel noted challenges for working spouses or those needing childcare to attend counseling. Awareness of eligibility for services among servicemembers and spouses may be lacking. In 2019, a study highlighted the lack of public awareness and outreach activities in military Family Advocacy Program (FAP) services. Some military-connected IPV victims may not be eligible for services under existing law and policy, such as unmarried civilian intimate partners of servicemembers. Reserve Component members and their partners may also face challenges accessing installation resources and mental/behavioral health coverage due to the part-time nature of their work. The National Guard relies on FAP services of the Army and Air Force for Domestic Abuse Response and Intervention Training. Military veterans and retirees may not be eligible for FAP services but could access some services through the VA, such as the Intimate Partner Violence Assistance Program. DODIG's 2019 findings show deficiencies in military law enforcement response to domestic violence incidents, indicating a need for congressional oversight in this area. The DODIG's findings suggest that congressional oversight of DOD actions in domestic violence cases may be necessary. Current DOD policy assigns MCIOs to investigate domestic violence, similar to sexual assault cases. However, there is no mandate for all allegations of domestic violence under Article 128, except for certain circumstances. If the maximum punishment for domestic violence were increased to one year or more, it could impact investigations. The DODIG and GAO reports have highlighted concerns with DOD data collection and reporting on domestic violence cases. Improving data quality is crucial for accurate estimates of the extent of the issue and identifying high-risk military populations. Training for personnel entering data into systems is also a key consideration for effective oversight. Proper data entry is crucial for enforcing laws on IPV offenders, such as prohibiting them from buying firearms. DOD programs aim to enhance family stability and reduce stress through measures like reducing personnel tempo and increasing time between deployments. The military aims to reduce stress on families by managing permanent change of station moves and deployments. Programs like child and youth services, spouse employment assistance, and family readiness services are in place to support military families. Congressional oversight should ensure these programs are adequately funded. The command climate established by military commanders within a unit is crucial for the well-being of servicemembers. The command climate established by military commanders is crucial for the well-being of servicemembers and their families. Commanders have the authority to address issues related to intimate partner violence (IPV) through positive reinforcement or punitive actions. Problematic gender norms and negative stereotypes within the military spouse community have been identified as risk factors for IPV. Commanders play a significant role in influencing acceptable behavior in the workplace, and there have been cases where abused spouses felt unsupported by their partner's commander. Complaints of abuse, especially among servicemembers, raise concerns about retaliation for reporting IPV. Conducting surveys with IPV victims can help understand their perceptions of command response and experiences with other responders. Options to address concerns include requiring higher-level review of complaints and enhancing protections against retaliation. Individual risk factors for IPV include low self-esteem, income, academic achievement, young age, aggressive behavior, and substance abuse. Individual risk factors for perpetrating intimate partner violence (IPV) include a history of aggressive behavior, heavy substance abuse, depression, anger, antisocial and borderline personality traits, prior physical abuse, isolation, unemployment, emotional dependence, belief in strict gender roles, desire for power and control in relationships, and perpetrating psychological aggression. Relationship factors such as marital conflict, instability, dominance, economic stress, and unhealthy family relationships also contribute to IPV. Factors contributing to intimate partner violence (IPV) include economic stress, unhealthy family relationships, poverty, low social capital, weak community sanctions against IPV, and traditional gender norms."
