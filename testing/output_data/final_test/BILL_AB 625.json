    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 41320.1 of the Education Code is amended to include conditions for school districts accepting apportionments. The Superintendent appoints a trustee with expertise in management and finance, with expenses borne by the district. The trustee serves at the pleasure of the Superintendent. The trustee and necessary staff serve until adequate fiscal systems are in place, future compliance is probable, and the Superintendent decides to terminate the appointment, but not less than three years. Notification must be given to relevant parties at least 60 days before conditions are met. Before the school district repays the loan, the recipient must select an auditor from a list established by the Superintendent and the Controller to audit its fiscal systems. The Superintendent may retain the trustee if deficiencies are found, with the school district bearing the costs. Reports submitted to the trustee are public records. The Superintendent is exempt from certain requirements to appoint the trustee and necessary staff. The Superintendent can appoint a department employee as a trustee for a specified period, with salary and benefits paid by the school district. The employee remains in the same retirement system and can return to their former position after the appointment ends. Time served as a trustee counts towards their service with the department. The trustee appointed by the Superintendent monitors and reviews the school district's operation. They have the authority to stay or rescind actions of the governing board that may impact the district's financial condition. After the trustee's service period, the county superintendent can also intervene in such actions until the loan is repaid. The county superintendent must notify the Superintendent within five business days of any actions taken. The governing board of the school district's intended action and its financial implications, along with the rationale and findings supporting the county superintendent's decision to stay or rescind the action. The Superintendent must report to the Legislature annually on the school district's compliance with the approved fiscal plan. The Superintendent can set timelines and formats for reports and materials for the trustee to monitor the school district. The trustee must approve or reject all required reports and materials, with potential penalties for late or unacceptable submissions. The Superintendent can adjust the apportionment if reports are late or unsatisfactory, and may modify the fiscal plan if deemed necessary. Compliance with the modified plan is required. The Controller transfers funds to the department to cover trustee expenses and associated costs incurred by the county superintendent, as requested by the Superintendent. The Controller conducts audits of school district books annually to ensure financial solvency, with costs borne by the district. Audits continue until financial stability is confirmed, no earlier than one year after the plan implementation or later than the apportionment repayment. The Superintendent, school district superintendent, or their designees meet before the audit to discuss terms and timeline. The Controller conducts quality control reviews as well. For errors and omissions liability insurance policies, the trustee appointed under this section is considered an employee of the local educational agency. For workers' compensation benefits, the trustee is also considered an employee of the local educational agency, except for those appointed under paragraph (7) of subdivision (a) who are considered employees of the department for this purpose. The state-appointed trustee, except for one appointed by the Superintendent as trustee, is a member of the State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System if qualified. If the trustee elects not to become a member, they will not be required to. Those already members or retirants of the system at the time of appointment will continue to be so. The trustee may be placed on the school district's payroll for contributions to the system. The Superintendent may also require payroll placement for remuneration, benefits, and deductions for certain trustees. For workers' compensation benefits, the state-appointed trustee is considered an employee of the local educational agency, except for trustees appointed by the department."
