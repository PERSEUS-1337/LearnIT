Funding is distributed through formula grants to state library administrative agencies for expanding services and access to learning. The Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) provides funding for expanding library services and access to information, targeting under served populations. A percentage of funds is reserved for national activities, Native Americans, and federal administration, with 3.75% allocated for national activities such as research, demonstrations, and education for librarians.

The Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) provides funding for library programs, with minimum state allotments set at $680,000. Outlying areas receive a minimum of $60,000 if appropriations allow. Participating states must develop five-year plans to enhance information-sharing.

The Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) provides funding for library programs, with states having flexibility in fund usage. The Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) administers LST funds competitively within states.

The Office of Library Services within the IMLS is overseen by a Deputy Director with a library science degree. Funding for Library Services and Technology (LST) has increased from $210.597 million in FY2006 to $220.855 million in FY2007. Initiatives since FY2003 have focused on training and recruiting librarians, providing scholarships, and enhancing diversity in the field. The federal government has provided direct aid for public libraries since the Library Services and Construction Act (LSCA) in 1956. The Library Services and Technology Act consolidated and replaced various programs under the L-HHS-ED Appropriations Act of 1997. The Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) was reauthorized as Title II, Library Services and Technology (LST), of the Museum and Library Services Act of 2003 (MLSA).

Construction aid under the former LSCA Title II is not authorized for LST grants, as explicitly stated in P.L. 108-81. The Museum and Library Services Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-81) reauthorized the Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) as Title II, focusing on new forms of information sharing like the Internet. Changes included prohibiting funding for projects deemed obscene and defining \"obscene.\" The Director of the IMLS was required to establish procedural standards for reviewing projects. The Museum and Library Services Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-81) reauthorized the Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) with new provisions such as prohibiting funding for projects deemed obscene and setting procedural standards for project review. It also increased minimum state allotments for library services and outlying areas, authorized specific funding amounts for Library Services and Museum Services for FY2004, and allocated advisory functions previously delegated to the National. The Museum and Library Services Act of 2003 reauthorized Library Services and Technology Act with new provisions, including locating advisory functions within a new National Museum and Library Services Board, increasing federal administrative costs to fund this new function, and permitting the Director of the IMLS to make national awards for library service. H.R. 13 (Hoekstra) was introduced to reauthorize Library Services and Technology within the Museum and Library Services Act of 2003. The Museum and Library Services Act of 2003, introduced on January 7, 2003, was passed by the House on March 6, 2003. H.R. 13 changed authorization for Library Services and Museum Services funding.
