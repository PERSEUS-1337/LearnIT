    "content": "There has been a high level of drug trafficking-related violence in Mexico, with estimates of deaths between 45,000 and 55,000 from 2006 to 2012. Concerns have been raised that this violence may spill over into the United States, although U.S. officials deny any direct spillover. The U.S. government supports Mexico's crackdown on drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) through bilateral security initiatives like the M\u00e9rida Initiative. Border security programs are being enhanced to reduce contraband movement across the Southwest border. The presence of Mexican DTOs in the U.S. does not necessarily indicate spillover of drug trafficking-related violence from Mexico. The DTOs in Mexico have developed sophisticated drug smuggling networks, leading to violence and criminal activity. The question for policymakers is whether the violence between DTOs in Mexico affects drug trafficking-related violence in the United States. This report focuses on identifying any spillover of drug-related violence. This report focuses on identifying spillover of drug trafficking-related violence from Mexican drug trafficking organizations into the United States. It discusses the structures of these organizations, their business operations, partnerships in the US, factors contributing to violence, nature of spillover violence, challenges in measuring it, and evaluating crime rate data. It does not cover enforcement issues or specific policy options. The conflict between Mexican drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) revolves around control of smuggling routes into the United States, particularly in the Southwest border region. This area poses unique challenges to law enforcement due to its size, geography, and climate. The National Drug Threat Assessment, 2008, highlighted the illicit drug threat scenario along the southern border with Mexico. The Southwest Border Region is a significant storage, transportation, and transshipment area for illicit drug shipments destined for markets throughout the United States. Mexican DTOs have developed extensive drug transportation networks from the Southwest Border to all regions of the country, smuggling large quantities of drugs through ports of entry and storing them in various communities. Major metropolitan areas like Dallas, El Paso, Houston, Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Antonio, and San Diego are key storage locations. The Southwest Border Region serves as a significant storage and distribution hub for drug shipments in the United States. Mexican DTOs transport drugs from key locations like Dallas, El Paso, Houston, Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Antonio, and San Diego to various destinations across the country. The United States is the largest consumer of illegal drugs, with Mexican DTOs posing the greatest drug trafficking threat. The country sustains a multi-billion dollar market for illicit drugs, including Colombian-produced cocaine and heroin, Mexican-produced heroin and marijuana, and methamphetamine. In 2011, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that 22.5 million individuals aged 12 and older were current illegal drug users, with marijuana being the most commonly used drug. Mexican DTOs are the major suppliers of illegal drugs smuggled into the United States. Mexico is a major transit country for illegal drugs smuggled into the United States across the SWB. Cocaine availability has decreased since 2007 due to various factors, but heroin, marijuana, methamphetamine, and MDMA availability has remained or even increased in some areas. Mexican DTOs control wholesale distribution of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and marijuana in the US. Heroin production in Mexico has increased, leading to higher availability in the US. Mexican methamphetamine supply initially declined due to import restrictions but DTOs found alternative production methods, resulting in increased flow into the US. The increase in Mexican methamphetamine flow into the US and rising marijuana availability are attributed to factors like increased production in Mexico and cultivation in the US by criminal networks. Data on drug seizures along the Southwest border provide insight into the quantity of drugs seized, but the total amount produced and transported by Mexican DTOs remains unknown. Total drug seizures generally increased from 2005-2010, with some declines in 2008 and 2010. Total drug seizures along the Southwest border generally increased from 2005-2010, with declines in 2008 and 2010. The drop in seizures for 2010 was mainly due to a significant decrease in marijuana seizures compared to 2009. Cocaine seizures decreased in 2007 and 2008 but began to increase again in 2009. MDMA seizures continued to decline in 2010. These data reflect only a portion of the drugs smuggled by Mexican DTOs into the US. Mexican drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) have a strong presence in over 1,200 U.S. cities, primarily focusing on the drug trade to meet the demand for illegal drugs. Influenced by geography and other factors, Mexican DTOs act as transshipment routes between Colombia and the United States. They are compared to corporations or small nation-states due to their organized criminal activities. Mexican DTOs have diversified their operations beyond drug trafficking, engaging in crimes like kidnapping, extortion, human trafficking, and intellectual property violations to supplement their income. They transport or produce drugs to be smuggled across the US-Mexico border for distribution in the US, with proceeds laundered, smuggled back, or used to buy weapons in the US for smuggling into Mexico. Mexican DTOs purchase weapons in the US for smuggling into Mexico, while drugs flow north across the border. They have expanded operations in at least 1,286 US cities, with 143 directly controlled by DTO members in Mexico. DTOs transport multi-ton quantities of drugs into the US using various methods. Mexican drug trafficking organizations generate billions in U.S. wholesale drug proceeds annually. Policy makers are concerned about the impact of drug trafficking-related violence spillover into the United States. One study found that surges in violence have the most negative impact on service-related businesses. Surges in violence negatively impact service-related businesses in low-crime areas, leading to a reduction in new businesses, decreased expansions, and overall lack of growth. The findings suggest that drug trafficking businesses could also be affected by violence spillover, potentially harming both legal and illegal markets. Surges in violence negatively impact service-related businesses in low-crime areas, leading to a reduction in new businesses, decreased expansions, and overall lack of growth. Drug trafficking businesses could also be affected by violence spillover, potentially harming both legal and illegal markets. Anecdotal predictions suggest that spillover violence could be detrimental to drug trafficking business, but the DEA has expressed moderate confidence in minimal impact in the short term. The NDIC has reported that Mexican DTOs have formed alliances with U.S. street gangs, prison gangs, and outlaw motorcycle gangs to distribute drugs in the United States. These gangs are involved in both retail and wholesale drug distribution, facilitating the movement of illicit drugs across urban, suburban, and rural areas. Domestic gangs not only distribute drugs but also provide warehousing, security, and transportation services. Barrio Azteca, a prominent U.S. prison gang, is one of several with ties to Mexican DTOs. Barrio Azteca is a U.S. prison gang linked to Mexican DTOs, primarily involved in smuggling drugs like marijuana, heroin, and cocaine. They also engage in crimes such as extortion, kidnapping, and alien smuggling. Mexican DTOs, driven by profit, generate income from various illegal activities beyond drug trafficking, including human and weapon smuggling, counterfeiting, piracy, kidnapping for ransom, and extortion. If drug income decreases, DTOs may increase involvement in other money-generating crimes like kidnapping and home invasions. The NDIC reported a high number of drug trafficking-related kidnappings for ransom in Phoenix, AZ, with statistics showing a decrease in reported incidents due to reclassification by the police department. Kidnappings may be underreported due to fear of retaliation or exposing involvement in drug trafficking. Tucson, AZ, police have noted an increase in kidnappings and home invasions, with suspects being local. There has been an increase in kidnappings for ransom and home invasions by local criminals, not DTO members from Mexico. These illegal activities may be tied to drug smuggling but are not directly related to drug trafficking in general. In an illegal marketplace, violence is used to settle disputes and maintain order due to the elevated risks and profits. The National Academy of Sciences Panel on the Understanding and Control of Violent Behavior concluded that illegal drug markets operate outside the law, leading to disputes resolved through violence. Drug trafficking-related violence in Mexico has increased significantly, with over 9,575 drug trafficking-related murders in 2012. Mexican drug trafficking organizations are at war with each other and law enforcement along the U.S. border. The increasing difficulty and cost for drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) to control production zones and smuggling routes, due to enforcement actions in Mexico and border measures by the United States, has led to a rise in violence as DTOs compete for territory and markets. This poses challenges for policy makers in evaluating the costs and consequences of increased law enforcement on drug trafficking-related violence in Mexico. Policy makers are concerned about the potential for drug trafficking-related violence in Mexico to spill over into the United States. The increasing tensions between DTOs in Mexico could lead to elevated levels of violence, prompting policy actions to alter the illegal drug market. The concern for \"spillover\" violence from drug trafficking in Mexico to the United States has prompted the need for a clear understanding and definition of this phenomenon. Various definitions have been proposed, including deliberate attacks by cartels on U.S. assets, civilians, and institutions. Congress has yet to adopt a formal definition of spillover violence. The definition of spillover violence excludes trafficker-on-trafficker violence, which is the predominant form of drug trafficking-related violence in Mexico. This narrow scope may underestimate the potential for this type of violence to spill over into the United States. The likelihood of spillover violence in the United States is considered small, but defining it may blur the line between spillover and terrorism. Experts suggest that drug trafficking-related violence, including trafficker-on-trafficker violence, could constitute spillover. Non-violent indicators like corruption among U.S. officials are not addressed in this report. Some experts suggest that drug trafficking-related violence spillover into the United States could resemble the recent surge of violence in Mexico, characterized by increasing murders, brutality, intimidation, attacks on security forces, assassinations, growing arsenals of weapons, and indiscriminate killing of civilians. However, differences in government responses between the two countries may impact the potential for violence spillover. The report discusses factors of concern as Congress debates drug trafficking-related violence spillover from Mexico to the United States. It includes who may be involved, the type and timing of violence, and potential locations. Perpetrators in Mexico are active DTO members seeking territory, revenge, and reacting to government crackdowns. If violence spills over, Congress may focus on perpetrators and victims. The drug trafficking-related violence in Mexico has connections with U.S. groups like street gangs and outlaw motorcycle gangs. Reports on violence in the United States are mixed, with some suggesting involvement of Mexican drug traffickers while others point to domestic traffickers or gang members. Violence in Mexico targets competing DTOs, security forces, and the government. Mexican drug trafficking violence targets competing DTOs, security forces, government officials, and those indebted to traffickers. Reports indicate that 90% of murders in Mexico are aimed at drug trafficking organization members. While there are isolated incidents of civilian casualties, drug traffickers do not consistently target unconnected civilians. Concerns have been raised over U.S. law enforcement agents being killed by suspected drug smugglers, such as the cases of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry and two ICE agents in Mexico. Experts warn that if security trends in Mexico worsen, there is a higher likelihood of deliberate targeting of U.S. government personnel. Policy makers may question if potential violence spillover into the United States would involve individuals connected to the drug trade. Reports suggest that victims of drug trafficking-related violence in the U.S. are often involved in the drug trade. There is a possibility that drug trafficking victims in the U.S. could extend beyond those directly involved in trafficking. If security trends worsen in Mexico, there is a higher likelihood of violence spillover into the United States, potentially targeting U.S. government personnel. Assaults against border patrol agents have remained relatively constant, with localized changes in specific sectors. It is unclear if these assaults are connected to Mexican drug trafficking organizations. Increased targeting of U.S. law enforcement personnel by Mexican DTO affiliates could indicate spillover violence. A change in victim patterns, such as innocent bystanders being affected, may trigger policy action. In Mexico, drug trafficking-related violence mainly involves murder, with estimates of 45,000-55,000 murders between 2006 and 2012, along with kidnappings and assaults. Reports suggest an increase in violence in the United States as well. The increase in drug trafficking-related violence in the United States is a concern, with reports pointing to kidnappings and home invasions. The true extent of these crimes and their ties to drug trafficking are unknown. Policy makers and law enforcement are unsure if different types of violence are more associated with drug traffickers. There is a question of whether the violence seen in Mexico, such as murders, will spill over into the United States. The rise in drug trafficking-related violence in the United States is a concern, with reports of kidnappings and home invasions. It is uncertain if different types of violence are more linked to drug traffickers. There is a question of whether the brutality and attacks seen in Mexico will spill over into the United States, leading to an increase in violent crimes. The United States has seen an increase in drug trafficking-related violence, with concerns about spillover from Mexico. Analyzing trends before and after 2006 could help determine if the US is experiencing spillover violence. It is challenging to isolate crimes directly linked to Mexico's situation, so policymakers should monitor other spillover indicators. The discussion of spillover violence from Mexico to the United States focuses on the Southwest border, but policymakers should consider measuring changes in other spillover indicators to standardize measurements and understand trends better. The analysis should start at the Southwest border, but drug trafficking organizations operate in over 1,286 cities in the US. They have connections with various groups like street gangs and prison gangs to distribute drugs. Policy makers need to focus on areas with the highest likelihood of spillover violence. One method to identify areas with potential spillover violence from drug trafficking is to analyze changes in violence levels and victim patterns in key locations along a timeline corresponding to the escalation of drug trafficking violence in Mexico. Strategic locations in the Southwest border region and inland distribution routes should be prioritized, along with areas not currently identified as significant to drug trafficking operations for comparison. This approach aims to pinpoint geographic areas with the highest risk of spillover violence. The report discusses challenges facing policy makers in the United States regarding drug control and border security issues. Various federal agencies, state and local entities, task forces, and intelligence centers are involved in drug control policy and countering threats from Mexican DTOs, each with different authorities, budgets, and responsibilities. The complexity of drug control policy in the United States is evident in the federal government's response to drug trafficking-related violence in Mexico. Congressional hearings have highlighted concerns over the lack of centralized direction and leadership in addressing these issues. The oversight of drug control and drug trafficking-related violence issues within Congress is complex due to jurisdiction spread across multiple committees. Coordination of oversight is challenging, especially since few agencies are solely dedicated to counterdrug missions. This presents challenges in analyzing drug control policy, such as disaggregating agencies' drug control activities from other missions. For example, CBP officers at ports of entry conduct inspections without knowing the ultimate outcome. The challenge of estimating the portion of CBP officers' time spent on counterdrug efforts and analyzing specific drug control policies is complex. Disaggregating drug control missions is critical for measuring progress and directing resources effectively. Success definition is crucial for policy evaluation. The complexity of evaluating drug control policies, especially in response to drug trafficking-related violence in Mexico, makes it crucial to define appropriate goals and objectives for policy evaluation. Temptation to conflate specific issues with the overall drug control problem complicates the articulation of a domestic policy response. The complexity of evaluating drug control policies, especially in response to drug trafficking-related violence in Mexico, makes it crucial to define appropriate goals and objectives for policy evaluation. Conflating specific issues with the overall drug control problem complicates the articulation of a domestic policy response, particularly in identifying drug-related violence and correlating drug activity indicators with increased violence in Mexico. Defining what constitutes drug-related violence poses a potential complication in this analysis. The definitions of drug-related violence are important for policy evaluation, including crimes under drug influence, economic-compulsive crimes, and systemic drug crimes related to trafficking. Measurement issues in collecting drug control statistics are also significant. Issues with the collection and reporting of drug control statistics raise questions about the value of reported measures. The complexity of the drug control issue leads to differences in how enforcement statistics are collected and reported by various agencies. The central question in this report is how to measure changes in drug-related violence, particularly drug trafficking-related violence. Evaluating indicators like violent crimes excluding robberies can be challenging. For example, in Tucson, there were fewer violent crimes in the first three months of 2009 compared to 2008. The increase in violent crimes in Tucson in the first three months of 2009 compared to 2008 raises questions about the spillover violence from drug trafficking in Mexico. It is unclear if the rise in violent crimes is related to drug trafficking, and the data on drug-trafficking-related violence is limited. The challenges in measuring changes in drug-related violence highlight the issues with available data. The analysis highlights the lack of readily available data on drug-trafficking-related violent crime in border and interior areas. The data needed for a statistically significant trend analysis is not accessible, as outlined by the Congressional Research Service. Currently, there is no comprehensive, publicly available data to definitively determine if there has been a significant spillover of drug trafficking-related violence into the United States. The U.S. government officials maintain that there has not been a significant spillover of drug trafficking-related violence into the United States. An analysis of violent crime data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Report (UCR) program was conducted by CRS to determine any spillover from Mexico. However, the UCR data does not specify the proportion of violent crime related to drug trafficking or spillover violence. The UCR compiles crime statistics from local police departments and state agencies in the U.S. The FBI's Uniform Crime Report (UCR) program collects data on Part I offenses in the United States, including violent crimes like murder and property crimes like burglary. However, the UCR is limited in scope and does not cover all crimes committed in the country. The UCR program collects data on Part I offenses in the United States, including violent crimes like murder and property crimes like burglary. However, the data is limited as it does not include all crimes committed in the country. Factors affecting the inclusivity of the UCR data include local law enforcement's choice to report data, reporting practices, and imputation methods used by the FBI. Policy makers are concerned about drug trafficking-related violent crimes increasing, so the UCR program presents and analyzes violent crime rates. The UCR program collects data on violent and property crime rates annually, including data for metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). The NDIC estimated that Mexican DTOs operate in at least 1,286 U.S. cities, supplying drugs to distributors. This information is based on state and local law enforcement agency estimations and interviews with NDIC staff. The NDIC estimated that Mexican drug trafficking organizations operate in over 1,200 U.S. cities, supplying drugs to distributors. The presence of DTOs in cities may lead to an increase in drug trafficking-related violence, especially along the Southwest border. If violence follows a similar trend as in Mexico since December 2006, an escalation in violence may be expected. Since December 2006, when former Mexican President Felipe Calder\u00f3n cracked down on drug trafficking organizations (DTOs), there has been an increase in violence. The NDIC identified 138 MSAs with Mexican DTO presence, 8 of which are border MSAs. Analysis shows that the violent crime rate has not significantly increased in areas with Mexican DTO presence from 1999 to 2011. Analysis indicates no significant difference in violent crime rates between border and non-border MSAs from 1999 to 2011. The average violent crime rate in selected border MSAs has generally decreased since 2001 and remained below the national rate since 2005. It is unclear if changes in violent crime rates are linked to drug trafficking-related crimes. The compilation of violent crimes, both related and unrelated to trafficking, could mask trends in drug trafficking-related violent crimes. Aggregate data may not reflect trends in individual MSAs. The trends in violent crime rates in border MSAs from 1999 to 2011 may not reflect individual MSA trends. Despite an increase in violent crime rates in some border cities, such as El Paso, TX, during certain years, the overall trend in drug trafficking-related violence did not align with escalating violence in Mexico. When drug trafficking-related violence peaked in Mexico in 2011, the violent crime rates in border MSAs, including El Paso, dropped. This counterintuitive trend may challenge expectations of spillover violence affecting border cities. Spillover violence from Mexico may not affect border cities uniformly. Hot-spot \"flare-ups\" in violence may occur in response to drug trafficking activity across the border. While violence in Ciudad Juarez correlated with an increase in El Paso violence, overall crime rates may not accurately depict trends in violent crime. The possibility of a time lag between drug trafficking-related violence in Mexico and the United States is considered, as rival DTOs may engage in violent conflict on the U.S. side of the border after settling disputes in Mexico. It is challenging to separate a time lag from other factors influencing levels of drug trafficking-related violence in the United States. Mexico has seen increased drug trafficking-related violence within and between DTOs since 2006. The drug trafficking-related violence in Mexico between 2006 and 2012 resulted in an estimated 45,000 to 55,000 deaths. Concerns persist about the potential spillover of this violence into the United States. Defining spillover violence is a challenge, with differing views on whether trafficker-on-trafficker violence should be included. Key elements in assessing spillover violence in the United States include identifying perpetrators and victims. The text discusses the lack of comprehensive data on drug trafficking-related violence spillover from Mexico into the United States. An analysis of FBI's violent crime data did not definitively show a significant spillover. Key elements in assessing spillover violence include identifying perpetrators and victims. The analysis by CRS on crime data from selected Metropolitan Statistical Areas along the Southwest border and non-border areas suggests no significant increase in violent crime rates related to Mexican drug trafficking organizations from 1999 to 2011. There is also no notable difference in violent crime rates between border and non-border areas during this period. CRS cannot draw fact-based conclusions on trends in drug trafficking-related violence spilling over from Mexico into the United States due to limitations in overall violent crime rate trends."
