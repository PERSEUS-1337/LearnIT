    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Turkish Human Rights Compliance Act\". The Congress finds extensive human rights abuses by the Government of Turkey, as documented by various organizations. The Government of Turkey is accused of widespread use of torture and violating international human rights agreements. It denies the existence of its Kurdish citizens and has used military force against them. Turkey also illegally occupies Cyprus and obstructs efforts for a resolution. The resolution to the division of Cyprus and the uprooting of Greek Cypriots caused by Turkey's 1974 invasion, along with Turkey's blockade of Armenia and restrictions on Christian communities, led to the withholding of 10 percent of US assistance to Turkey in 1995 due to human rights concerns. Turkey rejects any US aid tied to its human rights record. Turkey rejects US assistance tied to its deteriorating human rights record, as reported by independent monitoring organizations. The President will withhold $500,000 each day from assistance to Turkey if they do not meet specified conditions. The President has the authority to waive this restriction if it is deemed necessary for national security. The President will withhold assistance to Turkey if it does not meet specified conditions related to human rights monitoring, Kurdish rights, and military presence in Cyprus. Turkey must meet specified conditions related to human rights monitoring, Kurdish rights, and military presence in Cyprus to receive assistance. Additionally, Turkey must agree to a settlement recognizing the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of Cyprus, remove its blockade of United States and international assistance to Armenia, and remove official restrictions on Christian churches and schools while offering protection against violence and harassment."
