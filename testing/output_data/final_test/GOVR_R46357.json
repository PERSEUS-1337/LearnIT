    "content": "Congressional oversight of the executive branch is facilitated by statutory reporting requirements, which provide Congress with information on public policy implementation. Each year, Congress enacts various requirements for advance notification, planning, summarizing steps, and studying issues. Policymakers must make choices that impact the content and frequency of information provided to Congress. This report outlines statutory reporting requirements used by Congress to obtain information from the executive branch, including goals and common features of legislative language. Congress relies on information from the executive branch for oversight, enacting provisions that require specified information to be provided. The type and amount of information can vary, including notifications, data, statistics, and reports. Statutory reporting requirements from Congress include notifications, data, statistics, reports, and plans for policy implementation. The volume of reporting has fluctuated over time, with periodic efforts to reduce requirements. Despite this, federal entities are still mandated to submit numerous materials annually, with new reporting requirements continuously being introduced. These reports serve various purposes such as ensuring legislative compliance, gathering essential data, monitoring policy implementation, evaluating program effectiveness, and assessing federal capacity. The annual reporting requirements from Congress encompass notifications, descriptive reports, plans, and studies. These requirements cover actions taken, factual information, goal accomplishments, and evaluations on specific issues. Federal officials, such as Cabinet Secretaries, are often mandated to notify Congress before or after taking certain actions. The Secretary may be granted authority to take action or waive restrictions, with notification to Congress required. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2019 outlined specific notification requirements for waivers related to naval vessels. The reporting requirements for notification to Congress on executive branch activities serve to promote national defense, allow for congressional supervision, ensure compliance with legislative intent, provide an opportunity for legislators to prevent or modify executive actions, and act as a disincentive for the executive branch to take actions prompting a legislative response. These requirements include descriptive reports on agency activities and factual information. Requirements for descriptive reports often direct officials to provide Congress with data and statistics, summarize agency actions on a policy matter, list actions taken during a specified time frame, and describe program operations or results. Congress may also require reports on fund usage, implementation of recommendations, or instances of executive branch authority utilization. Congress may require agencies to submit plans with timelines and performance indicators to achieve specific goals. Acts like the GPRA and GPRA Modernization Act mandate executive branch agencies to submit strategic and performance plans regularly. Additionally, Congress can enact provisions for agencies to detail how they will achieve particular goals, such as establishing new programs or policies. For example, the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017 included provisions for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-48) requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to improve the information technology system for processing educational assistance claims under chapter 33 of title 38, United States Code. The Secretary must ensure electronic adjudication of claims and use rules-based processing with minimal human intervention. A plan for implementation must be submitted to Congress within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs is required to submit a plan to Congress for implementing changes and improvements to the information technology system for processing educational assistance claims. This plan may include reporting provisions and requirements for regular status updates on its implementation. The State must submit a multi-year spend plan to Congress detailing how funds will prioritize addressing key factors in Central America contributing to undocumented migration to the US. Requiring agencies to submit plans can focus attention on important issues and help measure progress systematically. Congress often requests agencies to study problems, evaluate performance, or perform analytical tasks. The John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 established the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence to review advances in artificial intelligence and submit recurring reports. The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence was established to review machine learning developments and technologies, and submit reports to Congress and the President. Other reporting requirements include evaluations of programs or policies, such as the FAA Reauthorization Act directing the evaluation of the FAA's personnel management system. Congress also mandates the Government Accountability Office to conduct studies and evaluations. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is a branch agency that supports Congress in its oversight role by conducting audits, evaluations, investigations, and other services. GAO prepares reports and testimonies in response to statutory requirements, committee reports, and requests from committees or individual Members. These reports serve multiple purposes such as supervising executive activity, ensuring compliance with legislative intent, focusing agency attention on congressional priorities, gathering factual information, assessing program effectiveness, and informing legislative decision-making. Additionally, GAO's studies and evaluations may lead to new legislative proposals and provide useful information to Congress on policies and procedures. Agency reviews of policies and procedures can provide valuable information to Congress on potentially outdated or incompatible laws that may need to be reconsidered. Adding reporting requirements could be a compromise for legislators, such as granting authority to the Executive with the condition of reporting to Congress. Some criticize the excessive and costly reporting burden on the executive branch. Estimating the total cost of reporting requirements is challenging due to the lack of a comprehensive inventory of required reports. The challenge of assessing and eliminating duplicative, outdated, and costly reports to Congress persists due to the lack of a comprehensive inventory of required reports. This poses difficulties for policymakers in determining the relevance of existing reporting requirements and evaluating the necessity of new ones. Agency compliance with reporting requirements also presents challenges. Agency compliance with reporting requirements poses difficulties due to factors like vagueness in statutory deadlines and lack of a complete inventory of submissions. Reports to Congress may not always meet statutory requirements or expectations. Congressional choices in designing requirements impact the content and frequency of information received. This report analyzes legislative considerations for creating reporting requirements. This report analyzes reporting requirements enacted during the 115th Congress, focusing on the challenges of obtaining a complete inventory of submissions to Congress. The Clerk of the House publishes an annual document, \"Reports to be Made to Congress,\" which lists reporting requirements but may not capture all statutory requirements. Reports to Congress can stem from various sources, including statutory mandates and committee reports. The diversity of sources of reporting requirements, including statutory mandates and committee reports, poses challenges in obtaining a complete inventory of submissions to Congress. Congress utilizes reporting requirements to gather a wide array of information through various products, leading to variation in legislative language used to refer to reports and their contents. This can include requests for reviews, evaluations, assessments, plans, strategies, analyses, studies, reports, lists, summaries, briefings, notifications, certifications, or other products from agencies. During the 115th Congress, over 3,000 reporting requirements were identified and analyzed. These requirements directed federal officials, agencies, or entities to submit specified information to Congress, congressional committees, or leaders. The search process involved examining public laws for terms related to reports and Congress to identify these statutory reporting requirements. The search method identified numerous reporting requirements during the 115th Congress, but it may not cover all requirements due to the diverse statutory language used. Some provisions mandate reports without specifying a congressional recipient, leading to exclusions in the search results. During the 115th Congress, 3,359 reporting requirements were identified, with the majority found in four key acts. The search process excluded reporting requirements that did not specify a congressional recipient. During the 115th Congress, 3,359 reporting requirements were identified, with the majority in key acts. Appropriations measures had more notification requirements than other acts, with provisions for agencies to notify Congress before fund obligations. Reporting provisions in appropriations acts expire at the end of the fiscal year. During the 115th Congress, 3,359 reporting requirements were identified, with most in key acts. Appropriations measures had more notification requirements than other acts, with provisions for agencies to notify Congress before fund obligations. Reporting provisions in appropriations acts expire at the end of the fiscal year, but some requirements reappear in subsequent bills as recurring provisions. Analysis of reporting provisions in the 115th Congress found common components such as specified information, responsible official or agency, recipient, deadline, and whether the report is one-time or recurring. Reporting requirements may also include details on public availability of information and handling of classified material.

Analysis of reporting provisions in the 115th Congress found common components such as specified information, responsible official or agency, recipient, deadline, and whether the report is one-time or recurring. Reporting requirements may also include details on public availability of information and handling of classified material. The nature, type, and specificity of content required in reporting provisions varied, ranging from general to highly specific instructions. Different products like notifications, certifications, plans, summary reports, studies, assessments, and evaluations are required to be submitted to Congress. Some provisions require a \"status update\" or a \"quarterly report\" without specific details, while others specify components and subcomponents to be included in reports. During the 115th Congress, numerous reporting requirements were identified, with appropriations acts having more notification provisions. These requirements may include specified information, responsible officials, deadlines, and the nature of the report. For example, the Save Our Seas Act of 2018 directed the Commandant to provide briefings on the implementation of actions regarding the vessel El Faro to specific congressional committees. The memo dated December 19, 2017, addressed the sinking and loss of the vessel El Faro. Reporting requirements typically specify federal officials responsible for submitting reports to Congress, including Cabinet Secretaries and heads of other federal entities. Some requirements direct multiple federal agencies to participate in creating and submitting reports. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2018 directed the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to submit a report on prioritizing US defense interests in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region. This may involve collaboration with nonfederal entities or outside experts for complex issues. The Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017 directs the Under Secretary of Commerce to assess the NOAA system for issuing hazardous weather warnings. This includes consulting with relevant NOAA line offices, academic sector individuals, media outlets, and non-Federal forecasters. The Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017 directs the Under Secretary of Commerce to assess the NOAA system for issuing hazardous weather warnings, including consulting with various stakeholders such as non-Federal forecasters, emergency planners, State and local agencies, and other government users. The Under Secretary may also utilize the services of the National Academy of Sciences for scientific and technical review. The statutory language varies in identifying recipients of reports, including Congress, specific committees, committee chairs, and executive branch officials. Most reporting requirements direct reports to standing committees or committee leaders. Some reports are directed to multiple committees in each chamber, while others are specified for Congress as a whole without naming a particular committee. When reports are submitted to Congress, they are usually referred to the relevant committee in each chamber. However, directing a report to Congress may not ensure it reaches all interested parties. Some reports are also required to be submitted to the President, agency officials, or other recipients. Some statutes establish independent panels to report recommendations to Congress and the President, ensuring outside perspective and quality assessment of agency plans. For example, the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 included a provision for the Administrator to submit a strategy within 180 days. The Administrator must submit a strategy for surface transportation security inspectors within 180 days, addressing data system limitations, alignment with risk assessments, and measurable objectives. The Comptroller General will review the strategy and issue recommendations within the same timeframe. Deadlines for submitting required reports can be based on calendar dates or specified events, such as enactment of legislation, agency actions, budget requests, program terminations, or fiscal year endings. The choice between a calendar date deadline and one tied to an event can impact the timeliness and quality of the information received. Setting a calendar-date deadline for report submission can ensure timely information to Congress, but delays in enactment reduce agency report production time. Tying the deadline to an event, like submission within 180 days of enactment, allows the same report completion time regardless of enactment timing. This approach may ensure agencies have enough time to address congressional concerns, although it may delay report submission. The submission date of the report in question may be challenging to oversee compliance with complex deadlines tied to specific agency actions. Some reporting requirements lack specified deadlines, instead offering incentives for timely submission. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2018 limited funds for vehicle upgrades until the Secretary of the Army submitted a detailed strategy report. The curr_chunk discusses a detailed strategy for upgrading and fielding M113 vehicles, addressing survivability and maneuverability concerns, historical costs, cost estimates, procurement and life cycle costs comparison, and the possibility of accelerating Army Multi-Purpose Vehicle production. Reporting requirements to Congress may be one-time or periodic. The curr_chunk discusses reporting requirements to Congress, which can be one-time or recurring, depending on the type of information being reported. One-time reports address specific issues, while recurring reports include status updates, annual summaries, data and statistics, and financial reports. The curr_chunk highlights the frequency of reporting requirements to Congress, ranging from monthly to every five years, with some provisions having a sunset date. For example, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act includes a recurring reporting requirement on suspicious orders. The curr_chunk discusses the reporting requirements to Congress, including the number of reports of suspicious orders, actions taken in response, and information shared with States. It also mentions the potential benefits of automatic expiration of recurring reporting requirements to reduce burden. The Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017 directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to report to Congress whenever legislative changes to the new appeals system are deemed necessary. The Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017 requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to report to Congress on legislative changes to the appeals system. Agencies must notify Congress of actions like fund transfers, contract awards, and office closures, as seen in the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018. The Senate receives notifications of closures to help monitor agency activities in real-time. Statutes may require reports that allow executive branch officials to take action, such as waiving certain requirements with justification to Congress. The Countering America's Adversaries through Sanctions Act permits the President to waive or terminate sanctions upon specified submission. Certain reports to Congress may not be required to be made publicly available, unless explicitly instructed. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2018 included a provision that gave agencies the authority to waive or terminate specific sanctions, contingent upon submitting specified information to Congress. Making reports publicly available can enhance access and awareness among legislators and the public. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2018 allows agency officials to decide whether to make certain reports public, with exceptions for national security or sensitive information. Reports must be posted on the agency's website after being available to the Committees on Appropriations for 45 days. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2018 allows agency officials to decide whether to make certain reports public, with exceptions for national security or sensitive information. Reports must be posted on the agency's website after being available to the Committees on Appropriations for 45 days. Some reports may contain classified material, requiring submission of a nonclassified report with a classified annex for legislative oversight. Legislators have concerns about the volume, cost, and effectiveness of reporting requirements, as well as monitoring agency compliance. There is a lack of comprehensive inventory of existing report requirements. Legislation has been introduced to create a centralized repository of congressionally mandated reports. For example, the Access to Congressionally Mandated Reports Act (H.R. 736, 116th Congress) would require the Government Publishing Office to create a publicly available online portal of all congressionally mandated reports. Establishing a centralized, public repository for congressionally mandated reports may address concerns related to the reporting process. It can help Congress monitor timely submission of reports, increase accessibility and awareness of submitted reports, and reduce duplicative reporting requirements. Additionally, it may assist in assessing the reporting burden on Congress. Creating a centralized database of submitted reports could help Congress assess reporting burden on federal agencies. However, it may not provide a complete picture of reporting requirements as unsubmitted reports would be missing. Obtaining a full inventory of requirements would be complex and resource-intensive. Ongoing maintenance would be necessary for the repository as new requirements and reports are added. Incomplete understanding of requirements could make it challenging to determine the total volume of reports needed. It is impossible to determine the total volume of reports required, assess agency compliance, or identify duplicative reporting requirements."
