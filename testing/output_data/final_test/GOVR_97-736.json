    "content": "Arguments for amending the criminal justice system include restoring balance in favor of victims, compensating them, and addressing disparities in existing laws. Critics argue that the system is not out of balance and should focus on determining guilt impartially. The proposal for a victims rights amendment could create uncertainty, flood federal courts with litigation, be costly, and potentially jeopardize the rights of the accused or hinder the government's ability to prosecute. It is argued that the Constitution is not the place for such amendments and goes against the principles of federalism. Each state has already determined how victims' rights should be handled. Each state has decided how victims' rights should be accommodated within its criminal justice system, making a uniform standard unnecessary. S.J.Res. 3 and H.J.Res. 64 proposed guaranteeing victims the right to notice, attend, and be heard during the criminal justice process. The definition of a victim varied between the two resolutions. The House Resolution and Senate proposal on victims' rights differ in coverage of nonviolent felonies. Victims may have rights at the bail hearing, with some states allowing victims to be heard or consulted before the hearing. Federal law addresses victims of interstate domestic violence or violations. In federal cases, victims of interstate domestic violence or violations of protective orders have the right to be heard at bail proceedings regarding any danger posed by the defendant. The 106th proposals aimed to give victims the right to be heard and submit written statements at all proceedings for conditional release from custody. Plea bargains, which account for over 90% of criminal convictions, can be detrimental to victims by jeopardizing restitution, resulting in inadequate sentences, or changing outcomes unexpectedly. Some states allow victims to address the court before a plea bargain is accepted. Proposed resolutions aimed to give victims the right to speak before plea bargains in criminal proceedings. Speedy trial rights are guaranteed by the Constitution for federal and state cases. The constitutional right to a speedy trial is reinforced by laws at both state and federal levels. Victims now have rights to prompt disposition of their cases, with many states enacting provisions for timely resolution and minimizing delays. Efforts include employer intercession services and the prompt return of a victim's property. Proposed resolutions aimed to ensure trials are free from unreasonable delays. The Sixth Amendment guarantees the accused a public trial by an impartial jury, but offers little protection to victims. Victims may be excluded from the courtroom during trial, even if they are also witnesses. Some states allow victims to attend court proceedings regardless of their role as a witness. Some states allow victims to attend court proceedings regardless of their role as a witness, while others leave it to the discretion of the trial court. Proposed resolutions aim to give victims the right to notice and attendance at all public proceedings related to the crime. The most common victims' right among states is the presentation of victim impact information during sentencing. The diversity of methods among states regarding victims' rights at sentencing is evident. Proposed resolutions aim to give victims the right to be heard and submit written statements during proceedings. Enforcement may be a challenge, but drafting a constitutional amendment could address this issue. Drafting a constitutional amendment for victims' rights enforcement would prioritize victims in legal proceedings, nullifying cases without honoring their rights. This would involve rescheduling sentencing hearings, rejecting plea bargains, restarting trials, and holding unfaithful public servants and negligent governmental entities accountable. Proponents suggest limiting enforcement to the courts' equitable powers, as seen in S.J.Res. 3 and H.J.Res. 64, which would confer legislative authority to define victims' rights. The proposed constitutional amendment for victims' rights would empower Congress to define victim classes and enforce provisions through legislation, with exceptions only when necessary for a compelling interest. The amendment raises questions about the survival of existing victims' rights laws under the U.S. Constitution. An amendment to the United States Constitution can make constitutional changes that would not otherwise be permissible, potentially subordinating defendants' rights to victims' rights and preempting existing laws. The idea of a \"king-of-the-hill\" victims rights amendment is implied in the complaint about the lack of uniformity in existing laws. Proponents of S.J.Res. 3 and H.J.Res. 64 aim to establish a minimum victims' rights standard and promote uniformity in the legal system. In cases of conflict between a victims' rights amendment and other constitutional rights, the most recently adopted provision will prevail. The proposals in the 106th Congress seek to address unfair treatment resulting from existing laws. The proposals in the 106th Congress aimed to eliminate unfair treatment in the criminal justice system by ensuring victims' rights without infringing on the rights of the accused. The text clarified that only the victim or their representative could assert the rights created by the amendment, separate from the accused's rights under the Sixth Amendment."
