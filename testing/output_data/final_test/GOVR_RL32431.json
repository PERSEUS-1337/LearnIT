    "content": "National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) under the Clean Air Act set pollution levels in outdoor air to protect public health and welfare. EPA establishes primary and secondary standards for criteria pollutants like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, lead, and particulate matter. This report focuses on the implementation process for the 1997 standards for fine particulate matter (PM 2.5). The EPA and states are finalizing the implementation of the 1997 standards for fine particulate matter (PM 2.5), which has been delayed due to court challenges and other factors. The PM 2.5 NAAQS, established in 1997, have been a topic of national debate and concern. Congress has shown interest in EPA's promulgation and implementation of the standards. EPA's experiences with the PM 2.5 NAAQS from 13 years ago could provide insights for the current implementation of the revised standards in 2006. The EPA revised the particulates standards in 1997 to focus on fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) due to its health impacts. The standards set a maximum concentration of 15 micrograms per cubic meter. The EPA set a maximum concentration of 15 micrograms per cubic meter for PM 2.5 in 1997. Geographic areas were designated as \"attainment\" or \"nonattainment\" based on air quality standards. As of August 2008, 205 counties in 20 states were designated as nonattainment areas, affecting nearly 90 million people. The EPA designated nonattainment areas based on air quality standards for PM 2.5. States had to develop emission control programs to meet the standards by April 5, 2010. Compliance status with the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS was not released by EPA at the time of the report. In November 2009, EPA found that Georgia, Illinois, and Pennsylvania missed deadlines for submitting plans for nonattainment areas. Sanctions, including a suspension of federal highway funds, could apply if SIPs are inadequate. EPA indicated that 19 of 39 nonattainment areas met the 1997 PM 2.5 standard by June 2010. The EPA's \"Clean Data Policy\" allows for the suspension of certain nonattainment SIP submission requirements if the area is monitoring attainment. Concerns were raised about compliance deadlines due to delays in EPA providing implementation procedures for the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS. The EPA published its final \"PM 2.5 implementation\" rule in April 2007, leading to petitions for review and reconsideration. States were required to submit their SIPs by April 2008, causing concerns among state and local air pollution control agencies and Members of Congress about the delays. The EPA's Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) was expected to help downwind states meet the PM 2.5 NAAQS by reducing interstate transport of emissions from electric generating units. The rule covered 28 states in the eastern US and the District of Columbia. The EPA's Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) covered 28 states in the eastern US and the District of Columbia, including 26 jurisdictions in the PM 2.5 nonattainment region. A court decision in July 2008 vacated CAIR, causing states to reconsider implementation plans for achieving or maintaining attainment with 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS. The court later reversed its decision to vacate CAIR while EPA develops a replacement rule, but left the substantive requirements intact. The court's decision to vacate the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) drew congressional interest and led to the proposed \"Transport Rule\" by the EPA in 2010. The new rule aims to limit sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions in 31 states and the District of Columbia to help downwind states comply with air quality standards. The proposal has sparked debate among states, industry, and stakeholders. The EPA's proposed alternative transport rule, aimed at limiting sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions in 31 states and the District of Columbia, has sparked debate among states, industry, and stakeholders. The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Clean Air and Nuclear Safety held a hearing on the rule in July 2010, with three public hearings scheduled by the EPA. Comments on the proposal must be received by October 1, 2010. Additionally, EPA's revisions to the NAAQS for particulate matter in 2006 and designations of nonattainment areas for the revised 2006 24-hour PM 2.5 standard have further complicated efforts to achieve attainment of the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS. The EPA's final nonattainment designations for the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS included counties exceeding both the 24-hour and annual standards. Tightening the 24-hour standard led to more areas being designated nonattainment. States were urged to consider control strategies for the 2006 revised PM 2.5 NAAQS. The final designations rule's effective date is December 14, 2009, with states having three years to submit SIPs to meet the standards. The EPA is urging states to submit SIPs to meet the 2006 revised PM 2.5 NAAQS within three years of designation. Delays in implementing the 1997 NAAQS could lead to a push for direct implementation of the 2006 standards. The EPA is accelerating its review of particulates NAAQS in response to a court decision challenging certain aspects of the standards. Changes to the standards are targeted for proposal by February 2011 and finalization by October 2011. The EPA is accelerating its review of particulates NAAQS in response to a court decision challenging certain aspects of the standards. Potential risk reduction estimates and initial staff recommendations suggest the evidence supports further strengthening of the NAAQS for fine particulates. The issue of whether particulates NAAQS should be strengthened or not, findings and recommendations included in EPA's assessments, and the implications with regard to the ongoing implementation of the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS will likely be subject to extensive comment and debate. The Clean Air Act allows the EPA Administrator discretion in determining nonattainment area boundaries based on NAAQS violations. States and tribes provide initial designation recommendations to the EPA for consideration. Governors must submit a list of nonattainment areas to the EPA. The EPA Administrator has discretion to modify nonattainment area boundaries based on NAAQS violations. States and tribes provide initial recommendations, but final determination rests with EPA. PM 2.5 designations are made using federally referenced monitoring data. EPA began developing fine particle monitoring methods in 1997 with funding from FY1998-FY2000 appropriations. The EPA worked with states and tribes to deploy a network of 1,200 monitors starting in January 1999, with most monitors in place by January 2000. Data collected from 2000-2002 was used for recommendations, and final PM 2.5 designations were made in January 2005. EPA's guidance included factors for determining attainment with the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS and recommended using consistent boundaries for nonattainment areas for PM 2.5 and eight-hour ozone standards. Many PM 2.5 nonattainment areas were expected to overlap with eight-hour ozone designations. The EPA recommended using Metropolitan Statistical Areas or Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas as the \"presumptive boundary\" for nonattainment areas under the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS, which do not have severity-based classifications like PM 10 and ozone. Determining nearby source areas contributing to nonattainment was recognized as complex. The CAA does not mandate combining neighboring counties in the same nonattainment area but requires the use of metropolitan statistical area boundaries in more polluted regions. Statistical Areas are used as the \"presumptive boundary\" for nonattainment areas under the 1997 PM 2.5 standards. Metropolitan areas are treated as units to prevent sprawl development and influence pollution levels. EPA has discretion to expand nonattainment areas and combine separate areas into larger units. EPA combined nonattainment counties across state lines into larger units based on metropolitan areas for the 1997 PM 2.5 standards. Some states disagreed with EPA's final designations, resulting in nonattainment designations for 244 counties in 21 states and the District of Columbia by June 2004. EPA notified affected states as required by statute. The EPA's final PM 2.5 designation rule, published in January 2005, established nonattainment, unclassifiable, and attainment/unclassifiable areas. 47 areas with 225 counties were designated as nonattainment, 5 areas with 7 counties as unclassifiable, and the rest as attainment/unclassifiable, reflecting minor modifications from the June 2004 proposal. The EPA's final PM 2.5 designation rule in January 2005 made minor modifications to the June 2004 proposal. 19 counties were removed from the nonattainment areas list, and some counties were redefined by designating only specific locations within the county as nonattainment. EPA considered factors and additional information to determine nonattainment areas based on significant sources of emissions. In some cases, nonattainment areas were designated even if they were not contiguous with the rest of the area, based on legally recognized government boundaries. The EPA's final PM 2.5 designation rule in January 2005 made minor modifications to the June 2004 proposal, removing 19 counties from the nonattainment areas list and redefining some counties by designating specific locations within the county as nonattainment. The final designations were based on monitoring data from 2001-2003, with provisions for states to submit 2004 data for consideration by February 22, 2005. EPA could withdraw a nonattainment designation if additional data warranted a change. On April 14, 2005, EPA published a final supplemental rule amending initial final designations for PM 2.5 NAAQS. Eight areas comprising 17 counties were changed to \"in attainment\" based on 2002-2004 data. Four areas previously \"unclassifiable\" were changed to \"attainment.\" EPA denied six petitions for reconsideration of nonattainment designations. The EPA finalized nonattainment designations for the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS in various counties across multiple states. By August 2008, 39 areas with 205 counties were designated as nonattainment, affecting a population of nearly 90 million. The EPA determined that a three-county area in Pennsylvania had achieved attainment status based on monitoring data. The final designated nonattainment areas for the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS were concentrated in central, mid-Atlantic, and southeastern states, as well as in California. Over 2,900 counties in 30 states have been designated attainment/unclassifiable. Some groups argue that 150 additional counties should be designated nonattainment. Areas can be re-designated based on future air quality data. Areas initially designated nonattainment may be reclassified as attainment based on updated monitoring data. Several areas previously designated nonattainment for the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS now meet the air quality standards based on certified monitoring data. EPA has suspended certain requirements for these areas, as long as they continue to meet the standard. As of June 2010, 19 out of 39 areas were in attainment with the standard. Based on a preliminary assessment of air quality monitoring data from 2006 to 2008, the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS were found to be in attainment. Nationally, PM 2.5 concentrations were lower in 2008 compared to 2001. EPA reported that most monitoring sites showed a decline or little change in PM 2.5 concentrations, with specific sites in California, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Utah, and West Virginia showing the greatest decreases. In 2008, PM 2.5 concentrations decreased at most monitoring sites across the United States. Some sites in Arizona, California, Georgia, Montana, Virginia, and Washington had levels above the 2006 standards. Despite overall progress, nearly 37 million people still lived in counties with high PM 2.5 levels. In 2008, nearly 37 million people lived in counties exceeding PM 2.5 air quality standards. States must develop plans to achieve compliance with the standards within a specified deadline. SIPs include pollution control measures implemented by federal, state, and local governments. The EPA published findings in 2009 that three states failed to meet the deadline for submitting complete SIPs. States with areas that received final clean data determinations are not subject to the final action. Georgia, Illinois, and Pennsylvania missed deadlines for submitting plans for nonattainment areas. The EPA published findings in 2009 that Georgia, Illinois, and Pennsylvania failed to submit complete State Implementation Plans (SIPs) for nonattainment areas. If acceptable plans are not submitted within 18 months, states will face sanctions, including emission offset requirements for new or modified sources. EPA will impose sanctions if a complete submission is not made within 6 months after the offset sanction is imposed. The EPA published findings in 2009 that Georgia, Illinois, and Pennsylvania failed to submit complete State Implementation Plans (SIPs) for nonattainment areas. If acceptable plans are not submitted within 18 months, states will face sanctions, including emission offset requirements for new or modified sources. Sanctions will also apply in designated nonattainment areas if a complete submission is not made within 6 months after the offset sanction is imposed. EPA will promulgate a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) if the required SIP is not submitted and approved within 2 years of the finding. Compliance with the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS was required by April 2010 for states with nonattainment areas, unless an extension was granted. EPA's final rule in April 2007 outlined the implementation plan requirements for achieving and maintaining attainment of the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS. The implementation rule for achieving and maintaining attainment of the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS included provisions for demonstrating attainment, submitting SIPs, and addressing transportation-related emissions. Legal challenges were filed against the EPA's rule, triggering conformity determinations for new or revised SIPs. The CAA, Section 176(c) requires conformity for federal funding and approval of highway and transit projects to align with air quality goals in a SIP. Conformity applies within one year of an area being designated as nonattainment. EPA has established rules for transportation conformity, including criteria for PM 2.5 nonattainment areas. The EPA established criteria and procedures for transportation conformity in PM 2.5 nonattainment areas, including the consideration of PM 2.5 precursors. Final rules were published in 2005 and 2006, addressing local particle emissions in nonattainment areas. Despite challenges, all PM 2.5 nonattainment areas have completed their initial transportation conformity determinations. The EPA published a final rule in 2010 amending transportation conformity regulations to incorporate changes in PM 2.5 air quality standards. The rule addresses issues related to hot-spot analyses and pollution from upwind areas in nonattainment areas. The transport of PM 2.5 particles can travel long distances from their source, contributing to nonattainment in downwind areas. The Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) aimed to address interstate pollution from electric generating units. EPA can classify areas for attainment dates and consider pollution control measures under Subpart 1 of the CAA. Areas can also petition for controls on upwind sources under \u00a7 126 of the CAA. The D.C. Circuit Court's decision in July 2008 to vacate the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) shifted focus to \u00a7 126 petitions for addressing interstate transport of pollutants. EPA has never granted a \u00a7 126 petition as outlined by the statute, denying North Carolina's 2004 petition due to CAIR being deemed a better mechanism for addressing interstate pollution. The EPA requested the D.C. Circuit Court to remand North Carolina's petition for reconsideration after the CAIR lawsuit was decided. Delaware and New Jersey also filed \u00a7 126 petitions for emission controls on electric generating units in other states. EPA proposed the \"Transport Rule\" in August 2010 to replace CAIR. EPA has requested extensions for rulemaking on the Delaware and New Jersey petitions. The \"Transport Rule,\" proposed in August 2010, aims to replace the current CAIR and reduce the impact of transported emissions on downwind states by requiring reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions in 24 jurisdictions. EPA provides grants to state air pollution agencies to support their programs, although there is no specific grant program for nonattainment areas. Other sources of funding are also available. States can obtain funding for projects to help meet NAAQS through the Department of Transportation's CMAQ program, authorized by Congress under SAFETEA-LU. The program funds projects for air quality improvements and congestion mitigation, including reducing CO and ozone. The CMAQ program funds projects to reduce carbon monoxide and ozone concentrations based on state population and pollution needs. States with no maintenance or nonattainment areas for CO or ozone are guaranteed a minimum of 0.5% of funds each year. The program was expanded to include projects targeting particulate concentrations under TEA-21. Events like the D.C. Circuit Court's decision in 2008 have impacted the implementation of the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS. The D.C. Circuit Court's decision in 2008 affected the implementation of the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS. EPA's final 2006 revisions of the PM NAAQS, designation of nonattainment areas in 2009, and actions on the eight-hour ozone NAAQS also impact implementation. EPA has started the periodic review of the PM NAAQS and plans to propose changes by February 2011. Congress is paying attention to these issues. EPA's Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) aims to reduce interstate transport of fine particulate matter and ozone. The Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) was seen as crucial for addressing interstate pollution from electric generating units hindering downwind states from meeting ozone and PM 2.5 standards. The U.S. Court of Appeals vacated CAIR in 2008 but later allowed it to remain in effect until a new rule is established by the EPA. The EPA published a proposed \"Transport Rule\" to replace the CAIR, which faced challenges in court. Some argued it was not strong enough to address pollution from upwind sources, while others said it would disproportionately affect certain operations. The court's decision in July 2008 would have vacated the entire CAIR. The court's July 11, 2008 decision would have vacated the entire CAIR rule and remanded it to the EPA. EPA modeled emissions impacts of 37 eastern states on 62 downwind counties for the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS, finding 23 states and DC contributing significantly to nonattainment. EPA predicted that implementing CAIR would help 17 areas reach attainment by 2010, while 19 areas would remain in nonattainment. The EPA analyses showed that implementing CAIR would help 17 areas reach attainment by 2010, while 19 areas would remain in nonattainment. Local and state emission reduction efforts were deemed crucial. EPA's SIPs guidance indicated that CAIR would meet the interstate transport provision of the CAA. Litigation on CAIR was ongoing, but states covered under the rule chose to participate in trading programs for SO2 and NOx. States under CAIR participated in trading programs for SO2 and NOx, with some also implementing direct control programs. The D.C. Circuit's decision to vacate CAIR in 2008 was a setback for meeting air quality standards. States relied on CAIR's emission reductions for compliance, which may need to be revised. EPA's Director of Atmospheric Programs testified that states in the CAIR region heavily relied on CAIR for emission reductions to meet air quality standards. The D.C. Circuit's decision to vacate CAIR in 2008 was a setback for meeting air quality standards. Current and pending SIPs from downwind states may need to be revised to achieve emission reductions previously required by CAIR. States are required to impose controls on sources of pollution that contribute significantly to downwind nonattainment or interfere with air quality standards in other states. This provision has been widely disregarded in the past, but can be challenged through CAA \u00a7 126 petitions. The EPA has never granted a \u00a7 126 petition as a means of addressing interstate transport of air pollutants. Reconsideration of the court's decision to vacate CAIR in 2008 was requested by the EPA and various groups, but success is unlikely. Granting a rehearing requires a majority vote of the active duty judges on the D.C. Circuit. In November 2008, new legal briefings were filed regarding the vacating of CAIR. The U.S. Department of Justice supported a rehearing but preferred a stay for implementation of a replacement rule. In December 2008, the D.C. Circuit reversed its decision to vacate CAIR, allowing EPA to develop a new rule while keeping the original decision intact. The court stated that there is no simple solution to make CAIR acceptable. The future of the regional cap-and-trade approach in CAIR is uncertain. The court found fatal flaws in CAIR and did not impose a specific deadline for EPA to develop a replacement rule. States missed deadlines to submit SIPs for the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS. Continued reliance on CAIR for reductions poses challenges for EPA. The EPA's reliance on CAIR for reductions is debated, with current requirements remaining in effect. The agency is working on a Transport Rule to replace CAIR, expected to be finalized by late spring 2011. In 2006, EPA revised the particulates NAAQS based on a review of scientific studies, which could impact the implementation schedule for the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS. The EPA's modifications to the particulates NAAQS tightened the standards primarily by strengthening the daily standard for PM 2.5 from 65 \u00b5g/m3 to 35 \u00b5g/m3 in 2006. This resulted in more areas being classified as \"nonattainment\" and requiring new controls on particulate matter. States and local governments must develop new plans to address emissions in areas that do not meet the 2006 particulate standards. EPA finalized designations for 31 areas in 18 states for nonattainment of the revised 2006 24-hour PM 2.5 standard in November 2009. The EPA finalized designations for nonattainment of the 2006 PM 2.5 standard in November 2009, with 150 counties nationally exceeding both the 24-hour and annual standards. The final designation rule for the 2006 PM 2.5 NAAQS was delayed for review by the current Administration. The EPA finalized designations for nonattainment of the 2006 PM 2.5 standard in November 2009, with 150 counties nationally exceeding both the 24-hour and annual standards. The final designation rule, initiated in response to regulatory review memos, became effective on December 14, 2009. States have three years to submit State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to meet the revised PM 2.5 NAAQS by 2014, with EPA projecting SIP submissions in November 2012. States were required to submit SIPs in November 2012 and meet the new PM 2.5 standard by November 2014 (or 2019 with an extension). Compliance with the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS was due by April 2010, unless granted an extension. Stakeholders debated moving directly to implementing the 2006 standards due to delays. The 2006 particulates NAAQS faced challenges, with a court decision in February 2009 partially granting petitions and remanding the standards to the EPA for further consideration. The court decision in February 2009 partially granted petitions and remanded the 2006 particulates NAAQS standards to the EPA for further consideration. This prompted renewed interest in PM NAAQS among members of Congress. The final area designations for the 2006 PM 2.5 NAAQS were delayed, with the effective date set for December 14, 2009. EPA plans to propose any changes to the standards by February 2010 and finalize them by October 2011. The draft EPA assessments suggest strengthening the NAAQS for fine particulates to reduce mortality risk and protect from high peak concentrations. CASAC members agree on the need for stricter PM 2.5 standards. The issue of whether particulate NAAQS should be strengthened will likely spark debate and comments. The D.C. Circuit's decision in July 2008 to vacate CAIR raised the issue of a multi-pollutant strategy for the electric utility industry. This strategy would involve consistent emissions caps through emission trading, potentially reducing PM 2.5 concentrations. However, questions remain about whether multi-pollutant legislation should supplement or replace current regulations, and how stringent emission caps should be. The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Clean Air and Nuclear Safety discussed key issues related to the CAIR in July 2008 and July 2010. Questions included the stringency of emission caps, inclusion of carbon dioxide in control programs, authority for market-oriented approaches, and comprehensive revision of the CAA to address various environmental issues. The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Clean Air and Nuclear Safety discussed key issues related to the CAIR in July 2008 and July 2010. Congress could consider legislative options to provide EPA with authority to implement cost-based approaches to address NAAQS. EPA's final nonattainment designations for the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS impacted 39 areas in 20 states and the District of Columbia. The 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS implementation faced uncertainty due to the U.S. Court of Appeals decision in July 2008. EPA projected that CAIR and other federal measures would help meet the standards. The court's ruling temporarily reinstated CAIR until EPA develops a replacement rule, allowing the implementation of the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS to continue. EPA is finalizing an alternative to CAIR, raising concerns about the ongoing implementation of the standards. Revisions to the NAAQS for particulate matter in 2006 tightened the PM 2.5 standards, leading to more areas being designated as nonattainment. Some stakeholders suggest implementing the 2006 PM 2.5 standards sooner to avoid delays in reducing exposures to PM 2.5, while opponents argue that following the 2006 schedule would further delay benefits. States must meet the new standard within five years of nonattainment designations, with possible extensions. Delays in finalizing designations for the 2006 PM 2.5 NAAQS have pushed back the effective date. The 2006 PM 2.5 NAAQS implementation has been delayed due to controversies and judicial challenges. While some areas have come into attainment, many states and cities remain in nonattainment. EPA is expediting the review of PM NAAQS in response to court decisions. The final phase of implementing the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS has faced delays due to expired deadlines, legal challenges, and lack of a national monitoring network. Stakeholders, interest groups, and Congress are likely to continue debating this issue. The timeline for implementing the NAAQS reflects key milestone dates driven by statutory requirements. The 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS implementation faced delays due to monitoring data availability and statutory deadline revisions in the TEA-21. The TEA-21 required states to submit PM 2.5 designation recommendations within one year of receiving three years of data meeting federal protocols. EPA had to finalize designations by December 31, 2005. The monitoring data was phased in from 1999 to 2000, leading to staggered availability. To streamline coordination, EPA set a single deadline for state recommendations and final designations. Governors had until February 15, 2004, to submit recommendations, and EPA had until December 31, 2004, to finalize designations. The delay in establishing a monitoring network for the 1997 NAAQS standards was a result of Congress amending the CAA in the FY2004 omnibus appropriations. The standards were challenged in District Court by various groups, with a Supreme Court decision in February 2001 overturning an initial ruling in favor of the plaintiffs."
