    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"No Subsidies Without Verification Act of 2014\". Congress finds that the final rule implementing the ACA no longer verifies eligibility for premium tax credits, relying on self-attestation and sample audits instead. The Department of Health and Human Services announced a change in policy to extend the sample population to 100 percent for verifying eligibility for Obamacare premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions. Failure to verify eligibility could result in approximately $250 billion in fraudulent payments. The final rule allows the Department to offer verification procedures for States establishing a State-based program. The House of Representatives passed legislation, H.R. 2775, the No Subsidies Without Verification Act, with bipartisan support to ensure verification of eligibility for Obamacare premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions before issuance. The House of Representatives passed H.R. 2775 with bipartisan support. The Obama Administration opposed the bill, stating it was unnecessary as an effective verification system was already in place. The Senate later removed the bill on October 16, 2013. On October 16, 2013, the Senate replaced the verification mechanism of H.R. 2775 with a requirement for a report to Congress by the Secretary of Health and Human Services by January 1, 2014. The Department of Health and Human Services submitted the mandated report to Congress on that date, focusing on verifying information for insurance affordability programs. The Exchange verifies consumer information for eligibility in health plans and subsidies under the ACA. Federal subsidies have been available since 2014 to help individuals purchase health insurance through premium tax credits and cost-sharing. The Department of Health and Human Services delayed income verification systems to boost sign-ups on healthcare.gov. Internal parts of the website are unfinished, leading to a lack of verification for subsidy claims. This creates a risk of fraudulent claims and financial burden on taxpayers. Delaying ACA premium and cost-sharing subsidies until eligibility verification process is complete. The premium tax credit and reduced cost-sharing under the ACA will not be allowed until the verification process for household income and coverage requirements is completed. The verification process for an individual's information under the ACA must be completed before imposing any penalty under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. No penalty will be imposed if a premium tax credit is being claimed for the individual and the verification process is not yet completed. The process described in subsection (a) has been completed for the individual's claim. The provisions of this section apply to coverage months starting after the enactment of this Act. Individuals currently receiving subsidies may have certain subsidies suspended if claimed before the enactment of this Act. The Act suspends allowances for individuals who received credits or reductions before the enactment date until the coverage month specified. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a 45-day special enrollment period for individuals to enroll in qualified health plans after completing the verification process. The Act suspends allowances for individuals enrolled in qualified health plans under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act before the enactment date, who terminated enrollment during the suspension period. The Act suspends allowances for individuals enrolled in qualified health plans under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act before the enactment date, who terminated enrollment during the suspension period and seeks to enroll in a qualified health plan after the verification process."
