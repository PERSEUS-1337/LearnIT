In early November 2002, the U.S. expelled four Cuban diplomats in response to a espionage case involving a Defense Intelligence Agency analyst spying for Cuba. Cuba denied their involvement in intelligence activities. Additionally, a U.S. Food & Agribusiness Exhibition was held in Havana in September 2002, featuring exhibitors from over 30 states. On July 24, 2002, the House approved the FY2003 Treasury Department appropriations bill containing amendments easing Cuba embargo restrictions. President Bush suspended the right to file lawsuits against those benefitting from confiscated U.S. property in Cuba. Cuba's National Assembly approved amendments to the Constitution reaffirming socialism as irrevocable. Fidel Castro's speech at the National Assembly raised concerns. Fidel Castro's speech at the National Assembly raised concerns about a potential mass migration exodus. However, Cuban and U.S. officials emphasized the importance of maintaining migration accords. The Senate approved a resolution supporting the Varela Project for political change in Cuba. Hearings were held on Radio and TV Marti by the House International Relations Committee's Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights, and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Peace Corps, and Narcotics Affairs discussed the issue of Cuba. On May 6, 2002, Under Secretary of State John Bolton stated that the United States believes Cuba has a limited offensive biological warfare research effort and has provided dual-use technology to other rogue states. Secretary of State Powell emphasized that the Administration had not claimed Cuba had biological weapons. President Bush announced a new initiative on Cuba on May 20, 2002, to reach out to the Cuban people. Former President Jimmy Carter visited Cuba for six days on May 12, 2002. Former President Jimmy Carter visited Cuba for a six-day trip in May 2002, where he raised human rights issues and addressed them on Cuban television. The Cuban government released political prisoner Vladimiro Roca early from his 5-year sentence. Additionally, a provision in the 2002 Farm Bill that would have eliminated restrictions on U.S. private financing of agricultural sales to Cuba was not included in the final report. The UN Human Rights Council passed a resolution urging Cuba to improve its human rights record. Ana Montes, a former DIA analyst, pleaded guilty to spying for Cuba. The Cuban government proposed bilateral agreements on drug-interdiction, migration, and terrorism cooperation. Cuba faced economic hardship after losing Soviet assistance from 1989-1993. Cuba experienced severe economic decline from 1989-1993, with growth rates fluctuating in the following years. Despite initial predictions, growth was lower than expected due to various factors such as poor sugar production, drought, and natural disasters. The economy rebounded in 1999 and 2000, but growth slowed in 2001 due to external events like Hurricane Michelle and the September 11 terrorist attacks impacting the tourist industry. The terrorist attacks and Hurricane Michelle severely affected Cuba's tourist industry and economy in 2002. Low world prices for sugar and nickel, a decline in tourism, and Venezuela's suspension of oil shipments also contributed to the economic downturn. A flat economic growth rate of 0% is forecast for 2002, with a rate of 3.2% forecast for 2003. Concerns about oil supplies from Venezuela arose due to an oil strike and political turmoil. Cuba's achievements in health and education, with a literacy rate of 94% and high life expectancy, have been notable. Cuba's achievements in health and education are notable, with a literacy rate of 94% and a high life expectancy of 76 years. Despite economic decline, the country has the lowest infant mortality rate in Latin America. Policy changes since 1993 have allowed Cubans to use U.S. dollars and engage in self-employment in various occupations. Cuban economic reforms since 1993 have included authorizing self-employment in over 150 occupations, breaking up large state farms into smaller agricultural cooperatives, opening agricultural and artisan markets, allowing private food catering, approving a new foreign investment law, and establishing free trade zones. Despite the establishment of free trade zones with tariff reductions in June 1996 and banking system reforms in May 1997, many Cubans still face challenges such as low wages, high prices, shortages of basic goods, and power outages. The government's regulations and new taxes have made it difficult for self-employed individuals, leading to closures of businesses. Foreign investors have also faced difficulties, with some complaining about deals being backed out of or being forced out of business. Fidel Castro has ruled Cuba since the 1959 Revolution, establishing an authoritarian Communist regime. The Constitution enacted in 1976 solidified the Communist Party's control, with power centralized in a Politburo led by Castro. Executive power is held by a Council of Ministers. The Cuban government is structured with executive power vested in a Council of Ministers led by Fidel Castro as President. Legislative authority lies with a National Assembly of People's Power with 601 members, meeting twice annually. The Cuban Communist Party reaffirmed its commitment to a single-party state during its 5th Congress in 1997, reelecting Fidel and Raul Castro as party secretaries. Direct elections for the National Assembly have been limited, with voters not offered a choice of candidates. The Cuban government, led by Fidel Castro, declared socialism irrevocable in a national referendum in 2002. Despite poor human rights record, with restrictions on basic rights, dissent crackdowns, and arrests of activists, the government remains oppressive. Since the Pope's 1998 visit, government attacks on dissidents have continued. Human rights groups estimate 249-300 political prisoners in Cuba, charged with various offenses. The number of prisoners has decreased due to more short-term detentions. Arbitrary arrests and detentions are routine according to the State Department's 2001 report. The 2001 report highlighted the Cuban government's arbitrary arrest and detention of human rights advocates. Prominent political prisoner Vladimiro Roca was released early from a 5-year sentence in 2002. Roca, along with three other leaders, had been convicted of \"sedition\" in 1999. The Cuban government detained human rights advocates and activists to prevent coverage and protest of a trial. Dissidents criticized the Cuban Communist Party and urged against voting in elections and foreign investment. Roca vowed to work for dialogue in Cuba upon his release. Another political prisoner, Biscet, was released in 2002 but jailed again after a human rights demonstration. Amnesty International highlighted political prisoners detained in Cuba in 2002, including Leonardo Bruz\u00f3n Avila, Carlos Alberto Dom\u00ednguez Gonz\u00e1lez, Emilio Leyva P\u00e9rez, and L\u00e1zaro Miguel Rodr\u00edguez Capote. The U.S. Department of State called for the release of Bruz\u00f3n Avila due to his deteriorating health from a hunger strike. The Varela Project, a human rights initiative in Cuba, gathered signatures for a national plebiscite advocating for human rights, amnesty for political prisoners, private enterprise, and electoral law changes. The Varela Project in Cuba, led by Oswaldo Paya, gathered signatures for a national referendum advocating for human rights, amnesty for political prisoners, and electoral law changes. Former President Jimmy Carter praised the project's significance in promoting peaceful change through direct voting by Cubans. The Cuban government responded to the Varela Project with its own referendum in June 2002, amending the Constitution to declare Cuba's socialist system irrevocable. The US Senate and House expressed support for the Varela Project, urging a peaceful transition to democracy. The UNCHR called on Cuba to cooperate with investigating human rights but Cuba refused. The UNCHR annually approved resolutions condemning Cuba's human rights record, but in 1998, the resolution sponsored by the United States was rejected. Despite this, resolutions criticizing Cuba's human rights record continued in the following years without appointing a Special Rapporteur. In 1999, the UNCHR resolution was approved by a close vote. In 2000, a similar resolution was passed with more support. In 2001, a resolution sponsored by the Czech Republic and co-sponsored by other nations, including the United States, was approved. Mexico abstained but expressed concerns about human rights in Cuba. In 2002, a resolution calling on Cuba to improve its human rights record was approved by the UNCHR. In 2002, a resolution was passed by the UNCHR calling on Cuba to improve its human rights record. The resolution was supported by several Latin American nations, with Brazil and Ecuador abstaining, and Venezuela voting against it. Cuba criticized Uruguay for sponsoring the resolution and accused Mexico of supporting it. Cuba was also urged to allow a visit by a representative of the U.N. High Commission for Human Rights. Observers are divided over the future of the Castro government, with some believing its demise is imminent due to Castro's age, while others argue that reports of its collapse are exaggerated. Cuba's strong security apparatus and controls on dissidents, along with support from the elite, suggest Castro may remain in power for years. The future of the Castro government is uncertain, with some predicting its imminent downfall due to Castro's age, while others believe reports of its collapse are exaggerated. Despite some support for Castro and the social benefits of the Cuban revolution, building a stable democratic Cuba after Castro will be challenging due to the lack of independent civil society and political opposition. U.S.-Cuban relations deteriorated in the 1960s when Castro established a repressive communist dictatorship and aligned with the Soviet Union. The tense U.S.-Cuban relationship is highlighted by events such as the Bay of Pigs invasion, the Cuban missile crisis, Cuban support for insurgencies, the Mariel boatlift, the 1994 exodus, and the 1996 shootdown of U.S. planes. U.S. policy towards Cuba has mainly involved economic sanctions since the 1960s. The U.S. policy towards Cuba has primarily consisted of economic sanctions, strengthened by the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 and the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996 (Helms/Burton legislation). These laws prohibit trade with Cuba and impose sanctions on those trafficking in U.S. property confiscated by the Cuban government. The U.S. policy towards Cuba includes economic sanctions, with laws like the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 and the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996 imposing trade restrictions and sanctions on those involved in trafficking confiscated U.S. property. President Clinton suspended the implementation of Title III, which holds accountable those involved in trafficking U.S. property, in U.S. federal court. Additionally, support measures for the Cuban people include humanitarian donations, democracy-building efforts, and U.S.-sponsored radio and television broadcasting to Cuba. Changes to U.S. policy after the Pope's 1998 visit to Cuba included the resumption of direct flights and cash remittances for close relatives. In January 1999, President Clinton announced measures to support the Cuban people, including broadening cash remittances, expanding direct passenger charter flights from more U.S. cities, and loosening travel restrictions for certain categories of travelers. President Bush announced his Administration's policy towards Cuba in May 2001, stating opposition to weakening sanctions until political prisoners are freed and democratic elections are held. He also supported efforts for democratic change in Cuba, enforcing the embargo while suspending Title III of the Helms-Burton legislation. On July 13, 2001, he directed the Treasury Department to enhance enforcement capabilities. President Bush continued to suspend the Title III provision of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, citing efforts by European countries and U.S. allies for democratic change in Cuba. He also announced a new initiative on Cuba with measures to reach out to the Cuban people. President Bush announced a new initiative on Cuba with four measures to assist the Cuban people, including humanitarian aid, direct assistance, scholarships for Cuban students, and calls for free and fair elections. He also urged Cuba to adopt market-based reforms for potential easing of trade and travel bans, with full normalization of relations contingent on democratic reforms. President Bush's new initiative on Cuba includes measures like humanitarian aid, direct assistance, scholarships for Cuban students, and calls for free and fair elections. The President stated that economic sanctions and travel bans to Cuba will continue until the Cuban government proves its commitment to real reform. Former President Jimmy Carter visited Cuba in 2002, raising human rights issues during his six-day visit. Former President Jimmy Carter criticized Cuba's one-party rule and called for democracy, respect for human rights, and improved U.S.-Cuban bilateral relationship during his visit in 2002. He also advocated for the Varela Project and urged Cuba to allow the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit Cuban prisons. Former President Jimmy Carter urged Congress to lift the embargo on Cuba, citing it as a barrier to improving bilateral relations. The Bush Administration, however, maintained the embargo as a crucial part of American foreign policy. Various approaches have been proposed over the years to promote democracy and human rights in Cuba. Some advocate maintaining pressure on Cuba while supporting the Cuban people. Others suggest lifting some sanctions and engaging in dialogue. There are also calls for swift normalization of U.S.-Cuban relations by lifting the embargo. Advocates for loosening sanctions argue that increased travel, trade, and dialogue could lead to peaceful reform in Cuba. The importance of avoiding violent change in Cuba is stressed, with concerns about a mass exodus to the United States and involvement in a civil war scenario. Supporters of changing policy highlight international support for lifting the U.S. embargo, missed business opportunities, and increased suffering of the Cuban people. Proponents argue for consistency in policies with remaining Communist governments and advancing human rights. Opponents maintain the current two-track policy of isolating Cuba while reaching out. The U.S. policy maintains a two-track approach towards Cuba, isolating the country while supporting the Cuban people. The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996 outlines steps for Cuba to normalize relations with the U.S. Opponents argue that softening sanctions without Cuban reforms would benefit the Castro regime. They believe in the effectiveness of sustained sanctions and point out Cuba's failed economic policies. Opponents argue that Cuba's failed economic policies, not the U.S. embargo, are the causes of the economy's decline. Legislative initiatives in the 107th Congress reflected divergent views on U.S. policy toward Cuba, covering issues like human rights and drug interdiction cooperation. Several bills aimed to strengthen sanctions on Cuba, including H.R. 160 prohibiting debt forgiveness until Russia closes its intelligence facility in Cuba. H.R. 2292 (Rothman) proposes amending the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act to require Cuba to extradite U.S. fugitives. Some Members support legislation providing increased support to the democratic opposition in Cuba. Measures to ease U.S. sanctions on Cuba were also introduced in the 107th Congress. During the 107th Congress, there were discussions about easing sanctions on Cuba, including amendments to the FY2002 Treasury Department appropriations bill and the \"Farm Bill\" to allow private financing of agricultural sales to Cuba. The House approved a provision to restrict travel to Cuba but rejected a measure to lift the overall U.S. embargo on Cuba. Ultimately, the travel provision was not included in the final bill. During the 107th Congress, discussions were held on easing sanctions on Cuba. The House approved amendments to the FY2002 Treasury Department appropriations bill regarding Cuba sanctions. The Senate provision was not included in the final bill. In July 2002, the House approved amendments on Cuba sanctions in the FY2003 Treasury Department appropriations bill. The Senate version included a provision to prohibit funds from enforcing Treasury Department regulations on travel. During the 107th Congress, a bipartisan group formed a Cuba Working Group to shift U.S. policy towards engagement with Cuba. The group criticized Cuba's lack of free elections and basic freedoms but argued that current U.S. policy has not led to meaningful reform in Cuba. They proposed nine recommendations for U.S. policy towards Cuba, including repealing the travel ban, allowing exports of agricultural and medical products, and ending restrictions on remittances. The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act (P.L. 104-114) was enacted into law on March 12, 1996, codifying existing Cuban embargo Executive Orders and regulations without providing a presidential waiver. This limits U.S. policy options towards Cuba, affecting future administrations' ability to make changes. Title III allows U.S. nationals to sue for trademark licenses used in connection with confiscated assets in Cuba. Title III of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act allows U.S. nationals, including Cuban Americans who became U.S. citizens after their properties were confiscated, to sue for money damages in U.S. federal court against those involved in trafficking confiscated property in Cuba. The President can delay implementation for 6 months at a time if it serves the national interest. Title IV denies entry to the U.S. for aliens involved in the confiscation or trafficking of U.S. property in Cuba, including corporate officers, shareholders, and family members. Title III of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act allows U.S. nationals to sue for damages against those involved in trafficking confiscated property in Cuba. President Clinton suspended the right to file suits for 6-month periods, with liability for trafficking becoming effective on November 1, 1996. This put foreign companies in Cuba on notice of potential lawsuits and liability in the United States. President Clinton and President Bush have suspended the right to file Title III lawsuits in relation to confiscated property in Cuba, citing efforts by America's allies to promote democracy in Cuba. President Bush has continued to suspend implementation of Title III at six-month intervals. Additionally, the State Department has banned executives and their families from three companies for their investment in confiscated U.S. property in Cuba under Title IV of the legislation. Three companies have faced action for investing in confiscated U.S. property in Cuba: Grupos Domos, Sherritt International, and BM Group. Grupos Domos disinvested in 1997, making its executives eligible to enter the U.S. STET avoided action by paying ITT Corporation $25 million. Sol Melia, a Spanish hotel company, was investigated for investing in confiscated property in Cuba. Settlement efforts were ongoing by the end of the year. Foreign allies, including Canada, Japan, Mexico, and EU nations, criticized the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act for allowing foreign persons to be sued in U.S. court. The EU challenged the Helms/Burton legislation at the WTO as an extraterritorial application of U.S. law. The EU-U.S. understanding on the Helms/Burton legislation was reached on April 11, 1997, with agreements to promote democracy in Cuba and develop investment protection principles. The EU suspended its WTO dispute case and let its challenge expire in mid-April 1998. Talks on investment disciplines were challenging, but a second understanding was reached on May 18, 1998. The EU and the United States reached a second understanding on May 18, 1998, regarding investment in expropriated properties worldwide. Future investment in expropriated property would be barred, and government support for past illegal expropriations would be denied. A Registry of Claims would be established to warn investors and government agencies. Opposition to the agreement by some senior Members of Congress has prevented any amendment of Title IV. Opposition from senior Members of Congress has stalled any changes to Title IV regarding the EU-U.S. understanding on investment in expropriated properties. Some members criticize the agreement for not covering companies already invested in expropriated property and proposing weak sanctions. However, others support the understanding, stating it enhances protection for Americans' property worldwide and deters investment in illegally confiscated property in Cuba. The Bush Administration considered legislation for a presidential waiver but faced challenges, as noted during the June 2001 U.S.-EU summit. Several legislative initiatives introduced in the 107th Congress aimed to repeal the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, including H.R. 174, H.R. 798, H.R. 2662, and S. 400. Additionally, H.R. 5616 proposed to sunset the Helms/Burton legislation by March 21, 2003. Another challenge in the WTO involved a dispute between Pernod Ricard and Bacardi Ltd. Pernod Ricard and Bacardi Ltd. are in a dispute over the Havana Club rum trademark. A provision in a 1999 appropriations measure prevents the US from accepting payment for trademarks used in Cuba without the original owner's consent. Pernod Ricard wants to protect its future distribution rights in the US. Bacardi started selling rum under the Havana Club label in the US. After Bacardi began selling rum in the United States under the Havana Club label, PernodRicard's joint venture unsuccessfully challenged Bacardi in U.S. federal court. The EU initiated a WTO dispute settlement panel in June 2000, claiming that the U.S. law violates the Agreement on TRIPS. The WTO panel ruled that a portion of the law prohibiting U.S. courts from recognizing Cuban trademarks is in violation of international rules on intellectual property rights. The WTO appeals panel ruled that Section 211 violated WTO provisions on national treatment and most-favored-nation treatment, requiring the United States to amend the law. The United States agreed to amend Section 211 to comply with WTO rules by January 3, 2003. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 allows for one-year export licenses for shipping food and medicine to Cuba, but no U.S. government assistance or financing is available. Transactions must be conducted in cash in advance or with financing from third countries. Travel to Cuba is authorized under a specific license. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 allows for one-year export licenses for shipping food and medicine to Cuba, but no U.S. government assistance or financing is available. Travel to Cuba is authorized under a specific license, despite restrictions on financing for sales. U.S. agribusiness companies are exploring the Cuban market for potential future sales, while Cuba initially refused to buy agricultural products from the United States due to financing restrictions. However, after Hurricane Michelle in November 2001, Cuba changed its policy and began purchasing agricultural products from the U.S. Cuba began purchasing agricultural products from the United States in late 2001, after Hurricane Michelle, despite initial disapproval of U.S. financing restrictions. Over $100 million worth of products, including grains, eggs, frozen chicken, corn, and apples, have been purchased from U.S. companies since then. Several U.S. companies, including Archer Daniel Midland, American Rice Inc., Cargill Corporation, and others, have sold agricultural products to Cuba since late 2001. A U.S. Food & Agribusiness Exhibition in Havana in September 2002 resulted in nearly $100 million in additional contracts for U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba. In March 2002, the State Department revoked visas of Cuban officials, raising concerns about future agricultural sales to Cuba. In April 2002, Senator Byron Dorgan expressed concern that the State Department's policy was discouraging food sales to Cuba. Secretary of State Powell stated that the visa for Alvarez should not have been issued due to his lobbying against US policy. Despite opposition to easing restrictions, recent sales to Cuba have occurred, including after Hurricane Michelle. Since the Cuban Democracy Act in 1992, the US has licensed over $4.3 billion in humanitarian donations to Cuba. Opponents fear easing sanctions would support the Castro regime, while supporters argue restrictions harm Cuban health. Opponents of easing sanctions on Cuba believe it benefits Castro by providing a scapegoat for his failed policies and political repression. U.S. agribusiness companies support lifting trade restrictions to access a $700 million market. Legislative initiatives in the 107th Congress focused on easing restrictions on food and medical exports to Cuba, including lifting private financing restrictions for agricultural sales. In July 2002, an amendment was approved in the House to prevent funds in the FY2003 Treasury Department appropriations bill from being used for this purpose. The Moran amendment, H.Amdt. 554, prohibits the use of funds in the bill for sanctions on private sales of agricultural commodities or medicines to Cuba. This could prevent the Treasury Department from enforcing restrictions on private financing for sales to Cuba. The Senate version of the bill did not have a similar provision. The 2002 \"Farm Bill\" in the Senate aimed to lift financing restrictions but was not included in the final bill. The Bush Administration opposes lifting financing restrictions for Cuba due to human rights concerns and terrorism. The Senate report noted potential market access for U.S. exporters without government funds. Despite a House vote in favor, the provision was not included in the final bill. Several Senators are interested in adding it to the FY2003 agriculture legislation. Several Senators are interested in adding a provision to the FY2003 agriculture appropriations bill. During Senate consideration, an amendment conditioning the lifting of restrictions on private financing of agricultural sales to Cuba on a presidential certification regarding terrorism was tabled. Another amendment, conditioning the lifting of restrictions on fugitive felons in Cuba, also fell. In May 2002, Senator Dorgan offered an amendment during Senate consideration of trade promotion authority legislation. Senator Dorgan offered an amendment, S.Amdt. 3439, to permit private financing of agricultural sales to Cuba, but withdrew it on May 21, 2002, to avoid jeopardizing TPA legislation. Other legislative initiatives aimed at lifting restrictions on private financing of agricultural sales to Cuba were also introduced. Additionally, S. 1017 and H.R. 2138, the Bridges to the Cuban People Act of 2001, sought to ease restrictions on food and medical exports to Cuba. On June 19, 2002, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Peace Corps, and Narcotics Affairs held a hearing on S. 1017, a bill that would allow for the export of agricultural commodities, medicines, medical supplies, medical instruments, and medical equipment to Cuba. Several other bills aimed at lifting sanctions on trade, financial transactions, and travel to Cuba were also introduced. The Cuba travel ban has been a contentious issue in U.S. efforts to isolate the communist government of Fidel Castro. Arguments for lifting the ban include influencing conditions in Cuba, protecting the rights of Americans, and the ability to travel to other countries with authoritarian governments. Arguments against lifting the ban suggest that American tourist travel would support Castro's rule. The House approved an amendment to prohibit spending on administering Treasury Department regulations restricting travel to Cuba. The amendment would prohibit funding to administer the Cuban Assets Control Regulations with respect to any travel or travel-related transaction. The Flake amendment, approved by a vote of 240 to 186, aimed to restrict spending on administering Treasury Department regulations on travel to Cuba. Senator Dorgan considered offering a similar amendment but decided against it to avoid delaying the bill. The issue of Cuba travel restrictions was further discussed in the second session of the 107th Congress by a bipartisan House Cuba working group. In February 2002, the Senate held a hearing on travel restrictions to Cuba. Secretary of State Colin Powell and Secretary of the Treasury Paul O'Neill stated they would recommend a veto on legislation easing travel restrictions. In July 2002, the House approved an amendment on easing travel restrictions offered by Representative Jeff Flake. The House approved the Flake travel amendment (H.Amdt. 552) by a vote of 262-167, preventing funds from being used to enforce Treasury Department regulations on travel to Cuba. The amendment does not affect the issuance of travel licenses to Cuba. Some question the limited impact of the amendment as underlying embargo regulations remain unchanged. Additionally, two Cuba amendments were rejected during consideration of H.R. 5120. The Rangel amendment (H.Amdt. 555) to prevent funds from enforcing the economic embargo of Cuba, including travel, was rejected. The Goss amendment (H.Amdt. 551) to limit funds for travel restrictions to Cuba until certain conditions were met was also rejected. The Senate version of the Treasury Department appropriations measure included a similar provision. The Senate bill included a provision to prevent funds from enforcing Treasury Department regulations on travel to Cuba, while allowing OFAC to issue licenses for travel. Another initiative, H.R. 5022 (Flake), aimed to lift all restrictions on travel to Cuba but was not acted upon in the 107th Congress. Several bills introduced in Congress aim to lift restrictions on travel to Cuba, including H.R. 5022 (Flake) which would remove all restrictions on travel to Cuba. Other bills such as H.R. 174 (Serrano), S. 400 (Baucus), and H.R. 798 (Rangel) seek to lift sanctions on trade and financial transactions with Cuba. Additionally, S. 1017 (Dodd) and H.R. 2138 (Serrano) propose easing travel restrictions for U.S. nationals to Cuba. Bills like S. 402 (Baucus) and H.R. 797 (Rangel) aim to repeal travel restrictions imposed in the 106th Congress. Several bills introduced in Congress aim to lift restrictions on travel to Cuba and sanctions on trade and financial transactions with the country. Some Members of Congress wanted Cuba to be added to the list of major drug transit countries due to concerns about drug trafficking through Cuban waters and airspace, but the Clinton Administration decided against it citing lack of clear evidence. President Bush also addressed drug-producing countries in a determination made on November 1, 2001. President Bush noted a shift in suspect air traffic from Cuban airspace to Hispaniola in his 2001 determination of drug-producing or drug-transit countries. Cuba has expressed concerns about drug transit and has implemented measures to combat the issue, including stricter penalties for traffickers and cooperation with other countries on anti-drug efforts. Cuba has bilateral counternarcotics agreements with 29 countries. Cuba has bilateral counternarcotics agreements with 29 countries and informal arrangements with 12 others. The United States has cooperated with Cuba on anti-drug efforts since the 1970s, with increased cooperation since 1999. In 1996, Cuban authorities cooperated with the US in seizing 6.6 tons of cocaine aboard a ship bound for Miami. Cuba hosted a regional counternarcotics conference in 2001 focusing on drug abuse prevention and trafficking strategies. Cuba and the United States have been improving anti-drug cooperation since the 1970s. In 2000, Cuba accepted an upgrade in communication with the U.S. Coast Guard and stationed a Coast Guard officer in Havana. This led to increased coordination between the two governments. Cuba has requested further cooperation and a bilateral anti-drug agreement. In 2002, Cuba deported a U.S. fugitive and arrested a Colombian drug trafficker. The Drug Enforcement Administration head expressed appreciation for Cuba's actions in 1992, but cooperation will continue on a case-by-case basis, not through a bilateral agreement. State Department spokesman mentioned the need for Cuba to demonstrate willingness for more formal structure in law enforcement issues. However, Cuba has not shown commitment, as there are still fugitives from U.S. justice provided safe haven by the Cuban government. Cooperation level is unlikely to significantly increase given the Administration's position. Some Members call for greater cooperation with Cuba on drug trafficking, viewing Cuba's proposal as a good-will gesture. In the second session of the 107th Congress, legislative initiatives diverged on Cuba and counternarcotics cooperation with the United States. The Senate bill proposed $3 million for preliminary work on cooperation with Cuban agencies on counter-narcotics, contingent on the President certifying Cuba's procedures for protecting innocent life during interdiction. In the 107th Congress, there were legislative initiatives regarding Cuba and counternarcotics cooperation. The Senate proposed funding for cooperation with Cuban agencies on counter-narcotics, contingent on certification of Cuba's procedures for protecting innocent life during interdiction. The 107th Congress proposed funding for counternarcotics cooperation with Cuba, contingent on certification of Cuba's procedures for protecting innocent life during drug interdiction. The House version of the bill did not include the Cuba drug cooperation, but the conference report called for a report on Cuba's involvement in illegal drug trafficking and encouraged exchanging drug-related law enforcement information with U.S. agencies. The 107th Congress proposed funding for counternarcotics cooperation with Cuba, contingent on certification of Cuba's procedures for protecting innocent life during drug interdiction. H.R. 2506, signed into law as P.L. 107-115 on January 10, 2002, included provisions for increased cooperation between the U.S. and Cuba on drug interdiction efforts. Additionally, legislation was introduced to authorize the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy to negotiate with Cuban officials for further cooperation. Several U.S. fugitives from justice, including Joanne Chesimard, Charles Hill, Michael Finney, and Victor Manuel Gerena, are currently in Cuba. In the 107th Congress, legislation was introduced to amend the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996 to require Cuba to extradite U.S. fugitives, including Joanne Chesimard. Representative Smith offered an amendment during consideration of the FY2002 Treasury Department appropriations bill. Cuba reportedly showed interest in negotiating mutual extradition of fugitives with the U.S., such as Orlando Bosch. In the FY2002 Treasury Department appropriations bill, an amendment was proposed to prohibit funds from being used to enforce travel restrictions to Cuba until the Cuban government released political prisoners and extradited U.S. fugitives. The amendment was later modified to remove the certification requirement for political prisoners and fugitives. Cuba deported fugitives Jesse James Bell and William Joseph Harris to the United States. In December 2001, the Cuban government deported William Joseph Harris, wanted on child abuse charges. In March 2002, Cuba also arrested convicted drug trafficker Rafael Bustamante. Cuba has a history of supporting revolutionary movements but changed its policy in 1992 due to economic decline after the breakup of the Soviet Union. Cuba remains on the State Department's terrorism list. According to the State Department's report, Cuba provides safe haven to Basque ETA terrorists, Colombian insurgent groups, and IRA members. Cuba also harbors U.S. fugitives and has been indecisive about the war on terrorism since September 11. Castro has vacillated over the war on terrorism, signing U.N. counterterrorism conventions but also criticizing the U.S.-led war on terrorism. Despite offering support after 9/11, Castro described the U.S. response as \"fascist and terrorist\" and warned against establishing \"unrestricted tyranny.\" The Cuban government had a muted reaction to the U.S. decision to send captured Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters to Guantanamo Bay. Guantanamo has been a U.S. base since 1903, housing detainees from over 30 countries. Despite objecting to the U.S. presence as a national security threat, Cuba has not opposed the new mission of housing detainees from Afghanistan. Defense Minister Raul Castro noted the unlikely event of a prisoner escape. On September 17, 2002, a State Department official accused Cuba of impeding U.S. anti-terrorist efforts by setting up false leads. Cuba denied the allegations and has been a target of terrorist incidents in the past. Two Salvadorans were sentenced to death for bombings in March 1999, while three Guatemalans received prison terms in January 2002. Cuban officials claim Cuban exiles funded the bombings. In December 2002, a Cuban spy infiltrating a Cuban American group was shot in Havana by an anti-Castro paramilitary group. The Senate rejected an amendment in December 2001 that would have lifted restrictions on private financing of agricultural sales to Cuba. Cuba's involvement in developing biological weapons is a recent controversy. The United States believes Cuba is involved in developing biological weapons and has provided dual-use technology to rogue states. Officials have called on Cuba to cease cooperation and comply with the Biological Weapons Convention. This belief is not based on new information according to Secretary of State Powell. Powell stated that the US believes Cuba has the capacity for biological weapons research but clarified they hadn't claimed Cuba possessed such weapons. Some saw this as contradicting Under Secretary Bolton. The Cuban government denied the allegations, accusing the Bush Administration of using them to justify their policies amidst growing momentum in the US to ease the embargo. Former President Jimmy Carter criticized the Bush Administration over the allegations during his trip to Cuba. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Peace Corps, and Narcotics Affairs held a hearing on Cuba's biological weapons effort, distinguished from a program by Assistant Secretary of State Carl Ford. Ford stated that Cuba has an effort, not a program, involving research and development for biological weapons. U.S. government concerns about Cuba's capability in this area date back several years. Cuba's biotechnology industry, developed since the 1980s, has raised concerns about its potential to produce biological weapons. The industry has produced vaccines and drugs, with some products exported internationally. In 1999, a British pharmaceutical company partnered with Cuba to test and market a meningitis vaccine. The FBI has made arrests in recent years related to this issue. The FBI has arrested and convicted Cuban intelligence agents in the United States, including members of the \"Wasp Network\" sentenced for espionage. The Cuban government is working for the return of the convicted spies, who are considered \"Heroes of the Republic.\" Additionally, two U.S. government officials have been implicated in spying for Cuba. In May 2000, Miami official Mariano Faget was arrested for passing classified information to a friend with ties to Cuba, leading to the expulsion of a Cuban diplomat. In September 2001, Defense Intelligence Agency analyst Ana Montes was arrested for spying for Cuba, supplying classified information for 16 years. Montes pled guilty in March 2002 and was sentenced to 25 years in prison in October 2002. In response to an espionage case, the U.S. expelled four Cuban diplomats, denying their involvement in intelligence activities. Radio and TV Marti, U.S.-government sponsored broadcasting to Cuba, aims to support the Cuban people's right to information and serve as a reliable source of accurate news. TV Marti and Radio Marti are U.S.-government sponsored broadcasting programs aimed at providing accurate news and information to the Cuban people. TV Marti broadcasts for four and a half hours daily, while Radio Marti broadcasts 24 hours a day on short and medium wave channels. The Broadcasting Board of Governors oversees these programs, which were previously under the United States Information Agency until its functions were merged into the Department of State. The Broadcasting Board of Governors oversaw U.S.-government sponsored broadcasting programs like Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, Radio Free Asia, and Office of Cuba Broadcasting. Legislation required the relocation of OCB to Miami, completed in 1998. Radio and TV Marti faced controversies and funding cuts due to Cuban jamming efforts. Various studies and audits have been conducted on these programs. Since FY1984, Congress has allocated nearly $407 million for broadcasting to Cuba, with $249 million for Radio Marti and $158 million for TV Marti. Critics argue that TV Marti is only seen by Cubans visiting the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, with the Cuban government easily jamming the broadcasts at a fraction of the cost. Supporters of continued TV Marti funding argue that eliminating it would send a message to the Cuban people that the United States is not committed to freedom in Cuba. They believe that cutting TV Marti would be giving in to the dictatorial Castro government, which suppresses information flow in Cuba. Supporters argue that cutting TV Marti funding would signal a lack of commitment to freedom in Cuba and give in to the suppressive Castro government. The Clinton Administration requested $23.456 million for broadcasting to Cuba in FY2001, including funds for a new transmitter for Radio Marti. The H.R. 4942 conference report, signed into law in December 2000, provided $22.046 million for radio and television broadcasting to Cuba. The FY2002 State Department Appropriations measure fully funded the Administration's request with $24.872 million for broadcasting to Cuba, including a failed attempt to eliminate funding for TV Marti. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act for FY2002 and FY2003 approved $25 million for broadcasting to Cuba each fiscal year. It also authorized $750,000 for transmission facility enhancements in Belize to evade Cuban jamming. The bill eliminated staff positions from the Advisory Board for Cuba Broadcasting. The Bush Administration requested $25.362 million for broadcasting to Cuba in FY2003. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $24.996 million for Cuba broadcasting in FY2003. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act for FY2003 authorized $25.923 million for Cuba broadcasting. The President signed the measure into law on September 30, 2002 as P.L. 107-228. The U.S. Agency for International Development has provided assistance to increase information flow on democracy, human rights, and free enterprise to Cuba through various U.S.-based NGOs. Funding for Cuba projects has increased over the years, with $6 million requested for FY2003. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $24.996 million for Cuba broadcasting in FY2003. The House Appropriations Committee supported the Administration's request for $6 million for promoting a peaceful transition to democracy in Cuba in FY2003. Concerns were raised about the Russian signals intelligence facility at Lourdes, Cuba, which allows Russia to monitor U.S. communications. The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act includes a provision to reduce U.S. assistance for Russia by an amount equal to support provided for intelligence facilities in Cuba. The legislation restricts assistance to Russia unless a presidential waiver is granted for national security reasons and assurance that intelligence from the Lourdes facility is not shared with Cuba. H.R. 160 aims to withhold debt forgiveness until the Lourdes facility is closed, similar to a previous bill in the 106th Congress. On October 17, 2001, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the closure of the Lourdes facility, which was met with approval from President Bush. Cuba criticized Russia's move as they had not agreed to the pullout. The Cuban government plans to turn the facility into a computer science university with 2,000 resident students. In 1994 and 1995, Cuba and the United States reached migration accords to prevent mass exodus of Cubans by boat. In 1994, amidst an exodus of Cubans by boat, President Clinton changed U.S. migration policy to take rescued Cubans to Guantanamo Bay. Talks between Cuba and the U.S. led to a bilateral agreement on September 9, 1994, to stem the flow of Cubans fleeing by boat. In 1994, amidst a Cuban exodus by boat, the United States and Cuba agreed to facilitate safe migration to the U.S. The U.S. committed to a minimum of 20,000 legal Cuban migrants annually, excluding immediate relatives of U.S. citizens. A policy change discontinued granting parole to all Cuban migrants reaching the U.S., while Cuba agreed to prevent unsafe departures. In May 1995, an accord was reached to parole over 30,000 Cubans at Guantanamo into the U.S. and intercept future sea migrants, returning them to Cuba. Both countries pledged joint cooperation. Since the 1995 migration accord, the U.S. Coast Guard has intercepted thousands of Cubans at sea, returning them to Cuba or transferring those at risk to Guantanamo for asylum in a third country. Tensions in South Florida rose after a 1999 incident involving the U.S. Coast Guard. In a 1999 incident, the U.S. Coast Guard used a water cannon and pepper spray to prevent six Cubans from reaching Surfside beach in Florida, prompting outrage from the Cuban-American community and Members of Congress. President Clinton called the incident \"outrageous\" and unauthorized. Another incident on July 9, 1999, resulted in the drowning of a Cuban woman when a boat being interdicted by the Coast Guard capsized. The State Department expressed regret and announced investigations into possible alien smuggling. The Cuban government has imposed prison sentences of up to three years for individuals engaging in alien smuggling. As of early July 2002, Cuba reported arresting over 130 immigrant smugglers since 1998, with potential sentences of up to three years for alien smuggling. U.S. prosecution of migrant smugglers in Florida has increased, with a focus on Cuban migration policy highlighted by the Elian Gonzalez case in late 1999 to mid-2000. The case involved a five-year-old boy found off the coast of Fort Lauderdale, leading to legal battles over his custody between his relatives in Miami and his father in Cuba. In June 2000, after legal appeals, a boy returned to Cuba with his father, Fidel Castro orchestrated mass demonstrations. The case stirred emotions in Cuba and South Florida. In a speech on June 26, 2002, Castro hinted at a possible mass exodus. Cuban and U.S. officials emphasized the importance of maintaining migration accords despite tensions. In 1996, Cuban fighter jets shot down two planes in the Florida Straits. In 1996, two Cessna 337s were shot down by Mig-29 fighter jets in the Florida Straits, resulting in the death of four members of the Cuban American group Brothers to the Rescue. President Clinton authorized compensation for the victims' families from frozen Cuban assets, and a U.S. federal judge awarded $187.6 million to three families who sued under the Antiterrorism Act of 1996. Cuba refused to recognize the court's jurisdiction. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations measure (P.L. 105-277, H.R. 4328) could have affected the payment of the December 1997 judgment from Cuba's frozen assets in the United States. The provision stipulates that foreign states are not immune from U.S. judgments for violations of international law, with a presidential waiver for national security interests. The Clinton Administration opposed the provision, while supporters argued it would ensure justice for nations found guilty in U.S. courts. The Clinton Administration agreed to pay compensatory damages to relatives of shootdown victims using frozen Cuban assets in the United States, totaling almost $97 million. This was in accordance with the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000. In 1994, the Clinton Administration paid compensatory damages to relatives of shootdown victims using frozen Cuban assets, totaling almost $97 million. By the end of 2001, about $112 million in Cuban assets in the United States remained frozen. P.L. 106-113 enacted H.R. 3194, which appropriated funds for Cuba broadcasting and included provisions for investigating violations of freedom of expression by Cuba. The text discusses provisions in various Acts related to Cuba, including funding for broadcasting, reporting requirements on drug trafficking, and restrictions on assistance to Cuba. It also mentions compensatory damages for claims against Cuba and Iran. President Clinton waived payments for damages against Cuba and Iran in the interest of national security when he signed the bill into law on October 28, 2000. The bill also terminates unilateral sanctions on food and medical exports from countries classified as state sponsors of international terrorism, including Cuba, allowing one-year licenses for exports without U.S. financing. The House and Senate expressed concerns about human rights abuses in Cuba, calling for international support and the establishment of the rule of law for the Cuban people. The Senate approved a resolution expressing the need for a UNCHR resolution criticizing Cuba's human rights abuses and appointing a Special Rapporteur. This was included in the appropriations bill for the District of Columbia government, providing funding for radio and television broadcasting to Cuba. Additionally, the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill for FY2002 contained provisions prohibiting assistance to Cuba. The House committee report supports a $5 million budget request for promoting democracy in Cuba. The bill was introduced on July 17, 2001, passed by the House on July 24, 2001, and signed into law on January 10, 2002. H.Res. 91 condemns the Cuban government's human rights abuses. The House of Representatives passed a bill (H.R. 1646) in 2001 to assist the Cuban people and improve human rights in Cuba. The bill also aimed to condemn the Cuban government for its human rights abuses and appoint a Special Rapporteur for Cuba. The bill authorized funding for a mobile library in Cuba. The bill authorized $70,000 annually for a mobile library at the United States Interests Section in Cuba for dissidents and democracy activists. Additionally, $6,000 was allocated for the Office of the Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression in the Western Hemisphere of the Organization of American States to investigate violations of freedom of expression by the Cuban government. The Security Assistance Act of 2002, passed by the Senate, did not include these provisions. H.R. 5410 (Kolbe)/ S. 2779 (Leahy) Foreign Operations Appropriations FY2003 included a $6 million request for a Cuba democracy program.

H.R. 5737 (Ros-Lehtinen) posthumously revokes the naturalization of Eriberto Mederos for alleged torture against political prisoners in Cuba. S.Res. 272 (Nelson) also supports the Varela Project. S.Res. 272 (Nelson) expresses support for the Varela Project in Cuba and urges the President to back the citizens' right to petition for a referendum and a peaceful transition to democracy.

The lifting of restrictions on private financing of agricultural sales to Cuba is conditioned on a presidential certification that Cuba is not a state sponsor of international terrorism. Senator Torricelli's amendment, which would have required the return of convicted felons living as fugitives in Cuba to the US for incarceration, was not passed. The Andean Trade Preference Expansion Act was passed by the House and Senate, allowing for trade promotion authority legislation.
