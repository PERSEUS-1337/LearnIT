    "content": "The Act titled \"Coastal State Renewable Energy Promotion Act of 2008\" amends the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 to include provisions for state ocean and coastal renewable energy planning. This involves conducting surveys, identifying renewable energy sites, and planning for their development. The Act allows grants to coastal States for surveys of coastal and Federal waters to identify areas suitable for renewable energy projects. Surveys include hydrographic, bathymetric, and oceanographic elements. The Act allows grants to coastal States for surveys of coastal and Federal waters to identify areas suitable for renewable energy projects, including identification of significant marine ecosystems, existing marine uses, shore and offshore locations for renewable energy development, and other necessary matters. Coastal States are encouraged to facilitate participation in surveys by relevant Federal agencies and State entities. The Act allows grants to coastal States for surveys of coastal and Federal waters to identify areas suitable for renewable energy projects. Surveys will be conducted by various relevant agencies and stakeholders to develop a comprehensive survey. The Secretary will publish guidelines for grant applications and use within 180 days. Grants may be awarded annually from 2009 to 2012, not exceeding $750,000 per fiscal year. Coastal States must demonstrate the use of grants for renewable energy surveys meeting specified requirements. The Secretary will not require State matching funds for grants awarded before fiscal year 2011. After fiscal year 2011, coastal States must provide matching fund contributions for surveys of coastal waters, with varying Federal-to-State contribution ratios. No matching funds are needed for surveys of Federal waters adjacent to a State's coastal zone. After an initial grant is made to a coastal State under this section, subsequent grants are contingent on satisfactory survey development. Coastal States are limited to receiving grants for a maximum of 3 fiscal years. This section does not grant new authority to coastal States or override existing Federal agency regulations on renewable energy facilities in the outer Continental Shelf. Priority consideration for renewable energy development areas identified in surveys developed with assistance under this section. Federal agencies must avoid areas identified as unsuitable to the maximum extent practicable. The Secretary shall provide technical assistance to coastal States for survey development and encourage other relevant Federal agencies to assist. In this section, the term 'renewable energy' includes wind, wave, current, tidal, or ocean thermal energy. Authorization of appropriations for grants under section 306B is amended to provide necessary funds. Other Federal agencies are encouraged to participate in providing technical assistance."
