    "title": "SB 249",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Legislature finds that border crossers from Mexico have a significant economic impact on California, accounting for $4,005,000,000 in benefits and 67,000 jobs annually. Border wait times at the San Ysidro Port of Entry cause a loss of 8,000,000 trips and nearly $1,003,000,000 in revenue in the San Diego region alone. Additionally, future increases in wait times could result in an additional $1,000,000,000 in costs and a loss of 134,000 jobs for the binational border region. After 9/11, the federal government implemented the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) to streamline entry for US citizens and foreign visitors, while enhancing border security. The WHTI required travelers to present identity and citizenship documents when entering the US, with full implementation in 2009 for land and sea travel. The Legislature must address border wait times to protect California's economy and jobs. The federal government approved the use of an enhanced driver\u2019s license (EDL) for cross-border travel, which contains RFID technology for faster processing at land and sea ports of entry. EDLs can be used in Ready Lanes for travelers with RFID-enabled documents. The use of an EDL as an RFID-enabled travel document is already implemented in several states, leading to faster border processing and decreased wait times by 30 minutes on average. This initiative benefits the state economically and enhances border security. The Legislature intends that obtaining an enhanced driver's license should be voluntary. If California partners with a federal agency to issue enhanced licenses, employers cannot require employees to get one for employment or retaliate against those who refuse. Chapter 8 of the Vehicle Code allows the department to enter into agreements with federal agencies to issue enhanced driver's licenses and identification cards that comply with federal travel requirements. Prior consultation with relevant parties is required before entering into any agreements. The department may issue an initial enhanced driver\u2019s license, provisional license, or identification card to a person who is 16 years or older, a resident of the state, and a US citizen. The applicant must provide proof of identity, residency, and citizenship as required by federal law. The applicant must also certify the accuracy of the information provided. The department must provide a protective shield when issuing an enhanced driver\u2019s license, provisional license, or identification card to prevent remote reading of information without the holder\u2019s knowledge. The applicant must sign a declaration acknowledging understanding of radio frequency identification technology. The license or card must include security measures to prevent unauthorized duplication or cloning and protect against unauthorized disclosure of personal information. The enhanced driver\u2019s license, provisional license, or identification card must include radio frequency identification technology with security measures to protect information. The technology should only contain necessary information for border crossing and may be suspended, revoked, or restricted. An applicant for an initial enhanced driver\u2019s license, provisional license, or identification card must have their photograph and signature captured by the department. All privacy and security laws related to driver\u2019s licenses apply to enhanced licenses. The department verifies applications and may require additional information for identity, residency, and citizenship. The department may deny an application for an enhanced driver\u2019s license, provisional license, or identification card if not satisfied with the application's authenticity or truthfulness. Copies of documents provided will be retained, along with the applicant's photograph and reason for denial for at least one year, unless fraud is suspected, in which case retention will be for at least 10 years. The California Public Records Act exempts the required documents from public disclosure. Information submitted shall not be disclosed to a foreign nation. An additional nonrefundable application fee is required for enhanced driver\u2019s license, provisional license, or identification card issuance or renewal, set by the department not to exceed $55. Fees collected go to the Motor Vehicle Account for implementation. The department must provide an annual report to specified committees on the issuance of licenses and cards, impact on wait times, and any security breaches. Federal information is only reported if received. The Legislature adds Section 15402 to the Vehicle Code, limiting public access to private information submitted for driver's licenses. Individual privacy outweighs public disclosure. The Legislature adds Section 15402 to the Vehicle Code, limiting public access to private information submitted for driver's licenses. No reimbursement is required by this act as it creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes penalties, within the meaning of the Government Code."
