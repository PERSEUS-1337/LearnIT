The Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 is amended to establish the Minority Serving Institution Digital and Wireless Technology Opportunity Program. This program aims to assist eligible institutions in acquiring digital and wireless networking technologies to enhance educational services. Eligible institutions can use grants for equipment, networking capability, and software. The Minority Serving Institution Digital and Wireless Technology Opportunity Program aims to enhance educational services by providing networking technology, training programs, and professional development for teachers and individuals seeking to improve technology skills. The program aims to enhance technology skills for educational purposes, including using digital and wireless networking technology in the classroom. It also provides capacity-building technical assistance and fosters the use of technology to improve research and education in various subjects. Eligibility for grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts is based on application and review procedures. To apply for funding, eligible institutions must submit an application to the Under Secretary detailing how the funds will be used, including acquiring digital and wireless networking technology. The institution must also outline plans to ensure accessibility and utilization of the technology by students, faculty, and administrators. The Under Secretary, in consultation with an advisory council, will review applications. The Under Secretary will establish procedures for reviewing applications for funding and will publish application requirements and review criteria in the Federal Register. An advisory council will be established to advise on encouraging participation in the program and reviewing proposals. The Under Secretary will consult with relevant organizations to ensure diversity on the advisory council. Experts in digital and wireless networking technology will also be consulted. Review panels will assess the quality of proposals from eligible institutions. The Under Secretary will ensure diverse representation on review panels evaluating proposals from eligible institutions for grants, agreements, or contracts. Conflict of interest will be avoided in the review process. The Under Secretary will convene annual meetings with eligible institutions to promote collaboration and capacity-building activities. Eligible institutions must agree to a matching requirement for costs incurred in carrying out the program. The Under Secretary requires eligible institutions to provide non-Federal contributions equal to one-quarter of the grant amount or $500,000, whichever is less. The matching requirement can be waived for institutions with no endowment or an endowment below $50,000,000. Eligible institutions seeking funding under this subsection must not exceed $2,500,000 in grants, agreements, or contracts. Consortia can include various entities such as State agencies, education institutions, and businesses, including minority businesses. The Under Secretary may provide funds for strategic plans to implement grants, agreements, or contracts to promote institutional diversity and prioritize institutions with the greatest need for funding. Annual report and evaluation are required from institutions that receive grants, agreements, or contracts to promote institutional diversity. The Under Secretary will contract with the National Academy of Public Administration for an independent assessment within 6 months of the enactment of this subsection. The program requires periodic assessments once every 3 years to evaluate its effectiveness in improving education, training, and access to digital technology at eligible institutions. The National Academy of Public Administration conducts assessments on networking technology for students, faculty, and staff at eligible institutions, evaluates established procedures, and makes recommendations for program improvement. The Under Secretary transmits the assessment reports to Congress upon completion of each independent assessment. The Secretary transmits assessment to Congress with a summary of plans to implement recommendations from the National Academy of Public Administration.
