    "content": "On June 30, 1999, U.S. and Canadian officials signed a new comprehensive agreement to resolve disputes and implement conservation principles of the 1985 Pacific Salmon Treaty. Resource management studies and joint-fishery restrictions were used to protect wild salmon stocks and ease tensions between the two nations. The agreement's Annex IV outlines fishery regimes for managing Pacific salmon, with discussions starting in 2005 for its renegotiation. The 1999 Agreement established abundance-based fishing regimes for Pacific salmon fisheries under the jurisdiction of the PST, created regional restoration and enhancement endowment funds, and included provisions to enhance bilateral cooperation and improve the scientific basis for salmon management. Discussions for the renegotiation of Annex IV began in 2005. Since the 20th century, salmon fisheries in the United States and Canada have faced fluctuations in catch and stock abundance, leading to concerns of overharvest. To address this, the Pacific Salmon Treaty (PST) was created in 1985 for cooperative management, research, and enhancement of intercepted Pacific salmon stocks. The Pacific Salmon Treaty (PST) aims to coordinate management of Pacific salmon for sustainable fisheries and maximize long-term benefits. Despite the PST, some salmon stocks continued to decline, straining diplomatic relations between the United States and Canada. Disagreements arose on achieving conservation and harvest-sharing goals, leading to arguments over catch shares and interceptions of depleted stocks. Following the 1992 Pacific Salmon Treaty, the United States and Canada managed their fisheries with the assumption of conservation measures. In 1997, stakeholder talks failed to reach an agreement, leading to the appointment of investigators. Despite some restrictions on fisheries, the lack of a long-term conservation agreement harmed salmon stocks and affected fishing planning and budgeting. The 1999 Agreement aimed to address these issues. The 1999 Agreement was a breakthrough in the unpredictable year-to-year salmon allocations issue. Pacific salmon are highly migratory anadromous fish, spawning in fresh water, migrating to the sea, and returning to their natal rivers to spawn. Six species include Chinook, sockeye, coho, pink, chum salmon, and steelhead trout. Pacific salmon species include Chinook, sockeye, coho, pink, chum salmon, and steelhead trout. Migration patterns vary among the species, with Chinook, sockeye, and coho being of particular interest due to their value to U.S. and Canadian fisheries. Chinook salmon from Oregon coastal rivers and the Columbia River system swim north as juveniles, some migrating as far as northern British Columbia and Alaska. Coho salmon stocks do not migrate as far north, with northern and southern stocks being addressed separately. Sockeye salmon are also important, originating from British Columbia. In the PST, northern and southern coho stocks are addressed separately. Fraser River sockeye salmon exhibit different migration patterns depending on ocean conditions, with El Ni\u00f1o years leading to a more southerly distribution. This results in fishermen from the US and Canada intercepting fish from each other's rivers. Canadian commercial troll fisheries off Vancouver Island often catch Chinook and coho salmon bound for rivers in Oregon and Washington. Salmon migration patterns and interceptions complicate negotiations between the United States and Canada. A 1937 arrangement was made to conserve and divide the harvest of Fraser River sockeye salmon. The Fraser River sockeye pass through U.S. waters as they return to spawn, supporting large fisheries in both countries. Fraser River sockeye supported fisheries in the US and Canada. Canadian fishermen dominated initially, but US purse seine fisheries took over by 1900. A rock slide in 1913 blocked spawning areas, causing a drop in salmon harvest. With US help, the Hell's Gate reach was restored by 1918, allowing sockeye salmon to spawn again. The Fraser River Convention was ratified in 1937 after negotiations between the United States and Canada. It established the International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission to protect and extend sockeye salmon fisheries. The commission aimed to restore sockeye runs and divide catches between U.S. and Canadian fishermen. Regulations were recommended in 1946 to ensure adequate escapement of all salmon races. The 1937 Fraser River Convention aimed to protect and rebuild salmon runs, divide catches between U.S. and Canadian fishermen, and address interception issues. However, disagreements led to its inadequacy, and it took nearly half a century for the convention to be replaced with a more comprehensive institution. In 1985, the United States and Canada replaced the Fraser River Convention with the Pacific Salmon Treaty (PST) for cooperative management of shared Pacific salmon stocks. The PST aims to ensure sustainable fisheries, maximize benefits, and reduce interceptions. The PST established the PSC to make recommendations on salmon fishing management. The Pacific Salmon Treaty (PST) established the Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC) to review fishing activities, advise on fishery status, and suggest adjustments to the regime. The PSC is divided into two national sections with voting structures defined by the Pacific Salmon Treaty Act. The PST's principles aim to prevent overfishing, provide optimum salmon production, and ensure each party receives benefits equivalent to salmon production in its waters. Disagreements have arisen over the interpretation of benefits equivalent to production. Canada interprets benefits equivalent strictly on a fish-for-fish basis, while the United States believes all PST principles must be considered together. Disagreements arise over issues like processing locations and balancing fish habitat protection with development opportunities. The Memorandum of Understanding elaborates on PST elements. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) provides minimal guidance on implementing Article III (1)(b) of the PST, stating that complete implementation may not be possible in the short term. Annual fishery regimes should be conducted equitably, with decisions taking into account changes in benefits. If one country derives substantially greater benefits, adjustments are expected in the long term. The parties are expected to develop a phased program to eliminate inequity in benefits within a specified time period, considering the desirability of reducing interceptions and avoiding disruption of fisheries. Correcting imbalances is a national responsibility and may involve adjusting fishing effort or enhancement projects regionally. Despite a joint commitment to conserve shared salmon stocks, the US and Canada faced diplomatic challenges, leading to a decline in salmon stocks. In the early 1990s, disagreements arose over the equitable sharing of intermingled stocks, leading to various mechanisms being employed to resolve the issue. Government-to-government negotiations and stakeholder panels were established, but ultimately failed to settle the controversy. In 1997, William Ruckelshaus and Dr. David Strangway were appointed to conduct a joint investigation and make recommendations to end the dispute. The report by William Ruckelshaus and Dr. David Strangway in January 1998 contained four specific recommendations to end the controversy over fishing-sharing arrangements for Pacific salmon. These recommendations included adopting interim fishing-sharing arrangements, developing a framework for long-term fishing arrangements, not reconvening the stakeholder process, and reviewing the Pacific Salmon Commission to ensure its functionality. Compromises and establishment of rules were deemed necessary for long-term sustainability of the shared resource. To ensure long-term sustainability of the shared salmon resource, rules must be established for preservation as time is running out. Disparate efforts to protect salmon habitat have led to weak southern stocks and stronger northern stocks. Habitat degradation, including from dams, agriculture, logging, and pollution, has significantly impacted Pacific Northwest Chinook salmon. The framers of the PST did not anticipate the harm caused by non-fishing activities on Pacific salmon. After the long-term harvest agreement expired in 1992, Canada and the United States argued over equitable harvest-sharing and conservation of salmon stocks. Cooperative studies and joint-fishery restrictions helped ease tensions between the two nations in the late 1990s, leading to a long-term conservation and harvest-sharing agreement in 1999. In June 1999, U.S. and Canadian officials signed the 1999 Agreement on Pacific Salmon after years of negotiations. The agreement resolved a long-standing dispute related to Pacific salmon and the Pacific Salmon Treaty Act of 1985. The Pacific Salmon Treaty Act of 1985 defines the composition and voting requirements of the U.S. Section in the Pacific Salmon Commission. The U.S. Section consists of four members, including a non-voting representative of the U.S. government and three voting members from Alaska, Oregon or Washington, and treaty Indian tribes. The U.S. Section aims to make decisions through consensus and operates with a single vote within the Commission. The U.S. Section of the Pacific Salmon Commission may create a Conciliation Board to resolve disputes if consensus cannot be reached. The Secretary of State can refer disputes to the President if international obligations are at risk. The Secretary of Commerce can override state or tribal fishery regulations if they jeopardize fulfilling international obligations. Concerns exist about potential political paralysis within the U.S. Section, unlike the Canadian Section where the federal government decides its position. The U.S. Section of the Pacific Salmon Commission lacks a federal government position, relying on unanimity among its three voting commissioners. Competing interests of Alaska, Washington/Oregon, and treaty tribes have hindered consensus in the past. The absence of penalties for non-resolution and the ability for both countries to fish without an agreed harvest regime contribute to the difficulty in reaching agreements. The U.S. Section of the Pacific Salmon Commission operates by consensus, requiring approval from all voting members for recommendations. The PST's salmon fishing regimes are influenced by the PSC's recommendations. A 1999 agreement between the U.S. and Canada established abundance-based fishing regimes for Pacific salmon fisheries under the PST's jurisdiction, aiming to implement conservation and harvest-sharing principles. The 1999 agreement between the U.S. and Canada established abundance-based fishing regimes for Pacific salmon fisheries under the PST's jurisdiction. Larger catches are allowed when salmon abundance is higher, and catches are constrained in years when stock abundance is lower. Two regional restoration and enhancement endowment funds were created to promote bilateral cooperation, improve fishery management, and aid stock and habitat enhancement efforts. The agreement also focused on enhancing bilateral cooperation, improving the scientific basis for salmon management, and applying institutional changes to the PSC. The 1999 Agreement between the U.S. and Canada focused on conservation and habitat protection for salmon stocks. It renewed cooperation, stabilized management, and implemented abundance-based management to sustain wild stocks and prevent overfishing. This approach set harvest rates relative to stock abundance, providing a framework for sharing conservation burdens and benefits of stock recovery. The 1999 Agreement between the U.S. and Canada focused on conservation and habitat protection for salmon stocks, implementing abundance-based management to sustain wild stocks and prevent overfishing. The parties believed that the new management regimes would be more responsive to natural stock fluctuations and environmentally responsible, requiring an informed pre-season and responsive in-season approach to fishery management. Matching harvest levels to actual salmon abundance reduces overfishing, ineffective live-release practices, and loss of fishing opportunities. Curtailment in fishing would be shared proportionately among fishermen in all areas covered under the agreement. An agreement between the U.S. and Canada focused on managing northern fisheries affecting coho salmon through new chapters in the PST. The agreement covers fishery arrangements for sockeye, coho, Chinook, and pink salmon in rivers flowing from Canada to the Pacific Ocean through southeast Alaska. Compliance with the new fishery regimes satisfies all obligations under the PST principles. The agreement is in effect through 2008, except for Fraser River sockeye, which is in effect through 2010. The United States and Canada established a Transboundary Rivers Panel within the Pacific Salmon Commission to address issues related to the Taku and Stikine Rivers. The agreement focused on managing sockeye and pink salmon fisheries in southeast Alaska and northern British Columbia, with provisions for conservation and fair sharing of salmon stocks. Fixed-catch ceilings were replaced with abundance-based provisions, allowing harvests to vary based on salmon abundance. Noteworthy provisions addressed contentious issues such as Alaska's purse seine fisheries near Noyes Island and Canada's troll fisheries. The 1999 Agreement focused on managing Chinook salmon fisheries in the United States and Canada, addressing concerns about declining populations listed as threatened or endangered. Various factors contributed to the decline, including habitat destruction, dams, and climate change. The conservation-based fishery regimes established by the agreement aimed to support habitat restoration and salmon recovery efforts. The 1999 Chinook salmon regime aimed to manage fisheries in Alaska, Canada, Washington, and Oregon based on abundance rather than fixed-catch quotas. Two types of fisheries were designated: those managed based on aggregate abundance and those managed based on individual stock status. Three fisheries were designated for aggregate abundance-based management: southeast Alaska, northern British Columbia, and west coast Vancouver Island. Each fishery would be managed to achieve a specific harvest. The 1999 Chinook salmon regime established fisheries managed based on abundance levels, with specific harvest rates varying depending on salmon abundance. Different stocks in each fishery led to varying allowable catches, with larger catches permitted during periods of higher abundance. Table 1 in the 1999 Agreement's Annex IV outlined maximum catch targets for the 3 AABM fisheries based on Chinook abundance indices, while other fisheries targeted Chinook salmon through individual stock-based management. The ISBM fisheries in British Columbia and the Pacific Northwest targeted hatchery-produced salmon and species other than Chinook, with a focus on maintaining a 36.5% reduction in fishing mortality on depleted Chinook salmon stocks. The 1999 Agreement allowed flexibility for U.S. and Canadian management agencies to distribute harvest across fisheries to reflect domestic priorities, as long as a 40% reduction in fishing mortality on depleted Chinook salmon stocks was maintained. Additional reductions were required to meet escapement objectives for natural stocks, with some Chinook stocks needing greater reductions for extra protection. The 1999 Agreement included provisions for extra protection of very depleted stocks, with specific conditions for even greater harvest reductions if stocks failed to meet escapement objectives. A total mortality approach to Chinook fisheries was to be implemented by 2002 for more accurate fishery management decisions. The 1999 Agreement introduced incentives to reduce fishing mortality and harvest more selectively, requiring a substantial reduction in the U.S. share of Fraser River sockeye. The reduction was phased in over three years, with the U.S. share in Washington State fisheries eventually set at 16.5% of the total allowable catch. To offset the impact on commercial fishermen, contributions were sought for a fishing vessel license buy-back program. The U.S. federal government contributed to a fishing vessel license buy-back program, resulting in the removal of a significant portion of the Washington sockeye fishery. The sharing rule was altered, with treaty tribes receiving 68% and non-tribal fishermen receiving 32% of the harvest. A conservation-based regime for border area fisheries was developed cooperatively for implementation in 2000. The coho regime was developed in 2000 to establish harvest limits in border area fisheries, aiming to sustainably manage natural coho stocks and improve long-term fisheries prospects in the United States and Canada. The program constrained fishing to enable sustainable harvests, responded to stock status, and provided a predictable framework for fishery impacts. The coho regime, established in 2000, aimed to sustainably manage natural coho stocks in border area fisheries. Certain fisheries were curtailed during times of low abundance to assist conservation efforts. This included closures in Alaskan and Canadian border fisheries based on catch indicators and CPUE levels. Incorporated refinements to provisions for chum salmon fisheries in the Strait of Georgia and Puget Sound, with minor impact on catch allocation but improved effectiveness. Canada agreed to require live release of chum salmon in certain Canadian net fisheries in southern boundary areas during specific times to protect threatened U.S. salmon stocks. Endowment funds established in 1999 Agreement manage science, restoration, and enhancement needs for salmon production. The Northern Boundary and Transboundary Rivers Restoration and Enhancement Fund (Northern Fund) and the Southern Boundary Restoration and Enhancement Fund (Southern Fund) were established to address salmon production needs in different regions. The United States contributed $75 million and $65 million to capitalize the two funds, respectively, over a four-year period. Canada was compensated for U.S. fishermen taking more than their fair share of salmon by the majority capitalization of these funds by the United States. Contributions to the funds can be made by either country or third parties in the future, upon agreement of the parties. The regional funds, managed by bilateral committees, are used to improve resource management, habitat restoration, and wild stock production for Pacific salmon. The 1999 Agreement aimed to enhance scientific information sharing and application for salmon resource management. Staff exchanges were encouraged between the two countries. The 1999 Agreement aimed to enhance scientific cooperation for salmon resource management, including staff exchanges, bilateral workshops, and a Committee on Scientific Cooperation. It emphasized habitat protection and restoration as key to achieving long-term objectives. The 1999 Agreement emphasized habitat protection and restoration as crucial for achieving long-term objectives, including maintaining water quality, improving spawning success, and migration corridors for salmon. The Pacific Salmon Commission reports annually on stocks needing additional measures beyond harvest controls and progress in implementing measures to enhance production, extending the framework to include coordination on habitat protection. The PST framework was extended to include coordination on habitat protection objectives to support stock conservation and rebuilding goals. The Endowment Funds provide capacity for remedial action to enhance freshwater habitat productivity, complementing the PSC's mandate for optimum salmon production coordination. Attention to concerns by Congress, U.S. officials, and fishery managers is crucial for the success of bilateral salmon management under the 1999 Agreement. The 1999 Agreement addressed ambiguity over PST as a separate treaty or supplement, requiring congressional funding. It was determined to be an executive agreement, not needing Senate ratification. $140 million in congressional appropriations were needed for the Endowment Funds, contingent on legislative authority. The 1999 Agreement required $140 million in congressional appropriations for two endowment funds, with funding being crucial for U.S. responsibility towards compensating Canada for salmon harvests. Congress fully funded the endowment funds, allowing for annual expenditures of about $14 million for salmon restoration projects benefiting both countries. In 2006, $7 million was allocated from interest on funds for salmon restoration projects benefiting both the United States and Canada. The 1999 Agreement did not directly address salmon interceptions, leading to skepticism among Canadians about receiving equivalent benefits from salmon production in their waters. The 1999 Agreement between the United States and Canada did not have a mechanism for reimbursement in case of overharvesting. Decision-making within the U.S. Section to the Pacific Salmon Commission requires consensus, which critics argue has been used to hinder rational salmon management. If consensus is not reached and fishing activities threaten salmon conservation, it could be problematic. The U.S. Section's fishing activities threaten salmon conservation, potentially breaching PST obligations. The federal government must take a leadership role to prevent this. Past hesitancy to intervene has strained relations with Canada. Excluding British Columbia from negotiations in the 1999 Agreement was seen as a mistake. The 1999 Agreement should have involved British Columbia due to its significant role in Canadian salmon origins and fishing interests. Cooperation with British Columbia was crucial for rational management of salmon stocks. Some Canadians viewed the Agreement as a sellout of Canadian interests, feeling the United States had historically benefited more in bilateral dealings. The 1999 Agreement between the United States and Canada raised concerns about the unequal outcomes in bilateral dealings regarding salmon management. Canadians felt that the United States had more leverage to address conservation concerns, while Canada lacked the ability to enforce similar restrictions on Alaska. The focus was on how the United States implemented the Agreement, especially regarding funding for Endowment Funds. Canadians did not express strong emotions about the perceived fairness of the Agreement's implementation. The absence of penalties for unresolved disputes between the two parties was also noted. The 1999 Agreement between the United States and Canada did not specify salmon harvest limits, leading to disputes. Canada sought binding arbitration, but the Agreement lacked incentives for resolution. No enforcement mechanism was provided, but no serious disputes have arisen. Technical disputes could have increased under the Agreement. The 1999 Agreement between the United States and Canada did not specify salmon harvest limits, leading to disputes. Canada sought binding arbitration, but the Agreement lacked incentives for resolution. No enforcement mechanism was provided, but no serious disputes have arisen. Abundance-based management relies on accurate science for salmon abundance forecasts, and both nations may benefit from promoting greater objectivity and cooperation among scientists. Canada and the United States have implemented selective fishing methods to target harvestable fish and avoid bycatch of wild or weak stocks. This practice aims to protect threatened and endangered species, minimizing conflicts between fishing and conservation laws. The 1999 Agreement's effects are being evaluated through various measures. The effects of the 1999 Agreement are being evaluated based on conservation, resource sharing, benefits to fisheries, and cultural value. The Department of State measures success by comparing relations with Canada before and after the Agreement, as disputes over Pacific salmon were significant in the 1990s. The 1999 Agreement improved the Pacific Salmon Commission's effectiveness after disputes under the 1985 Treaty. U.S. and Canadian participants now work together constructively, amending fisheries regimes and implementing management plans for salmon conservation. Endowment funds created by the Agreement support salmon initiatives. The 1999 Agreement established endowment funds to support salmon initiatives and improve cooperation between the U.S. and Canada in managing shared salmon stocks. This agreement ended a seven-year dispute and led to the creation of joint committees for scientific cooperation. The PSC provides advice on scientific cooperation and management of transboundary rivers. Discussions have been positive and productive since 1999, with no formal disputes between the US and Canada. The 1999 Agreement established fishing regimes leading to improved relationships and focus on other issues. The PSC processes have allowed parties to focus on cooperative resolution, leading to improved relationships and the ability to devote more time to cooperative analysis. Multi-year regimes have shifted conservation responsibility, with AABM regimes relieving fisheries of stock-specific obligations. Other fisheries must now bear more responsibility for conservation and meeting jeopardy standards for ESA-listed species. The U.S. Congress allocated $20 million each for the Northern and Southern Funds in FY2000, with an additional $40 million in FY2001. This funding was sent to the PSC in late 1999 and early 2000, and then in February 2001. The allocation of salmon harvest between Canada, Alaska, and Washington has led to a reduction in the allowed harvest off the Washington coast. In FY2000, $20 million was allocated for each Fund ($40 million total) and transmitted to the PSC in February 2001. An additional $40 million was authorized for FY2001. Canada also contributed $250,000 to each fund in November 2000. By 2006, the endowment funds were generating $7 million annually for projects in Canada and the United States. Multiple projects were funded involving cooperators from both countries, with benefits shared bilaterally. The 1999 Agreement established Endowment Funds for the Fraser River sockeye fishery, leading to a temptation to use these funds for agency programs due to budget pressures. The agreement shifted conservation responsibility for Chinook salmon to fisheries not managed under AABM regimes, affecting stocks returning to Puget Sound, Washington Coast, and Columbia River. The impact of the ESA was not initially considered during the agreement negotiations. The 1999 Agreement did not anticipate the full effects of the ESA on Chinook management. Canadian WCVI fishery harvest rates for Puget Sound stocks have not been reduced as expected, leading to further restrictions on Puget Sound fisheries. However, the impacts of WCVI fisheries on Snake River fall Chinook have been reduced more than anticipated, allowing for more flexibility in allocating impacts among U.S. fisheries. Chinook bycatch in groundfish fisheries has not been allocated to individual stocks due to lack of necessary data. The lack of data has prevented the allocation of species among individual stocks. Canadian interception of Washington State Chinook salmon is viewed as a trade-off for Alaskan interceptions of Canadian Chinook salmon, leading to Washington salmon fleets feeling denied of a fair harvest opportunity. Washington fishermen believe Canada is managing their ocean Chinook salmon harvest to avoid domestic stocks and target U.S. stocks, which they see as a violation of the existing treaty. Additionally, Washington's ability to harvest Fraser River sockeye and pink salmon is impacted. The ability to harvest Fraser River sockeye and pink salmon in Washington State is constrained by the ESA listing of Puget Sound Chinook. Due to harvest restrictions on Puget Sound Chinook, there is insufficient permissible Chinook bycatch remaining for both treaty and non-treaty commercial fisheries. The renegotiations of Annex IV were envisioned to occur within the PSC process, with optimism for success due to improved cooperation. Most fisheries regimes in Annex IV expired in 2008. The Annex IV fisheries regimes expired in 2008, except for Fraser River sockeye and pink salmon which will expire in 2010. The U.S. proposed a framework to Canada for renegotiation, aiming to bring new regimes into force by the end of 2008. The PSC discussed the proposed framework in October 2006, highlighting positive relations between the two countries on Pacific salmon. Challenges arose from the implementation of the 1985 PST and the 1999 Agreement. The renegotiation of the expiring Annex IV fisheries regimes focused on the challenges of the fishery regime for Chinook salmon, particularly those runs in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and British Columbia. The issues related to the status of certain Chinook salmon runs, including U.S. endangered species listing, posed difficulties for negotiators. The PSC's activities regarding the Habitat and Restoration agreement were also a key concern, with a focus on reporting on natural stocks not at optimum production and addressing factors limiting their production. The PSC has discussed the challenges of renegotiating fisheries regimes for Chinook salmon, with U.S. domestic concerns and Canada's domestic issues influencing the process. Bilateral progress has been limited due to differences within and between the two national sections. At the \"Future of Wild Pacific Salmon\" conference, Chairman James L. Connaughton discussed the challenges of Pacific salmon management, including mass marking and mark-selective fisheries to conserve natural stocks and sustain fishery opportunities. Canada is strategically positioned between Alaska and the Lower 48 states, facing jurisdictional issues in the Pacific Salmon Commission process. Concerns arose regarding unilateral decisions to implement mass marking and mark-selective fisheries, which could undermine the coded-wire-tag system used by the Pacific Salmon Commission. Different interpretations of expectations led to uncertainty and debates over intent, such as the complex implementation of the Chinook regime and controversy over the U.S. share of Fraser River sockeye harvest. The United States and Canada have differing views on how to determine their proportional share of the sockeye run. Ambiguities in Annex IV language have made it challenging for bilateral technical committees to monitor performance and compliance. The Pacific Salmon Commission's meeting schedule and processes are not conducive to coordinating fishing regimes between the two countries. The Fraser Panel coordinates fishing plans for sockeye and pink salmon bound for the Fraser River, while coordination for other species is less formal. The 2002 Southern Coho Agreement involves exchanging information on abundance forecasts and fishery expectations through limited manager-to-manager discussions. The Pacific Salmon Commission holds three meetings each year to review fishing seasons, resolve issues, and plan work for Panels. The lack of forums for policy-technical exchange in implementing PSC regimes hinders cooperative salmon management between the US and Canada. Funding issues have led to reduced participation in technical committees, impacting stock and fishery assessments. This has eroded the foundation for science-based management. The foundation for science-based management is eroding as demands for precision in salmon management increase. Canada's allocation policy prioritizes First Nations for harvest after spawning escapement. Concerns exist over the accuracy of harvest estimates and fishery sampling data for some First Nations fisheries. Canada is reluctant to interfere with First Nations' fishing rights, even when conservation concerns arise. Cooperation with the United States on Pacific Salmon Treaty issues has been positive since the 1999 Agreement. The PSC discussed chapter renewal starting in 2007, with a focus on Chinook salmon. Canada had implemented conservation measures before the 1999 Agreement, leading to changes in fishing patterns. The agreement shifted focus to conservation and abundance-based management. The fishing pattern off west coast Vancouver Island shifted from old treaty arrangements to a conservation and abundance-based approach, meeting Canada's conservation needs and reducing overall harvest of U.S. Chinook, including ESA-listed stocks. Canada's catch was within the parameters of the 1999 Agreement for Chinook salmon, but it was impossible for Canada to harvest its Chinook stocks without intercepting southern-bound U.S. stocks. Alaska also had a significant harvest of southern U.S. Chinook stocks. Canada was concerned about the increasing bycatch of Yukon River Chinook salmon by the U.S. pollock fishery. The increasing bycatch of Yukon River Chinook salmon by the U.S. pollock fishery in the Bering Sea was causing declining numbers of Chinook salmon migrating into Canada to spawn in Upper Yukon River tributaries. Canadian managers blamed this interception for poor salmon returns and attended a meeting to emphasize their concern, citing treaty language binding parties to reducing marine catch and bycatch of Yukon River salmon. U.S. pollock fishermen argued that severe restrictions on their fishery could make it unprofitable. Conservation of Canadian Pacific salmon populations was a priority for Canada. Canada prioritized access to salmon under treaty arrangements, benefits from Canadian stock rebuilding efforts, and obligations to First Nations in renegotiating the Pacific Salmon Treaty. The government supported the work of the Pacific Salmon Commission for successful negotiations. A coalition of U.S. and Canadian conservation groups proposed four principles to improve the treaty for sustainable salmon management. The coalition proposed four principles to improve the Pacific Salmon Treaty (PST), including protecting diversity, increasing habitat protection, adopting the precautionary principle, and enhancing transparency. U.S. and Canadian representatives agreed on changes to the PST chapters in 2008, which were ratified and took effect in 2009, lasting until 2018. Significant revisions to the Pacific Salmon Treaty chapters took effect on January 1, 2009, and will remain in effect through 2018. Changes include new harvest sharing arrangements for sockeye on the Taku River, a renewed commitment to the joint enhancement program for sockeye in the Transboundary Area, and reductions in the allowable Chinook harvest in certain fisheries to address conservation concerns. The Pacific Salmon Treaty underwent significant revisions in 2009, with new provisions to protect weak stocks and reduce harvests in Alaskan and Canadian fisheries. A fund was created by the US and Canada to support the implementation of these changes, including $30 million for Canada to mitigate harvest reductions, $15 million for a coastwide coded-wire tag program, and $10 million for a \"Sentinel Stocks Program.\" Additionally, funds are allocated for pilot projects and improving fisheries in Canada. Chapter 5 (Coho) incorporates the joint Southern Coho Management Plan and an abundance-based management framework. Chapter 6 (Chum) introduces a 20% fixed harvest rate in Johnstone Strait and establishes a \"critical level\" for southern-bound chum salmon. The agreement also includes a defined start date for U.S. fisheries in certain areas and removes previous provisions for U.S. harvest."
