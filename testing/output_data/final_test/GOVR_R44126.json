    "content": "Mass murders with firearms in public spaces cause anxiety and vulnerability, as seen in recent tragedies in Charleston, SC, and Chattanooga, TN. Multiple incidents in 2012 raised concerns about the prevalence and severity of such shootings. Various groups and researchers have compiled data on multiple victim homicides, but their methodologies and findings differ. The analysis utilizes official crime data to compile comprehensive datasets of mass murders and multiple victim homicides. According to the FBI, mass murder with firearms is defined as a multiple homicide incident where four or more victims are murdered in one event, in close geographical locations. A mass shooting involves four or more victims murdered with firearms in one event, while a mass public shooting refers to the same criteria. The FBI defines mass murder as a multiple homicide incident where four or more victims are murdered with firearms in one event, in various public locations. They did not specify if mass murder involves one or multiple offenders, but typically it is one offender. Different types of mass murder include \"classic mass murder\" with one person in one location at one time, \"family mass murder\" or \"familicide,\" and murder-suicides when the offender commits suicide. Mass shootings, defined by the FBI as incidents where four or more victims are murdered with firearms in one event, often lead to calls for gun control legislation. Following tragedies like the Virginia Tech massacre and Newtown shooting, Congress considered amendments to improve recordkeeping on individuals ineligible to possess firearms due to mental illness or domestic violence. However, consensus on gun control proposals was not reached, and the legislation was tabled without reaching the House floor for debate. This report provides data and analysis on mass shootings, specifically mass murders committed with firearms, for a 15-year period (1999-2013) and mass public shootings for a 44-year period (1970-2013). Policymakers could use this information to evaluate gun control proposals following deadly mass public shootings. Congress defined \"mass killings\" as \"3 or more killings in a single incident\" in 2012. The FBI established a system to classify multiple murder types in the 1980s. The FBI Behavioral Science Unit and National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime classified different types of murder, including mass murder, spree murder, and serial murder. They studied rapists and killers to analyze violent crime trends. Crimes can be classified by type, style, and victim counts, with homicides traditionally categorized based on the number of victims slain in one event. A spree murder involves two or more victims slain in one event at multiple locations without emotional cooling-off. Serial murder includes three or more separate homicidal events with emotional cooling-off between them. The FBI defines a massacre as four or more murder victims. The Crime Classification Manual discusses classic mass murder and family mass murder prototypes. The FBI criminal profilers identified classic mass murder and family mass murder as prototypes of mass murder events. Classic mass murder can last minutes, hours, or days, while family mass murder involves an offender killing four or more family members in one location. \"Familicide\" refers to the murder of intimate partners and children. These definitions have a four-victim threshold but may not capture cases where additional victims were killed by means other than firearms. The FBI classifications of multiple homicides (double, triple, mass, spree, and serial) were created for criminal profiling, not statistical data collection. There can be overlap among these classifications, making them not mutually exclusive for statistical purposes. This can lead to different judgments and findings regarding the frequency and severity of these incidents. According to the FBI, there are varying definitions of mass murder, with different organizations adopting different definitions. This leads to varying findings on the frequency and severity of these incidents. The FBI's classifications of multiple homicides were created for criminal profiling, not statistical data collection, and can overlap, leading to different judgments and findings. The definitions of mass murder vary among organizations, leading to differing findings on the frequency and severity of these incidents. Despite the public outcry, there is a lack of comprehensive data on multiple-victim homicide incidents. Researchers have analyzed national homicide statistics compiled by the Department of Justice, with the Bureau of Justice Statistics estimating the prevalence of mass murder. The Bureau of Justice Statistics estimated 987 four or more victim homicide incidents from 1980 to 2011, accounting for 0.19% of all murders. Researchers found an average of 26 mass murders per year from 1976 to 2011, involving 4,330 victims. Grant Duwe identified an average of 27 mass murders per year from 1976 to 1999. From 1976 to 1999, there were an average of 27 mass murders per year, with 5.22 murder victims per incident. Firearms were used in 69% of the incidents, indicating about 448 mass public shootings out of 649 mass murder incidents. Grant Duwe's analysis showed an average of 18.7 mass shootings per year. Additionally, there were 1.3 mass public shootings per year in the 1970s, 3.2 per year in the 1980s, and 4.2 per year in the 1990s. According to USA Today, there were roughly 242 mass murders from 2006 to 2013, resulting in an average of 30.3 incidents per year with 4.98 victims per incident. Mass shootings accounted for 21.5 incidents per year with 5.1 victims per incident, while 1.25 mass murder incidents per year involved firearms and resulted in 4.8 victims per incident. Offenders used firearms more often than any other means in these incidents. For this report, CRS analyzed data on mass shootings from 1999 to 2013, using FBI SHR data and cross-referencing with other sources. They evaluated each incident based on various characteristics. The analysis of mass shootings from 1999 to 2013 identified three patterns of mass shootings in public places, providing insight for policymakers on evaluating gun control proposals. Grant Duwe conceptualized mass public shootings as a form of mass murder, where offenders gun down victims without apparent reason. In the twentieth century, there were 116 mass public shootings defined as incidents where four or more victims were killed publicly with guns within 24 hours. These shootings exclude those related to criminal activities like robbery or drug dealing. Mass murders are categorized as \"classic mass murders\" or \"family mass murders,\" with the former typically involving a mentally disordered individual acting alone in one location over a period of time. In mass public shootings and familicide mass shootings, offenders often share similar attributes such as being lone assailants and having a high likelihood of committing suicide or being killed by police. Some mass shootings involve offenders who do not expect to escape and are killed by police when resisting arrest. These incidents may not fit the classic mass murder or family mass murder patterns, often involving gangland executions, drug-related crimes, robberies, and other criminal activities. Offenders in these cases may not consider the long-term consequences of their actions but still hope to avoid detection and accountability. The FBI guidance helped CRS define \"mass shooting\" as a multiple homicide incident with four or more victims murdered with firearms in close proximity, and \"mass public shooting\" as a similar incident with murders in public locations. The FBI guidance helped CRS define different types of mass shootings: \"familicide mass shooting\" involves four or more family members murdered in a private setting, while \"other felony mass shooting\" involves four or more victims murdered in close proximity due to underlying criminal activity. The FBI guidance helped CRS define different types of mass shootings, including \"familicide mass shooting\" and \"other felony mass shooting.\" These involve four or more victims murdered in close proximity due to underlying criminal activity. Most mass shootings typically last only a few minutes, but some researchers define \"mass murder\" or \"mass public shooting\" with a timeframe parameter of 24 hours. The FBI traditionally views \"mass murders\" as four or more murder victim multicides that occur in a single event or incident and single location. The FBI changed its definition of \"mass murder\" to include events in multiple nearby locations. The CRS definition of mass public shooting includes incidents in multiple locations or neighborhood spree killings. Five out of 66 mass public shootings in the CRS dataset involved four or more victim spree murders. The CRS defines mass public shootings as incidents where four victims were shot to death in public spaces, excluding secluded areas. About one-fifth of the incidents in the dataset may have been triggered by domestic disputes. The curr_chunk discusses familicides and mass public shootings, where the offenders were usually family members or former intimate partners of the victims. These incidents often took place in private residences or remote locations, involving lone offenders. The prev_chunk mentions mass public shootings defined as incidents with four victims shot to death in public spaces, excluding secluded areas. The curr_chunk discusses three broad patterns of mass murder and mass shootings: mass public shootings, familicide mass shootings, and other felony mass shootings. The data subsets are mutually exclusive in this report, categorized based on location, offender-victim relationships, and other circumstances. While some cases could fit into more than one category, most incidents fall within one of the three patterns outlined. The analysis shows that there were 317 mass shooting incidents in the United States from 1999 to 2013, resulting in 1,554 murder victims and 441 wounded victims. On average, there were 21 mass shooting incidents per year, with 104 murder victims and 29 wounded victims annually. There was an increase in incidents and casualties in the last 5 years of the 15-year period. On average, there are 21 mass shootings annually in the United States, falling into three broad patterns: mass public shootings, familicides, and other categories. Mass public shootings involve four or more victims shot to death in public locations, while familicides involve a parent or intimate partner shooting four or more victims in private settings. These murders are not linked to underlying criminal activity. The 15-year dataset compiled by CRS shows that mass shootings in the United States fluctuated annually, with an increase in incidents from 2009-2013 compared to earlier years. The shootings fall into three categories: mass public shootings, familicides, and other felony mass murders. The latter involve victims shot to death due to underlying criminal activity or commonplace circumstances. The composition of mass shootings in the United States possibly changed over a 15-year timespan (1999-2013), with an increase in mass public shootings and familicide incidents. Familicide and other felony mass shootings occurred twice as frequently as mass public shootings. Public mass shootings had twice the number of victims per incident compared to familicide and other felony shootings. Some incidents previously classified as mass public shootings were re-evaluated and categorized as other felony mass shootings. The data shows an increase in mass public shootings over the decades, with an average of one incident per year in the 1970s and four incidents per year from 2010 through 2013. The prevalence of these shootings has increased, but whether it constitutes an \"epidemic\" is subjective. The United States saw an increase in mass public shootings in the 1990s and 2000s, with an average of four incidents per year. The first four years of this decade showed a rise in both the frequency and deadliness of these incidents. Over the past half century, there have been 13 high-casualty mass public shootings, with seven occurring in the past seven years. Two of the deadliest shootings on record were the Newtown, CT, and Blacksburg, VA incidents. Offenders committed 66 mass public shootings, resulting in 446 murder victims. Offenders committed 66 mass public shootings from 1999 through 2013, resulting in 446 murder victims and 329 non-fatally wounded victims. The number of incidents varied each year, with an average of 4.4 per year. Casualty counts increased in 1999, 2007, 2009, and 2012, driven by incidents with 10 or more victims killed. The average age of victims killed was 39, with a mode of 6 years old. The last five years had higher averages for incidents and victim counts compared to the previous 10 years, largely due to incidents in 2012. The annual incident and casualty counts increased in 2012, largely driven by a few incidents. Excluding 2012, the averages would have been lower than the preceding five-year period. Offenders used assault weapons in 27.3% of incidents, with some firearms illegally converted into machine guns. In 42.4% of incidents, offenders carried multiple firearms. At least seven offenders held concealed carry permits. Offenders in mass public shootings often carried multiple firearms, with some holding concealed carry permits. A domestic dispute was a factor in a fifth of incidents, and some were familicides. One incident was classified as a terrorist attack. In the Hood, TX mass shooting, 6 out of 66 mass public shootings occurred in a house of worship. Out of 68 offenders, 39 committed suicide, 8 were killed by police, and 18 were arrested. The average age of offenders was 36 years old. The average age of offenders in familicide mass shootings was 36 years old, with 3 juveniles involved. From 1999 to 2013, there were 127 familicide mass shootings, resulting in 576 victims killed and 37 wounded. Familicide mass shootings occurred twice as often as mass public shootings, with an average of 8.47 incidents per year. Victims killed had an average age of 27 years old. Over the 15-year period, there was an increase in familicide incidents and casualties in the last 5 years. Out of 129 offenders, 72 committed suicide, 5 were killed by police, and 57 were arrested. In familicide mass shootings, most offenders were male heads of household or former domestic intimate partners. Incidents often occurred late at night or in the early morning hours in private households. Offenders used a single firearm in 86.9% of cases. None of the familicide mass shootings remained unsolved. Some offenders were progeny or ex-boyfriends of daughters. In other felony mass shootings, offenders committed 124 incidents from 1999 through 2013, resulting in 532 murders and 75 non-fatal injuries. These shootings occurred about twice as frequently as mass public shootings, with victims averaging 30 years old. Unlike mass public or familicide shootings, other felony shootings generally decreased in incidents and casualties over five-year averages. The average age of offenders in felony mass shootings was 27.4 years, with most incidents being drug- or gang-related. Out of 184 known offenders, three committed suicide, one was killed by police, and the rest were arrested. Offenders ranged from single individuals to groups of eleven, with twelve being female. In felony mass shootings, offenders ranged from single individuals to groups of eleven, with twelve being female. 12 cases involved offenders carrying and/or using assault weapons. 27 incidents remain unsolved. Mass public shootings had the highest casualty rates compared to other types of shootings. Half of other felony mass shooting incidents involved multiple offenders. Casualty rates per offender were lower for other felony mass shootings. In the past 48 years, there have been 13 high-casualty mass public shooting incidents in the United States, with seven occurring in the last seven years. Two of the deadliest shootings were the Newtown, CT, and Blacksburg, VA (VA Tech) incidents. In comparison, there were no double-digit death toll mass shootings from 2000-2006, and from 1966-1999, there were six such incidents occurring less frequently. The public understanding of mass public shootings, as defined by Grant Duwe, has evolved over the years. A 44-year dataset shows that incidents have become more frequent, with fewer days between them. The firearms-related murder victim rate increased in the 1970s, 1980s, and peaked in 1993. The firearms-related murder victim rate increased in the 1970s, 1980s, and peaked in 1993. Since then, the murder rate has decreased, fluctuated moderately, or held steady for the past two decades. From 1993 to 2013, the estimated firearms-related homicide victim rate per 100,000 of the population decreased from 6.62 to 3.10. Mass public shooting murder victim rates have trended upward, with spikes in several years such as 1977, 1984, 1991, 1999, 2007, and 2009. The firearms-related murder victim rate increased in the 1970s, 1980s, and peaked in 1993. Since then, the murder rate has decreased, fluctuated moderately, or held steady for the past two decades. Mass public shooting murder victim rates have trended upward, with spikes in several years such as 1977, 1984, 1991, 1999, 2007, and 2009, largely due to high casualty incidents like the Aurora, CO, and Newtown, CT mass shootings. Public perception of mass shootings is shaped by media accounts, depicting them as \"random\" incidents, but leading criminologists argue that most mass murderers plan their attacks in advance and select victims methodically. Criminologists note that mass murderers are often emotionally distressed and unstable, but not usually psychotic or criminally insane. After a brief period of national attention, communities affected by mass shootings return to normal. Familicides occur twice as often as mass public shootings but receive less media coverage. Societal stigma attached to familicides, victims sometimes blamed. Sparse media coverage, little opportunity for law enforcement intervention. Some states have laws to remove firearms from domestic violence offenders. \"Other felony mass shootings receive initial media coverage but attention fades over time if offenders are not quickly apprehended. Many incidents are drug- or gang-related, with little sympathy in affected communities. Police intervention during shootings is limited, posing challenges for law enforcement and the judicial system. Approximately 27 unsolved cases in a 15-year dataset highlight this issue. Media often raises questions following mass shootings.\" Following mass shootings, questions are raised about how offenders obtained their guns, their history of violence or mental illness, the types of guns used, the impact of gun types on victim counts, concealed carry permits, and shootings in \"gun free zones\". Comprehensive answers to these questions could inform policymaking and provide valuable criminal intelligence to first responders. Several gun control issues related to mass shootings are discussed. Following the Newtown, CT mass shooting, Congress passed legislation defining \"mass killings\" as 3 or more killings in a single incident. This allows the Attorney General and FBI Director to assist in investigating violent acts, including mass killings in public places. The definition of \"mass killings\" in this act differs from previous FBI guidance on homicide types and the general practice of defining \"mass murder\" as four or more victims murdered in one event. Congress may need to consider establishing consistent definitions for terms like \"mass murder\" and \"mass shooting\" to differentiate them from terms like \"active shooter\" and \"mass casualty event.\" Researchers have called for a consensus definition for mass shootings to stimulate further research. Currently, only the Bureau of Justice Statistics has analyzed multiple victim homicide incidents involving firearms comprehensively. The FBI's Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) and Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR) provide data on multiple victim homicides, but have shortcomings that could be improved with better reporting from state and local law enforcement agencies. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also maintain a database on firearms-related homicides in the United States. The CDC maintains a database on mortality and morbidity in the United States, including firearms-related incidents. However, their data releases lag behind the FBI's UCR-SHR datasets by a couple of years. Congress could consider improving both CDC and FBI datasets to enhance statistical baseline on mass murder and gun violence. One common question after firearms-related multiple homicides is how the offender acquired their gun(s), which can sometimes be answered by federal authorities. The DOJ's ATF administers recordkeeping regulations under the Gun Control Act and National Firearms Act to trace firearms from manufacturers to purchasers. The release of firearms trace data to the public is controversial, as it may reveal the identities of licensed gun dealers. Knowing if offenders acquired firearms legally or illegally could help inform gun control measures. The origin of firearms used by offenders, whether acquired legally or illegally, is crucial for informing the gun control debate. Understanding if offenders obtained weapons legally could support the need for better recordkeeping on individuals disqualified from owning firearms due to violent behavior. Additionally, the source of firearms, whether from licensed dealers or unlicensed persons, can influence arguments for stricter regulations, such as universal background checks. Opponents of universal background checks argue that offenders could still acquire firearms through illegal means like \"straw purchases.\" However, comprehensive data on the legality of transfers could be released by ATF without compromising the identities of licensed gun dealers. This information could help inform the gun control debate and support the need for better recordkeeping on individuals disqualified from owning firearms due to violent behavior. If a federally licensed gun dealer or unlicensed person illegally transfers a firearm to a mass shooter, they could face prosecution. Congress could require ATF to assist in tracing firearms used in multiple victim homicides and report to Congress on the frequency and deadliness of such incidents. ATF could also report on arson- and explosives-related mass murders. The enactment of stricter gun control measures was influenced by a rise in mass public shootings in the 1980s and early 1990s. The rise in mass public shootings in the 1980s and early 1990s led to the enactment of a 10-year federal ban on semiautomatic assault weapons from 1994-2004. Shooters in various incidents used firearms characterized as assault weapons, accounting for 9.78% of mass shootings. In 31 incidents (9.78%), firearms classified as \"assault weapons\" were used, potentially leading to higher victim counts. Establishing a comprehensive dataset on types of firearms used in mass shootings could provide a basis for assessing gun control proposals regarding detachable magazines and semiautomatic firearms. In mass shootings, domestic disputes were a factor in some incidents, leading to calls for stricter gun laws regarding firearms possession by individuals with domestic violence restraining orders. Some states have extended the duration of these orders to prevent such tragedies. Some states require individuals with domestic violence restraining orders to surrender their firearms to authorities, while others only require surrendering constructive possession. Congress could consider establishing guidelines for handling this issue at the state and local level. Congress may want to revisit the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 to improve electronic information sharing on individuals with histories of domestic violence for gun control purposes. Many mass murderers exhibit mental instability, but not all individuals who commit mass shootings have significant interactions with mental health or law enforcement. Policymakers often suggest increasing funding for the National Instant Criminal History Background Check System maintained by the FBI after mass shootings. Prior to the Brady Act, the FBI maintained records on individuals deemed mentally incompetent for gun control. A federated system called the Interstate Identification Index (III) was established in the 1970s to share serious felony criminal history records. The system needed improvement to meet the objectives of the Brady Act. The Brady Act required substantial improvements to the Interstate Identification Index (III) to prevent mentally unstable individuals from obtaining firearms. Federal authorities relied on states to electronically provide records of those deemed unfit to possess firearms. Some states had not established the necessary record systems, leading to a top-down approach for nationwide dialogue and consensus building by the federal government. The federal government led a nationwide dialogue to establish a national consensus on record systems for firearm background checks. In 1997, the ATF defined \"adjudicated mental defective\" to implement the Brady Act. Some states did not provide records to the FBI, even for individuals deemed unfit to possess firearms. Before the Newtown, CT, mass shooting, federal courts did not provide records to the FBI on persons found to be criminally insane, despite falling under the ATF definition of \"adjudicated mental defective.\" The Executive Office of the U.S. Attorneys and Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts have addressed this oversight, but it may still require congressional attention. The Department of Veterans Affairs has been transferring electronic records to the FBI on mentally incompetent VA beneficiaries since 1998, leading Congress to establish an appeals process for restoring gun rights. Additionally, states are required by Congress to establish similar administrative processes under the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007. In response to the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007, states must establish administrative appeals processes. Some states have avoided applying for federal grants due to costly appeals processes. Congress prohibits the ATF from considering disabilities relief applications for those ineligible to possess firearms. The wide scope of individuals classified as \"mentally incompetent\" or \"mentally unstable\" under the ATF definition of \"adjudicated mental defective\" poses cost challenges. Congress has allocated funds to enhance accuracy and electronic access to records for state and local governments. Governments allocate millions of dollars to improve accuracy and access to disqualifying records for gun control, focusing on mental incompetency and domestic violence convictions. Maintaining these records has implications for individuals and costs for governments and mental health providers. Congress could consider expanding the federal definition of \"adjudicated mental defective\" and the implications of a national database of mentally unstable individuals. The current definition of \"mental defective\" for gun control purposes in the United States is broad, making it difficult to collect comprehensive records of individuals who fall under this category. Congress may need to revisit the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 to improve electronic information sharing on individuals with mental illness, instability, and substance abuse histories. Additionally, a significant percentage of \"other felony mass shootings\" remain unsolved. A significant percentage of \"other felony mass shootings\" remain unsolved, raising concerns about the clearance rate and the reasons behind the lack of resolution. Congress could investigate if the unsolved cases are due to a lack of resources, ineffective policing, or witnesses' fear of retaliation. Unsolved \"mass shootings\" raise concerns about community trust in police and potential affinity with criminals. Multiple victim homicide rates could guide policymakers in targeting federal law enforcement assistance in high-crime areas. Researchers have analyzed homicide data to understand the prevalence and deadliness of mass murders. The Bureau of Justice Statistics provided data on multiple victim homicides from 1999 to 2011, estimating an average of 32 four or more victim homicides per year during that period. The data was statistically weighted to address reporting limitations. From 1999 to 2011, there were an average of 32 four or more victim homicides per year, accounting for 0.21% of all murder and nonnegligent manslaughter incidents. These incidents involved approximately 152 murder victims per year, with 1.58% of all homicide victims being associated with these cases. Some of these incidents were classified as \"serial murders\" or \"spree murders\" extending past one event. In 2011, about two-thirds of all homicides involved firearms. In 2011, the majority of homicides involved firearms, with handguns being the most common type of firearm used. The percentage of murders committed with firearms increased for multiple victim homicides compared to other means of murder. For example, over two-thirds of single victim homicides and more than three-quarters of double victim homicides involved firearms. Additionally, the percentage of multiple victim homicide incidents committed with rifles or shotguns increased significantly in 2011. According to BJS, incidents of multiple murders and nonnegligent manslaughter involving four or more victims are statistically infrequent but have a significant impact. Over a 13-year period (1999-2011), there were 416 such incidents resulting in 1,977 victims. These incidents accounted for about 0.21% of all reported murders and nonnegligent manslaughter cases, with an average of 32 incidents per year. The victims in these incidents made up almost 1% of all reported murder and nonnegligent manslaughter victims, totaling 152 per year. The BJS data includes all four or more victim murder and nonnegligent manslaughter incidents, with firearms likely used in at least two-thirds of cases. The incidents possibly include spree and serial murders, distinct from mass murders, and may also involve vehicular crimes. Mass shootings constitute a smaller percentage of these incidents. Between 1999-2011, CRS data shows that 272 mass shootings accounted for 1,316 homicide victims out of 208,425 in total. These incidents were categorized as \"mass public shootings,\" \"Familicide mass shootings,\" and \"Other felony mass shootings.\" 65.38% of four or more victim murder incidents were mass shootings, with at least four victims shot to death in a single incident. Based on BJS data from 1999-2011, there were 1,316 victims in four or more victim murder incidents. On average, there were 116 three or more victim homicides per year, including 84 triple homicide incidents and 32 four or more victim incidents. Additionally, there were about 80 three or more victim homicides committed with firearms per year, with at least 21 being four or more victim mass shootings. Fox and Levin analyzed FBI-SHR data to estimate the frequency of mass murder in the US. Based on Fox and Levin's analysis of FBI-SHR data, they estimated 927 incidents of mass murder in the US from 1976 to 2011, resulting in 4,330 victims. Offenders committed an average of 25.8 mass murders annually, killing about 4.7 victims per incident over the 36-year period. Fox and Levin estimated that firearms were the weapon of choice in approximately 20 out of 26 mass murder incidents annually over a 36-year period. The frequency of mass murders and mass shootings varied from year to year with no significant tendency to increase or decrease. Researchers faced challenges in creating exclusive typologies of multiple murders or mass murderers based on offender factors. Criminologist Grant Duwe analyzed FBI-SHR data from 1976 to 1999, identifying 649 mass murders with an average of 27 per year, resulting in casualty rates of 5.2. Various typologies of mass murderers were discussed, but statistical breakouts based on profiles were not provided. Grant Duwe analyzed FBI-SHR data from 1976 to 1999, identifying 649 mass murders with casualty rates of 5.2 murder victims and 4.31 wounded victims per incident. He estimated that 69% of mass murder incidents involved firearms, with assault weapons used in about 3% of cases. Duwe also found 55 mass murders not reported to the FBI but in the press, and eliminated 71 cases inaccurately recorded. He suggested that mass shootings in public spaces likely increased from 1966 to 1999, labeling them \"mass public shootings.\" Grant Duwe defined \"mass public shooting\" as any incident where four or more victims are killed in a public place with guns within 24 hours. He noted an acceleration in the frequency of these shootings starting in the 1960s, with roughly three incidents per year from 1980 to 1999. Duwe updated his estimates in January 2013, providing slightly revised numbers to the Washington Post. Grant Duwe updated estimates of mass public shootings, reporting incidents in each decade from the 1960s to the 2000s. The worst year was 1991 with eight incidents, followed by 1999 and 2012 with seven incidents each. Duwe also identified five historical patterns of mass murder, including workplace violence and gang-related massacres. In December 2013, USA Today published an article by Meghan Hoyer on mass killings, based on an eight-year dataset (2006-2013) compiled and analyzed by Hoyer and her colleagues. They found that there were roughly 242 mass murders resulting in the deaths of four or more victims during this period, averaging 30.3 incidents per year and 4.98 victims per incident. The data was verified by checking press accounts and police reports, as well as supplementing with additional information from the press. On average, there were 30.3 mass murders per year with 4.98 victims per incident. This included 21.5 incidents of \"mass shootings\" with 5.1 victims per incident, 1.25 incidents of \"mass murders\" involving firearms with 4.8 victims per incident, and 7.5 incidents of \"mass murders\" without firearms with 4.3 victims per incident."
