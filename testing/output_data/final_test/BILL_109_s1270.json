    "content": "The Act titled \"Green Chemistry Research and Development Act of 2005\" defines green chemistry as designing chemical products and processes to reduce hazardous substances. It establishes the Green Chemistry Research and Development Program. The Green Chemistry Research and Development Program, established by the President, promotes Federal green chemistry activities through grants for research, development, and partnerships among universities, industry, and nonprofit organizations. The Green Chemistry Research and Development Program promotes Federal green chemistry activities through grants for research, development, and technology transfer at Federal laboratories. It aims to encourage consideration of green chemistry in Federal chemical science and engineering research, create incentives for green chemistry processes and products, facilitate adoption of green chemistry innovations, and expand education and training in green chemistry. The Green Chemistry Research and Development Program aims to expand education and training in green chemistry for students and professionals, collect and disseminate information on green chemistry research and technology transfer, and provide outreach venues for green chemistry advances. The Green Chemistry Research and Development Program includes support for research to identify barriers and methods for advancing commercialization of green chemistry. It also involves public input through mechanisms like citizen panels and educational events. An Interagency Working Group will be established, including representatives from various agencies designated by the President. The Interagency Working Group, led by the Administrator for Research and Development of the Environmental Protection Agency, oversees the planning, management, and coordination of the Green Chemistry Research and Development Program. It establishes goals, priorities, and interagency coordination, including budget coordination. Each participating Federal agency must submit a report on its activities as part of its annual budget request to the Office of Management and Budget. The Interagency Working Group, overseen by the EPA Administrator for Research and Development, manages the Green Chemistry Research and Development Program. Participating agencies must report their activities in their budget requests to the Office of Management and Budget. A report to Congress is required within 2 years of the Act's enactment, detailing federally funded green chemistry activities and budgets. The Green Chemistry Research and Development Program overseen by the EPA Administrator requires participating agencies to report their activities and budgets to the Office of Management and Budget. A report to Congress is mandated within 2 years of the Act's enactment, detailing progress towards goals and priorities, along with recommendations for future activities. SEC. 4. MANUFACTURING EXTENSION CENTER GREEN SUPPLIERS NETWORK GRANT PROGRAM. Amends the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act to enable supply chain manufacturers to improve products, increase energy efficiency, identify cost-saving opportunities, and reduce hazardous substances. SEC. 5. UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION IN CHEMISTRY AND CHEMICAL ENGINEERING. The National Science Foundation will award grants to higher education institutions to revise their chemistry and chemical engineering curriculum to include green chemistry concepts. Grants will be merit-reviewed and require cost sharing from non-Federal sources. Institutions must submit an application with a description of the adoption schedule. The National Science Foundation will award grants to higher education institutions for revising chemistry and chemical engineering curriculum to include green chemistry concepts. Applications must include a description of the proposed curricular revisions, schedule for adoption, commitment to sustaining changes, and cost-sharing details. Additional appropriations are authorized for this purpose. The National Science Foundation will provide funding for curriculum revisions to include green chemistry concepts at higher education institutions. Appropriations of $7,000,000 for 2006, $7,500,000 for 2007, and $8,000,000 for 2008 are authorized for this purpose. The text chunk discusses a study on the commercialization of green chemistry. The Director of the National Science Foundation will conduct a study with the National Research Council to identify barriers to commercializing green chemistry research. The study will analyze successful and unsuccessful commercialization attempts, recommend research areas, priorities, and public policy options to overcome barriers. A report on the findings and recommendations will be submitted to the House Committee on Science and the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation within 18 months. SEC. 7. PARTNERSHIPS IN GREEN CHEMISTRY. The Program authorizes agencies to award grants to higher education institutions for partnerships with the chemical industry to retrain chemists and chemical engineers in green chemistry. Grants are merit-based with cost sharing required from non-Federal sources. Institutions must partner with two or more companies in the chemical industry to be eligible. Grants will fund activities for retraining in green chemistry. The Program allows grants for higher education institutions to partner with the chemical industry to retrain chemists and chemical engineers in green chemistry. Grants may cover the development of curricular materials, designing courses, publicizing professional development opportunities, and providing stipends for enrolled individuals. Institutions must submit applications describing the partnership and each member's role in the proposal. The evaluation of grant applications for higher education institutions partnering with the chemical industry in green chemistry will consider the partnership's ability to carry out proposed activities effectively and prepare chemists and chemical engineers in green chemistry concepts. The evaluation of grant applications for higher education institutions partnering with the chemical industry in green chemistry will consider the partnership's ability to apply green chemistry concepts and strategies in their work, as well as the amount of cost sharing to be provided.
