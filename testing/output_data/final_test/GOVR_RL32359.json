    "content": "Nonproliferation assistance programs, like the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) funded by the Department of Defense, aim to combat the spread of weapons of mass destruction. Initially focused on Russia's nuclear weapons reduction, CTR now also targets preventing terrorist access to WMD. Analysts suggest expanding these programs beyond Russia to other regions. The Bush Administration in 2003 expanded the strategic focus of the CTR program to support the war on terrorism. The Bush Administration expanded the strategic focus of the CTR program in early 2003 to support the war on terrorism. Congress authorized $50 million from the CTR Program for states outside the former Soviet Union. $38.5 million was spent in Albania to eliminate chemical weapons stockpiles. The 9/11 Commission called for continued support for threat reduction assistance to prevent WMD access by terrorist groups. This report explores applying CTR programs to states with WMD and terrorism threats, discussing potential recipients, assistance types, constraints, and costs. The report discusses the constraints and benefits of providing assistance for countering WMD terrorism, with a focus on specific countries and the growing interest of terrorists in WMD after the 2001 attacks on the United States. President Bush identified Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as \"axis of evil\" states supporting terrorism and possessing WMD. The connection between terrorists and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) has been highlighted in various national security strategies. The Iraq war in 2003 was justified based on claims of WMD possession and ties to terrorism. Concerns have been raised about the A.Q. Khan nuclear network in Pakistan providing WMD technology to state sponsors of terrorism, raising fears of terrorist access to WMD. Some call for assistance to Pakistan to reduce terrorist access to WMD. Russia is seen as a key focus due to its Cold War WMD technologies. Cooperation should extend to problem states like Pakistan, Syria, Libya, and Iran. Nonproliferation assistance programs aim to restrain states like North Korea and Pakistan. The Bush Administration advocates using various tools to counter WMD proliferation. President Bush introduced seven new initiatives in a nonproliferation speech, including expanding CTR funds for retraining weapons scientists and reducing uranium enrichment levels. The success of CTR-like approaches may depend on a state's willingness to cooperate and their perception of the assistance. Globalizing CTR raises questions about spreading cooperation and potential concerns about arms control or bribery. The Nunn-Lugar Expansion Act, part of the FY2004 National Defense Authorization Act, allowed $50 million of unobligated CTR funds to be used outside the former Soviet Union. This raised concerns about spreading resources thinly and the potential for arms control or bribery. The Nunn-Lugar Expansion Act, part of the FY2004 National Defense Authorization Act, allowed $50 million of unobligated CTR funds to be used outside the former Soviet Union. The final language of the act requires the President to determine that the project will help the US in resolving proliferation threats, the Department of Defense is best suited for the project, and it will be completed quickly. Senator Lugar introduced a bill in 2005 to remove restrictions on using CTR funds outside the FSU. The Nunn-Lugar Expansion Act in the FY2004 National Defense Authorization Act removed restrictions on spending CTR funds outside the former Soviet Union. The bill lifted program-wide restrictions, removed the $50 million cap, and allowed spending on chemical weapons destruction. The threat of terrorist access to WMD is a new concern for nonproliferation experts, focusing on controlling materials at the source as the first line of defense. The threat of terrorist access to weapons of mass destruction (WMD) is a growing concern since the September 2001 attacks. Al Qaeda has prioritized acquiring WMD capabilities, and there is evidence of increased availability of chemical and biological weapons. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has noted a high threat of terrorists using CBRN materials. The CIA warned of a high threat from terrorists using chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear materials in 2003. By 2006, the Director of National Intelligence stated that terrorist groups were more likely to use weapons of mass destruction than states. Nearly 40 terrorist organizations have shown interest in CBRN agents or weapons, capable of simple attacks like poisonings. According to the 2002 National Security Strategy, \"rogue states\" brutalize their own people, violate international law, acquire weapons of mass destruction, sponsor terrorism, and hate the United States. The CIA is concerned about states supplying WMD technology to non-state actors, especially those designated as state sponsors of terrorism. Some state sponsors of terrorism may provide WMD materials to terrorist organizations, although evidence is limited. Cooperation with these \"pariah\" states is challenging. States with terrorist activity and WMD programs pose a risk of terrorists accessing WMD without government knowledge. Table 1 cross-references WMD capabilities and terrorist activities. Estimates of WMD capabilities are based on CIA reports to Congress. Terrorism activity is categorized into state sponsors of terrorism and those with terrorist incidents on their soil. The list of state sponsors may not align with the current threat. The Export Administration Act of 1979 is referenced for analysis. The U.S. Secretary of State designates five countries as state sponsors of terrorism: Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria. Cuba, designated in 1982, has ratified counterterrorism conventions but opposes the U.S. global war on terrorism. The CIA found no credible evidence of Cuban government involvement in international terrorist operations in the past decade. Assertions about Cuba's WMD programs focus on limited biological weapons research and development. Iran, a member of various nonproliferation treaties, is believed to have active nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons programs. Inspections revealed undeclared nuclear activities, leading to the suspension of enrichment programs in 2003. Despite a deal brokered by the EU-3, Iran resumed construction and conversion activities in 2004. The EU-3 brokered a deal with Iran to suspend enrichment activities, but Iran broke the suspension in August 2005. The IAEA found Iran in noncompliance with its NPT safeguards agreement in September 2005. Iran ended its voluntary adherence to the Additional Protocol in February 2006 and resumed uranium enrichment research. The UN Security Council passed a Presidential Statement in March 2006 calling on Iran to suspend uranium enrichment. Iran failed to meet the Council's demands and the P5+1 proposal, leading to the adoption of UNSCR 1696 in June 2006. In 2006, UNSCR 1696 gave Iran a deadline to comply with Security Council requests regarding uranium enrichment or face sanctions. The United States believes Iran has sought chemicals and expertise abroad and has stockpiled chemical weapons. Iran ratified the CWC in 1997 but has not acknowledged its use of chemical weapons against Iraq. The CIA reports Iran continues to seek chemicals and technology from Chinese entities. The CIA believes Iran has stockpiled various chemical agents and probably has nerve agents. Iran has sought dual-use biotechnical material and expertise for its offensive biological weapons program. The State Department reported that Iran has capabilities to produce small quantities of BW agents but limited ability to weaponize them. In 2005, the State Department informed Congress that Iran has an offensive biological weapons program in violation of the BWC. Libya was a state sponsor of terrorism from 1979 to 2006, but its involvement in supporting terrorism decreased as its cooperation with the West increased. In 2003, Libya proposed compensating families of Pan Am 103 bombing victims in exchange for lifting sanctions and being removed from the state sponsors of terrorism list. Libya pledged to eliminate chemical and nuclear weapons programs, signed the Chemical Weapons Convention, and began destroying its chemical weapons. Libya also signed the Additional Protocol for nuclear safeguards. On March 10, 2004, Libya signed the Additional Protocol to its nuclear safeguards agreement and began removing and destroying nuclear-related items. On May 15, 2006, the US announced the restoration of full diplomatic relations with Libya, including the installation of a US embassy in Tripoli and the removal of Libya from the list of designated state sponsors of terrorism. This decision was made in recognition of Libya's commitment to renouncing terrorism and its cooperation with the international community in addressing global threats since September 11, 2001. North Korea remains on the terrorism list since 1988, with ties to terrorist groups and selling weapons to them. It poses a high threat with its WMD programs, including nuclear and chemical weapons capabilities. North Korea withdrew from the NPT in 2003. North Korea withdrew from the NPT in April 2003 and has violated U.S. missile nonproliferation laws. In 2003, North Korea claimed to have nuclear weapons and threatened to export them. However, in January 2004, officials denied having nuclear weapons or a uranium enrichment program. North Korea tested ballistic missiles in 2006, including an intercontinental missile that failed shortly after launch. Resolution 1695 was passed by the Council, demanding North Korea to halt ballistic missile activity and return to talks. North Korea is reported to possess significant amounts of chemical and biological weapons. Sudan has ratified international counterterrorism conventions and received recognition for its efforts against terrorism. Ambassador Black praised Sudan's cooperation in 2003. Sudan is a permissive environment for terrorist groups like al Qaeda, Egyptian Islamic Jihad, and Hamas. Despite cooperating with the US on apprehending terrorists, concerns remain about Sudan's suspected chemical weapons program. The CIA is working with Sudan to address past attempts to acquire chemical weapons. Sudan is not believed to have nuclear or biological weapons programs. In 2003, despite some cooperation on al Qaeda and the Taliban, Syria continued to support \"Palestinian rejectionist groups\" like Hezballah, Hamas, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Secretary of State Colin Powell warned Syria to withdraw support from terrorist organizations, leading to closures of their offices. President Bush signed the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act, imposing sanctions on Syria until it stops supporting terrorist groups, ends its occupation of Lebanon, halts WMD development, and ceases facilitating terrorist activity in Iraq. In 2004, President Bush issued Executive Order 13338 imposing sanctions on Syria, including a ban on munitions and dual-use items. Syria has a known chemical weapons program and is believed to be seeking biological weapons. Despite signing nuclear cooperation agreements with Russia, few believe Syria has serious nuclear weapons aspirations. Syria is not a party to the Chemical Weapons Convention and has an arsenal of ballistic missiles. Pakistan, India, and Israel are states with WMD programs and terrorist activity. None are NPT members, limiting nuclear cooperation. India declared its CW program in 1997 and must destroy remaining stockpile by 2007. Pakistan and India are BWC members without BW programs; Israel is suspected of BW research. Algeria, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt are also concerns for CW programs and potential terrorist access. Egypt is a concern for potential terrorist access to WMD due to its BW program and non-ratification of the BWC. Saudi Arabia is not believed to be acquiring biological or chemical agents. The severity of the threat depends on terrorists' intention and opportunities. The Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK), Hamas, Al Qaeda, and Aum Shinrikyo have shown interest in developing weapons of mass destruction. Countries like Algeria, India, Thailand, and Yugoslavia/Kosovo have terrorist activities but no demonstrated WMD intentions. Different states offer varying opportunities for terrorists to access facilities, with some having high security like North Korea and Israel, while others like Algeria or Egypt have lower security levels. Even in Russia, where nuclear material theft is a concern, terrorists' ability to acquire it is not guaranteed. The CIA has not found any connection between terrorists and the sixteen seizures of Russian weapons-usable nuclear material since 1992. The dual-use nature of WMD materials may allow terrorists to enhance their capabilities in countries without obvious WMD programs. South Africa, with a history of nuclear weapons program, could be a target for terrorists, but good security measures and low terrorist activity may mitigate this risk. The Bush Administration is concerned about the security of weapons-usable material, even if it is under IAEA safeguards. Initiatives include bringing back HEU from foreign countries and the Global Threat Reduction Initiative. Revelations about Iran's nuclear program and Pakistan's role in supplying uranium enrichment equipment have sparked a debate on international control of certain processes and materials. In 2003, the IAEA Director General proposed international management of nuclear fuel cycle, aiming to limit sensitive technology to few states while ensuring fuel supplies for others. President Bush suggested restricting spread of enrichment and reprocessing technology in 2004, leading to G-8 moratoriums. In 2006, the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership was proposed by the Bush Administration. The Bush Administration proposed the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) in 2006, aiming for cooperation in developing a new kind of spent fuel reprocessing technology. U.S. government agencies have spent nonproliferation assistance funds in countries outside the former Soviet Union for over a decade. The Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program, enacted in 1991, addresses the proliferation danger of the former Soviet Union's weapons infrastructure. The Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program, enacted in 1991, aimed to destroy and dismantle strategic nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons in the former Soviet Union. It also focused on securing transportation and storage of weapons, converting WMD facilities and scientists, and preventing proliferation and diversion of weapons and materials. The Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program focused on destroying and dismantling strategic nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons in the former Soviet Union. Efforts included securing transportation and storage of weapons, converting WMD facilities and scientists, and preventing proliferation and diversion of weapons and materials. Destruction and dismantlement activities under the START I agreement involved removing warheads, deactivating missiles, and eliminating launch facilities. CTR programs evolved over time to address changing priorities and threats. The Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program evolved over time to address changing priorities and threats, including providing alternative employment for WMD scientists and improving material protection measures. The United States implemented quick-fix security measures like bars on windows and blast-proof doors, followed by more sophisticated measures such as sensors and cameras. The Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program implemented various security measures like sensors, cameras, and personnel access measures to secure nuclear weapons and materials. The unique circumstances surrounding CTR's inception included the need to secure weapons before destruction, absence of international inspections, and the United States' interest in helping Russia due to past targeting of US by Soviet nuclear weapons. The expansion of the CTR program's scope may raise concerns about states like India and others using US funds to fulfill their chemical weapons destruction obligations under the CWC. Assistance to non-FSU states may involve programs to secure weapons, sites, materials, and personnel, similar to CTR missions in the Soviet Union. Some differences include not all countries of concern possessing actual weapons and some being part of treaties. The United States may need to provide different types of assistance to countries with weapons programs, as some may be violating treaties, while others have no restrictions. Assistance may not focus on weapons security for states less armed than Russia. Improving nuclear weapons security could be controversial for non-NPT states. Some suggest assistance to prevent theft or unauthorized detonation of nuclear weapons. Improving weapons security involves funding armed guards and providing advice or equipment like permissive action links (PALs) to prevent unauthorized use of nuclear weapons. General information on PALs is publicly available, but some countries like North Korea may not have exhausted public sources. Measures to ensure command and control systems work can also help prevent unauthorized use, but may enhance operational capabilities. Assistance in destroying nuclear, biological weapons may be necessary. Assistance in destroying nuclear, biological, or chemical warheads is a priority due to treaty bans. Temporary security measures may be needed before destruction. CTR programs in Russia focus on site security for WMDs, with different goals for nuclear and chemical weapons. Nuclear site security aims to prevent theft, while chemical weapons site security focuses on capabilities destruction. Libya has decided to adhere to CWC guidelines for chemical weapons destruction. Site security measures for biological weapons focus on dismantlement, safety, and security at facilities for biological pathogens. Perimeter security includes gates, barriers, and personnel identification systems to prevent unauthorized entry. Sensors detect unauthorized actions to mitigate insider and outsider threats. Additional measures include checks on personnel leaving facilities, cameras in sensitive areas, and armed guards for protection. The United States conducts vulnerability assessments at sites in Russia and implements operational and administrative controls. The United States could offer general information on security measures at sensitive facilities, focusing on personnel vetting, training, and development of a security culture. Assistance in the nuclear area is provided under IAEA auspices to India and Pakistan. Licenses might be required for installing cameras or sensors at sensitive sites, but recipients are more likely to use commercially available security systems. In the biological area, there are no specific details provided. The United States is beginning to implement security measures in the biological area, but faces challenges in guarding against insider threats and theft of pathogens. Ken Alibek noted some Russian labs required personnel to strip before leaving to prevent smuggling of samples. Under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), state parties must secure and account for specified chemicals, with measures including destroying chemical weapons, continuous monitoring, and challenge inspections. In the nuclear area, security measures in Russia and other FSU countries involve removing and securing nuclear material, blending highly enriched uranium into low-enriched uranium, and implementing better material protection, control, and accounting measures. Nuclear material no longer intended for use can be stored securely. Security measures for nuclear material involve storage with tamper-proof seals, cameras, and monitoring techniques. A system of accounting and control tracks material flows for legitimate industrial or research use. International nuclear safeguards rely on state systems of accounting and control (SSACs) for measuring physical inventories. Technical exchanges and sharing of new securing techniques, like using heavy cement blocks over plutonium containers, are possible. The IAEA and Sandia National Laboratory conduct programs on physical protection, and equipment like cameras, seals, locks, or barriers can be provided under license. In the case of the Soviet Union, chaos and poverty created incentives for security measures. In the case of the Soviet Union, chaos and poverty led to incentives for scientists to develop WMD technology. The U.S. approach has been to encourage them to redirect their work to non-weapons-related areas through financial support and international science centers. Programs need to provide secure jobs, interesting work, and a commitment to nonproliferation. There is a need for a coordinated plan to prioritize expanded CTR assistance, with potential assistance divided into three tiers for critical states in the nexus of WMD and terrorism. The first tier includes \"axis of evil\" states North Korea and Iran, with equal emphasis on all four kinds of assistance. North Korea's threat lies in selling excess nuclear material to terrorists. The potential for scientists freelancing WMD wares is low due to extreme isolation. North Korea may face similar challenges as Russia in the 1990s due to lack of a market economy. In the 1990s, Russia and the FSU faced challenges due to the lack of a market economy. Interim measures may be necessary to support former WMD workers. The success of cooperative threat reduction measures would depend on the extent of change in countries like North Korea and Iran. Iran has made progress in developing nuclear capabilities, but there is limited experience in applying enhanced inspections. Iran's Additional Protocol, ratified from December 2003 to January 2006, is necessary for CTR-like assistance. IAEA inspections provide feedback on nuclear personnel issues, as Iran is known to possess chemical and likely biological weapons. Measures to secure and eradicate these weapons could be useful with political agreement. Iraq, no longer a Tier I state, received $900 million for WMD destruction. The FY2004 supplemental requests aimed to find and destroy weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Although no actual weapons were found, sites and materials were secured, and a program was established to retrain Iraqi WMD scientists. Cuba, Sudan, and Syria are identified as state sponsors of terrorism with WMD capabilities, with concerns over Syria's focus on chemical weapons. Cuba's threat is mainly in dual-use biotechnology capabilities, with mixed intelligence on their intentions and capabilities in bioweapons. The United States is working with Sudan to address concerns about its past attempts to seek chemical weapons capabilities from abroad. Assistance would likely focus on site and material security, with personnel security being less urgent due to few indigenous capabilities. Syria, on the other hand, has a known chemical weapons program and is believed to be seeking biological weapons. If Syria agrees to give up its chemical weapons, assistance could cover a range of areas from weapons to personnel security. Syrian scientists may have cooperated with other states or terrorist organizations. Assistance in biological area could focus on site and material security. Pakistan is a crucial node of terrorism and WMD proliferation due to assassination attempts on President Musharraf and nuclear assistance to North Korea, Iran, and Libya. Pakistan's nuclear program and chemical weapons assistance have raised concerns about proliferation. Despite Pakistani officials' reassurances about the security of their arsenal, there are worries about potential risks. The sensitivity surrounding nuclear weapons has hindered proposals for sharing permissive action links even between close allies like the US and UK. India's nuclear program has less proliferation potential than Pakistan, but some Indian suppliers have been sanctioned for supplying chemical weapons precursors. Assistance in the nuclear area for both India and Pakistan is limited due to their non-NPT status. President Bush announced a strategic partnership with India focusing on civilian nuclear technology, space technology, and high-technology trade. U.S. officials emphasized restrictions on the use of space and nuclear technology. Israel, unlike India and Pakistan, maintains ambiguity about its nuclear capabilities and has not faced U.S. sanctions. Assistance for Israel's nuclear program may be limited, similar to India and Pakistan. Assistance in securing nuclear programs for countries like Algeria, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia may face legal constraints due to international laws. These countries also have issues with terrorism and suspected chemical weapons capabilities. U.S. assistance could focus on site, material, and personnel security, but political, technical, and legal challenges may arise. The countries must be willing to negotiate with the U.S. to reduce the WMD threat, ideally by abandoning their programs like Libya. Countries may face challenges in admitting and abandoning their WMD programs due to political constraints. The value of such programs to national security, prestige, and regional stature must be weighed against potential benefits of abandonment. Technical hurdles also exist, raising questions about the effectiveness of threat reduction programs. The challenges of admitting and abandoning WMD programs are influenced by political and technical constraints. Some states like India, Pakistan, and Israel view nuclear weapons as essential for regional security and survival, making transparency efforts difficult. In regions like the Middle East, countries such as Israel, Iraq, and Iran have used ambiguity to conceal their WMD programs, while Pakistan's history of clandestine activities makes transparency challenging. Overcoming a culture of secrecy, as seen in Russia, may be even more difficult for other states. Professional pride could potentially foster cooperation, but political obstacles remain. Many countries may benefit from giving up their WMD programs, such as gaining political acceptance, technical assistance, and the lifting of sanctions. Libya's decision to abandon its WMD programs was influenced by the need to lift U.S. sanctions and a perception that the programs were no longer essential for national security. This cost-benefit analysis aligns with U.S. nonproliferation efforts. Efforts to promote the end of WMD programs in countries may face constraints, such as incomplete knowledge hindering assistance provision. In the case of Iraq, chaos from war and deception complicates the search for WMD-related items. Russia's political willingness for assistance does not cover all areas of its WMD programs, with limited access to military facilities. Nuclear material protection programs in Russia still have material outside of control. The United States faces challenges in gaining access to sensitive facilities in other countries, potentially hindering transparency in biological and nuclear weapons programs. Secrecy levels vary between different types of WMD programs, with some sites being known while others remain undisclosed. Countries may choose to end certain WMD programs while maintaining secrecy around others, limiting transparency efforts. Providing assistance for an ongoing WMD program could imply tacit acceptance by the United States, especially if the assistance actively helps the program. Legal constraints may prohibit certain types of assistance. Cooperation levels between the U.S. and other countries will impact the type of assistance provided. Countries that cooperate on counterterrorism may receive leniency on nonproliferation issues. The United States may overlook proliferation concerns to maintain antiterrorism cooperation in the region. Providing assistance for WMD programs requires accurate information and verification to prevent aiding capabilities. Limited knowledge about WMD programs in countries like Iran, Iraq, North Korea, and Libya poses challenges. Advanced WMD programs, like Pakistan's nuclear program, are still shrouded in mystery. The United States is concerned about Pakistan's nuclear program, particularly the amount of fissile material they possess and the location of their plutonium production reactor. Limited knowledge about WMD programs in countries like North Korea poses challenges for accurate assessments. Information from defectors has revealed more extensive biological weapons programs than previously thought. The United States is concerned about limited knowledge of WMD programs in countries like North Korea. Russia has not provided necessary access for the US to ensure goals are met in material protection programs. US assistance must not improve WMD capabilities. The United States is cautious about providing assistance that could enhance WMD capabilities in other countries. Some forms of aid, such as improving security barriers or personnel reliability testing, pose less risk. However, enhancing weapon transportation and storage security could potentially increase the operational readiness of these weapons. Treaty obligations also play a role in limiting assistance, both for the U.S. and the recipient states. The United States is cautious about providing assistance that could enhance WMD capabilities in other countries, considering treaty obligations. The relevant treaties include the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BWC). These treaties generally prohibit transferring weapons and assisting other states in acquiring them. Compliance with these treaties was not publicly questioned regarding U.S. assistance to Russia and the FSU. Assistance to Russia and the FSU, particularly in the areas of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, has been provided by the United States while ensuring compliance with relevant treaties such as the NPT, CWC, and BWC. Concerns have been raised about potential benefits to Russia's CW and BW programs, but overall, there has been no public criticism of U.S. compliance with its treaty obligations. The NPT prohibits the transfer of nuclear weapons or control over them to non-nuclear weapon states, as well as assisting these states in acquiring nuclear weapons or control over them. The definition of \"control\" is ambiguous, but the obligation extends to not indirectly transferring control through safety or security measures. The NPT interprets \"manufacture\" broadly, encompassing the entire acquisition cycle. Non-nuclear weapon states party to the NPT are obligated not to seek nuclear weapons. The NPT prohibits assisting non-nuclear weapon states in acquiring nuclear weapons. Non-NPT states like India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea are not bound by this obligation. The U.S. State Department has not defined a violation of Article I under the NPT but advises that closer assistance to nuclear weapons programs could breach international and domestic laws. Some forms of aid, like food or humanitarian aid, could indirectly support a nuclear weapons program by freeing up resources. Assistance in the form of transferrable funds may pose a greater risk of linkage to a nuclear weapons program. The CWC prohibits military preparations to use chemical weapons and assisting anyone in activities prohibited by the Convention. U.S. assistance aims to comply with the treaty, but certain actions could potentially raise concerns. Assistance that does not violate the treaty could still be seen as a breach if it enhances chemical weapons security without immediate destruction. Implementing security measures would require demilitarization steps, which could take years, as seen with the U.S. chemical weapons stockpile. Any activities with non-CWC parties could be viewed as assisting in prohibited actions under the Convention. The prohibition on aiding states or organizations in acquiring chemical agents is a key provision. The likelihood of states being reluctant to allow access to sensitive BW-related sites for assistance is small. U.S. domestic laws restrict financial assistance and exports to states with poor proliferation records or on the state sponsors of terrorism list. The U.S. domestic laws restrict financial assistance and exports to states on the state sponsors of terrorism list, as well as impose restrictions on nuclear material and weapons cooperation. These laws aim to prevent sensitive technologies from reaching suspected proliferators and allow for waivers in certain cases for national security interests. The U.S. has laws in place to prevent the spread of nuclear technology to proliferators, including restrictions on military sales, economic assistance, and exports of sensitive goods and technologies. Sanctions against Pakistan and India from 1998 are also relevant in this context. Sanctions related to the 1998 nuclear tests in Pakistan and India have been lifted, with the ability for Presidential waiver. The Energy Policy Act in 2005 amended the Atomic Energy Act to include a cutoff of nuclear exports to state sponsors of terrorism. Sanctions against countries supporting terrorism include bans on arms exports, controls on dual-use items, economic assistance prohibition, and various financial restrictions. Cuba, Libya, Iran, and North Korea are subject to comprehensive embargoes. Iran, Cuba, Libya, and North Korea are subject to comprehensive embargoes and sanctions. The \"state sponsors of terrorism list\" allows for countries to be removed if there is a change in leadership and policies, and assurance of no support for terrorism. The President must submit a report to Congress justifying the recision of support for international terrorism by a government. Iraq and Libya have been removed from the list in recent years. Other terrorism lists, such as Section 40 of the Arms Export Control Act and Section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, may also apply. Congress has a specific procedure to consider blocking the President's removal of a country from these lists. The Atomic Energy Act governs nuclear cooperation and restricts sharing of information related to nuclear weapons. Significant nuclear cooperation with states like India, Pakistan, Israel, or North Korea would require them to abandon their nuclear weapons programs and adopt full-scope safeguards. The Atomic Energy Act governs nuclear cooperation and restricts sharing of information related to nuclear weapons. Section 129 of the AEA prohibits the export of nuclear material and equipment to non-nuclear-weapon states that have engaged in certain activities. Some states face country-specific restrictions on nuclear cooperation agreements, such as North Korea under the North Korea Threat Reduction Act of 1999. The North Korea Threat Reduction Act of 1999 imposes strict conditions for nuclear cooperation with North Korea, including compliance with nuclear safeguards, access for the IAEA, implementation of denuclearization agreements, and no nuclear weapons activities. The President must notify Congress if transferring nuclear components serves national security interests. Some requirements overlap with existing laws, but others, like implementing the joint declaration, are new. The United States can share sensitive nuclear information under certain conditions outlined in Section 144 of the AEA. The Secretary of Energy and Secretary of Defense have specific roles in exchanging Restricted Data for defense purposes, including training personnel and evaluating potential enemies' capabilities. The President can authorize the exchange of Restricted Data on atomic weapons with another country to improve their nuclear weapon capabilities. The Atomic Energy Act allows the President to authorize the exchange of Restricted Data on atomic weapons with another country to enhance their nuclear weapon capabilities. Most weapons-related data, including safety and security information, are classified as restricted data. It is unlikely that the President would approve such exchanges with countries like India and Pakistan. Transfers of nuclear-related equipment may still require full-scope safeguards under NSG guidelines. NSG member states require full-scope safeguards for supplying items on the trigger list. The Department of Commerce mandates a license for exporting dual-use items to non-NSG states. The entities lists streamline the export control system, with proliferation concerns in China, India, Israel, Pakistan, and Russia. Under the 1990 Enhanced Proliferation Control Initiative (EPCI), the Department of Commerce can impose licensing requirements on exports and reexports of goods and technology that pose a risk of diversion to activities related to nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons or missile proliferation. U.S. exporters must apply for a license if they know or have reason to believe that the exports will be used in nuclear explosive activities, unsafeguarded nuclear activities, or activities to produce special nuclear material. The Export Administration Regulations outline criteria for assessing license applications related to nuclear activities, including nonproliferation credentials of importing countries. The United States has provided nonproliferation assistance to countries lacking resources to address proliferation issues. However, questions arise regarding the US's capacity to address multiple proliferation problems through bilateral agreements. The United States faces challenges in addressing multiple proliferation problems through bilateral approaches, which may undermine international institutions and support for U.S. policy objectives. Without clear disarmament steps, assistance could be seen as rewarding bad behavior, particularly concerning North Korea. Treaty compliance issues may arise for states party to the NPT, BWC, and/or CWC. The challenges of addressing proliferation problems through bilateral approaches may undermine international institutions and support for U.S. policy objectives. Compliance issues with the NPT, BWC, and CWC treaties are a concern, with examples like Russia's delayed declaration of an offensive BW program and suspicions of CW capabilities in Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and Israel. Questions arise about handling noncompliance, verification of destruction, and the role of international organizations like the OPCW in overseeing disarmament efforts. President Bush's proposal for peaceful nuclear cooperation with India has raised concerns about legitimizing India's nuclear weapons program. The acceptance of assistance from nuclear proliferators could confer acceptance of their nuclear weapons status, posing challenges for the nonproliferation regime. The status of Iran and North Korea's nuclear weapons remains uncertain. The impact of assistance to \"new nuclear states\" on the nonproliferation regime is questioned due to the broken nuclear programs of various countries. Some believe that verifying compliance with treaties like CWC or BWC is nearly impossible and new tools are needed to address the threat. The challenge of eliminating the nexus between terrorism and WMDs involves gaining cooperation from diverse states, including non-traditional allies of the United States. The United States is facing challenges in dealing with former state supporters of terrorism and proliferators like Libya. Libya, despite being a successful supporter of terrorism, gave up these activities in exchange for economic sanctions relief. The issue of states retaining WMD programs without the stigma of being a proliferator, like Pakistan, is a concern for the Bush Administration. Pakistan's proliferation activities have raised concerns for the Bush Administration in the war against terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. Despite evidence of sales of uranium enrichment equipment to Iran and Libya, Pakistan has not been pressed on its activities due to its support in the war against terrorism. The change in nonproliferation policy can be traced back to the September 2002 National Security Strategy. The September 2002 National Security Strategy highlighted the threat of radicalism and technology, with a focus on combating weapons of mass destruction (WMD). This shift in policy towards terrorism and hostile states may overlook the proliferation activities of friendly states. The 109th Congress considered these challenges. The 109th Congress considered legislation that could restrict the provision of CTR assistance to certain countries, including Cuba, Libya, North Korea, Iran, and Syria. The Iran Freedom Support Act and the Iran-Libya Sanction Act also impact the supply of CTR assistance. The Iran-Libya Sanction Act (P.L. 104-172) has been extended through September 2011 by the Iran Freedom Support Act (P.L. 109-293). Sudan has been restricted from receiving U.S. assistance since 1997 through various executive orders and U.S. laws. Legislation considered by the 109th Congress could impact third-party states receiving CTR assistance. Examples include prohibiting assistance to countries providing military equipment to State Sponsors of Terrorism. In its oversight capacity, Congress may consider expanding CTR assistance, potentially leading to increased costs depending on program objectives. Nuclear programs in India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea are smaller than Russia's, but data on their nuclear materials are limited. The state of nuclear materials in countries like India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea is not well-documented, making it challenging to determine the scope and timeline of any nuclear program. The costs of implementing such a program could vary depending on the approach taken, ranging from minimal for a low-technology solution to substantial for a high-technology solution. Managing multiple programs could pose difficulties, as seen in the Nunn-Lugar program's restrictions on providing assistance to certain entities. The President must certify to Congress that proposed recipients are committed to dismantling weapons, forgoing military modernization, and complying with arms control agreements. Certifications provide leverage but may cause delays in implementing CTR programs. In the FY2006 National Defense Authorization Act, certification requirements were extended indefinitely, posing delays in CTR programs. The FY2007 National Defense Authorization Act did not repeal restrictions on U.S. assistance to non-democratic countries. Congress may need to consider implications of aiding such countries. Pakistan's exemption from restrictions on foreign assistance was extended through FY2006 and potentially through FY2007 if the foreign operation FY2007 appropriation bill passes Congress. The law extends Pakistan's exemption from foreign assistance restrictions through FY2007 if the appropriation bill passes. Key issues include President Musharraf's restoration of democracy and the impact of continued military leadership on U.S. cooperative efforts. Relevant treaty texts address obligations not to assist non-weapon states in acquiring nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons capabilities. The Chemical Weapons Convention prohibits states from developing, producing, acquiring, stockpiling, or using chemical weapons, and from assisting others in these activities. The Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention prohibits states from transferring or assisting others in acquiring biological weapons. The Chemical Weapons Convention prohibits states from assisting in the manufacture or acquisition of specified agents, toxins, weapons, equipment, or means of delivery."
