    "content": "The \"Chronic Wasting Disease State Support Act of 2002\" defines chronic wasting disease as a transmissible nervous system disease affecting deer and elk. It is part of the group of diseases known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, which includes scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and Cruetzfeldt-Jakob disease. Congress acknowledges the States' authority in wildlife management, particularly in addressing chronic wasting disease in deer and elk populations. The increasing spread of this fatal neurological disease necessitates intensified research, surveillance, and management efforts to contain and eradicate it. The Federal Government should provide financial and technical support to States managing chronic wasting disease in cervid populations. Relevant Federal agencies must offer consistent support structures for State wildlife and agricultural administrators to prevent the spread of the disease between captive and wild cervids. The Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Agriculture, and other Federal authorities should be involved in providing support. The Federal Government, including the Secretary of Agriculture, can offer integrated support systems under existing legal authorities for agriculture and other affected Federal authorities. The Department of the Interior is conducting computer modeling to track disease spread in wild cervid populations. The Secretary of the Interior will establish a modeling program to predict chronic wasting disease spread in wild deer and elk. Computer modeling will identify disease concentration areas for targeting control efforts. Data will be integrated in GIS format with land use, soils, elevation, environmental conditions, and wildlife data. $1,000,000 is authorized for this program. SEC. 102. Surveillance and monitoring program for chronic wasting disease in wild deer and elk herds. The Secretary of the Interior will conduct a surveillance program on Federal lands to identify chronic wasting disease in wild deer and elk herds, determine the spread of the disease, and identify potential reservoirs of infection. Tribal governments will receive assistance in managing the disease on tribal lands. $3,000,000 is authorized for this program. The Secretary of the Interior has been allocated $3,000,000 to establish and support a surveillance and monitoring program for chronic wasting disease in wild deer and elk herds on Federal lands. SEC. 201. NATIONAL REPOSITORY OF INFORMATION REGARDING CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE. The United States Department of Agriculture will develop and maintain an internet-based web site displaying data on chronic wasting disease in wild and captive cervid populations. The site will also include modeling information on the disease's spread in the US and other relevant information from various sources. The national repository will be available for Federal and State agencies managing chronic wasting disease. The United States Department of Agriculture will establish a national repository for chronic wasting disease data, accessible to Federal and State agencies, as well as the general public upon request. SEC. 202. SAMPLING AND TESTING PROTOCOLS. The Secretary of Agriculture will release guidelines for the collection of animal tissue for chronic wasting disease testing, a protocol for laboratory assessment, and a certification program for laboratories within specific timeframes after the enactment of the Act. The Secretary of Agriculture will accelerate research into developing live animal tests for chronic wasting disease, including field diagnostic tests, and testing protocols to reduce processing time. SEC. 203. ERADICATION OF CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE IN HERDS OF DEER AND ELK. The Secretary of Agriculture will develop a program to identify chronic wasting disease infection in captive deer and elk herds, provide assistance to states and tribal governments for surveillance programs, and cooperate with agencies managing the disease in captive wildlife. Grantees must submit a plan to monitor chronic wasting disease in captive wildlife and reduce disease spread through transport. The Secretary of Agriculture may restrict interstate movement of animals or articles to prevent disease introduction. The Secretary of Agriculture may prohibit interstate movement of animals or articles to prevent chronic wasting disease introduction. The Secretary, in cooperation with the Secretary of the Interior, will establish standards for sample collection. $2,000,000 is authorized for Agriculture Secretary activities. SEC. 204. EXPANSION OF DIAGNOSTIC TESTING CAPACITY. Expansion of diagnostic testing capacity includes upgrading federal and certified laboratories to process samples from surveillance programs for chronic wasting disease. Grants will be provided for laboratory upgrades under the Competitive, Special and Facilities Research Grant Act. The Secretary shall make grants to upgrade certified laboratories for timely sample processing in response to surveillance programs. $7,500,000 is authorized for this purpose. Expansion of Agricultural Research Service research to focus on chronic wasting disease, including detection, genetic resistance, tissue studies, and environmental studies. $1,000,000 authorized for this purpose. Additionally, expansion of Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service supported research and education. The Secretary of Agriculture will expand research and educational efforts on chronic wasting disease. $3,000,000 is authorized for research and $1,000,000 for educational outreach. Authorization of appropriations is provided for these purposes. Within 60 days of enactment, the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior will coordinate to prevent chronic wasting disease spread. A report to Congress within 180 days will detail actions taken and recommend further legislative steps. SEC. 302. Interagency grants for state and tribal efforts to manage chronic wasting disease in wildlife. The Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior will develop a grant program to allocate funds to State agencies for managing chronic wasting disease in wildlife. Priority for funding will be based on the scope of the disease incidence and expenditures on disease management, surveillance, and research. The grant program will prioritize funding for States and tribal governments with significant financial commitment to managing chronic wasting disease. It aims to establish comprehensive policies and programs for disease management, promote integration between wildlife and agricultural agencies, and ensure rapid response to new outbreaks to contain the disease. Authorization of $10,000,000 for containing disease in new infection areas. SEC. 303. RULEMAKING. Joint Rulemaking: The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture will jointly promulgate rules to ensure compatibility of surveillance and monitoring programs required by the Act for inclusion in the national database, without following certain procedural requirements. In joint rulemaking, the Secretary of the Interior and Agriculture will use authority from title 5, United States Code. This does not delay Agriculture Secretary's rules on captive deer or elk transportation or affect existing laws on chronic wasting disease."
