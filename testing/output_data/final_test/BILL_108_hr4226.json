    "content": "The Act may be cited as \"Cape Town Treaty Implementation Act of 2004\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings section. The Cape Town Treaty extends modern commercial laws for the sale, finance, and lease of aircraft and aircraft engines internationally, providing greater security and economic benefits to the aviation and aerospace sectors. The Cape Town Treaty aims to facilitate the acquisition of newer, safer aircraft globally. The United States only needs technical changes to its laws for implementation since the treaty's concepts are already reflected in the Uniform Commercial Code. The new electronic registry system will complement the existing aircraft document recordation systems of the Federal Aviation Administration. The US Government played a key role in developing the Cape Town Treaty. The purpose of this Act is to implement the treaty in the US by making technical amendments to relevant laws. The Federal Aviation Administration is directed to expedite rulemaking processes and clarify the Treaty's applicability during the process under title 49, United States Code. SEC. 3. RECORDATION OF SECURITY INSTRUMENTS. Section 44107(a) of title 49, United States Code is amended to establish a system with changes in paragraph (2)(A) and (3). Additionally, a new section is added for the International Registry designating the Federal Aviation Administration Civil Aviation Registry as the United States Entry Point for civil aircraft, aircraft with a US identification number, and aircraft engines under the Cape Town Treaty. The Administrator will establish a system for filing notices of prospective assignments, international interests, and sales of aircraft or aircraft engines under the Cape Town Treaty. The validity of such filings and registrations with the International Registry will expire after 60 days unless related documents are recorded within that time frame. The validity of filings and registrations with the International Registry expires after 60 days unless related documents are recorded within that time frame. Registration with the International Registry for an aircraft is only valid if the person files eligible documents with the United States Entry Point and receives authorization. SEC. 4. REGULATIONS. The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration will issue regulations to implement the Act, specifying requirements for aircraft registration and cancellation based on the Cape Town Treaty. The regulations must be finalized by December 31, 2004, and will only take effect once the Treaty is in force in the United States. The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration will issue regulations based on the Cape Town Treaty, with Articles IX(5) and XIII applying until the final rule is effective or December 31, 2004. Economic analysis of the final rule is not required. SEC. 5 amends Section 44108(c)(2) of title 49, United States Code, to include the Cape Town Treaty. SEC. 6 adds definitions to Chapter 441 of title 49, United States Code. SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE AND PRESERVATION OF PRIOR RIGHTS. This section defines key terms such as Cape Town Treaty, United States Entry Point, and International Registry in relation to aviation regulations. The Act, along with any amendments, will take effect when the Cape Town Treaty enters into force in the United States. It will not affect any registrations or legal rights made before this date under chapter 441 of the title."
