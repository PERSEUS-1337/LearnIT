    "content": "Suicide attacks by terrorist organizations have become a global threat, especially after 9/11 when the vulnerability of the U.S. to such attacks was realized. The potential use of new technologies in these attacks adds to the concern, despite the absence of \"weapons of mass destruction\" in the September 11th attacks. The threat of suicide attacks by terrorist organizations, potentially using modern weapons technology, is a major concern globally. The increasing advocacy for martyrdom operations and interest in weapons like chemical, biological, nuclear, or radiological ones by groups like Al Qaeda raises worries. The focus is on the patterns, motivations, and potential future attacks against Americans and their interests. The report aims to summarize the lessons from international experience with suicide attacks and their relevance to the United States. The choice of language in describing terrorism is crucial. Some use the term \"suicide bombings,\" but this is too narrow as suicide attacks can involve various weapons beyond explosives. For this report, the term \"suicide attacks\" will be used to describe events where the success of the operation requires the death of the perpetrator. Different terms like \"genocide bombings,\" \"homicide attacks,\" \"martyrdom operations,\" and \"suicide operations\" are also used to describe such acts, each emphasizing different aspects of the attacks. The report focuses on suicide attacks carried out by nonstate actors for political ends against civilian targets. These attacks involve the death of the perpetrator, who is aware of this in advance. The report excludes high-risk military operations and self-inflicted deaths without outward violence. Understanding suicide attacks requires placing them in a broader historical context. Terrorist suicide attacks have a lengthy historical background, with groups like the Muslim Assassins engaging in deliberate self-sacrifice by using daggers to kill civilian targets for symbolic effect. These groups sought martyrdom and publicity by attacking prominent officials in public places. The Muslim Assassins sought martyrdom and publicity by attacking officials in public places. The group's admiration for martyrdom in killing is a historical precursor to modern suicide attacks by Islamic terrorist organizations. Additionally, historical examples of suicide attacks were found among Muslim communities in Asia during the eighteenth to early twentieth centuries, aimed at inflicting punishment on European colonial powers. Perpetrators engaged in religious rituals before attacks, aspiring to a heroic status of martyrdom. The use of suicide attacks as a terrorist technique is not exclusive to one culture or religion. With the invention of dynamite in the late 19th century, bombs became a favored method in terrorist attacks, including suicide tactics. For example, Russian radicals in the late 19th century sought martyrdom by putting themselves close enough to the target to ensure success. Suicide attacks were valued by terrorists as a way to legitimize their cause and attract new recruits. However, with advancements in explosives and technology, suicide attacks became less common in the twentieth century. Instead, methods like pre-placed or remotely detonated explosives were favored. In the mid-twentieth century, terrorist attacks evolved from pre-placed explosives to suicide attacks, especially after the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut. The 1983 Beirut attacks killed 241 off-duty U.S. soldiers and 58 French soldiers, leading to the withdrawal of U.S. and French forces from Lebanon. This event marked the success of suicide attacks against Western powers, prompting a shift in targeting towards Israeli Defense Forces and South Lebanese Army posts. The Beirut bombing indirectly initiated a ruthless suicide campaign by the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka in May 1987. The Tamil Tigers, led by Velupillai Prabhakaran, were inspired by the 1983 Beirut attacks and have been responsible for over half of all suicide attacks globally. Suicide attacks have been used by various groups worldwide, including Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and Hezbollah. The Fatah movement, Al-Ansar Mujahidin in Chechnya, Egyptian Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Armed Islamic Group of Algeria, Barbar Khalsa International, Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, Kurdistan Worker's Party, and Al Qaeda are among the groups involved in suicide attacks. Counterterrorism experts are concerned about the increasing use of suicide attacks globally, particularly targeting Americans. Research shows that terrorists involved in suicide attacks are usually psychologically normal and the attacks are premeditated. The motivations for suicide attacks are similar to other types of terrorism, including attention to a cause, personal notoriety, anger, revenge, and retribution against perceived injustice. Suicide attackers may seek to impress an audience and be remembered, especially if they feel their lives lack significance. Some attackers are widows or bereaved siblings seeking vengeance. In recent years, an increasing number of women are carrying out suicide attacks, driven by a longing for religious purity, commitment to the group's welfare, and societal factors like widowhood. The central role of culture or ideology, as seen in Palestinian groups, can inspire a subculture of martyrdom, influencing children growing up in such environments. In a culture glorifying sacrifice for the Palestinian cause, attackers are motivated by social, cultural, religious, and material incentives, including spiritual rewards. Some are driven by a sense of humiliation or injustice, especially among unemployed and frustrated individuals. Desperation is often cited as a reason for suicide attacks, seen as a last resort by Palestinians. Suicide attacks are considered a last resort and are often associated with the Islamicization of conflicts. Al Qaeda's use of suicide attacks is well-known, and there are growing links between this organization and other local indigenous groups. Recent suicide attacks in Chechnya and Morocco are seen as indicators of radical Islamist influence. The August 2003 suicide attacks in Jordan and Iraq suggest a shift towards more active involvement of radical groups. Iraq may reflect a shift from local resistance to outside Islamist fighters. Martyrdom is not just religious, but also a powerful element in secular traditions. Secular groups like the Tamil Tigers and the PKK have carried out a larger proportion of suicide attacks in the last twenty years than religiously-motivated groups. Following the September 11th attacks, the concept of a typical profile for suicide attackers has been reexamined. Previous assumptions based on Hamas members being male, young, unmarried, and uneducated have proven inadequate. Older, well-educated individuals like Mohammed Atta have participated in attacks. In the Palestinian intifada, diverse operatives including college students, middle-aged married men, and even women and children have carried out suicide attacks, leading some to argue that there is no clear pattern to these profiles. As we move into the twenty-first century, stereotypes about terrorist suicide attackers are disappearing. Research shows that attackers are not necessarily \"crazy\" but are often influenced by group pressures and beliefs. The role of the organization is crucial in planning and executing suicide attacks, with experts emphasizing that the organization's influence is more significant than the individual's identity. Most modern suicide attacks involve a well-developed organization. Suicide attacks in the modern era are carried out by well-organized terrorist groups, with a strategic choice to cause maximum casualties. These attacks have been shown to result in a significantly higher number of deaths compared to other forms of terrorism. For example, between 2000 and 2002, suicide attacks accounted for only 1% of total attacks but caused 44% of Israeli casualties. This high casualty rate inflicts both physical and psychological damage on the targeted state or community. Suicide attacks cause significant physical and psychological damage to the targeted state or community, potentially leading to government responses in the form of concessions or retaliations. These attacks attract more publicity than other forms of terrorism and can serve the interests of the terrorist campaign by increasing psychological leverage and drawing international condemnation. Suicide attacks draw public attention and aim to impress upon an audience through shocking violence. Media coverage helps publicize the terrorists' cause, and martyrdom symbolizes commitment to a cause. Groups may glorify members' deaths to emphasize the irreversible nature of their actions. Suicide attackers are often glorified by groups, creating a \"culture of martyrdom\" that attracts recruits. Sponsoring organizations may see attackers as assets for political or monetary gain. Suicide attacks can be used to gain advantage over rival groups, as seen in cases like Palestinian groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad. The organization's involvement is evident in the style and content of attackers' videotapes. The style and content of videotapes made by suicide attackers often show them holding weapons and explaining their motivations. These videos serve as a powerful tool for recruitment and motivation within terrorist groups. Suicide attacks are financially inexpensive but can yield large monetary rewards for organizations. Support for terrorist organizations can come from distant sources, such as donors sympathetic to suicide attackers. For example, a Saudi telethon raised over $100 million for Palestinians after a bombing. The Tamil Tigers have received funding from Tamil diaspora abroad, sending back an estimated $150 million annually. Payments and benefits are given to families of dead attackers. The use of suicide operatives helps control the timing and placement of attacks. Suicide attacks allow for precise control over timing and placement of attacks, with the attacker acting as the ultimate \"smart bomb.\" The lack of an escape route reduces complexity, while also minimizing risks such as intelligence leaks and capture. Additionally, suicide attacks can instill fear and intimidation in the target population. Suicide attackers are perceived as unstoppable due to logistical challenges and a sense of desperate determination. Terrorist organizations benefit from perpetuating the stereotype of fanatics and the idea of numerous recruits ready to replace them. Prospective attackers engage in rituals that make it difficult to back out without losing honor and societal standing. Members of terrorist organizations undergo elaborate psychological preparation for suicide attacks, including lying in graves to experience peace after death. Recruits form close relationships and compete to be chosen for missions, often leaving letters or videos for loved ones. Captured operatives who fail their mission may see themselves as \"half martyrs.\" The actual attack is portrayed as an afterthought after intense preparation. Palestinian groups aim to maximize human suffering not only during the explosion but also in the aftermath. Suicide attacks in Israel are designed to maximize human suffering by embedding explosives with foreign objects like shrapnel, nails, bolts, screws, and ball bearings. Chemicals like rat poison are also added to make it harder for rescue workers to stop bleeding. This can have long-lasting psychological effects on both victims and the population. Additionally, trying to stop a suicide attack can result in premature detonation, leading to increased wariness among police and soldiers. The use of women in suicide attacks is a growing concern, indicating a broadening of recruitment by terrorist groups. Female participation in terrorism, especially in suicide attacks, is on the rise, potentially leading to deep polarization and violence in target societies. Female suicide attackers, particularly among the Tamil Tigers (LTTE), exploit the reluctance in conservative societies to search women, giving them an advantage. The LTTE, including the Black Tigers, involve both male and female children as young as 10 in suicide missions. About a third of LTTE's suicide operations are carried out by women. Notably, a female suicide bomber killed Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 by disguising explosives as a pregnancy. In the 1980s, women in the Middle East engaged in suicide missions, such as a 16-year-old Shi'a school girl who drove a car packed with explosives into an Israeli checkpoint, killing herself and two soldiers. These attacks targeted military sites, not civilians. The use of female suicide bombers in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been seen as a desperate act by some, while others view it as a tactical evolution in terrorist tactics. The first confirmed instance occurred in January 2002 when a 28-year-old Palestinian woman, Wafa Idrees, detonated herself outside a shoe shop in Jerusalem, killing an Israeli man and injuring over 100 people, including an American lawyer. Several female suicide attacks have occurred in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with women being armed and prepared by militant groups like the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades and PKK. These attacks were not voluntary, as attackers were chosen by leadership for their missions. The PKK leadership chose members for suicide missions, using coercion and violence to ensure participation. Female attackers were preferred due to perceived expendability and burden on male members. Chechen women also increasingly participate in suicide attacks against Russian targets. Female Chechen suicide attackers target Russian forces, often motivated by personal losses. Referred to as \"black widows\" by the Kremlin, they are pushed into suicide missions due to societal exclusion. This trend signifies desperation in the fight for independence and a shift towards using women in attacks. Most Palestinians support terrorist organizations using women and children in attacks, with enthusiasm initially increasing after suicide attacks. Concern lies in long-term population acquiescence, especially in Chechnya and among Palestinians. Groups engaging in suicide attacks typically focus on causes geographically distant from the United States. Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the PKK, and the Tamil are among the groups likely to use suicide attacks. The use of suicide attacks has evolved globally, with a widening geographical distribution and targeting. Al Qaeda is the most effective global network associated with suicide attacks, and they are the most likely to target Americans in the future. Al Qaeda, a global network of militant Islamic groups, has a history of using suicide attacks. These attacks have evolved from supporting insurgencies to directly targeting American and Western interests. Notable attacks include the 1998 bombings of U.S. Embassies in Africa and the 2000 attack on the U.S.S. Cole in Yemen. The September 11th attacks, the U.S.S. Cole attack, and other planned suicide attacks by Al Qaeda have resulted in significant casualties. There is a trend of increasing use of suicide tactics by the organization, with connections to Chechen militant groups. Hamas and Islamic Jihad have not been linked to Al Qaeda. The increasing use of suicide attacks in Russia and Chechnya is concerning due to potential radical Islamist influence among Chechens. Al Qaeda supports Pakistani groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and there are signs of outside fighters being responsible for major suicide attacks in Iraq. The globalization of Al Qaeda blurs their role in these attacks, with knowledge being disseminated internationally through the Internet. Jihad manuals and encyclopedias are available online. The increasing globalization of terrorism has led to the globalization of suicide tactics, with the potential use of female suicide attackers by Al Qaeda being a concern for the FBI. Al Qaeda may be preparing women for \"martyrdom operations,\" as reported in an Arabic-language newspaper. Al Qaeda is reportedly setting up training camps to prepare women for suicide attacks, as the FBI issues alerts to law enforcement agencies. The capture of senior leaders could lead to an increase in women operatives being used for missions. Different types of suicide attacks in Iraq are directed towards U.S. military forces and noncombatant targets. Suicide attacks in Iraq, including those carried out by Iraqi women, have been observed targeting U.S. military forces. Techniques for these attacks are shared among groups, making it challenging to identify perpetrators. Al Qaeda has called for attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq, with some groups claiming responsibility for these attacks. Training camps for Arab volunteers willing to carry out suicide bombings have been reported. In Iraq, suicide attacks targeting U.S. forces have been carried out by Iraqi women and Arab volunteers trained in camps. Weapons caches for suicide bombers have been found in Basra and Baghdad. Postwar violence was initially attributed to Saddam Hussein loyalists and Ba'ath party members, using guerrilla tactics against U.S. forces. The postwar violence in Iraq initially involved attacks on U.S. forces using weapons like rocket propelled grenades and explosives. Attacks on Iraqi infrastructure aimed to disrupt rebuilding efforts. Suicide attacks on civilian targets in August 2003 signaled a shift towards coordinated terrorist campaigns involving foreign elements. The threat of terrorist campaigns involving foreign elements is difficult to predict and prevent, especially suicide attacks. Offensive measures like preemptive strikes, intelligence collection, and disrupting terrorist organizations can help reduce the severity of attacks. These measures, often used by the Israeli Defense Forces, aim to undermine the organization's ability to operate through military operations, cutting off funding, and targeting leaders. Targeted killings, preemptive attacks, and disrupting known operatives or training camps are strategies employed by the Israeli Defense Forces to undermine terrorist organizations. While capturing or killing leaders can disrupt operations, it may also energize followers to act in the name of the \"martyr.\" Operations that enrage the population can lead to increased recruitment and rapid reconstruction of the organization. The importance of intelligence gathering in countering terrorist groups is highlighted, as it can provide critical information on their activities and dynamics. International cooperation in intelligence gathering is crucial, especially in regions where terrorist activities are prevalent. International cooperation in intelligence gathering is crucial in unfamiliar regions to prevent and retaliate against attacks. Efforts to reduce terrorist recruitment involve altering political, cultural, and socio-economic contexts. These measures aim to improve quality of life, social stability, and provide opportunities for political expression, employment, and education. Defensive measures against suicide attacks aim to prevent perpetrators from reaching their target, making it harder for terrorist organizations to succeed. This includes physical barriers, security screening, and strict border controls. Some also suggest reducing the quantity or profile of attacks. Some suggest reducing potentially symbolic targets by restricting travel in dangerous areas and controlling sensitive information availability. Preparing the public to respond calmly can also deter attacks. These anti-terrorism measures are crucial in denying terrorist organizations their most attractive targets and making spectacular strikes less appealing. The question of reducing suicide attacks against the US and its interests is crucial to Congress, especially in determining future funding levels for homeland security, defense, and foreign operations. Balancing measures like homeland security and force protection with proactive approaches like targeted foreign aid programs, public diplomacy, and intelligence for counterterrorism is key. Concerns also lie in the competing requirements for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as domestic homeland security. Increasing casualties from additional suicide attacks could impact these calculations. Another area of concern is implementing better strategies. Spending on counterterrorism measures and threat assessments for suicide attacks on U.S. interests is a growing concern. Better analysis of the evolving threat and understanding terrorist organizations is needed. Intelligence for counterterrorism remains a serious issue, requiring well-qualified personnel. The United States lacks a sufficient number of well-trained individuals to analyze terrorist organizations in depth, especially compared to other major powers. Traditional academic institutions are hesitant to support terrorism studies, which hinders the ability to effectively combat terrorism. Access to classified sources and thorough analysis of open-source literature are crucial for successful counterterrorism efforts. Additional civilian and military training support is necessary in the age of globalization. Efforts to combat terrorism may involve support for civilian and military training programs, funding initiatives like the Middle East Partnership Initiative, and improving public diplomacy. These measures aim to reduce the constituencies for terrorist organizations and deter individuals from engaging in terrorism. Efforts to combat terrorism may involve support for civilian and military training programs, funding initiatives like the Middle East Partnership Initiative, and improving public diplomacy. Measures to deter suicide attacks include outlawing payments to families of attackers, holding states accountable for supporting terrorism, denying visas to family members of attackers, and promoting moderate Islamic clerics to condemn such acts. Congressional oversight of Defense Department activities in Iraq will be influenced by the evolution of resistance forces and continued suicide attacks. The evolution of resistance forces and continued suicide attacks in Iraq could have significant effects on the postwar effort. Developing effective countermeasures against suicide attacks is crucial for the success of U.S. policy in Iraq and beyond."
