    "content": "President Obama submitted his FY2017 budget request on February 9, 2016, which included $46.5 billion for agencies funded through the FSGG appropriations bill. The House Committee on Appropriations reported a bill with a total funding of $43.5 billion for FY2017, including $250 million for the CFTC in the Agriculture appropriations bill. The House of Representatives passed the bill on July 7, 2016, with some funding amendments. The House of Representatives passed H.R. 5485 on July 7, 2016, with funding shifts among FSGG agencies but overall levels unchanged. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported S. 3067 on June 16, 2016, appropriating $44.4 billion for FY2017, $2.2 billion below the President's request. H.R. 5325 / P.L. 114-223 provided continuing appropriations through December 9, 2016, with a 0.496% across-the-board decrease for most FSGG agencies. The House of Representatives passed H.R. 244 on May 3, 2017, with Senate passage on May 4 and enactment on May 5, providing FY2017 FSGG appropriations totaling $43.3 billion, $3.2 billion below the President's request. Two additional CRs were enacted, providing funding through April 28, 2017 (P.L. 114-254) and May 5, 2017 (P.L. 115-30). The CR contained anomalies related to presidential transition funding. The FY2017 FSGG appropriations totaled $43.3 billion, $3.2 billion below the President's request. The bill does not include funding for the regulation of much of the financial services industry, which is often subdivided into banking, insurance, and securities. Federal regulation of the banking industry is divided among the Federal Reserve, FDIC, OCC, and CFPB. Credit unions are regulated by NCUA. Insurance is regulated at the state level with some oversight by the Federal Reserve. Securities regulation is at the federal level. The funding for financial regulatory agencies is divided between the SEC and the CFTC, with the SEC funded through fees collected offset by the FSGG bill. H.R. 5485 proposes changes to the funding procedure for the CFPB, shifting to congressional appropriations instead of funds transferred from the Federal Reserve. Other provisions in the bill include amending the Dodd-Frank Act to change the leadership of the CFPB to a five-person commission. The FSGG bill proposed changes to the leadership of the CFPB and the FSOC. P.L. 115-31 did not include these provisions. House and Senate Committees on Appropriations reorganized their subcommittee structures in 2007, creating a new Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee. The Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee was created in 2007 as part of a reorganization of House and Senate Appropriations Committees. It now oversees agencies like the FCC, FTC, SEC, and SBA, which were previously under different subcommittees. The House and Senate FSGG Subcommittees have similar jurisdictions after a reorganization, with the CFTC falling under the Senate's FSGG Subcommittee and the House's Agriculture Subcommittee. Various departments and agencies funded through FSGG appropriations are listed in Table 4 along with contact information for CRS experts."
