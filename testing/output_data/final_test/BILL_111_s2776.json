    "content": "The \"Clean Energy Act of 2009\" may be cited as the official title of the Act. Congress acknowledges that nuclear energy plays a significant role in the United States, providing 19% of the country's electricity and 70% of carbon-dioxide free electricity. It also recognizes the low land-use requirements of nuclear energy compared to other sources. The majority of operating reactors in the US were built between 1970 and 1990. Congress believes that expanding nuclear energy, including through small reactors and advanced fuel cycles, would help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and maintain low electricity prices. SEC. 3. REVISIONS TO LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM AUTHORITY. The definition of commercial technology under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to exclude technologies used solely for demonstration projects or projects approved for a loan guarantee. Additionally, the rights of the Secretary regarding property acquired through the program are clarified. The guarantee agreement ensures that the rights of the United States regarding property acquired through the program are superior to others, with detailed terms to protect interests in case of default, provide necessary patents and technology, and share proceeds from asset sales. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 ensures that the United States has superior rights over project assets in case of default, with necessary lien priority and fees collected for administrative expenses. The Secretary has the authority to adjust fees to promote eligible projects under this title. 75 percent of fees at the conditional commitment stage are refundable if there is no financial close, unless administrative costs exceed the amount retained. Credit rating may not be relevant for support determination. The Secretary may waive the requirement for a third-party credit report. Accelerated reviews aim to issue decisions on loan guarantee applications within 180 days. Eligible projects include those with credit ratings. Section 1704 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to allocate not less than $10,000,000,000 for subsidies, including nuclear power parts, services, and fuel suppliers. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 allocates $10 billion for subsidies, including nuclear power components and services. Additionally, Section 4 addresses the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 allocates $10 billion for subsidies, including nuclear power components and services. Congress supports the convening of a blue-ribbon panel for the development of a Federal nuclear waste policy. The Secretary is authorized to enter into cooperative agreements for the development of small nuclear reactor designs with capacities less than 350 megawatts per unit. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 allocates $10 billion for subsidies, including nuclear power components and services. Congress supports the convening of a blue-ribbon panel for the development of a Federal nuclear waste policy. The Secretary is authorized to enter into cooperative agreements for the development of small nuclear reactor designs with capacities less than 350 megawatts per unit. The Secretary shall ensure that only the most feasible designs are submitted to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for certification and licensing, paying 50 percent of any fees arising from the process. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 provides $10 billion for nuclear power subsidies, including components and services. A blue-ribbon panel is supported for Federal nuclear waste policy development. The Secretary can enter cooperative agreements for small nuclear reactor designs under 350 megawatts. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission must report on application status within 90 days. $200 million is authorized for each fiscal year for this purpose. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorizes $200 million annually for nuclear waste disposal capacity considerations in nuclear facility applications under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. SEC. 5. FUNDING FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND RESEARCH. Authorization of $100,000,000 annually from 2011 to 2020 for nuclear workforce education to train workers and develop educational programs. Cooperative programs for secondary schools and postsecondary institutions are authorized. $50,000,000 annually for nuclear reactor research and $750,000,000 annually for clean energy research and development from 2011 to 2020. The funds allocated for research and development in various areas from 2011 to 2020 include $150,000,000 each for liquid transportation biofuels, carbon dioxide capture/storage/conversion, reducing battery costs for electric vehicles, and making solar electricity cost-competitive. Research and development funding of $150,000,000 is allocated to make solar electricity cost-competitive and to recycle used nuclear fuel, including Generation IV nuclear reactors."
