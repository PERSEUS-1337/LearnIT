The Congress finds disparities in health care for racial and ethnic minorities, including higher mortality rates and serious disparities in health access outcomes. African-American children have higher rates of asthma and mortality compared to white children. African Americans face disparities in health outcomes, with higher rates of asthma, cancer mortality, advanced breast cancer diagnoses, diabetes death rates, heart disease mortality, and AIDS cases compared to whites and Latinos. The annual AIDS case rate is 4 times higher for Latinos than for whites. Infant mortality rates are twice as high among African-American infants as whites. Studies show that even well-meaning physicians demonstrate unconscious negative racial attitudes. The Cultural Competence Commission is established by this Act to address disparities in healthcare, including higher AIDS rates among Latinos and infant mortality rates among African-Americans. The Commission's duties include promoting cultural competence in healthcare. The Commission will conduct a study and submit a report on establishing standards in cultural competence education for medical professionals, mandating training requirements for high-quality patient care, collaborating with healthcare organizations to update clinical guidelines for patients of color, and engaging diverse organizations for leadership. The national consortium for African-American children prioritizes cultural competence training in school-based health settings, collaborates with diverse organizations to address the needs of vulnerable populations, and works with geriatric experts to improve access to culturally competent care for seniors in long-term care facilities. Increasing outcomes-based research to assess improvements in health care outcomes for minority patients through cultural competence education, broadening access to culturally competent health education, conducting a national policy forum to inform legislators about cultural competence programs, facilitating improvements in provider-patient interactions through cross-cultural education, health literacy training, and creating incentives for providers with expertise in cultural competence.
