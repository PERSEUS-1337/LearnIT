Congress has three formal methods to combat non-compliance, including the inherent contempt power to detain and imprison a contemnor until compliance is achieved. Congress has three formal methods to combat non-compliance with congressional subpoenas: inherent contempt power, criminal contempt, and reliance on the judicial branch for enforcement. Inherent contempt allows Congress to detain a contemnor until compliance is achieved, criminal contempt permits prosecution for non-compliance, and the judicial branch can enforce compliance through civil judgments. The power of Congress to enforce compliance with congressional subpoenas includes civil enforcement for executive branch officials, with non-compliance potentially leading to contempt of court. This report explores the historical development and limitations of the contempt power, as well as the procedures for inherent contempt, criminal contempt, and civil enforcement. Congress's authority to punish for contempt is closely tied to its investigative powers. Congress's authority to investigate and obtain information, including confidential details, is broad and essential to its legislative function. The Supreme Court has established this power through rulings like McGrain v. Daugherty, describing the power of inquiry as crucial for Congress. The Supreme Court has affirmed Congress's broad authority to investigate and obtain necessary information for its legislative function, stating that the power of inquiry is essential for effective legislation. This power includes the ability to compel the disclosure of information when needed. The Supreme Court has upheld Congress's authority to investigate and obtain information for legislative purposes, including the power to compel disclosure. In Sinclair v. United States, a witness refused to answer questions during congressional hearings, citing a pending lawsuit as a reason. The Court rejected this argument and upheld the witness's contempt conviction. The Supreme Court has affirmed Congress's investigative authority, stating that it can require disclosures to aid its constitutional power, even if the information may also be useful in pending lawsuits. This broad authority has been consistently upheld in subsequent rulings, such as Eastland v. United States Servicemen's Fund. The Supreme Court has affirmed Congress's broad investigative power, stating that it includes inquiries into administration of laws and potential statutes, not limited to cases of wrongdoing. The Court emphasized that Congress's investigative power is strongest when addressing waste, fraud, abuse, or maladministration within government departments. The Supreme Court has affirmed Congress's broad investigative power, allowing inquiries into suspected corruption or mismanagement by government officials. The Court recognizes Congress's authority to probe corruption and inefficiencies within government agencies, with the power to hold offenders in custody until they comply with requests for testimony or documents. This inherent contempt power is not specified in a statute but is deemed implicit in Congress's legislative powers. Inherent contempt was historically used for coercion, not punishment. Congress enacted a statutory criminal contempt provision in 1857 due to limitations of inherent power. Criminal contempt involves citation, indictment, and prosecution, aiming to punish non-compliance. A civil enforcement procedure for the Senate was established in 1978. It allows for contempt of court and incarceration of witnesses who refuse to testify or provide documents to a Senate committee. In 1795, Congress asserted its contempt authority for the first time after allegations of bribery involving Members of the House of Representatives. The House ordered the arrest and detention of the individuals involved, leading to formal proceedings recommended by a special Committee on Privileges. The House of Representatives recommended formal proceedings against Messrs. Randall and Whitney, allowing for written interrogatories and questions from Members. The accused were granted counsel, the right to call witnesses, and time to prepare a defense. A proceeding was held at the bar of the House. The House found Mr. Randall guilty of contempt and breach of privileges, reprimanded him, and detained him until discharged on January 13, 1796. Mr. Whitney was cleared of wrongdoing as his actions were against a member-elect and away from the seat of government. Congress's power to punish a non-Member for contempt was not questioned. The Senate exercised its contempt power against William Duane, editor of the Aurora newspaper, for publishing a libelous article about the Senate. Duane was ordered to appear before the Senate and defend his actions. Mr. Duane was held in contempt by the Senate for failing to appear after requesting counsel and expressing concerns about a fair trial. He was eventually released and tried by the courts, sparking debate on Congress's contempt authority. The Senate asserted its contempt power, citing necessity and historical practices, to prevent disruption of its proceedings. However, some Senators argued that Congress lacks the authority for such power as it is not explicitly granted by the Constitution. The minority proposed that Congress enact a statute to protect its proceedings as it lacked inherent self-preservation rights. After Mr. Duane's contempt, the issue of Congress's inherent contempt power seemed settled, but it was not used again for 12 years. In 1812, the House issued a contempt resolution against Mr. Nathaniel Rounsavell for refusing to answer questions about secret sessions. In 1812, the House issued a contempt resolution against Mr. Nathaniel Rounsavell for refusing to answer questions about secret sessions. However, before Mr. Rounsavell was brought before the House, a Member admitted his indiscretion, and the matter was dropped. Congress's inherent contempt power was not used again until 1818, eventually reaching the Supreme Court for adjudication. In 1821, the Supreme Court had to interpret the scope of Congress's contempt power when a Representative accused John Anderson of attempting to bribe him. This led to a debate in the House on the procedures to be adopted for Mr. Anderson's arrest. In 1821, the Committee on Privileges adopted procedures for Mr. Anderson's contempt case. Despite objections, Mr. Anderson was found in contempt, reprimanded, and taken into custody by the Sergeant-at-Arms. The Supreme Court in 1821 ruled that Congress has the authority to punish for contempt to protect itself, dismissing charges against the Sergeant-at-Arms who had taken Mr. Anderson into custody. The Court's decision in Anderson does not define specific actions constituting contempt but adopts a deferential posture, emphasizing Congress's power to punish actions obstructing its proceedings. Congress can enact statutes to supplement this power and endorse existing parliamentary practices for contempt cases. The Court's decision in Anderson established that a contemnor could not be held beyond the end of the legislative session. This rule may apply to contempt by the Senate, a \"continuing body,\" as seen in a 1871 case involving recalcitrant witnesses. The Senate's acquiescence to the Anderson rule was questioned for providing adequate punishment. The Senate instructed the release of prisoners upon final adjournment. The House imprisoned a contemnor beyond Congress adjournment. Patrick Wood was jailed for assaulting a Representative. In 1876, a committee investigated Jay Cooke & Company's collapse. The House issued a subpoena to Hallet Kilbourn, who refused to comply and was arrested for contempt. The Supreme Court ruled that Congress did not have a general power to punish for contempt. The Supreme Court declined to follow an expansive view of Congress's authority in punishing for contempt, rejecting reliance on English and colonial precedents. The Court held that the House of Representatives' right to punish citizens for contempt cannot be supported by historical practices. The Supreme Court ruled that Congress exceeded its constitutional responsibilities by investigating private individuals' finances, leading to Mr. Kilbourn not being legally required to answer questions. The Court emphasized that Congress cannot punish individuals for contempt unless the matter falls within its jurisdiction, and the investigation violated the separation of powers doctrine. The Supreme Court ruled that Congress overstepped its bounds by investigating private individuals' finances, leading to Mr. Kilbourn not being legally obligated to answer questions. The investigation was deemed to violate the separation of powers doctrine. The Supreme Court ruled in Kilbourn v. Thompson that Congress lacked jurisdiction to investigate private individuals' finances, leading to Mr. Kilbourn's imprisonment being deemed unlawful. The case limited Congress's power to probe into private affairs and highlighted the importance of separation of powers. The Supreme Court's ruling in McGrain v. Daugherty affirmed Congress's authority to investigate and discipline its Members, as well as individuals subject to congressional regulation. The case involved a Senate investigation into the Attorney General's failure to prosecute antitrust violations, leading to the issuance of a subpoena to the Attorney General's brother. When the brother refused to comply, the Senate used its inherent contempt power to take him into custody, a decision upheld by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court's ruling in McGrain v. Daugherty affirmed Congress's authority to investigate and discipline individuals, including through inherent contempt power. This power allows for individuals to be brought before Congress, tried, and potentially detained for non-compliance. The House has the authority to imprison or detain individuals for non-compliance, either as punishment or coercion. This power was exemplified in the case of Anderson v. Dunn, where a non-Member was arrested and brought before the House for attempting to bribe a Member. The House has the authority to imprison individuals for non-compliance, as seen in the case of Anderson v. Dunn where a non-Member was brought before the House for bribery. Anderson was found guilty of contempt, reprimanded, and discharged from custody after a hearing with witnesses and legal counsel. The process included attachment by the Sergeant-at-Arms, provision for defense, identification of charges, and determination of guilt. In cases of contempt, judicial review can be sought through a habeas corpus petition to determine if Congress acted within its jurisdiction and followed due process. While not all procedural rights of criminal proceedings are required, notice and a hearing must be provided. The courts may impose requirements similar to criminal contempt procedures for inherent contempt cases. Sanctions such as incarceration or fines could be imposed. In cases of contempt, judicial review can be sought through a habeas corpus petition to determine if Congress acted within its jurisdiction and followed due process. While not all procedural rights of criminal proceedings are required, notice and a hearing must be provided. The courts may impose requirements similar to criminal contempt procedures for inherent contempt cases. Sanctions such as incarceration or fines could be imposed. In the incarceration of the contemnor, there may be an argument for the imposition of monetary fines as an alternative to avoid a court proceeding on habeas corpus grounds. Congress could potentially impose fines instead of incarceration, drawing on the authority to inherently impose fines for contemptuous behavior. Additional support for this argument can be found in dicta from the 1821 Supreme Court decision in Anderson v. Dunn. The power of imprisonment is the least possible power adequate for punishment in cases of contempt. Other forms of punishment are considered mere commutation for confinement. In certain cases, Congress may compel testimony in the same manner as a court of justice. The courts have stated that no person can be punished for refusing to testify unless the testimony is required in a matter within the jurisdiction of the House. The House has the power to inquire and punish contempt of Congress, including the possibility of levying fines. Inherent contempt proceedings do not require cooperation from other branches, allowing the House or Senate to conduct summary proceedings independently. Judicial review through a writ of habeas corpus is available but limited compared to criminal contempt cases. There are constraints on the inherent contempt process. The inherent contempt process allows for incarceration until compliance with a subpoena, but cannot extend beyond the current session of Congress. Described as cumbersome and ineffective, it has not been used since 1935. To streamline proceedings, initial fact-finding could be done by a special committee with final guilt decisions made by the full House or Senate. The inherent contempt process allows for incarceration until compliance with a subpoena, but has not been used since 1935. Proceedings can be conducted at the bar of the House or Senate, or initially before a committee with the final decision made by the full body. This historical evidence suggests that the process can also involve evidentiary proceedings and recommendations at the committee level. The use of committees to develop detailed inquiries into charges of contempt of Congress dates back to the first inherent contempt proceedings in 1795. The House appointed a Committee on Privileges to report a procedure, which included interrogating the individuals at the bar of the House. This historical evidence shows that the process can involve evidentiary proceedings and recommendations at the committee level. The House appointed a Committee on Privileges to report a procedure for detailed inquiries into charges of contempt of Congress. The committee's language sparked a debate on proper procedures, with some arguing for a select committee to handle evidence and others recommending remanding the subject to a committee to save time. Some Members objected to using a select committee for hearings on contempt charges, citing concerns about improper procedures. Despite the debate, it seems that no proceedings took place before a select committee. Congress's interpretation of its powers is crucial, as historical precedents show a willingness to allow some proceedings before a committee. In 1836, a select committee was appointed by the House to investigate an assault on the House floor. The committee had the authority to administer oaths and call witnesses. Mr. Wheeler admitted his offense, and the committee recommended a non-vindictive punishment. The House appointed a select committee to investigate an assault on the House floor in 1836. Mr. Wheeler admitted his offense, and the committee recommended a non-vindictive punishment. The report contained three resolutions, with the first finding Mr. Wheeler guilty of contempt and breach of privileges, the second excluding him from the House floor for the session, and the third initially calling for his custody but amended to discharge him instead. Another instance of a select committee for a contempt trial occurred in 1865 involving Mr. A.P. Field assaulting Representative William Kelley. The House appointed a select committee to investigate an assault on the House floor in 1836. Mr. Wheeler admitted his offense, and the committee recommended a non-vindictive punishment. The committee had power to send for persons and papers, examine witnesses, and report all facts and circumstances for the vindication of the House's privilege. The House committee recommended a resolution for Mr. Field's arrest for a reprimand without his presence or opportunity to address the House. The Speaker referred to Mr. Field being tried before a committee and ordered to be reprimanded at the bar of the House. The historical evidence supports contempt proceedings before Congress committees, but there is no judicial ruling confirming Congress's interpretation of its contempt powers. In Nixon v. United States, the Supreme Court addressed a similar delegation of authority by the Senate to a select committee for impeachment proceedings. The \"Rules of Procedure and Practice in the Senate when Sitting on Impeachment Trials\" allow for the appointment of a committee of Senators to receive evidence and take testimony. The committee, chaired by a Senator elected by the committee, has the powers conferred upon the Senate and the Presiding Officer during impeachment trials. The committee must follow the rules of procedure and practice in the Senate for impeachment trials and report to the Senate in writing. The appointed committee reports to the Senate with a certified transcript of proceedings and testimony. The evidence and testimony are considered by the Senate, with the right to determine competency, relevancy, and materiality. Judge Nixon argued that a full Senate trial is necessary for impeachment, not a select committee. The Supreme Court ruled that the Senate impeachment trial was non-justiciable due to being a political question, citing constitutional text and the potential chaos of judicial review. The lack of a clear limit on the Senate's authority in the Impeachment Clause was a key factor in the decision. The Supreme Court affirmed the Senate's authority in impeachment trials, allowing for the use of select committees for contempt proceedings. This indicates that the use of committees for such purposes is within each House's rulemaking power, suggesting that the argument against using Congress's inherent contempt power due to being cumbersome may no longer be valid. The use of committee structure for trials and procedural determinations is supported by historical records and the Court's decision in Nixon. The question of rights and privileges in contempt proceedings before a congressional committee has not been directly addressed by the courts. The Supreme Court has indicated that the procedural rights in criminal trials may not be necessary in legislative contempt proceedings. The Supreme Court has indicated that procedural rights in criminal trials may not be necessary in legislative contempt proceedings before a congressional committee. Congress has the authority to establish its own rules and procedures, with minimum protections of notice and opportunity to be heard. Congressional precedent can guide what process is due in contempt proceedings. The traditional procedures for inherent contempt proceedings include attachment by the Sergeant-at-Arms, appearance before the bar, specification of charges, identification of the accuser, compulsory process, provision of counsel, a hearing, determination of guilt, and imposition of a penalty. These procedures were followed by Congress until they adopted a more convenient statutory device. Between 1795 and 1857, 14 inherent contempt actions were initiated by the House and Senate, with eight considered successful. In 1857, a statutory criminal contempt procedure was enacted as an alternative to the traditional inherent contempt proceedings, allowing for judicial trial by a United States Attorney instead of a trial at the bar of the House or Senate. This new procedure was seen as more efficient and effective, providing a different avenue for addressing contempt cases. In 1857, a statutory criminal contempt procedure was enacted as an alternative to the traditional inherent contempt proceedings. A criminal contempt referral was made in the case of John W. Wolcott in 1858, but most contempt proceedings continued to be handled at the bar of the House. Today, these provisions are codified as 2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7192 and 194, stating that anyone summoned as a witness by Congress who willfully makes default or refuses to answer may face consequences. Anyone summoned as a witness by Congress who willfully makes default or refuses to answer may face consequences, including a fine of up to $100,000, imprisonment for one to twelve months, and a misdemeanor charge. Failure to appear or produce required documents can also result in penalties. The criminal contempt statute allows for consequences, such as fines and imprisonment, for those who refuse to cooperate with Congressional investigations. This law was prompted by obstruction of a House select committee's investigation into misconduct allegations against Members of the House of Representatives. The select committee responded by reporting a resolution citing Mr. Simonton for contempt and introducing a bill to enforce witness attendance at Congress. There was opposition to the bill, with some arguing against Congress's inherent power to punish for contempt. Some Members opposed a bill to enforce witness attendance at Congress, citing concerns about violating constitutional amendments. Supporters clarified that the bill aimed to enhance Congress's authority without diminishing its inherent contempt powers. The bill to enforce witness attendance at Congress was passed by both the House and the Senate, addressing concerns about punishments for contempts near the end of a session. Supporters argued that the bill provided judicial protection for potential contumacious witnesses and removed them from partisan influences. The bill to enforce witness attendance at Congress was passed to increase the power to punish for contempt, compel testimony, and remove trials from partisan influences. Failure to comply can result in a fine of up to $100,000 and imprisonment for up to one year. The criminal contempt statute allows for a fine of up to $100,000 and imprisonment for up to one year. The procedure for referring a recalcitrant witness to the courts involves committee approval, reading the committee report on the floor, House approval of a resolution authorizing prosecution, and certification by the Speaker to the U.S. Attorney for prosecution. The criminal contempt statute allows for a fine of up to $100,000 and imprisonment for up to one year. It is used to punish a witness who refuses to cooperate, with the goal of deterring others from similar behavior. Once a witness is found in contempt, they lack an incentive to cooperate. In some cases, compliance with subpoenas after contempt citations have been issued may lead to the case not being referred to grand juries. The duty of the U.S. Attorney to present contempt to the grand jury is unclear, with conflicting guidance from case law. In Ex parte Frankfeld, witnesses before the House Committee on Un-American Activities were released due to procedural errors. Congress mandated that committees must report uncooperative witnesses to the House or Senate, who would then certify the facts to the district attorney. The district attorney is obligated to present the facts to the grand jury, as seen in United States v. United States House of Representatives. The Section 192 contempt procedure applies to executive branch officials. The duty of the Speaker to certify contempt citations to the U.S. Attorney is discretionary, not mandatory, based on legislative history and congressional practice. Congress must report uncooperative witnesses to the House or Senate, who then certify the facts to the district attorney for presentation to the grand jury. The review of a committee's contempt citation is provided by the Speaker or President of the Senate when Congress is not in session. In Wilson, convictions were reversed because the Speaker certified the contempt citations without exercising discretion. This suggests that the U.S. Attorney's function may also be discretionary, not mandatory as other courts have concluded. The U.S. Attorney's prosecutorial discretion has been upheld by courts, even when statutes use mandatory language. This discretion was evident in cases involving contempt citations for high-profile individuals like Anne Gorsuch Burford, Harriet Miers, Joshua Bolten, and Eric Holder. The courts have recognized the criminal provisions of 2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7192 and 194, reversing contempt convictions when limitations are exceeded. Congress can enforce a subpoena through civil enforcement by filing suit in federal court. Non-compliance may lead to contempt of court, not Congress. The House has pursued civil enforcement through an authorizing resolution, while the Senate has a civil enforcement procedure enacted in 1978. This procedure allows the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to enforce, secure a declaratory judgment, or prevent non-compliance with subpoenas issued by the Senate or its committees. The Senate Legal Counsel typically brings such suits on behalf of the Senate. The Senate has the option to seek a court declaration on the validity of a subpoena before enforcing it. The court will review the subpoena's validity and if it does not meet legal standards, it cannot intervene in congressional proceedings due to limited jurisdiction and congressional immunity. Clause immunity for congressional investigations limits the court's jurisdiction to enforcing a subpoena. If an individual refuses to comply, they may face contempt of court proceedings with sanctions to compel compliance. The Senate can choose civil enforcement for securing compliance or clarifying legal issues, rather than criminal contempt. Sanctions in civil enforcement can include imprisonment or fines until compliance is achieved. Civil enforcement sanctions, such as imprisonment or fines, can be imposed until the subpoenaed party complies, providing an incentive for compliance. This process is quicker than criminal proceedings and allows for flexibility in raising defenses without risking criminal prosecution. However, civil enforcement has limitations, especially when the subpoena is issued to an officer or employee. The civil enforcement statute allows for sanctions like imprisonment or fines to enforce compliance with subpoenas. However, this statute does not apply to federal government officers or employees acting in their official capacity. The statute was created to address jurisdictional issues related to congressional requests for information, particularly in response to a case involving President Nixon's tape recordings. The executive branch opposed giving federal courts jurisdiction over such matters during debates on the legislation. The civil enforcement statute allows for sanctions like imprisonment or fines to enforce compliance with subpoenas, excluding federal officers and employees acting in their official capacity. Testifying before Congress, then-Assistant Attorney General Antonin Scalia argued for courts to abstain from deciding sensitive issues between Congress and the executive branch. Congress amended legislation to exclude federal officers unless the President directed non-compliance with a subpoena. The Senate has authorized the Office of Senate Legal Counsel to seek civil enforcement of subpoenas since 1979. The Office of Senate Legal Counsel has sought civil enforcement of subpoenas at least six times, with none directed at executive branch officials. The Senate successfully enforced a subpoena against Carl Ferrer, CEO of Backpage.com, in a sex trafficking investigation. The U.S. District Court granted enforcement of the subpoena despite Ferrer's First Amendment arguments. The Senate has used its statutory authority to seek civil enforcement of subpoenas, as seen in the case of Carl Ferrer from Backpage.com. The House may also authorize a committee to pursue civil enforcement actions to compel compliance with subpoenas, as shown in the case of Committee on the Judiciary v. Miers. The jurisdiction of federal district courts over such claims was previously unresolved. The jurisdiction of federal district courts for civil enforcement of congressional subpoenas is derived from Article III of the Constitution and federal statute. The Supreme Court interprets federal jurisdiction broadly, allowing it whenever federal law is a significant factor in a case. However, the federal question jurisdiction statute is narrower in scope. The Supreme Court has not equated statutory \"arising under\" jurisdiction with Art. III \"arising under\" jurisdiction. The limitations on jurisdiction under 1331 do not restrict Congress's constitutional power to confer jurisdiction on federal courts. Art. III \"arising under\" jurisdiction is broader than federal-question jurisdiction under 1331. This raises the argument that a statutory grant of jurisdiction may not be sufficient for the House to authorize a subpoena enforcement proceeding in court without passing a law signed by the President. The Supreme Court has not equated statutory \"arising under\" jurisdiction with Art. III \"arising under\" jurisdiction. The limitations on jurisdiction under 1331 do not restrict Congress's constitutional power to confer jurisdiction on federal courts. Art. III \"arising under\" jurisdiction is broader than federal-question jurisdiction under 1331. This suggests that both houses of Congress must pass a law, signed by the President, to authorize a civil enforcement action in federal district court. Limited precedent indicates that current statutory basis may be sufficient for jurisdiction if a congressional committee representative is specifically authorized by a house of Congress to act. The special committee was authorized to obtain evidence related to the disputed election of William B. Wilson to the Senate, but the Supreme Court ruled it lacked jurisdiction to decide the case. The Senate's powers to investigate were affirmed, but the Court could not intervene in the matter. The Supreme Court ruled that the Senate lacked jurisdiction to decide the case involving the disputed election of William B. Wilson. The Court emphasized that the Senate did not specifically authorize the committee to sue, therefore there was no basis for judicial jurisdiction over the suit. Reed suggests that if the Senate resolution had mentioned the power to sue, the Court might have accepted jurisdiction. This is supported by a recent district court ruling in Waxman v. Thompson, where minority House members sought access to HHS records but the case was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction, rejecting the argument that Members had the right to sue to enforce their informational demands under 5 U.S.C. \u00a72954. The court cited Reed v. County Commissioners, stating that authorization to sue must be explicit in the law. Since \u00a72954 is silent on civil enforcement, Congress did not intend to provide that power. The Congress did not intend to give Members the power to seek civil judicial orders to enforce their document demands, as per the court in Waxman. Legislative branch suits to enforce requests for information from the executive branch are justiciable if authorized by one or both Houses of Congress, based on previous cases like Reed and United States v. AT&T. The argument that a one-house resolution is insufficient for jurisdiction is supported by the ruling in Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities v. Nixon. The court in Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities v. Nixon found no jurisdictional statute to hear the committee's request for documents from President Nixon. The court considered various bases for jurisdiction, including federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331, which had a minimum \"amount in controversy\" requirement of $10,000 at the time. The court dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to the select committee's failure to establish the amount in controversy requirement of $10,000. The lack of jurisdiction was solely based on the jurisdictional amount in controversy, not on any larger limit on federal question jurisdiction. The Miers court ruled that the amount in controversy requirement no longer exists for invoking federal question jurisdiction under \u00a71331. The House authorized a committee to pursue a civil action in federal court to enforce a subpoena against an executive branch official. Attorney General Eric Holder was held in contempt on June 28, 2012. On June 28, 2012, the House held Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt for not complying with subpoenas related to Operation Fast and Furious. A civil lawsuit was authorized to enforce the subpoenas, which was filed on August 13, 2012. The court rejected the DOJ's motion to dismiss the case on September 30, 2013, citing jurisdictional and justiciability arguments. The court's decision addressed separation of powers, federal court jurisdiction, standing, and causes of action. The court determined jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331 for a civil lawsuit filed by the House committee. Authorization by resolution of the full House is legally required for House committees to seek civil enforcement of subpoenas. Without such authorization, courts will not entertain civil motions on behalf of Congress or its committees. Authorization by the House is sufficient for claims filed in the U.S District Court for the District of Columbia. The House can obtain resolution for civil enforcement of subpoenas or committee orders. Special investigatory committees have been granted authority not usually available to standing committees, including staff deposition authority, access to tax information, seeking international assistance, and participation in judicial proceedings. An example is the 1987 select committee investigating Iran-Contra arms transactions. The House resolution for civil enforcement of subpoenas or committee orders granted broad subpoena authority, including access to White House materials and the ability to make applications to court. This was exemplified in the 1987 select committee investigating Iran-Contra arms transactions. The House resolution granted broad subpoena authority, including access to White House materials and the ability to make court applications. In the 1987 Iran-Contra investigation, the Senate Select Committee issued an order for bank records, showing the committee's power to seek judicial enforcement. The committee sought offshore bank records from Mr. Secord, who refused to sign the consent directive. The court did not grant the committee's request due to Fifth Amendment concerns, ruling that it violated Mr. Secord's right against self-incrimination. This case was the first attempt by a house of Congress to seek civil enforcement of subpoenas in federal court. In a unique move, the House of Representatives authorized counsel to intervene in civil litigation involving congressional subpoenas via House resolution. In 1976, subpoenas were issued to AT&T by a House committee seeking national security request letters from the FBI. Before compliance, negotiations were initiated between the DOJ and the committee's chairman. The DOJ and Representative John Moss negotiated to prevent AT&T from turning over all its records. When negotiations failed, the DOJ sought an injunction to stop AT&T from complying with subpoenas. The House authorized Moss to intervene in the lawsuit on behalf of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce to secure information on telephone communications privacy. The House resolution authorized Chairman Moss to hire a special counsel and use up to $50,000 from the committee's fund. It was adopted by a vote of 180-108 on August 26, 1976. Chairman Moss intervened in the proceedings, noted by the district court, and remained involved until an agreement was reached on document disclosure. Another intervention authorization occurred in 1976 involving litigation between Ashland Oil and the FTC. In 1976, Ashland Oil sought to enjoin the FTC from transferring its information to a congressional subcommittee. The subcommittee authorized a subpoena for the documents, and Chairman Moss filed a resolution for authorization from the House to intervene in the lawsuit. The district court granted Chairman Moss's motion to intervene and refused to grant the injunction, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. The court found no substantial showing that the materials would be made public if turned over to Congress. In In Re Beef Industry Antitrust Litigation, the chairmen of two subcommittees of the House of Representatives sought to intervene in a pending antitrust dispute to access subpoenaed documents. The district court refused to modify its protective order, leading to an appeal to the Fifth Circuit. The Fifth Circuit entertained a motion to dismiss by one of the plaintiffs who argued that the chairmen needed authorization from the full House of Representatives before filing their initial motion. The chairmen contended that they did not require authorization as they were seeking a modification of the protective order, not enforcement of subpoenas. However, the Fifth Circuit rejected their arguments, stating that House Rules mandate authorization for appearing in court. The House Rules require authorization for House committees to intervene in litigation, appeal court decisions, and enforce subpoenas. The court dismissed the appeal as the chairmen did not obtain authorization from the full House. The DOJ prefers civil enforcement procedures for subpoenas against executive branch officials. The executive branch has consistently argued that Congress cannot use its contempt authority against officials invoking executive privilege on the President's instructions. The Attorney General has directed against pursuing criminal contempt prosecutions in such cases. This stance is supported by DOJ opinions from the 1980s and actions in past disputes. The President's influence may render criminal contempt ineffective, leading Congress to seek other ways to enforce subpoenas, such as civil enforcement through federal courts. The DOJ's legal analyses were prompted by House committees investigating the EPA's actions under the Superfund Act. Subpoenas were issued for EPA documents, but executive privilege was claimed, resulting in a criminal contempt citation approved by a House committee. The House of Representatives voted to adopt a criminal contempt citation against the President, but the DOJ filed a lawsuit to stop it, claiming it interfered with executive privilege. The District Court dismissed the DOJ's suit, stating that judicial intervention should be delayed for settlement attempts. The court ruled that judicial resolution of the President's claim of executive privilege could only happen during the contempt of Congress trial. The DOJ did not appeal and negotiations led to full disclosure of subpoenaed documents. The U.S. Attorney refused to present the contempt citation to a grand jury, citing discretion. The issue was unresolved as the settlement agreement included a withdrawal of the contempt citation. In its 1984 opinion, the OLC concluded that a U.S. Attorney is not required to prosecute an executive branch official for contempt if they are asserting executive privilege as directed by the President. The opinion also stated that Congress did not intend the criminal contempt statute to apply to such officials, and that the threat of criminal contempt could hinder the President's ability to protect privileged deliberations. The OLC opinion states that the President's privilege claim, based on legal advice from the Attorney General, is presumptively valid. If Congress could make it a crime to assert this privilege, it would nullify the privilege. Congress has other methods to test privilege claims, making criminal prosecution for asserting the claim unreasonable and intolerable. The OLC opinion asserts that prosecuting the President for asserting executive privilege is an unreasonable burden on his constitutional duties. The opinion argues that Congress's inherent contempt power would also be unconstitutional if used to punish executive officials for asserting privilege. The history of the criminal contempt statute indicates that it was intended to align with Congress' civil contempt powers. The 1986 OLC opinion questions the constitutionality of using Congress's inherent contempt powers to punish executive officials for asserting privilege, citing Supreme Court opinions expressing wariness of Congress exercising judicial authority. The continued constitutional validity of the inherent contempt power is questioned, with OLC opinions suggesting potential limitations. The argument that a U.S. Attorney cannot be required to submit a contempt citation to a grand jury, despite the law, is compared to granting \"pocket immunity\" by the President. Courts have recognized informal immunity agreements, influenced by contract law principles and due process requirements. It seems a President has implicitly immunized executive branch officials from violations. In 1996, the DOJ argued that a statute requiring all public printing to be done by the Government Printing Office was unconstitutional. Executive branch officials were directed not to comply with the statute, with little to no litigation risk or prosecution under the Anti-Deficiency Act. This claim of immunization raises constitutional questions, as the President can immunize individuals from criminal prosecution. The President can immunize individuals from criminal prosecution, but not from a congressional inherent contempt proceeding. Inherent contempt is outside the criminal code and not subject to executive authority. It is meant to coerce compliance with congressional directives, making it not an offense against the United States. This argument also applies to potential civil enforcement by Congress. The legislative history of the 1857 statute establishing the criminal contempt process shows it was intended as an alternative to inherent contempt authority, not a substitute. Supreme Court opinions have upheld the use of the criminal contempt statute, with Representative H. Marshall highlighting its broad application to Cabinet officers and culprits insulting the House. The 1857 statute establishing criminal contempt was meant as an alternative to inherent contempt authority. Congress was aware of the impact of language on claiming privileges before Congress, with Representative Orr citing British Parliament's practice of not exempting witnesses from testifying based on common law. Representative Orr emphasized the importance of transparency in government spending, citing a past investigation into misuse of a secret service fund. This was in response to a proposed amendment regarding attorney-client privilege, which was ultimately defeated. In 1857, the House issued subpoenas to former Presidents Adams and Tyler regarding the use of a secret service fund by President Polk. Polk refused to disclose details, but investigatory committees were established. Former Presidents testified, and Secretary of State Buchanan was subpoenaed. Ultimately, no wrongdoing was found. The House in 1857 was sensitive to its oversight of the executive branch. Congress has cited executive branch officials for contempt since 1980, including former EPA Assistant Administrator Rita M. Lavelle and former White House Counsel Harriet Miers. The House has cited various executive branch officials for contempt since 1980, including EPA Administrator Anne Gorsuch Burford, White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten, and Attorney General Eric Holder. Committees and subcommittees of the House of Representatives have also voted contempt citations against other officials such as Secretary of Energy Charles Duncan, Secretary of the Interior James Watt, and Attorney General Janet Reno. Senate committees have also taken similar actions against officials like Joshua Bolten and Karl Rove. The Department of Justice's stance on using criminal contempt against executive branch officials invoking executive privilege was demonstrated during a dispute over an investigation. During a dispute over an investigation into the resignations of nine United States Attorneys, executive privilege was invoked by the House Judiciary Committee. This led to a legal confrontation over Congress's contempt authority and a civil lawsuit filed by Congress to affirm its information gathering prerogatives. The Attorney General's refusal to prosecute a former presidential advisor for contempt of Congress and the resulting district court decision shed light on Congress's ability to issue and enforce subpoenas against executive branch officials. The investigation also looked into potential political motives and White House involvement in the resignations. The House Judiciary Committee authorized subpoenas for White House officials Ms. Harriet Miers and Mr. Joshua Bolten to obtain information on the resignations of U.S. Attorneys. Despite unfruitful negotiations, the committee sought documents and testimony related to the resignations, leading to a legal confrontation over Congress's contempt authority. Chairman Conyers delayed issuing subpoenas in an attempt to negotiate a solution. The White House, through Counsel Fred F. Fielding, refused to comply with the Bolten subpoena citing executive privilege. Fielding advised Miers not to produce documents or testify, asserting executive privilege over the investigation information. The White House refused to comply with subpoenas citing executive privilege, leading to Ms. Miers not appearing at the hearing. Negotiations failed, resulting in a contempt of Congress recommendation for Ms. Miers and Mr. Bolten, who were cited on February 14, 2008. The Speaker directed the contempt citation to the U.S. Attorney for action against Ms. Miers and Mr. Bolten. Resolution 980 authorized Chairman Conyers to initiate a civil lawsuit if DOJ did not pursue criminal contempt actions. The Speaker certified the report to the U.S. Attorney, but the DOJ refused to prosecute. The House committee filed a civil suit in 2008 to enforce subpoenas against White House officials who invoked executive privilege. The lawsuit aimed to compel compliance with the subpoenas, not to determine contempt of Congress. The Bush Administration argued that senior presidential advisors, like Ms. Miers, were immune from compelled testimony. The Bush Administration argued that senior presidential advisors, like Ms. Miers, were immune from compelled testimony before Congress when asserting executive privilege. The Administration's argument was based on the belief that senior advisors should have the same constitutional immunities as the President. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia rejected this argument on July 31, 2008. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, in a ruling on July 31, 2008, rejected the Bush Administration's claim of absolute immunity for senior presidential advisors like Ms. Miers. The court upheld Congress's power to issue subpoenas and obtain information, stating that past precedent did not support the immunity argument. The court did not address Congress's authority to punish executive branch officials for contempt or the U.S. Attorney's ability to decline referral of contempt citations to a grand jury. The U.S. District Court rejected the Bush Administration's claim of absolute immunity for senior presidential advisors like Ms. Miers, citing the Supreme Court's decision in Harlow v. Fitzgerald. The court ruled that presidential advisors were not entitled to alter ego status for immunity purposes, only qualified immunity in the performance of their official duties. The district court noted that even if presidential advisors were entitled to the same immunity as the President, it was not clear if the President himself would enjoy absolute immunity from compelled congressional testimony. The court referenced U.S. v. Nixon and Clinton v. Jones, suggesting that the President may not be absolutely immune from compulsory process. In Nixon, President Nixon had a presumptive privilege over White House tapes that could be overcome by a showing of need, and in Clinton, President Clinton was not immune from a civil suit for unofficial conduct. The district court in the Miers case ruled that former White House counsel, Ms. Miers, could be required to comply with a congressional subpoena, emphasizing the importance of access to information for Congress. While the ruling supported congressional oversight, it also recognized limits to Congress's authority to compel testimony from executive branch officials, allowing for the assertion of executive privilege in response to specific questions. Ms. Miers could assert executive privilege in response to specific questions from the Committee, with the court suggesting limits on Congress's authority to compel testimony related to national security or foreign affairs. The Administration appealed the district court decision to the D.C. Circuit for a final decision. The D.C. Circuit granted a stay on the district court order but denied an expedited schedule, citing that the subpoenas issued by the 110th House of Representatives would expire before the dispute could be resolved. The district court issued a second order to preserve documents covered by committee subpoenas related to the Miers case. A settlement was reached in March 2009, allowing some documents to be provided to the committee and permitting Ms. Miers to testify in a closed, transcribed hearing. The D.C. Circuit dismissed Miers on October 14, 2009. The Miers litigation ended in October 2009 after a motion for voluntary dismissal. The committee gained access to sought-after information. In 2012, the DOJ refused contempt prosecution over executive privilege in response to a subpoena on Operation Fast and Furious. The House Oversight Committee had been investigating ATF since early 2011. Operation Fast and Furious was an ATF operation in Phoenix, Arizona, where straw purchasers were allowed to buy large quantities of firearms for gun trafficking investigations. Some of these firearms were trafficked to criminals in Mexico, leading to the death of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry. Attorney General Eric Holder ordered a review of ATF's gun trafficking investigations after public outcry. In 2011, DOJ denied knowledge of weapons sales to straw purchasers for Mexico. Congress requested documents from ATF, leading to subpoenas. Hearings were held on Operation Fast and Furious, with testimony from Attorney General Holder. The committee issued a second subpoena to the Attorney General for all departmental communications related to Operation Fast and Furious. Attorney General Holder admitted that a previous letter contained inaccurate information about ATF's \"gun walking\" methods. DOJ withdrew the letter and acknowledged the operation was flawed, providing 1,400 pages of documents addressing the inaccuracies. The DOJ maintained significant confidentiality interests in responding to congressional requests about the Executive Branch's deliberations. They stated they made extraordinary accommodations but refused to produce certain documents related to sensitive law enforcement activities. Despite flexibility, the committee criticized the DOJ for not fully complying with outstanding subpoenas. During a committee hearing, Chairman Issa criticized the Attorney General for refusing to cooperate and only offering to provide subpoenaed documents if the investigation was closed. Chairman Issa threatened a contempt vote if the Attorney General continued to refuse compliance. Negotiations between the two parties narrowed the scope of documents to be produced to those created after February 4, 2011, related to the Department's response to congressional inquiries about Operation Fast and Furious. The Attorney General faced criticism for not cooperating with congressional inquiries related to Operation Fast and Furious. Despite negotiations, a contempt vote was scheduled due to the refusal to provide requested documents. President Obama invoked executive privilege over certain documents to protect the deliberative process. The Department's response to congressional oversight and media inquiries could have damaging consequences by inhibiting Executive Branch candor and impairing its ability to independently respond to oversight. The Oversight Committee rejected executive privilege, leading to a contempt citation against Attorney General Holder. On June 28, 2012, the House passed two resolutions related to the contempt citation against Attorney General Holder. The first resolution, H.Res. 711, approved by a vote of 255-67, found the Attorney General in contempt for failing to comply with a congressional subpoena. The second resolution, H.Res. 706, authorized Chairman Issa to initiate a judicial proceeding to enforce compliance with subpoenas in the Fast and Furious investigation. The House voted to hold an executive branch official in criminal contempt of Congress, with the option to seek enforcement through a civil action in federal court. DOJ determined that the Attorney General's response to the subpoena did not constitute a crime, and therefore no prosecution would take place. H.Res. 706 allowed the committee to request a federal court to compel the Attorney General. H.Res. 706 allowed the committee to file a civil enforcement action in federal court to compel the Attorney General to comply with the subpoena. The court rejected the DOJ's motion to dismiss the case based on separation-of-powers concerns and jurisdiction, echoing a previous ruling in a similar case. The DOJ argued for a different conclusion without providing distinguishable facts. The court rejected the DOJ's argument that resolving disputes between branches violates the Constitution, asserting its authority to enforce subpoenas and evaluate executive privilege claims. It emphasized that not hearing the claim would harm the balance of powers envisioned by the Framers. The court rejected the DOJ's argument that the court lacked jurisdiction to enforce House subpoenas, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the balance of powers envisioned by the Framers. The court held that subject matter jurisdiction is rooted in the federal question jurisdiction statute, allowing it to hear the case as a \"civil action[] arising under the Constitution.\" The court asserted jurisdiction over the case as a \"civil action[] arising under the Constitution,\" rejecting the DOJ's argument on lack of standing for the committee to enforce their subpoena. The court emphasized the committee's concrete injury to gather information for its constitutional duties and cited D.C. Circuit precedent on the House's investigatory power. Additionally, the court acknowledged the traditional role of courts in resolving questions on privileges and subpoena enforcement. The court asserted jurisdiction over the case, rejecting the DOJ's argument on lack of standing for the committee to enforce their subpoena. The court emphasized the committee's concrete injury to gather information for its constitutional duties and cited D.C. Circuit precedent on the House's investigatory power. Additionally, the court concluded that the committee did not need to identify another source to seek declaratory relief, establishing an actual, ripe controversy. The court declined to dismiss the case on prudential grounds, expressing skepticism that dismissal would facilitate a resolution. The committee then filed a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the DOJ could not invoke executive privilege in response to a congressional subpoena. The district court denied the DOJ's motion for summary judgment based on executive privilege in response to a congressional subpoena. The court rejected the blanket assertion of privilege without specific justification for each record and directed the DOJ to provide a list of withheld materials. The DOJ provided a list of documents it sought to withhold from Congress, including those related to media and congressional inquiries about Operation Fast and Furious. The district court partially granted the committee's motion to compel the production of these documents, rejecting the argument that the deliberative process privilege only applied to policy discussions. The court ruled that the deliberative process privilege extended to internal deliberations on responding to inquiries about Operation Fast and Furious. Despite the privilege, the court ordered the DOJ to produce the documents due to Congress's need for the material. The court ruled that the agency must provide documents without justification for invoking privilege, but declined to order production of documents withheld for reasons other than deliberative process privilege. The case was appealed to the D.C. Circuit, which granted a request to hold the case in abeyance for potential settlement with the Trump Administration. The court may clarify Congress's subpoena power and executive privilege in a case involving the IRS targeting conservative groups. Lois G. Lerner admitted to the targeting in 2013, leading to a committee investigation. The committee investigated the IRS's targeting of conservative groups, focusing on Ms. Lerner's crucial testimony. She invoked her Fifth Amendment privilege during a hearing on May 22, 2013. The committee issued a subpoena to compel Ms. Lerner's testimony on May 20, 2013. Despite being advised by Chairman Darrell Issa to testify, she maintained her Fifth Amendment right and denied any wrongdoing during the hearing on May 22, 2013. The committee later voted that she had waived her Fifth Amendment privilege. Ms. Lerner waived her Fifth Amendment privilege by making a voluntary opening statement and denying involvement in unlawful activity. Despite being advised to comply with a subpoena, she continued to invoke her Fifth Amendment privilege. The committee approved a contempt resolution against her for refusal to comply, leading to a House vote adopting the resolution. The House voted to adopt a contempt resolution against Ms. Lerner for refusing to comply with a subpoena. The Speaker was directed to certify the contempt citation to the U.S. Attorney for prosecution. The U.S. Attorney decided not to pursue criminal prosecution based on the House's resolution. The U.S. Attorney decided not to pursue criminal prosecution against Ms. Lerner for refusing to testify before the committee, citing her Fifth Amendment privilege. This decision marked another instance where the DOJ declined to prosecute based on a contempt resolution passed by Congress. The DOJ cited executive privilege in Holder cases, but Fifth Amendment privilege in Lerner case for not pursuing criminal contempt charges. The challenges Congress faces in enforcing a criminal contempt resolution are highlighted by disputes over information access between congressional committees and the executive branch. Efforts to punish executive branch officials for non-compliance with subpoenas through criminal contempt may not be successful, especially if the President endorses the non-compliance. The DOJ may not pursue prosecution for criminal contempt if the President supports the official's refusal to disclose information. Prosecutorial discretion is often cited as a reason for not forwarding contempt citations to a grand jury. In cases where the President does not endorse the official's conduct leading to contempt, prosecution may still be pursued. Efforts to punish executive branch officials for non-compliance with subpoenas through criminal contempt may face challenges, especially if the President supports the official's refusal to disclose information. The executive branch may choose not to prosecute the official to avoid setting a precedent for Congress's authority. Congress may enforce its own subpoenas through a declaratory civil action, but this process may be time-consuming and ineffective in protecting congressional prerogatives. The Miers litigation, involving a congressional subpoena, was dismissed after 19 months without a decision on the merits. The committee gained access to withheld information, but the change in administrations and time passing reduced its effectiveness in oversight. A federal district court may decide on the Holder subpoena before the 112th Congress ends, but appeals are expected to prolong the process. Prior to the expiration of the 112th Congress, a new authorization may be needed for the committee to continue litigation into the 113th Congress. Congress may not always rely on the executive branch or civil enforcement of subpoenas for prompt resolution. Congress can enforce subpoenas through inherent contempt, with limits set by the courts. The criminal contempt statute imposes limits on investigatory and contempt powers, applying to witnesses summoned by Congress regardless of subpoena issuance. A contempt conviction requires clear authorization for the investigation by the full House or Senate. The investigation and questions in a committee must be within its jurisdiction, with authorization from the parent body. Subcommittees must also stay within their granted authority. The Supreme Court looks at the committee's authorizing resolution and legislative history to determine scope. The clear articulation of committee jurisdiction in House and Senate rules, combined with the authorization of special committees by resolution, has eliminated the use of jurisdiction as a defense to contempt proceedings. Investigations must have a legislative purpose or be conducted under Congress's constitutional powers. The courts generally presume a legislative purpose for investigations authorized by House or Senate rules, even if not explicitly stated. In a case like In re Chapman, the Court upheld an inquiry into corruption charges against Senators, emphasizing the pertinence of the questions to the inquiry's subject matter. The Senate committee is investigating whether any Senator has been speculating in sugar stocks during the tariff bill consideration. The Senate has the constitutional power to take further action based on the investigation's findings, regardless of specified purposes like censure or expulsion. The Senate has the constitutional power to censure or expel members for reprehensible actions, as deemed by the Senate. The resolutions indicate the Senate was within its rights to investigate and take action, as seen in the McGrain v. Daugherty case. The Senate had the constitutional power to investigate a contumacious witness for the purpose of obtaining information necessary for legislative action. The Court found the investigation to be legitimate, as the Senate's object was to aid in legislating. The resolution declared that the testimony was sought for legislative and other necessary actions. The Senate's power to investigate a witness for legislative purposes was upheld by the Court. The resolution stated that testimony was needed for legislative and other necessary actions, with the possibility of additional measures if deemed necessary. This suggestion, while criticized for being vague, does not invalidate the overall legitimacy of the investigation. The Supreme Court has upheld Congress's power to investigate various matters, including legislative functions, oversight of the executive branch, and national concerns. However, Congress's authority is not unlimited, and a committee must have a legislative purpose for its investigations to be valid. Courts have ruled that a committee must have a legislative purpose for its investigations to be valid. Congress's authority is not unlimited, and the Judiciary cannot intervene based on the motives behind the exercise of congressional power. In a contempt prosecution, the questions posed by the committee must be pertinent to the inquiry for a witness's refusal to answer to be punished. Courts have recognized that pertinency in congressional investigations is broader than in judicial context, allowing for broad and exhaustive inquiries to make effective the constitutional powers of Congress. The Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause is a key consideration in determining the scope of inquiries. The Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of pertinency in congressional investigations, stating that the subject matter must be clearly explained to the witness at the time of questioning. The witness is entitled to understand how the questions relate to the committee's jurisdiction, as outlined in its authorizing resolution or rules. The committee must rule on a pertinency objection and inform the witness before directing them to answer a question. A witness can determine the subject matter of an investigation from various sources. A conviction for contempt requires willful intent in failing to appear, produce documents, or respond to questions. When a witness objects or refuses to answer, the chairman should rule on the objection and direct the witness to answer. There is no specific formula for directing a witness to answer, but they should be clearly informed and given another chance to respond if their objection is rejected. The procedure for responding to a witness's objections to questions involves ruling on the objection and directing the witness to answer. If a witness refuses to answer a question, the committee must ascertain the grounds for the objection, rule on it, and warn the witness of potential prosecution for contempt of Congress. Failure to clearly instruct the witness on the requirement to answer can result in a contempt conviction being overturned. Committees must adhere to their own and parent body's rules when issuing subpoenas and conducting investigations. Witnesses can be convicted of criminal contempt but not perjury. In practice, the committee weighs legislative need for disclosure against possible injury when deciding on attorney-client privilege claims. This process considers legislative need, public policy, and statutory duties. The strength of a claimant's assertion is evaluated based on the relevance of the documents to the investigation. The committee evaluates attorney-client privilege claims based on the relevance of the documents to the investigation, the practical unavailability of the information from other sources, and the cooperation of the witness. A valid claim of attorney-client privilege carries substantial weight, but any doubt about its validity diminishes its strength. Recognition of non-constitutionally based privileges, like attorney-client privilege, is within congressional discretion. The legal basis for Congress's practice in evaluating attorney-client privilege claims before congressional committees is rooted in its constitutional prerogative to investigate fraud, abuse, or maladministration. Appellate court rulings on the privilege in other investigative contexts have raised questions about executive branch officials claiming privileges in the face of investigative demands. The attorney-client privilege is a judge-made exception to full disclosure, not a constitutionally based privilege. The attorney-client privilege is a judge-made exception to full disclosure in the adversary process, narrowly construed and confined to the judicial forum. While no court has recognized its inapplicability in congressional proceedings, a ruling by the Legal Ethics Committee of the District of Columbia Bar acknowledges long-standing congressional practice. This arose during an investigation by a House Commerce Committee subcommittee into the relocation of the Federal Communications Commission, where documents were sought from developer Mr. Franklin L. Haney. His refusal led to subpoenas for the documents. The law firm representing Mr. Haney refused to comply with subpoenas for documents, citing attorney-client privilege. The firm sought guidance from the D.C. Bar's Ethics Committee, which deemed the issue novel and advised waiting for a plenary session. After being cited for contempt, the firm proposed to turn over the documents if the citation was withdrawn, which was accepted by the subcommittee. The D.C. Bar's Ethics Committee later issued an opinion supporting the firm's actions. The Ethics Committee advised that an attorney should seek to quash or limit a congressional subpoena to protect client confidences. If objections are overruled and the lawyer is threatened with contempt, they may produce the documents unless forbidden by a judicial order. The D.C. Bar opinion advises attorneys to vigorously object to subpoenas to protect client confidences, even suggesting seeking third-party action to stop compliance. Ultimately, congressional committees decide on attorney-client privilege claims. The D.C. Bar opinion advises attorneys to object to subpoenas to protect client confidences. Congressional committees are not legally required to allow witnesses to decline to testify based on testimonial privileges like attorney-client privilege. Court decisions indicate that witnesses in congressional hearings may not have the same rights as in judicial proceedings. Congressional committees have the authority to determine their own rules for proceedings, including whether to recognize privileges for confidential communications. While not legally obligated to do so, committees often choose to acknowledge such privileges, weighing the need for disclosure against potential harm. The Supreme Court has emphasized that Congress, like all branches of government, must operate within constitutional limitations. The government, including Congress, must operate within constitutional limitations, which also apply to investigative powers. The First Amendment restricts Congress in conducting investigations, as seen in the case of Barenblatt v. United States. Balancing private and public interests is crucial when First Amendment rights are invoked to resist government interrogation. The First Amendment does not provide an absolute right to refuse congressional demands for information, unlike the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The courts emphasize the need for authorization, delegation of power, and a legislative purpose to protect witnesses' rights in cases involving the First Amendment and congressional investigations. The First Amendment is not a valid reason to refuse congressional demands for information. The courts have narrowly interpreted committees' authority to avoid First Amendment issues. In a 1976 investigation, news media representatives were subpoenaed for unauthorized publication of a report. Daniel Schorr was found to have obtained and shared the report for publication. The ethics committee found that Daniel Schorr's publishing of a report was defiant, but he was not cited for contempt for refusing to disclose his source. The committee's decision was influenced by a desire to avoid a clash over First Amendment rights. In another case involving the First Amendment, CBS president Frank Stanton was subpoenaed to provide \"outtakes\" related to a documentary. CBS president Frank Stanton was directed to deliver \"outtakes\" related to a documentary to a subcommittee. Stanton refused on First Amendment grounds, leading to a contempt citation. The House debated the matter, expressing concerns about the press's freedom. In a similar case, Backpage.com CEO Carl Ferrer also refused to comply with a subpoena citing First Amendment rights. The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs requested documents from Backpage.com regarding screening practices against Internet sex trafficking. Backpage.com CEO Carl Ferrer refused to provide the documents, leading to a lawsuit by the Senate to enforce the subpoena. Ferrer argued that the subpoena violated the First Amendment, but the district court rejected his arguments, stating that he did not have an absolute right to be free from government investigation. The court concluded that the subpoena did not infringe on First Amendment rights as it only requested information on Backpage.com's efforts to combat sex trafficking online. The court found that understanding and preventing Internet sex trafficking outweighed any burden on producing the requested documents. The court granted the subcommittee's application to enforce the subpoena duces tecum, stating that requiring a party to search for responsive documents on a specific subject is not unusual or unreasonable. Congress's investigatory authority may be limited by the First Amendment, but when used to advance a valid governmental interest, private interests may be outweighed by the public interest in securing information. The Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures applies to congressional committees, with a legitimate legislative or oversight-related basis required for a congressional subpoena. The Court has outlined the standard for judging the reasonableness of a subpoena, stating that adequacy or excess in the breadth of the subpoena depends on the nature, purposes, and scope of the inquiry. The subcommittee's inquiry required a broad scope of materials, including records and correspondence from the Civil Rights Congress. The subpoena specified the subjects of the documents with reasonable particularity, allowing the petitioner to know which documents were required. Compliance with a subpoena duces tecum is necessary unless there is a legal objection or inability to comply. When unable to comply with a subpoena duces tecum, the witness must provide reasons for non-compliance. The D.C. Circuit emphasized the importance of informing the committee of any objections or doubts regarding the requested documents to avoid contempt. If a witness cannot produce documents, they will not be held in contempt unless they are responsible for them. The exclusionary rule may apply to congressional committee investigations, barring unlawfully seized documents from being used as evidence in unrelated criminal prosecutions. It is unclear if the rule would prevent the admission of a congressional subpoena based on unlawfully obtained documents in a contempt prosecution. The Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination applies to witnesses appearing before congressional committees, protecting them from being compelled to testify. The privilege is personal and cannot be invoked on behalf of organizations. Verbal formula or warning is not required to invoke the privilege, and any reasonable indication suffices. Compliance with a subpoena for documents may invoke the privilege if it implies testimonial authentication. The Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination applies to witnesses before congressional committees, protecting them from compelled testimony. A verbal warning is not necessary to invoke the privilege, any reasonable indication suffices. The committee can review the validity of the privilege assertion, without the witness needing to specify the exact hazard feared. The Supreme Court advises that a responsive answer to a question might be dangerous if injurious disclosure could result. The privilege against self-incrimination allows witnesses to refuse to answer questions that could incriminate them. It can be asserted if there is a reasonable fear of providing evidence for a criminal offense. Waiving the privilege can be done by not asserting it or testifying on the same matters. The privilege against self-incrimination allows witnesses to refuse to answer incriminating questions. Waiving the privilege can be done by not asserting it or testifying on the same matters. If a witness asserts the privilege, the full House or committee can seek a court order for testimony with use immunity granted. The application for a judicial immunity order must be approved by a majority of the House or Senate or by a two-thirds vote of the full committee seeking the order. The Attorney General must be notified at least ten days prior to the request for the order, and he can request a delay of twenty days in issuing the order. The court's role in issuing the order is considered ministerial, and if the procedural requirements are met, the court may not refuse to issue the order or impose conditions on the grant of immunity. In 2013, former IRS Director Lois Lerner invoked her Fifth Amendment privilege in response to a subpoena regarding the agency's targeting of conservative groups. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform determined she waived the privilege by denying involvement in unlawful activity. The DOJ did not pursue criminal contempt charges due to the Fifth Amendment protection. In 2015, the House Committee investigated Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. Bryan Pagliano, a former advisor, invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege and refused to testify before the committee. Chairman Chaffetz issued subpoenas for Pagliano's appearance, but he continued to cite his Fifth Amendment privilege. The House Committee issued a subpoena for Bryan Pagliano's appearance on September 22, 2016, but he refused to testify. The committee voted 19-15 to recommend finding Pagliano in contempt of Congress for failing to comply with the subpoena. Chairman Chaffetz requested the DOJ to bring the matter before a grand jury on February 16, 2017. Sessions requested DOJ to bring Pagliano before a grand jury for criminal contempt. Congress's immunity power could eliminate Fifth Amendment privilege. After 2016 election, investigation into Russian influence led to Flynn's resignation. Flynn offered testimony in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Congress has not taken action yet. The Senate committee subpoenaed Mr. Flynn for documents related to Russian meddling. If granted immunity, he would have to provide testimony without invoking the Fifth Amendment. The committee must clarify the pertinency of their questions to Mr. Flynn. The witness must be informed of the subject under inquiry and the pertinency of questions. Tables show contempt and civil enforcement resolutions in Congress since 1980.
