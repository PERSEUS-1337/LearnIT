    "content": "The \"Central Rockies Land Exchange and National Park System Enhancement Act of 2010\" authorizes land exchanges in Colorado and Utah to enhance the National Park System, protect natural values, and improve public access in Gunnison County, Colorado. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This section defines key terms such as Bear Ranch, Darien Ranch, Federal land, non-Federal land, and Secretary concerned. SEC. 4. BEAR RANCH AND DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR LAND EXCHANGE, GUNNISON COUNTY, COLORADO, AND UINTAH COUNTY, UTAH. This section pertains to a land exchange involving Bear Ranch and the Department of the Interior in Gunnison County, Colorado, and Uintah County, Utah. The Bear Ranch offers to convey non-Federal parcels to the Secretary of the Interior for inclusion in the National Park System. In exchange, the Secretary of the Interior and Agriculture will convey approximately 1,846 acres of Federal land to the Bear Ranch. The Bear Ranch proposes to transfer non-Federal land within Curecanti National Recreation Area in Colorado and Dinosaur National Monument in Utah to the Secretary of the Interior. The land titles must meet the approval standards of the Attorney General for Federal land acquisitions. SEC. 5. DARIEN RANCH AND FOREST SERVICE LAND EXCHANGE, GUNNISON COUNTY, COLORADO. The Darien Ranch is required to convey approximately 0.42 acres of non-Federal land in Gunnison County, Colorado. In exchange, they will receive a permanent right-of-way for a water intake and pipeline along an existing irrigation ditch from Rapid Creek to private land. The Secretary of Agriculture will receive non-Federal land in Gunnison County, Colorado, with acceptable title standards. SEC. 6. EQUAL VALUE EXCHANGE AND APPRAISALS. Equal Value Exchange: The values of Federal and non-Federal land in each land exchange must be equal. If values are not equal, adjustments will be made to achieve equality, including cash payments if necessary. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 requires equal value exchanges of Federal and non-Federal land. If the final appraised value of non-Federal land exceeds that of Federal land, no cash payment will be made, and the surplus value of the non-Federal land will be considered a donation to the United States. Any cash equalization payment received by the Secretary of the Interior will be deposited in the Federal Land Disposal. Cash equalization payments under subsection (a) will be deposited in the Federal Land Disposal Account for the Bureau of Land Management to acquire lands in Gunnison County, Colorado. Payments received by the Secretary of Agriculture will go to the fund established by the Sisk Act. Appraisals for land exchanges will be determined by the respective Secretary. The Secretary determines land exchange appraisals following specific standards and selects an appraiser agreed upon by both parties. A summary of the appraisals is made available to the public before finalizing the exchange. The appraisal of Federal land parcels under this Act will not consider any decrease in value due to conservation easement requirements. The Secretary of the Interior may determine the value of Federal Parcel 6 - Bear Ranch if deemed appropriate. SEC. 7. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS. The Bear Ranch must grant a permanent conservation easement on Federal Parcels 1-5 before completing the land exchange. The easement restricts future use to agricultural, recreational, open space, and wildlife conservation purposes. Lands acquired by the United States under this Act will be permanently withdrawn from appropriation and disposal under public land laws. The Geothermal Steam Act of 1930 and mineral leasing laws are relevant to the withdrawal revocation of public land orders for disposal under the Act. Federal land for exchange is withdrawn from public land laws until conveyed to Bear Ranch or Darien Ranch, subject to valid existing rights. Land acquired through the exchange will be managed by the National Park Service or the National Forest System, depending on the agency involved, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The National Forest System regulations apply to the land acquired through the exchange. A travel management plan must be prepared within 3 years for the Bear Ranch Area in consultation with Gunnison County, Colorado. The plan dated February 2010 may incorporate existing travel management plans for the area, update plans for enhanced public access, and consult with Gunnison County on access reservation termination. Federal parcel 1 conveyance is subject to interim access regulations. Before the land exchange under section 4, Bear Ranch must deposit $50,000 for access funding. The conveyance of Federal parcel 1 to Bear Ranch is subject to existing right-of-way for County Road 2 and a reservation of nonmotorized public access to the Deep Creek area. The Bear Ranch must pay an additional $200,000 if the plan determines the reservation should be terminated. This sum will be used for road, trail, and trailhead work as determined by the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture. Upon completion of the work, the reservation will be terminated. The land exchanges directed by this Act should be completed within 1 year. Minor boundary adjustments and corrections can be made by mutual agreement. In case of conflicts, the map will control unless agreed otherwise. The Secretary will make pertinent maps available for public inspection in designated field offices of various national parks and forests."
