    "content": "The Small Business Administration's Women-Owned Small Business Federal Contracting Program was established by Congress to provide more opportunities for small businesses to win federal contracts. Congress has a long history of supporting small businesses, dating back to World War II and the Korean War. In 1953, the Small Business Act was passed to authorize the SBA and promote the interests of small businesses to preserve free competitive enterprise. Since 1953, Congress has used its authority to help small businesses receive a fair share of federal contracts through procurement goals, preferences, and set-asides. This includes government-wide and agency-specific goals for awarding contracts to small businesses. The government sets goals for awarding contracts to small businesses, including 5% to WOSBs. Federal agencies reserve contracts above $10,000 but below $250,000 for small businesses. Sole source awards can be made to small businesses under urgent circumstances. The government sets goals for awarding contracts to small businesses, including specific preferences for Minority Small Business, HUBZone, WOSBs, and SDVOSBs. Federal agencies reserve contracts for small businesses and review procurements to maximize small business participation. Additional requirements are in place to maximize small business participation as prime contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers. The government sets goals for awarding contracts to small businesses, including preferences for specific groups. Federal agencies reserve contracts for small businesses and encourage subcontracting with small businesses. Small business subcontracting plans are negotiated for contracts exceeding certain amounts, and SBA procurement center representatives review acquisition packages before solicitation issuance. The SBA's WOSB Federal Contracting Program, authorized by H.R. 5654, aims to help federal agencies meet the goal of awarding 5% of contracting dollars to WOSBs. Contracting officers can set aside acquisitions exceeding $10,000 for bidding by WOSBs, including economically disadvantaged WOSBs. If the contracting officer rejects the PCR's recommendation, the basis for rejection must be documented, and the PCR can appeal to higher authorities. The WOSB program aims to increase federal contracts awarded to WOSBs, with a focus on industries where they are underrepresented. Despite increased use of the program, WOSB contracts still make up a small portion of total contracts awarded. The WOSB program aims to increase federal contracts awarded to WOSBs, focusing on industries where they are underrepresented. However, there have been delays in the program's implementation and oversight, with deficiencies noted by the GAO and SBA's OIG. The program was authorized in 2000 but took nearly 10 years to issue a final rule and four more months to go into effect. P.L. 113-291, NDAA 2015, removed certain requirements related to the program. The NDAA 2015 removed the self-certification option for small businesses in the WOSB program to ensure contracts go to intended recipients. The SBA implemented its own certification process, with the final rule issued on May 11, 2020, effective from October 15, 2020, nearly six years after the requirements were enacted in 2014. The history of small business contracting preferences, leading to the creation of the WOSB program, began in 1978 with federal procurement goals established by agency heads. President Jimmy Carter's Executive Order 12138 in 1979 promoted women-owned businesses. The WOSB program was created in 1979 through Executive Order 12138 to promote women-owned businesses in federal contracting. Despite initial growth, by 1988, WOSBs only received 1% of federal contracts, prompting advocates to call for more support due to ongoing prejudice and discrimination. Federal agencies have shown weak efforts in supporting women's business enterprise, leading to the Women's Business Ownership Act of 1988. This act authorized the SBA to establish WOSB procurement goals and extended goaling requirements to include subcontracts. Additionally, the Business Opportunity Development Reform Act of 1988 allowed the President to set government-wide procurement goals for small businesses. The Women's Business Ownership Act of 1988 authorized the SBA to establish procurement goals for women-owned small businesses. Congress mandated a 5% procurement goal for WOSBs each fiscal year, in response to advocates' efforts to increase federal contracting opportunities for women-owned businesses. The conference agreement by FASA aimed to increase opportunities for women to compete for federal contracts, setting a target rather than creating a new set-aside program. Subsequently, 3% procurement goals were established for HUBZone small businesses and SDVOSBs. Figure 1 illustrates the percentage of federal contracts awarded to various small business categories from FY2005 to FY2018. The federal government has struggled to meet procurement goals for WOSBs and HUBZone small businesses. The 5% goal for WOSBs was only achieved in FY2015, while the 3% goal for HUBZone small businesses was never met in the 14 fiscal years reported. In contrast, the 23% goal for all small businesses was met in 8 fiscal years, including the past 6 years. The 5% goal for SDBs was achieved in all 14 years, and the 3% goal for SDVOSBs was also met consistently. The 3% procurement goal for SDVOSBs was achieved in 7 of the 14 fiscal years. Frustrated by slow progress, WOSB advocates lobbied for a federal contracting set-aside program for WOSBs. The Women's Business Centers Sustainability Act of 1999 required GAO to review federal efforts to meet the 5% goal for WOSBs and identify measures to improve contracting opportunities. GAO issued a report on February 16, 2001. The GAO report from February 16, 2001 highlighted suggestions to improve WOSB contracting opportunities, including creating a contract program, coordinating outreach activities, promoting contracting through incentive programs, and providing more information to WOSBs. Legislation had been enacted to authorize the WOSB program by the time the report was published. The WOSB program was authorized in 2001 to provide greater access to federal contracting opportunities for WOSBs. Congressional efforts to promote WOSB set-asides were complicated by Supreme Court decisions on legal challenges of contracting preferences for minority contractors. The Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena case challenged federal subcontracting preferences for SDBs, arguing that race-based preferences violate the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The Supreme Court ruled that all racial classifications must pass strict scrutiny review, leading to a reexamination of affirmative action programs by the federal government. This included the development of the WOSB set-aside program, which faced heightened judicial review due to the Adarand decision. The House report accompanying H.R. 4897 advocated for a set-aside program for Women-Owned Small Businesses (WOSBs) due to slow progress in meeting procurement goals. Contract bundling and Federal Supply Schedules were noted to increase efficiency but may perpetuate the use of well-known firms. The Committee believes that achieving goals for increasing contracting opportunities for Women-Owned Small Businesses (WOSBs) will require a mandatory tool for identifying WOSBs and promoting competition among them. The bill did not establish sole source authority for WOSBs and limited set-asides to industries where WOSBs are underrepresented in federal contracts. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001 specified conditions for setting aside contracts for WOSBs or Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Businesses (EDWOSBs). In 2011, set-aside award caps for Women-Owned Small Businesses (WOSBs) and Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Businesses (EDWOSBs) were increased to $6.5 million for manufacturing contracts and $4 million for all other contracts. In 2013, caps were removed by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001 specified recipient eligibility requirements and mandated a study to identify underrepresented industries for WOSBs. WOSBs are underrepresented in federal procurement contracting. The SBA had to develop criteria to define an EDWOSB due to the lack of a clear definition of economic disadvantage. To participate in the program, WOSBs must meet specific requirements, including being at least 51% owned and controlled by women, having women manage day-to-day operations, and being certified by a federal agency or approved certifying entity. P.L. 113-291 (NDAA 2015) removed the ability for small businesses to self-certify their eligibility. The NDAA 2015 removed the ability for small businesses to self-certify their eligibility for the WOSB program. The SBA will implement its own certification process for WOSBs starting October 15, 2020. WOSBs and EDWOSBs must be either self-certified or third-party certified to participate in the program. Self-certification requires annual submission of certification information through the SBA's website and an up-to-date profile on the SAM website. Effective October 15, 2020, WOSBs and EDWOSBs must be certified to participate in the program. Self-certification is free, while third-party certification involves a fee. Other women-owned small businesses can self-certify as WOSBs, receive contract awards, and count towards procurement goals. EDWOSBs must meet all program requirements and be economically disadvantaged. The WOSB program, defined by the SBA, requires businesses to be owned and controlled by women with specific financial criteria. As of May 11, 2020, there were 65,903 WOSBs and 24,370 EDWOSBs registered. The program's implementation was delayed for over 10 years due to challenges in identifying underrepresented industries for WOSBs in federal procurement contracting. The SBA completed a draft of the legislatively mandated study of underrepresented NAICS industrial codes in September 2001 and submitted proposed regulations for the WOSB program to OMB. However, the SBA withdrew the regulations in April 2002 due to concerns about the draft industry study's content and constitutionality. A contract was awarded to the National Academy of Science in late 2003 to conduct the study. The SBA awarded a contract to NAS in late 2003 to conduct a study on race- and gender-conscious contracting programs. NAS found the SBA's study to be problematic and made recommendations for a new study. The SBA later issued a solicitation in October 2005 in response to NAS's analysis. The SBA issued a solicitation in October 2005 for a revised study on underrepresentation in federal contracting. The contract was awarded to the RAND Institute in February 2006, and their report in April 2007 identified 28 different approaches to determine underrepresentation based on disparity ratios. The SBA defined underrepresentation and substantial underrepresentation of WOSBs in federal procurement based on disparity ratios. Using this methodology, the SBA identified 83 four-digit NAICS industry groups in its final rule implementing the WOSB program. The SBA identified 83 four-digit NAICS industry groups as underrepresented for WOSBs in federal procurement. Congress passed legislation requiring the SBA to update the list of underrepresented NAICS codes every five years. The SBA sought assistance from the Department of Commerce's Office of the Chief Economist to conduct a new study on women-owned businesses' odds of winning federal contracts. The SBA increased the number of underrepresented and substantially underrepresented NAICS codes for women-owned businesses in federal procurement based on a study by the Office of the Chief Economist. Women-owned businesses were found to be less likely to win federal contracts in many industry groups. The SBA reduced the number of underrepresented and substantially underrepresented NAICS codes for women-owned businesses in response to OMB's release of NAICS 2017, merging two industry groups and affecting the WOSB program. This resulted in fewer four-digit NAICS industry groups where WOSBs are underrepresented. WOSB set-asides are available in 364 six-digit NAICS industry codes for WOSBs and in 80 six-digit NAICS industry codes exclusively for EDWOSBs. Federal agencies can award sole source contracts to eligible WOSBs under the WOSB program. The WOSB program allows federal agencies to award sole source contracts to eligible WOSBs if certain criteria are met, including the contract being assigned a NAICS code where WOSBs are underrepresented, the contracting officer not expecting offers from multiple WOSBs, and the contract value being below $4 million ($6.5 million for manufacturing contracts). The NDAA 2015 also allows sole source contracts for EDWOSBs under similar conditions. The WOSB program was expanded to include sole source contracts to help federal agencies meet the goal of awarding 5% of contracting dollars to WOSBs. The SBA implemented this expansion in 2015, but both GAO and SBA's OIG have criticized the program's oversight and implementation. GAO reported delays and deficiencies in oversight related to third-party certifiers and eligibility examinations. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) criticized the Small Business Administration's (SBA) oversight of the Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) program, highlighting deficiencies that limit the ability to identify fraud risks. GAO found that ineligible businesses received set-aside contracts, with 3.5% of WOSB contracts awarded for ineligible goods or services. SBA's Office of Inspector General (OIG) also found that 15 out of 34 set-aside awards did not meet WOSB requirements. The SBA OIG found that 15 out of 34 set-aside awards totaling $7.1 million did not meet WOSB program requirements. This was due to contracting officers not complying with regulations and lack of outreach and training from the SBA. Additionally, in 2018, the SBA's OIG found that 50 out of 56 WOSB sole source contracts awarded between January 2016 and April 2017 were problematic. The SBA's OIG found that 50 out of 56 WOSB sole source contracts awarded between January 2016 and April 2017, totaling $52.2 million, lacked necessary documentation for determining eligibility. Missing documentation included WOSB and EDWOSB self-certifications, articles of incorporation, birth certificates, and financial information. Congress may focus on oversight of the SBA's implementation of certification procedures, training of procurement officers, agencies' performance in achieving the 5% procurement goal for WOSBs, and the program's efficacy in meeting the goal. The WOSB program has seen an increase in usage, with federal procurement officers utilizing it more from $21 million in FY2011 to $893 million in FY2018. However, WOSB set-asides and sole source awards still make up a small portion of federal contracts awarded to WOSBs. Many federal agencies have limited experience with the program, as shown by the distribution of contracts in FY2018. The WOSB program has seen increased usage, with federal agencies awarding nearly 83% of contracts to DOD, DHS, Department of Commerce, Department of Agriculture, Department of Health and Human Services, and GSA. GAO conducted an audit from October 2017 to March 2019, interviewing various stakeholders who identified positive aspects of the program, such as providing more opportunities for WOSBs to win federal contracts. The WOSB program has seen increased usage, with federal agencies awarding contracts to various departments. Stakeholders identified positive aspects of the program, such as providing more opportunities for WOSBs to win federal contracts. However, there are impediments that limit the program's use by federal contracting officers, including difficulties in executing sole source authority and industry restrictions. The WOSB program sets aside contracts within specific industries identified by NAICS codes. Stakeholders recommend expanding or eliminating NAICS codes to increase opportunities for WOSBs. Some stakeholders find it easier to use the 8(a) or HUBZone programs because applicants are already certified by the SBA, reducing the need for additional eligibility documentation review. GSA officials suggest that eliminating the need for contracting officers to review eligibility documentation for WOSB set-asides could create more opportunities for WOSBs. The need for additional guidance for federal contracting officers under the WOSB program was discussed by stakeholders. Legislation was passed to eliminate option periods in sole source contracts for qualified small businesses, including WOSBs, to increase contracting opportunities. The bill aims to increase contracting opportunities for WOSBs (including EDWOSBs) by eliminating option years in sole source contracts, raising the sole source cap to $7 million for manufacturing contracts, and aligning it with other small business programs. Advocates suggest removing distinctions between WOSBs and EDWOSBs in contract awards and allowing set-asides and sole source awards in all NAICS industry codes. These changes could lead to more contracts being awarded to WOSBs. The bill aims to increase contracting opportunities for WOSBs by allowing set-asides and sole source awards in all NAICS industry codes, potentially leading to more contracts being awarded to WOSBs. This change addresses legal challenges and eliminates distinctions between WOSBs and EDWOSBs in contract awards. The Supreme Court's decision in Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena established that all racial classifications must pass strict scrutiny review. The WOSB program, although not based on racial classifications, was expected to face heightened judicial scrutiny, leading advocates to create distinctions to protect it from legal challenges. The program aims to provide more contracting opportunities for small businesses, with complexities arising from distinctions between WOSBs, EDWOSBs, and different NAICS codes. The SBA's implementation of the WOSB program faced delays due to difficulties in defining distinctions between WOSBs, EDWOSBs, and NAICS codes. Congressional oversight remains a priority, as federal agencies struggle to meet the 5% procurement goal for WOSBs. While federal procurement officers are using the WOSB program more frequently, it still accounts for a small portion of contracts awarded to WOSBs. The WOSB program faces challenges in awarding federal contracts in full competition with other small business programs. Congressional interest remains in addressing the low percentage of contracts awarded through the WOSB program."
