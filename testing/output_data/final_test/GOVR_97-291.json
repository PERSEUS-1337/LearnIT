There were also worries about increased pollution in the U.S.-Mexico border region due to NAFTA-driven industrialization and population growth. Trade officials argued that environmental issues were not typically addressed in trade talks. NAFTA negotiators responded to concerns over environmental issues by including provisions to protect stricter environmental, health, and safety standards. The agreement also discourages lowering standards to attract investment and promotes upward harmonization of standards. NAFTA does not restrict a country's ability to set its own environmental protection levels for manufacturing and process standards. NAFTA addressed environmental concerns by including provisions to protect stricter standards and promoting upward harmonization. It recognizes three trade-related MEAs that may take precedence over NAFTA in case of conflicts. Despite these provisions, some in Congress were worried about the unpredictable impact of NAFTA on environmental laws. The debate on NAFTA's impact on environmental laws raised concerns about investor challenges to environmental measures as expropriation. Over 20 cases have been filed, including one involving California's MTBE ban. NAFTA's completion led to additional agreements to address environmental issues. Questions arose about lax enforcement of environmental laws in Mexico incentivizing U.S. industries to relocate, potentially increasing job losses and border pollution. The debate over NAFTA's impact on environmental laws led to calls for side agreements with enforcement mechanisms. In 1993, the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC) was adopted to address failures in enforcing environmental laws. The objectives of the side accord include enhancing compliance with environmental regulations and fostering environmental protection. The North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC) was created to enforce environmental laws and regulations, establish the North American Commission for Environmental Cooperation (NACEC), and promote environmental protection and pollution prevention. NACEC includes a Council, Joint Advisory Committee, and Secretariat with key responsibilities for dispute settlement and addressing environmental concerns within NAFTA. The NAAEC's dispute settlement process allows for monetary assessments and sanctions for parties failing to enforce environmental laws. Complaints must be trade-related or involve competing goods/services, and can be initiated by NAFTA parties or submitted by individuals/NGOs. The Secretariat may prepare factual records for consideration by the Council. Since 1995, 47 citizen submissions have been filed, with 9 factual records finalized and made public. The NAFTA debate highlighted the need for funding sources to finance environmental improvements in the border area, where pollution was attributed to unregulated industrial development and population growth from Mexico's maquiladora program. Both governments anticipated that NAFTA could worsen existing environmental conditions without a binational effort to address infrastructure needs. The Administration estimated that $8 billion would be required over the next decade for sewage treatment, drinking water, and waste infrastructure projects along the border, with additional needs arising from NAFTA-related industrialization. Support for NAFTA in Congress was partially contingent on identifying funding sources. In October 1993, the United States and Mexico established the Border Environmental Cooperation Agreement to finance environmental infrastructure projects along the border. The agreement led to the creation of the North American Development Bank (NADB) and the Border Environment Cooperation Commission (BECC) to assist in areas like water pollution and wastewater treatment. The BECC coordinates and certifies projects for financing, while the NADB provides financial support. The North American Development Bank (NADB) was created to provide financing for border environmental infrastructure projects. The NADB generates loans or guarantees for projects on both sides of the border, with funding from the United States and Mexico. However, the NADB faces challenges in financing projects in low-income border communities due to its requirement to make market-rate loans. Despite this, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also provides grants for environmental projects. The NADB utilizes EPA grants for border infrastructure projects, with $75 million or $50 million annually allocated by Congress. The BEIF was established to make water and wastewater projects affordable for border communities. As of June 30, 2004, the NADB had approved 22 loans totaling $97.1 million and disbursed 9 loans, with a total of $662.4 million in grants authorized. EPA grant funds can be used for BECC-approved projects on either side of the border. The NADB had authorized $662.4 million in grants and/or loans for 80 infrastructure projects, including $490 million in EPA grants for water and wastewater projects. Interest in reforming the NADB emerged due to low activity levels and reliance on EPA grants. In 2000, the NADB established a Low Interest Rate Lending Facility using part of its capital to provide lower-than-market rate loans to communities. In 2001, Presidents Bush and Fox directed a working group to strengthen the NADB and BECC. Recommendations included focusing on environmental projects, giving NADB more flexibility for financing, and expanding operations in Mexico. The NADB Board approved a Water Conservation Investment Fund in 2002. H.R. 254 (P.L.108-215) in 2004 authorized operational reforms for the NADB. The NAFTA Implementation Act in 1997 directed a report on the effects of NAFTA and side agreements. Studies have linked increased border pollution to NAFTA, but also identify other contributing factors. A 2001 NAAEC study warned of significant air pollution from increased freight traffic in NAFTA transportation corridors. The traffic in NAFTA transportation corridors is expected to double or quadruple by 2020. The number of assembly factories in Mexico near the border increased from 2,114 in 1993 to 3,182 in 2003, with employment more than doubling to 1.07 million. A report by the EPA in 2000 highlighted the environmental challenges at the border, including pollution and water constraints. The NAAEC committee concluded that NAFTA has promoted trinational environmental cooperation and capacity building, with specific progress seen in Mexico. During the 107th and 108th Congress, attention was given to trade promotion authority legislation and the U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement, which incorporated environmental provisions from the NAAEC and NAFTA. Concerns were raised about NAFTA-like investment provisions impacting domestic environmental protection efforts. Efforts to reform the BECC and NADB continued, leading to the signing of P.L.108-215 in April 2004, allowing the NADB to provide below-market-rate loans and limited grants. The NADB's charter allows for below-market-rate loans and grants to increase project support. U.S. NADB board members are directed to oppose projects with over 50% grant financing. The law extends the operational area of BECC/NADB on the Mexican border. Legislation also encourages financing clean energy projects. Interest in NAFTA implications continues in the 108th Congress. Interest in the implications of NAFTA and the NAAEC for new trade agreements in the 108th Congress remains high. The U.S.-Chile and U.S.-Singapore FTAs include obligations to enforce environmental laws and dispute settlement procedures. Both agreements also have environmental cooperation and capacity-building provisions. The U.S.-Central America FTA (CAFTA) includes similar provisions and allows citizens to file submissions on a party's failure to enforce environmental laws effectively. Some Members of Congress and environmental groups are concerned about the provisions in the current TPA law. Concerns persist among Members of Congress and environmental groups regarding the adequacy of current TPA law and trade agreements in protecting environmental measures from challenges, especially in investor-state disputes. While the debate on including environmental issues in trade negotiations has been settled, the discussion on how to address these concerns is ongoing. The impact of environment-related provisions in recent U.S. bilateral trade agreements, including NAFTA, will become clearer as these agreements are implemented."
