    "content": "Employee benefits for retired workers, especially health insurance, have declined in recent years due to increasing costs. Unlike pensions, firms are not required to prefund retiree health insurance, leading to concerns about coverage and health status of retirees. The firm is not obligated to set aside funds for future retiree health insurance. Retiree health benefits can be revised or eliminated during financial hardships. Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary Associations (VEBAs) are tax-exempt trust funds that can cover various employee benefits. The report focuses on the use of VEBAs to fund retiree health insurance, showing potential benefits for both firms and workers. VEBAs are tax-exempt trust funds that can cover various employee benefits, such as accident benefits, child care facilities, disaster loans or grants, supplemental unemployment insurance, education and training, severance benefits, and retiree health benefits. The use of VEBA contributions can help reduce or eliminate retiree health insurance liabilities for firms. Once funds are contributed to a VEBA, they cannot revert back to the firm, providing benefits to unionized workers. However, insufficient funding in a VEBA offers few benefits. Negotiations between GM, Ford, and Chrysler and the UAW illustrate aspects of VEBA implementation. The report discusses contract negotiations and revisions during the 2009 bankruptcy of Chrysler and GM. It covers funding of retiree health insurance from the firm, workers, and VEBA perspectives, VEBA's role in bankruptcy reorganization, benefits and risks in unionized firms, and legislative issues. Detroit 3 VEBAs are used as examples, with GM receiving special emphasis due to its public financial information availability. Ford also renegotiated its 2007 retiree health VEBA with the UAW in 2009. Some VEBAs are now structured as independent trusts, controlled by membership or trustees designated by the members. The Detroit 3 VEBA is an example, operating independently from the automobile companies since 2010. Negotiations between firms and unions determine funding for retiree health insurance in these independent VEBAs. The parties negotiated funding for retiree health insurance, with VEBAs providing tax incentives for prefunding health benefits. A Credit Suisse/First Boston study estimated a $336 billion unfunded liability for post-retirement benefits in 2005. VEBAs offer tax deductions and tax-free investment income. Funding constraints exist for most VEBAs, with limits on funding levels to avoid Unrelated Business Income Tax (UBIT). However, VEBAs created through collective bargaining agreements have more flexibility, allowing for actuarially standard levels of medical inflation and no UBIT. These VEBAs are used to fund retiree health insurance and are not subject to deductibility constraints. The tax advantages of retiree health insurance VEBAs in unionized workplaces are greater than other types of VEBAs due to no UBIT owed and no deductibility limits. Firms using VEBAs can improve their financial position by avoiding liabilities on their balance sheet, which can depress market value. Transferring a firm's liability for benefits to a VEBA can increase market value. Employees in a VEBA share a common bond and can be from different firms. A VEBA reduces the risk of receiving promised retiree benefits and ensures funds go to intended recipients. A VEBA ensures funds go to intended recipients and reduces the risk of not receiving promised retiree benefits. It must have sufficient funds to cover costs for current and future retirees to receive benefits, known as a fully funded VEBA. VEBAs offer tax advantages to workers by excluding firm contributions from gross income. Benefits from a tax-exempt VEBA are not included in gross income and are taxed when distributed. IRS approval is required to implement a VEBA, with specific documentation needed for a 501(c)(9) determination letter. VEBAs negotiated by unions can be combined, as seen with the UAW's decision to merge VEBAs from GM, Ford, and Chrysler into one larger trust. The VEBAs from different firms can be combined to create one larger trust, as seen with the UAW merging VEBAs from GM, Ford, and Chrysler. The funds deposited for each firm are not mixed, making it challenging to calculate the total amount needed to fully fund the VEBA. Actuarial calculations involve forecasting variables like retirement dates, life expectancies, healthcare utilization, medical inflation rates, asset returns, and changes in the trust over time. The calculation of fully funding a VEBA trust involves forecasting variables like medical inflation, asset returns, and changes in the tax code. Estimating the number of future workers eligible for retiree benefits and their retirement timelines adds complexity. Contributions from firms and workers can span over several years, with VEBAs funded in various ways. Liquidated firms are easier to calculate fully funded levels for compared to financially healthy firms. Both GM and the UAW contributed to the retiree health VEBA, with active workers sacrificing wage increases and cost of living adjustments. GM funded the VEBA with various financial instruments, and negotiations determined the percentage of fully funded level for which GM would be responsible. There is no legal requirement for VEBAs to be fully funded. The trustees of the VEBA manage funding and choose health insurance plans. Union contracts may require existing plans to continue until a specified date. Once free to change plans, trustees select the most favorable terms. The VEBA's ability to fund retiree health insurance depends on cost-effective plan choices. Retiree health benefits may be reduced during a chapter 11 reorganization, but do not automatically end. The court may approve modifications to benefits after determining. Modifications to retiree health benefits in chapter 11 bankruptcy are possible but not guaranteed. A funded VEBA provides strong protection as funds in the VEBA are safe from the firm's creditors. Forming and funding a VEBA can benefit both the firm and retirees. Forming and funding a VEBA can benefit both the firm and its workers by improving financial statements and providing workers with guaranteed benefits, even in bankruptcy. However, the level of funding in VEBAs is inherently risky and unpredictable, as it depends on factors like stock prices and consumer demand for the firm's products. The funding level of a VEBA is determined by the collective bargaining process, which can be uncertain for current and future retirees. Firms must have the money to contribute to the VEBA as dictated by collective bargaining agreements. Tradeoffs exist for retirees between the near future and distant future, with the automotive VEBA intended to last 80 years. The VEBA for retiree health benefits may not be fully funded, leading to potential conflicts between current and future retirees. GM and Chrysler received over $80 billion in assistance from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, with the federal government now owning a significant stake in both companies, raising concerns about conflicts of interest. Legislation has been introduced to Congress regarding VEBAs for former employees of Delphi Corporation, with bills providing up to $3 billion from the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. A resolution has also been introduced requesting details on the role of the Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry in relation to GM's employee and retiree benefits. Establishing a VEBA gives workers more control over health insurance funding. Retiree health insurance through VEBA gives workers control over funding and plan design. Success is measured years later, influenced by firm's financial health, trustees' investment decisions, and cost-effective insurance plans for retirees."
