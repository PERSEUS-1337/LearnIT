We address issues like flickering and halo structures by introducing a novel temporal loss function that considers higher time derivatives of point positions. Our method, which includes a truncation approach, is effective for large, deforming point sets from different sources. Our proposed deep-learning method aims to create stable feature spaces for changing point clouds by considering the time dimension. This approach is effective for large, deforming point sets from different sources, demonstrating flexibility in handling point-based data sets. In the context of super-resolution, a method is proposed to learn stable representations for point-based data sets by considering the time dimension. Point-based data lack ordering, making convolutions challenging. Various approaches for point-based convolutions have been suggested, utilizing neural network architectures and Earth Mover's Distance to establish a loss for temporal coherence. Training point networks for localized patches is crucial to avoid reliance on the entire dataset for tasks like normal estimation. In super-resolution tasks, a patch-based approach is crucial for dealing with varying input and output sizes. The challenge lies in handling permutation-invariant inputs and targets of changing sizes that move and deform over time. Key contributions include permutation invariant loss terms for point set generation, a Siamese training setup for point-based super-resolution, and enabling dynamic adjustments for improved output variance. The curr_chunk discusses the use of neural networks to improve output variance by dynamically adjusting the output size. It introduces a specialized form of mode collapse for temporal point networks and a loss term to address it. The goal is to infer stable solutions for moving point clouds with millions of points, generating a point set with increased resolution from input points. The network aims to estimate the underlying shape and generate suitable sampling positions as output, targeting a two to three-fold increase per spatial dimension. The network must establish a stable latent space representation for moving point clouds with changing positions and densities. Deep learning techniques like PointNet and PointNet++ have been developed to handle order-invariant networks for dynamic point sets. The goal of defining point convolutions has been explored in various works, with approaches such as MCNN using Monte Carlo integration, PointCNN utilizing nearest neighbors, and PU-Net proposing a hierarchical network structure. These methods are used for convolutional operations in networks to extract abstract features from point clouds. In the realm of point-based learning, various methods like Deep Kd-network, PointProNets, PCPNet, and P2PNet have been developed to address different challenges in 3D reconstruction and shape property estimation. The focus has recently shifted towards 3D segmentation problems, showcasing a growing interest in this area. In the realm of 3D segmentation, various networks like SPLATNet, SGPN, SpiderCNN, PointConv, SONEt, and 3DRNN have proposed improvements. Other networks such as Flex Convolution, SuperPoint Graph, and fully convolutional network focus on large scale segmentation. Additionally, there is interest in shape classification, object detection, hand pose tracking, rotation and translation invariant inference, point cloud autoencoders, and generative models based on points. Our work focuses on generative models for point cloud super-resolution, specifically targeting temporally changing data. We aim to infer a function that approximates a high-resolution output point cloud from an input point cloud, with the number of output points determined by an upsampling factor. Our super-resolution network treats the upsampling problem locally, working with individual patches extracted from input point clouds. A spatial loss function based on Earth Mover's Distance is used to measure how well two point clouds represent the same object or scene. The Mover's Distance (EMD) solves an assignment problem to obtain a differentiable bijective mapping \u03c6 :\u1ef9 \u2192 y, minimizing differences in position for arbitrary orderings of point clouds. A Siamese network setup is used for temporal loss calculation to address the nonlinear and ill-posed nature of the super-resolution problem, reducing temporal artifacts like flickering. To train a temporally coherent network with high resolution point cloud sequences, a Siamese setup is employed to ensure consistent behavior of the output. The network is evaluated multiple times with the same weights and moving inputs to avoid recurrent architectures. Temporal derivatives can be computed from input points and used for training. To enforce temporal coherence in high-resolution point cloud sequences, temporal derivatives can be computed from input points. Minimizing the generated positions over consecutive time steps can reduce flickering, but does not constrain acceleration. Including the previous state at time step t-1 can further reduce jittering, but direct temporal constraints may lead to clustering of generated points around the center point during training. To ensure temporal coherence in high-resolution point cloud sequences, temporal derivatives are computed from input points. The training procedure is adjusted to balance minimizing changes and encouraging realistic, larger motions. The network is provided with a reference by using the estimated velocity of the ground truth point cloud sequence. The temporal constraint is formulated in a permutation invariant manner to mimic the motion of the closest ground truth points and minimize rapid changes of velocity over time. The algorithm introduces additional loss terms for processing variable input and output points in localized super-resolution. It aims to ensure a full set of samples without scaling invariance, requiring features at different spatial scales. The algorithm focuses on training a network for fixed spatial size to handle varying numbers of inputs. Padding is used with specific values to prevent misinterpretation by the network. The network generates a fixed number of points regardless of input size, and outputs are masked to ensure consistency for loss calculations. The algorithm uses masking to truncate the point cloud for loss calculations, providing an approximation of the true number of target points. This approximation is accurate for planar surfaces but less so for detailed structures. Output counts vary significantly in practice, impacting target shape and performance. Incorporating variable output sizes improves results. Incorporating variable output sizes provides a good approximation for data sets. Training a second network to predict output size did not significantly improve results. The network generates output points related to input points, focusing on maintaining temporal coherence. The proposed temporal loss formulation includes L2 Loss Velocity Only Velocity + Acceleration. Ablation study shows the effectiveness of the velocity loss LEV and the full loss formulation with LEV + LEA. Quantitative results for different terms of the loss functions are provided, showing improvements in target shape approximation and output quality. The curr_chunk discusses the issue of cluster-like structures in point cloud output, leading to suboptimal distributions over time. To address this, a mingling loss term is introduced to prevent cluster formation by pushing individual points apart. This mingling loss encourages global mixing of points rather than just local repulsion, improving the distribution of patterns in the output. The curr_chunk introduces a final loss function that includes spatial and temporal terms, along with weighting terms, for training a network with simulated data. The temporal loss functions are employed with established network architectures to illustrate their effects on generating well-distributed points. The focus is on maintaining spatial structure and temporal coherence in the output. The curr_chunk discusses the application of a method to an animation of a moving spider, showcasing the preservation of shape with fewer outliers and a more even distribution of points. It also presents graphs illustrating the reduced high frequency changes in the latent space with temporal loss. The curr_chunk discusses frequency changes in the latent space with temporal loss, showing significant high-frequency information in the blue and red curves. It also compares point counts between previous work and their proposed network, highlighting the more even distribution of points generated by their network. The curr_chunk evaluates the effectiveness of a loss formulation through a two-dimensional ablation study and compares their method to previous work using a PointNet++ architecture. The resulting quality is assessed through a supplemental video, showcasing the distribution of points covering the object more evenly. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges faced by a network in approximating target points due to temporally changing data and varying output sizes. Different approaches are evaluated, with L EA showing the best results in terms of removing errors and clustering of generated points. The success of our approach for dynamic output sizes is demonstrated in Table 1, showing an L2 error with respect to ground truth size. Our goal is to learn stable features over time, analyzing the latent space content for different inputs. The latent space is a 256-dimensional vector containing features extracted by the network's initial layers. A qualitative example in Fig. 8 illustrates the model's ability to extract coherent data sets from patch sequences, with the model trained with temporal coherence showing smoother results. The model trained with temporal coherence shows smoother results and lower high frequency content compared to the version without temporal loss formulations. This is confirmed by weighted integrals, with values of 36.56 and 16.98 respectively. The temporal model establishes a stable temporal latent space by evaluating temporal frequencies for inputs in randomized order. The model with temporal coherence training yields smoother results and lower high frequency content compared to the version without temporal loss formulations. It correctly identifies incoherent inputs and maintains high frequencies similar to the regular model. The generated point clouds are mapped to ground-truth points for correlation analysis. The mean position and sample density changes over time are evaluated to ensure accuracy in ground-truth changes. The method shows clear improvements in position errors and density derivatives, indicating smoother results with temporal coherence training. Our patch-based approach involves decomposing input volumes into patches over time. Results show improved accuracy in position errors and density derivatives with temporal coherence training. The method produces even and stable reconstructions of 3D models, as demonstrated in the accompanying video. Comparatively, previous work exhibits uneven point distributions and outliers. Our network improves point distribution and motion accuracy, adapting to sparse regions with fewer outputs. It outperforms previous fixed-output methods, showcasing flexibility in generating coherent point sets from volumetric data. Our method demonstrates improved quality in generating coherent point sets from volumetric data, showcasing generalization capabilities and lower loss values for spatial and temporal terms. It is also applicable to physical simulations, particularly for fluids, where time stability is crucial. Our method improves spatial and temporal accuracy for liquids, with low errors and high convergence. It introduces a novel loss function for temporal coherence and prevents static patterns in the results. The super-resolution results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our approach introduces a mingling loss term for dynamic point clouds, showing promising super-resolution results. It can be combined with other network architectures for various applications such as generating point clouds from image sequences or animated meshes. Future work could explore classification tasks of 3D scans over time and representing physical phenomena like elastic bodies and fluids in a Lagrangian manner. Our approach utilizes physical simulation to generate complex motions for training data. The IISPH algorithm is employed to efficiently create incompressible liquid volumes, allowing for control over point density. High-resolution input pairs are generated by sampling regions near the surface, while low-resolution inputs are computed using Poisson-disk sampling to create points with larger spacing. This process helps prevent aliasing in the data. Our method utilizes physical simulation to generate complex motions for training data. Surface fairing and smoothing are performed before downsampling to prevent aliasing. Models trained with this data can be applied to moving surface data and new liquid configurations. The surface data is resampled with bicubic interpolation to match a chosen average per-point area. When applied to new liquid simulations, all points of a low-resolution simulation are used directly. Our method utilizes physical simulation to generate complex motions for training data. Surface fairing and smoothing are performed before downsampling to prevent aliasing. When applied to new liquid simulations, all points of a low-resolution simulation are used directly. Points are sampled via Poisson-disk sampling around the surface to create temporally coherent patches, with new patches sampled for points outside existing ones. Resampling of patches over time is instantaneous in our implementation. Our network architecture relies on hierarchical point-based convolutions, extracting features for a subset of points and their nearest neighbors. Group centers are selected evenly from input clouds, with points within a chosen radius processed. Padded points far outside the regular range are filtered out efficiently. Each group is then processed by a PointNet-like sub-structure. The network architecture utilizes hierarchical point-based convolutions to extract features from input clouds. Group centers are selected evenly, processed by a PointNet-like sub-structure, and interpolated back to the original points. Input and output masking are key features of this approach, with a mean point spacing of 0.5 units. The point data was generated with a mean spacing of 0.5 units. For 2D tests, patches with diameters of 5 and 15 were used for low and high-resolution data, respectively. Thresholds k max = 100 and n max = 900 were applied, with loss parameters \u03b3 = 10, \u00b5 = 10, and \u03bd = 0.001. The network was trained with 5 epochs, a batch size of 16, and a learning rate of 0.001. For 3D results, scaling factor r was 8, patch diameters were 6 and 12 for low and high-resolution data, with k max = 1280 and n max = 10240. Loss parameters were \u03b3 = \u00b5 = 5, \u03bd = 0.001, and training involved 10 epochs, 54k patches, and a batch size of 4. The input feature vector is processed in the first part of the network using four point convolutions with different parameters for each level. Interpolation layers are then used to distribute features among input points, extending the original point cloud with 256 features. The data flow in the network is visually represented in Fig. 11. Fig. 11 provides a visual overview of the data flow in the network. The data is processed in separate branches with shared fully interconnected layers. The output is then processed with additional layers and skip connections for stability. The network accepts various input features such as velocity, density, and pressure for data generation. The network processes data with separate branches and shared layers, including velocity, density, and pressure fields. The pressure fields have minimal influence. The latent space stability is evaluated with and without temporal loss using ordered and unordered patch sequences. The central latent space is 256-dimensional and its behavior is analyzed by averaging components over patch sequences. The result is a time sequence of scalar values representing deviations in the latent space. The Fourier transform of the scalar values representing deviations in the latent space is used to compute the weighted frequency content. Examples from the synthetic data generation process and an overview of the network architecture are provided. Convergence plots for training runs of different 2D and 3D versions are also shown. The Fourier transform is used to compute the weighted frequency content in the latent space deviations. Terms vary among the four variants, with LM not minimized and only provided for reference."
