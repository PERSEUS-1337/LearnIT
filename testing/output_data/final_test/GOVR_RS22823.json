    "content": "The evolution of trade agreements included enforceable labor provisions, which were not initially part of U.S. trade policy focused on lowering tariffs. The International Labor Organization (ILO) sets international labor standards through Conventions adopted at its annual conferences. The 1995 U.N. Social Summit in Copenhagen declared four fundamental principles and rights at work: freedom of association, elimination of forced labor, elimination of child labor, and elimination of discrimination in employment. The ILO responded with the 1998 Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, requiring all Member States to respect these principles. The Follow-Up calls for reports on implementation of these rights, including from countries that have not ratified the core Conventions. The U.S. promoted internationally recognized worker rights similar to those in the Declaration. The U.S. has developed trade preference laws for developing countries that require them to uphold \"internationally recognized worker rights,\" similar to those in the ILO Declaration. These laws include the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA), African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), and Haiti Opportunity through Partnership Act (HOPE). These laws mandate that beneficiary countries must ensure acceptable conditions of work, including minimum wages, hours of work, and occupational safety and health. In 1996, the WTO debated forming a committee to address trade and labor standards. Developing countries argued against it, stating it was a smokescreen for protectionism. Ultimately, the ILO was designated as the body to handle internationally recognized core labor standards. The ILO promotes labor standards through consensus and technical assistance, while bilateral U.S. trade agreements have evolved to include labor provisions. The inclusion of labor provisions in bilateral U.S. trade agreements has evolved over time. Initially, agreements with Israel and Canada did not include labor provisions. However, after 1993, there was a shift due to negotiations with lesser-developed countries and a growing recognition of the relationship between labor issues and trade policy. Globalization was also seen to have both benefits and costs, with benefits like economic growth and access to lower-priced goods, but costs such as job displacement and diminished worker rights in developing countries. Business groups have played a role in pushing for these changes. Since 1993, the United States has negotiated 13 FTAs with 19 countries, including NAFTA, bilateral agreements with various countries, and regional agreements like CAFTA-DR. Business groups have made concessions to labor groups to promote trade agreements and investment in developing countries, reflecting a bipartisan compromise on labor language in recent agreements. The \"May 10th Agreement\" of 2007 includes additional labor provisions in FTAs, such as enforcing basic international labor standards and using identical enforcement provisions for all agreement provisions. NAFTA's labor provisions are in a side agreement called NAALC, where countries agree to enforce their own labor laws. The U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement includes enforceable labor provisions that prohibit the failure to effectively enforce labor laws affecting trade, with shared dispute resolution procedures for labor and commercial provisions. Labor laws are defined as U.S. internationally recognized worker rights. Enforcement procedures differ from the main agreement, with limits on monetary assessments and benefits suspension for noncompliance. Labor laws are defined as U.S. internationally recognized worker rights. Disputes can lead to \"any appropriate and commensurate measure\" if not resolved. Trade agreements with various countries have enforceable labor provisions related to effectively enforcing labor laws affecting trade. The Bipartisan Trade Deal in 2007 included enforceable commitments on adopting and maintaining ILO Declaration in laws, prohibiting lowering of labor standards in pending FTAs with Peru, Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. Labor and commercial disputes in trade agreements have similar procedures, with limits on monetary penalties for labor disputes and suspension of benefits as a last resort option for both types of disputes. The 2007 Bipartisan Trade Deal included enforceable commitments on adopting and maintaining ILO Declaration in laws, prohibiting lowering of labor standards in pending FTAs with Peru, Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. The deal also introduced new limitations on prosecutorial and enforcement discretion, and incorporated similar dispute settlement mechanisms and penalties for labor and commercial disputes in all four agreements. The language in the agreements limits obligations to those specified in the ILO Declaration. The Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP), released by President Obama on November 5, 2015, includes 11 countries bordering the Pacific Ocean, with six already covered by previous FTAs. Recent agreements with Peru, South Korea, Panama, and Colombia were approved by Congress in implementing bills. Disputes may involve monetary assessments and suspension of benefits for non-conformity. The TPP includes 11 countries bordering the Pacific Ocean, with six covered by previous FTAs. The additional five are Brunei, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Vietnam. The agreement includes provisions to strengthen adherence to labor principles, such as maintaining statutes on acceptable work conditions, discouraging goods produced by forced labor, encouraging corporate social responsibility, and using corporate labor dialogue to resolve issues. The TPP includes provisions for corporate labor dialogue to resolve labor issues expeditiously, including action plans with specific steps and independent verification. This initiative aims to address differences between labor and commercial FTA provisions, focusing on enforcement agencies. Under Models 2 and 4, all labor provisions in trade agreements are enforceable, while Models 1 and 3 only enforce certain labor provisions. NAFTA's labor side agreement, NAALC, enforces standards on child labor, minimum wages, and occupational safety, but not core labor rights like organizing and collective bargaining. FTAs under Model 3 have a broader enforceable labor provision requiring countries to uphold all laws related to internationally recognized labor rights. In the NAALC, countries must enforce their own laws on internationally recognized worker rights affecting trade. Models 1 and 3 have different enforcement procedures for labor violations compared to other provisions. Models 2 and 4 have a single set of enforcement procedures covering all provisions without caps on penalties. Under Model 2, U.S.-Jordan FTA aims for mutual resolution without dispute settlement procedures. Labor provisions in Model 4 agreements are fully enforceable. Labor provisions in Model 4 agreements are fully enforceable through the same dispute resolution procedures available for other disputes. However, a footnote limits a key labor provision to the ILO Declaration, suggesting that trading Partners could be held to the principles of the Declaration but not the details of the Conventions and Follow-Up procedures. Concerns have been raised about potential conflicts between some ILO core labor standard conventions and U.S. labor laws. Differences in the consideration of commercial and labor disputes by the Department of Commerce (DOC) and the Department of Labor (DOL) exist. The Department of Commerce (DOC) and the Department of Labor (DOL) receive complaints about compliance with trade agreements. The DOC uses various sources to conduct research on compliance cases, while the DOL focuses on protecting the needs of U.S. workers and ensuring compliance with labor provisions of trade agreements. The Department of Labor (DOL) receives information on foreign labor conditions from various sources and may take action to resolve issues before dispute resolution. Labor submissions have been filed alleging violations of labor provisions in trade agreements with countries like Guatemala, Bahrain, and Mexico. However, none of these disputes have led to formal consultation with foreign governments for potential dispute resolution. The USTR is currently handling two pending cases involving Guatemala and Bahrain. The Department of Labor has recommended formal consultations for the case with Bahrain. The USTR prioritizes cases based on clear violations, potential to clarify issues, and likelihood of winning based on evidence. Entering dispute resolution is a lengthy and expensive process for the small USTR operation."
