    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commercial Truck Safety Act\" and includes a Commercial Truck Safety Program. The Commercial Truck Safety Act includes a program to improve commercial motor vehicle safety on highways, allowing covered trucks with specific criteria to operate on the Interstate System with waivers granted by the Secretary. The Commercial Truck Safety Act allows covered trucks meeting specific criteria to operate on the Interstate System in a State with waivers granted by the Secretary. The Governor must submit a request including details of proposed routes, safety certifications, and other required information. The Secretary requires specific information for waiver requests under the Commercial Truck Safety Act. The Secretary must acknowledge receipt of the request within 30 days and notify the Governor of the decision within 90 days. The Secretary must provide specific safety concerns if a waiver request is disapproved. Failure to act on a request within the specified time frame results in automatic approval. Data collection and review are required for receiving a waiver. As a condition of receiving a waiver, a State transportation department must collect data on the effects of the waiver, establish a safety committee to review the data, and set rules and procedures for the program. The safety committee must be appointed by the Governor and consist of members. The State transportation department must establish a safety committee with specific members, including a member of the traveling public, a business using truck transportation services, a commercial truck driver, a professional engineer from the State DOT, and a member of a highway safety group. The committee must submit reports to the State and the Secretary annually during the waiver period. The safety committee must submit an annual report describing the data reviewed during the year. After a 3-year program, a waiver granted to a State will become permanent unless adverse impacts on highway safety are determined and published in the Federal Register. Additionally, there is a waiver of vehicle weight limits. Waiver of vehicle weight limits allows States receiving a waiver to not lose any apportionment under chapter 1 for noncompliance with vehicle weight provisions for certain vehicles over 80,000 pounds on highways. SEC. 3. CONFORMING AMENDMENT. The analysis for chapter 4 of title 23, United States Code, is amended to include a new section titled \"413. Commercial truck safety program.\""
