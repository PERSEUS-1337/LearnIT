    "content": "Health insurance premiums are the agreed-upon amount paid for a set of health benefits over a defined period. They are paid monthly by policyholders or enrollees and can vary based on age, sex, and health status. Rating methodologies differ between market segments and may vary by state regulations. Health insurance premium rates are calculated based on factors such as age, sex, geographic location, number of employees, and type of health insurance product. In the small group market, a \"manual rate\" is first estimated, while in the large group market, rates are determined from either individual group's medical claims history or a blended average of manual rates. Premium rates are actuarial estimates of covering a risk pool of individuals under a specific health benefits package, with more generous packages leading to higher premiums. Health insurance premiums are calculated based on various factors, including deductibles, to compensate insurance carriers for financial risks. Premium rates are adjusted to reflect factors like previous financial losses and state solvency standards. These standards require insurance companies to keep reserves of capital to protect against unforeseen losses and prevent bankruptcy. The Bureau of Labor Statistics' Producer Price Index data shows a 4.4% average increase in private health insurance premiums between 2004 and 2010, with a higher acceleration since 2009. Premiums can be much higher in individual and small group markets due to smaller risk pools, leading to distortions in average healthcare costs covered by premiums. In the employer group market, worker share of premiums has been increasing as employer subsidies decrease. Employers have shifted more of the cost to workers, leading to higher cost sharing requirements and decreased real income. Average incomes for adults and families declined from 2007 to 2010, with a greater proportion of income being consumed by health insurance premiums. The growth of health insurance premiums has been a focus of congressional attention, with premiums covering health benefits, administrative costs, and profit margins. The final component of premium calculation involves adjustments for various factors like responding to competitors, hedging against regulatory risks, and the underwriting cycle. Health benefits expenses, the largest premium component, are determined by unit prices of health services and utilization. In 2010, health benefits accounted for about 85% of premiums in the health insurance industry. Health benefits expenses have trended upwards between 2003 and 2010, with an annual increase typically over 7%. Factors affecting medical trend include health status of enrollees, coverage policy, managed care techniques, and organizational factors. The unit price of health services and prescription drugs also plays a role. The unit price of health services and prescription drugs is determined through contract negotiations between various healthcare entities. Geographic variation in provider pricing exists, with significant differences in payment rates among different markets. Insurers pay varying prices due to differences in provider bargaining power. In California markets, physician group practice integration with hospital systems, hospital mergers, and regulatory environment favoring providers contribute to price negotiation advantage. State insurance commissioners recognize providers' power in negotiating higher unit prices. In Massachusetts, the Division of Insurance approved a premium rate increase for Fallon Community Health Plan due to demand for broad provider choice. The Massachusetts Division of Insurance Appeals Board and the state Attorney General found that large providers have leverage over health insurance companies in negotiating prices, leading to price increases in health care services. Unit price transparency is lacking in the US due to proprietary negotiations between payers and providers. Producer price inflation measures like the PPI are not suitable for examining unit price inflation among privately insured individuals. The aging American population drives increased demand for health services and prescription drugs, leading to price inflation for hospitals, physicians, and drugs. However, the overall age distribution of the population changes slowly over time. The aging American population is projected to increase just 1.8 years from 36.9 in 2010 to 38.7 in 2030. Medicare assists the private health insurance market by covering most persons age 65 and older. Health insurance companies have a financial incentive to limit health benefits to increase profits. They can use various management techniques to control healthcare utilization. Utilization management techniques, such as utilization review, case management, and physician gatekeeping, are used by insurers to restrict health care utilization and control costs. Insurers may also limit the use of high-priced providers through network contracting. While utilization management became prevalent in the late 1980s, consumer resistance has led to a shift towards case management focused on provider coordination and evidence-based medicine for improved outcomes. Utilization management techniques, such as utilization review and network contracting, are used by insurers to control costs. The market has shifted towards less restrictive preferred provider organization (PPO)/point of service (POS) plans, leading to increased utilization of health services and prescription drugs. Health insurance companies utilize utilization management techniques to control costs. Studies show that increases in health benefits expenditures are mainly due to increases in unit prices, not utilization per insured member. Premiums are expected to cover operational costs of insurance companies, which are complex organizations requiring specialized resources. Table 2 provides a summary of administrative functions in health insurance plans. Health insurance companies report administrative costs on a per member per month basis in regulatory filings. Average costs per company increased about $3 PMPM from 2007 to 2009. Specialty firms have lower administrative costs, while companies focusing on non-group insurance have higher costs. Administrative expenses vary by market segment, with non-group insurance being the highest and large group the lowest due to factors like enrollment size. Non-group insurance must be sold individually, increasing marketing costs. Companies price each product separately, similar to car models. Premium rates are calculated at the health insurance product level. Data may show variation within companies if product level data were available. Many health insurance companies have multiple non-insurance businesses. The complexity of large health insurance conglomerates with multiple non-insurance businesses poses challenges for accurate cost accounting and regulation of administrative costs. There is no consensus benchmark for appropriate administrative costs, creating barriers to fair regulation across different types of health insurance companies. Industry executives of for-profit firms believe administrative costs can be managed effectively. Executives of for-profit health insurance firms believe that administrative costs can be reduced, as shown in recent earnings conference calls. The average profit margin for the industry is low, with profit being a small part of premiums. In 2010, the average profit margin was 3.5%. Even if a company like WellPoint rebated its entire net income to members, it would only result in a small monthly credit per member. Profit variations exist due to company size differences. There is substantial variation in health insurance company profits due to differences in company size, cost management strategies, and business goals. Wellpoint, a large for-profit company with 33.3 million members, focuses on reducing costs and value for investors, earning $2.89 billion in net income in 2010. In contrast, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island, a mid-sized non-profit company with approximately 600,000 members, incurred a $14.1 million loss in 2010. The health insurance underwriting cycle refers to the cyclical nature of premiums and insurer profitability. The health insurance underwriting cycle involves adjustments to premiums based on past experience, future losses, business strategy, and regulatory changes. Insurers may charge higher premiums to recover previous losses, leading to increased profitability until they become uncompetitive and have to lower premiums. Alternatively, insurers may aim to gain market share by offering competitive pricing. The insurer's business strategy involves reducing premiums to gain market share, even at the cost of temporary losses. Once the desired market share is achieved, premiums are increased to maximize profit margins. Insurers may also subsidize one policy with profits from another. An example from Anthem Blue Cross Life and Health Insurance Company's premium rates in California from 2007 to 2009 illustrates this strategy. Anthem's maternity coverage policies showed an operational gain in 2007 but operated at a loss in 2008 and 2009 despite increased policyholders. The insurer projected a $14.2 million loss for 2010 based on this trend. Anthem projected a $14.2 million loss for 2010 on maternity coverage policies. Options for Anthem include increasing premiums, eliminating maternity coverage, seeking non-premium revenue sources, implementing cost-saving methods, or offsetting losses with gains from other products. This data suggests that losses from maternity coverage are balanced out by gains from other policies. Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, states and the federal government share regulatory authority over private health insurance. States oversee various aspects of the industry, including rate and form filing requirements. The federal government provides grant funding to states for health insurance rate reviews and requires insurers to justify rate increases under certain circumstances. States regulate private health insurance, including rate and form filing requirements. \"Form\" refers to the language in insurance contracts for new or modified plans, while \"rate\" pertains to the price of insurance units. Rates must be filed with the initial form and whenever changes are proposed. Rate reviews aim to ensure rates are adequate, actuarially justified, and non-discriminatory. State regulation of health insurance rates varies, with some states collecting rates for informational purposes and over half requiring \"prior approval\" for rate changes. States regulate private health insurance, including rate and form filing requirements. Over half of states have \"prior approval\" requirements for rate changes, where the state can approve, disapprove, or modify the request. Prior approval may include a deeming period, where if no action is taken, the filing becomes effective. Some states have \"file and use\" requirements, where rates become effective immediately or on a specified date. The state can disapprove a rate filing if it doesn't meet compliance standards. Some states have \"file and use\" requirements, while one state has \"use and file\" where the filing becomes effective when used. Only 13 states have public Internet access to rate filings or summary statistics on rates, with varying levels of transparency in how states make their information public. For example, Oregon approved 68.3% of recent requested rate increases, while Maine only posts rate filings for insurers called to public hearings. States vary in their approval of rate increases, with Oregon approving 68.3% and Massachusetts only 14.2%. Factors influencing these differences include regulatory standards, market variations, and cost trends. States base their decisions on prior year trends, with approved rates sometimes seeing double-digit percentage increases. For example, Regence Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oregon requested a 26.4% increase but was approved for 17.3%. Oregon approved a lower rate increase of 12.6% for Regence Blue Cross Blue Shield due to their financial loss of 9.7% on policies from May 2008 to April 2009. Health Net Health Plan of Oregon received a significant rate increase of 22.8% in 2009 because they had lost money on policies from 2005 to 2008. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act aims to increase transparency in rate increases but does not include a formal approval process. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act aims to increase transparency in rate increases by establishing a process for the annual review of \"unreasonable\" rate hikes for health insurance coverage. The term \"unreasonable\" is not clearly defined, leading to challenges in preventing unintended consequences. The review process involves analyzing multiple factors by actuaries and accountants, rather than relying on simplistic benchmarks like prohibiting double-digit percentage increases. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act establishes a process for the annual review of \"unreasonable\" rate hikes for health insurance coverage. The review process involves identifying potentially unreasonable increases and determining mitigating factors. Health insurance issuers must justify any unreasonable premium increase before implementation. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires health insurance issuers to justify any unreasonable premium increase before implementation. The HHS Secretary will publicly disclose information on rate increases deemed unreasonable, with a proposed regulation for more review if the increase is 10% or more. Adopting a state's determination of unreasonable rate increases is also proposed if the state has an effective rate review program. The proposed regulation specifies that a state's rate review program would be considered effective if it has the legal authority to obtain necessary data and documentation. The state must be able to review data and documentation for proposed rate increases, including actuarial assumptions, historical data validity, and insurer accuracy. If a state lacks an effective program, HHS would conduct the review and deem a rate increase unreasonable if it is excessive or unreasonably high in relation to benefits provided. The rate increase would be considered unjustified if it results in a projected future loss ratio below the required standard. Health insurance issuers must provide data and documentation to support the proposed increase, and it would be deemed unreasonable if incomplete or inadequate. Unfairly discriminatory rate increases would result in premium differences within similar risk categories that do not correspond to expected costs. The ACA requires the HHS Secretary to provide grants to states for premium rate review. States were awarded $43 million in the first cycle of funding and $200 million in the second cycle. $109 million was awarded to 28 states and the District of Columbia in September 2011. The final rule clarifies which proposed rate increases would be subject to review. The final rule establishes a process for rate review to be conducted by the state or CMS, specifies notice requirements for informing the public about the outcome of rate reviews, and includes a comment period on whether health coverage sold through associations should be subject to ACA's rate review requirements. States have ongoing authority to impose filing requirements and review rates. Proposed rate increases of 10% or more after September 1, 2011, will be considered for review under ACA. The final rule establishes a process for rate review under ACA, with proposed rate increases of 10% or more subject to review. The HHS Secretary will consult with states to establish state-specific thresholds. Health insurance issuers must submit a Preliminary Justification for each proposed rate increase. The final rule establishes a process for rate review under ACA, with proposed rate increases of 10% or more subject to review. Health insurance issuers must submit claims experience, utilization and cost trend projections, changes in benefits, claims and non-claims costs, current and projected premiums, and a three-year history of rate increases for the insurance product. A justification for the rate increase, including data and assumptions used, primary factors driving the increase, and overall experience of the insurance product, must also be provided. Parts I and II must be submitted to CMS and the applicable state, while Part III must be submitted to CMS. Additional information may be requested if the submission is insufficient. The submission process for rate reviews under the ACA involves posting Parts I and II on the CMS website with a disclaimer. Reviews of proposed rate increases are conducted by either a state or CMS. If a state has an Effective Rate Review Program, it will conduct the review and CMS will accept the state's determination. If the rate increase is deemed unreasonable, CMS will provide the state's decision to the issuer. If the state does not have an Effective Rate Review Program, CMS will conduct the review. CMS will conduct a review if the state lacks an Effective Rate Review Program. Three tests are applied to determine if a proposed rate increase is unreasonable: excessive, unjustified, and unfairly discriminatory. Final determinations are posted on the CMS website with explanations provided to the issuer. The state will conduct rate reviews based on specific criteria, including data collection from issuers, timely reviews, consideration of various factors impacting rates, and adherence to statutory or regulatory standards. States with an Effective Rate Review Program must publish certain information on their website. The Rate Review Program requires publishing Parts I and II of the Preliminary Justification for proposed rate increases on its website. States must establish a mechanism for public comments on the proposed increases. As of July 1, 2011, 40 States, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have effective rate review programs. Health insurance issuers can choose to decline or implement a smaller rate increase if deemed unreasonable. If the smaller increase still exceeds the threshold, a new Preliminary Justification must be submitted. The issuer must submit a new Preliminary Justification for a smaller proposed rate increase if the initial increase is deemed unreasonable. The Final Justification must be consistent with the Preliminary Justification and include analysis conducted by CMS on the potential impact of the rule on health insurance issuers and enrollees. CMS collected and analyzed data on insurance carriers offering products in individual and small group markets. 417 issuers could be impacted by rate review requirements, with 311 in the individual market and 342 in the small group market. Nearly 35 million enrollees could be affected by rate review, with 11 million in the individual market and 24 million in the small group market. CMS estimated the number of rate filings subject to review and developed low, middle, and high-range estimates. CMS estimated the number of rate filings subject to review and justification in the individual and small group markets for 2011. For the individual market, estimates ranged from 279 to 819 filings, representing 40%-67% of all filings. In the small group market, estimates ranged from 189 to 940 filings, representing 20%-32% of all filings. Additionally, CMS estimated potential administrative costs to issuers related to rate review under ACA. The estimated administrative costs for developing and providing justification reports, retention of records, and online notification requirements for health insurance issuers affected by rate review requirements are detailed in Table 7. Health insurance premiums only cover a portion of costs incurred for health services and prescription drugs, with enrollees responsible for cost sharing through deductibles, co-payments, and co-insurance when services are used. Increased cost sharing is seen as a way to shift costs to service users, limiting shared risk and controlling premium growth. Increasing cost-sharing reduces coverage value as premiums rise, leading to individuals paying more for less. Deductibles have a significant impact, with average deductibles on the rise in both group and non-group markets. Other benefit designs like drug co-payments and hospital co-insurance data are not publicly available. The Milliman Medical Index estimates that out-of-pocket cost sharing for a typical family of four with private employer group coverage has increased between 5.4% and 10.5% annually from 2006 to 2010."
