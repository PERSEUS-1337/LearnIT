    "content": "Daylight Saving Time (DST) was first proposed by Benjamin Franklin in 1784 to save energy on candles. William Willett later advocated for DST in 1907 to align work and recreation with daylight hours. Germany implemented DST during World War I to conserve fuel. Germany implemented DST during World War I on May 1, 1916. The rest of Europe followed suit. The United States formally adopted DST in 1918 with the \"An Act to preserve daylight and provide standard time for the United States.\" Despite being unpopular, DST was reinstated during World War II as \"War Time\" by President Franklin Roosevelt in 1942. The lack of nationwide consistency led to the Uniform Time Act of 1966, establishing federal regulation for DST. The Uniform Time Act of 1966 mandated standard time within time zones and introduced daylight saving time (DST) changes. States could exempt themselves from DST, with Arizona being the first to do so in 1968. The act was amended in 1972 to allow states split between time zones to exempt themselves. Currently, Arizona, Hawaii, and American Samoa do not observe DST. During the 1973 oil embargo, Congress enacted a trial period of year-round DST from January 6, 1974, to April 27, 1975. The trial was hotly debated, with benefits including increased daylight hours in the winter evening, while opposition was concerned about children leaving for school in the dark. The trial ended in 1975, and the country returned to observing summer DST. The trial of year-round DST from January 6, 1974, to April 27, 1975, ended in 1975. The Department of Transportation (DOT) reported modest benefits in energy conservation, traffic safety, and reduced crime, but these were minimal and hard to distinguish from seasonal variations. The National Bureau of Standards (NBS) found no significant energy savings or differences in traffic fatalities in their report to Congress in April 1976. In 1974, a trial of year-round DST was conducted from January to April, with inconclusive results on energy savings and traffic fatalities. Congress later amended the Uniform Time Act in 1986 and 2005 to adjust the start and end dates of DST. The impact of extended DST on energy consumption was to be reported to Congress by the Department of Energy. The Department of Energy reported to Congress on the impact of extended DST on energy consumption in the United States in October 2008. Congress had the authority to revert DST to the 2005 time schedule. Some areas like Arizona, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico do not observe DST. Approximately 70 countries, including most in North America and Europe, observe DST. The Department of Transportation oversees DST regulations. Under the Uniform Time Act, DST regulation is overseen by the Department of Transportation. States can opt out of DST through legal action, either by legislation or executive order. Compliance with federal legislation is required for observing DST dates. Changing a state's time zone requires DOT regulation, with requests made by the governor, state legislature, or county officials. As of September 2015, 12 states were considering opting out of the Uniform Time Act. County-elected officials may request a change in the time zone based on the area's convenience of commerce. The Department of Transportation (DOT) reviews the request to ensure it meets statutory criteria before initiating a public comment period and scheduling a hearing in the affected area. Final action is taken after reviewing comments, and if the Secretary agrees that requirements have been met. The Department of Transportation reviews requests for time zone changes to ensure they meet statutory criteria before scheduling a hearing. Final action is taken if the Secretary agrees with the requirements being met. Studies have been conducted on the impact of Daylight Saving Time (DST) on energy savings, health, and safety, with the first national study since the 1970s conducted by the DOE in 2006 and 2008. Extended Daylight Saving Time (EDST) resulted in total electricity savings of about 1.3 TeraWatt-hour (TWh), equivalent to 0.5 percent per day or 0.03 percent over the year. Total potential energy benefits are estimated to be small, ranging from 7 to 26 Trillion Btu (TBtu), or 0.01 to 0.03 percent of total annual U.S. energy consumption. The introduction and extension of daylight saving time (DST) was primarily driven by projected energy savings, especially for electric lighting. Studies show a potential reduction in national electricity use of around 0.5% due to DST, mainly from residential lighting. While some research supports this finding, others suggest no effect or even energy penalties, especially when considering gasoline consumption. Despite contributing to an evening decrease in peak electricity demand, DST may lead to an increase in the morning. However, changes in energy use patterns and building efficiency since these studies were conducted may impact these findings. Future energy policy decisions regarding changes to Daylight Saving Time should be based on high-quality research analyzing prevailing energy use, behaviors, and systems. Recent studies have shown that DST may not save energy as intended, with an increase in electricity demand and no significant impact on vehicle crashes. This is especially relevant as North America extended DST in 2007. The impact of Daylight Saving Time transitions on road traffic accidents is not statistically significant. Studies show that the transitions do not increase the number of accidents. Additionally, the start of DST in spring may lead to sleep loss and fragmentation, while the autumn transition may not result in extra sleep. The cumulative effect of five consecutive days of earlier rise times following the autumn change suggests a net loss of sleep across the week. Indirect evidence of an increase in traffic accident rates and changes in health behaviors related to sleep disruption indicate that adjustment to daylight saving time has consequences. Limited evidence suggests that DST shifts have a substantial influence on the risk of acute myocardial infarction. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the Uniform Time Act, changing the beginning and ending dates of Daylight Saving Time. Only one bill related to DST has been enacted since 1966, with several others introduced but not passed. Examples include bills to modify State exemptions, study the effects of year-round DST on fossil fuel usage, and establish a standard time zone for Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. The Uniform Time Act of 1966 was amended by the Daylight Savings Time Amendments Act of 1991 to extend daylight savings time. Another bill aims to establish year-round daylight savings time. The Department of Transportation and Naval Observatory oversee DST regulations. NASA also provides relevant information."
