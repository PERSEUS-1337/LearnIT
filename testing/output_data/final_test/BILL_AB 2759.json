    "title": "AB 2759",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 2281 of the Corporations Code is amended to define key terms related to fraudulent acts, including \"agent,\" \"application,\" \"claimant,\" and \"complaint.\" The amended Section 2281 of the Corporations Code defines key terms related to fraudulent acts, including \"corporation,\" \"court of competent jurisdiction,\" and \"final judgment.\" A final judgment refers to a judgment, arbitration award, or criminal restitution order that is enforceable and has not been nullified or fully reimbursed. The curr_chunk discusses the requirement for providing documentation of an arbitration decision in cases of fraud, misrepresentation, or deceit against a corporation. The arbitration award must include findings of fact and conclusions of law, and be in accordance with specific legal procedures. The curr_chunk introduces the Victims of Corporate Fraud Compensation Fund and defines terms like \"fund\" and \"judgment debtor\" in relation to criminal restitution orders for intentional fraud. Section 2282 of the Corporations Code is amended to allow aggrieved persons to file for payment from the Victims of Corporate Fraud Compensation Fund after obtaining a final judgment against a corporation or agent for fraud, misrepresentation, or deceit. The application for payment from the Victims of Corporate Fraud Compensation Fund must be submitted to the Secretary of State within 18 months of the final judgment. It should include the claimant's name, address, attorney information if applicable, corporation details, final judgment identification, unreimbursed claim amount, and computation explanation. The claimant must provide a final judgment and civil complaint for fraud, misrepresentation, or deceit, along with any additional documentation they believe will help the Secretary of State evaluate the application. If the final judgment is a criminal restitution order, the claimant must also provide the charging document and restitution order. The claimant must describe searches for the judgment debtor's assets and make representations regarding their relationship to the corporation. The claimant must show compliance with requirements and that the judgment was for fraud or deceit by the corporation, with unpaid amounts. The claimant must demonstrate that the judgment is unpaid, not discharged in bankruptcy, and not collected from any other restitution fund. If there is a pending claim or collection from another fund, details must be provided. The Secretary of State may request additional documents and information from the claimant to determine the validity of the claim if the final judgment was by default, stipulated, a consent judgment, or defended by a trustee in bankruptcy. If the final judgment does not specify the amount of damages awarded for actual loss and compensatory damages payable from the fund, the Secretary of State may request documentation from the claimant. \"Sufficient proof of money damages\" may include bank statements, checks, credit card statements, or similar documentation showing financial loss from fraudulent acts by the corporation or its agent. The Secretary of State may request additional information from the claimant to determine available assets to satisfy the final judgment. The application form includes a notice of the claimant's obligation to protect the judgment from discharge in bankruptcy. The Secretary of State may request additional information from the claimant to determine available assets to satisfy the final judgment and provide notice on how to contest payment from the fund. The notice to the corporation must be sent by certified mail to the last designated agent for service of process with the Secretary of State, and it is considered complete five days after mailing. If the corporation or its agent wants to challenge payment of an application, they must send a written response to the Secretary of State within 30 days of the notice, and also to the claimant. Failure to respond waives the right to object to payment and receive further notice from the Secretary of State. Section 2286 of the Corporations Code is amended. SEC. 4. Section 2286 of the Corporations Code is amended to require the Secretary of State to notify the corporation and agents named in the application of a decision to award funds to the claimant. SEC. 5. Section 2288 is amended to specify that payment out of the fund can only be ordered if the aggrieved party has a valid cause of action under Section 2282 and has complied with Section 2287. The Secretary of State may defend actions on behalf of the fund, with the right to examine witnesses and relitigate relevant issues. A claimant's judgment creates a presumption of fraud by the corporation, affecting the burden of proof. If the judgment was by default or defended by a trustee in bankruptcy, the burden shifts to the petitioner to prove fraud. If a criminal restitution order is issued against an agent, the petitioner must prove the defendant qualifies as an agent. An active corporation may appear in court to dispute the defendant's status as its agent. The Secretary of State can request the court to dismiss a petition if it lacks merit and there are no triable issues. The motion must be supported by an affidavit and a notice must be given to the claimant at least 10 days before the hearing. Section 2289 of the Corporations Code is amended. Section 2289 of the Corporations Code is amended to limit the liability of the fund to $50,000 for any one claimant per single judgment finding fraud, misrepresentation, or deceit. When multiple corporations or their agents are involved in corporate fraud, misrepresentation, or deceit resulting in a judgment meeting the requirements of Section 2282, each claimant may seek recovery from the fund individually, subject to limitations. Claimants who are spouses, registered domestic partners, or entities other than natural persons with eligible final judgments are considered as one claimant. Section 2290 of the Corporations Code is amended to ensure that unpaid awards or settlements will be satisfied from the fund when sufficient money is available. Section 2293.1 is also amended to address related matters. Section 2293.1 of the Corporations Code is amended to require corporations or their agents to repay the fund if the Secretary of State pays a settlement or judgment on their behalf. Failure to repay within 30 days will result in suspension. Bankruptcy does not exempt them from penalties. Section 2294 is also amended. The Secretary of State will not award funds to claimants if they have already received payments from other restitution funds or collected portions of the judgment from the corporation or other defendants. No reimbursement is required for local agencies or school districts under this act as it pertains to creating new crimes or changing penalties."
