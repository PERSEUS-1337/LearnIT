    "content": "The \"Lebanese Adjustment Act\" allows for the adjustment of status for certain nationals of Lebanon. The \"Lebanese Adjustment Act\" allows for the adjustment of status to permanent residence for eligible aliens within 18 months of enactment, subject to certain conditions. Aliens present in the United States who have been ordered excluded, deported, or removed may apply for adjustment of status without needing to file a separate motion. If the application is granted, the order will be canceled; if denied, the order remains in effect. Aliens granted temporary protected status in the United States under specific conditions are eligible for benefits. They must have voluntarily departed the US before December 9, 1993, and have a continuous physical presence in the country. Aliens granted temporary protected status in the United States must have a continuous physical presence in the country, beginning not later than March 28, 1993. Absences totaling no more than 180 days are allowed. Proof of commencement of continuous presence before March 28, 1993, is required. Aliens granted temporary protected status in the United States must demonstrate physical presence by performing service or engaging in a trade within the country, applying for benefits under the Immigration and Nationality Act before March 28, 1993, or providing other evidence as required by the Attorney General. Regulations allow for work authorization for aliens with final deportation orders. The regulation allows aliens subject to deportation or removal orders to seek a stay based on filing an application. The Attorney General cannot order removal if the alien has applied for adjustment of status, except if the application is denied. The alien may be authorized to work during the application process. During the application process, the Attorney General may authorize employment for aliens, and if the application is pending for over 180 days without denial, employment authorization is required. Spouses, children, and unmarried sons or daughters of aliens whose status is adjusted to permanent residence may also have their status adjusted. An unmarried son or daughter applying for adjustment of status must prove continuous physical presence in the US since March 28, 1993, apply within 18 months of the enactment of the Act, be physically present in the US when filing the application, and meet admissibility requirements. An unmarried son or daughter applying for adjustment of status must prove continuous physical presence in the US since March 28, 1993, and not be penalized for absences totaling less than 180 days. The Attorney General will offer administrative review for adjustment of status applicants. The Attorney General shall provide adjustment of status applicants with the same administrative review rights as applicants under the Immigration and Nationality Act. A determination by the Attorney General on status adjustment is final and not subject to judicial review. The Immigration and Nationality Act definitions apply, and this section does not affect the Attorney General's authority. The Attorney General's powers in immigration enforcement may not be restricted by eligibility for permanent residence status under this section. Aliens can still seek status under other applicable laws."
