    "content": "The Act titled \"International Pediatric HIV/AIDS Network Act of 2004\" is abbreviated as such. It includes findings related to pediatric HIV/AIDS. Congress finds that HIV/AIDS is a leading cause of death globally, with over 3 million deaths in 2003. Approximately 40 million people are infected with HIV, and 28 million have died from AIDS since the epidemic began. Half of new HIV infections are among young people aged 15 to 24, and over 2,000 children are infected daily. In 2003, 700,000 children were newly infected with HIV. In 2003, approximately 500,000 children died from AIDS, with a total of over 5,600,000 children dying from AIDS since the epidemic began. More than 14,000,000 children have been orphaned due to HIV/AIDS, with 95 percent living in sub-Saharan Africa. The number of children under 15 living with HIV/AIDS in specific countries are: 270,000 in Nigeria, 250,000 in South Africa, 230,000 in Ethiopia, 220,000 in Kenya, 170,000 in Tanzania, 150,000 in Zambia, 110,000 in Uganda, 84,000 in Cote d'Ivoire, 80,000 in Mozambique, 65,000 in Rwanda, and 30,000 in. Approximately 50 percent of individuals infected with HIV acquire the virus before age 25 and die from AIDS-related illnesses before age 35. 95 percent of HIV/AIDS-associated deaths occur in developing countries, with projections indicating a potential doubling of HIV infections in Africa by 2005. The HIV/AIDS epidemic may double to 60,000,000 individuals, with Asia, especially India and China, expected to see a major increase. There is a lack of healthcare professionals with expertise in treating children infected with HIV, leading to limited access to treatment for children in developing countries. Limited access to scientific literature and lack of collaboration among healthcare professionals in developing countries hinder research and training for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. Infrastructure for clinical research is lacking, especially for pediatric cases. Establishing a network of pediatric centers and training healthcare professionals could significantly improve HIV/AIDS care in these countries. Establishing a network of pediatric centers in developing countries will provide treatment and care for approximately 40,000 children with HIV/AIDS. These centers, developed collaboratively by United States and local professionals, will enhance global infrastructure for HIV/AIDS care and clinical research. The centers will be modeled after existing international pediatric HIV/AIDS care centers in Romania and Botswana. The pediatric HIV/AIDS care centers in Constanta, Romania and Gaborone, Botswana will contribute to treatment, routine care, psychosocial support, and child life services. SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE FOREIGN ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1961. Amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 includes the establishment of a network of pediatric HIV/AIDS centers in countries with high rates of HIV/AIDS to provide treatment, care for children, and training for pediatric health care professionals. Funding for this initiative is also addressed in the amendment. The amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 establishes a network of pediatric HIV/AIDS centers in high-risk countries, with funding of at least $10,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2005 to 2009 allocated to subsection (d)(8)."
