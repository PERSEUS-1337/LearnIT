    "content": "The pending debate over reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the 110th Congress includes issues such as FAA budgeting, airport development, system-wide demand, modernization of airspace infrastructure, aviation safety, energy, environment, and international civil aviation. The authorization of the aviation tax structure funding the aviation trust fund will expire at the end of FY2007. Deliberations over FAA funding are crucial due to declining uncommitted balances in the aviation trust fund and the need for additional funding for the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS) by 2025. Initial estimates suggest NGATS may require an average of $200. Early estimates suggest that NGATS development will require $200 million to $1 billion annually in facilities and equipment costs. Congress may explore financing options to ensure the aviation trust fund can cover operational costs and infrastructure improvements for NGATS. The debate includes cost allocation between aviation system users, burden sharing with the aviation trust fund, and contributions from Treasury general funds. Airlines have long contested the tax burden on industry participants since the creation of the aviation trust fund. The airlines have been arguing for over 36 years that they are paying a disproportionately larger share of the system costs compared to general aviation users. They claim that general aviation users, especially business jet operators, are not paying their fair share to maintain and improve the national airspace system. On the other hand, general aviation users argue that the system has mainly been developed to support the airline industry and that existing fuel taxes are sufficient to compensate for their impact on the system. One alternative to the existing tax structure supported by the airlines is a fee-for-service system that would be more of a direct user fee system. The FAA has been considering a direct user fee structure to replace existing aviation taxes and fees, with an administration proposal currently under review. Speculation suggests the proposal may align more closely with international standards for user fees based on specific impacts on air traffic facilities and services. Congress may consider various aviation trust fund revenue alternatives during the reauthorization debate. Congress may consider various aviation trust fund revenue alternatives during the reauthorization debate, including keeping existing passenger ticket and fuel taxes, moving to a fuel tax-based system, adopting a user fee-based system, or a hybrid scheme. One proposed hybrid approach involves charging user fees for airlines and larger general aviation aircraft, while small general aviation users would continue to contribute through fuel taxes. The Airport Improvement Program (AIP) provides federal grants for airport development, funded by the airport and airways trust fund, tax-exempt bonds, and passenger facility charges (PFCs). The Airport Improvement Program (AIP) is funded through tax-exempt bonds, passenger facility charges (PFCs), state and local grants, and airport revenue. The reauthorization debate will determine if AIP funding levels will increase, remain steady, or decrease. The outcome will be influenced by decisions on aviation trust fund taxes, FAA budget allocation, and airport eligibility criteria. The reauthorization debate will cover various aspects of airport funding, including apportionments among different airport sizes, discretionary funding levels, grant assurances, noise-related projects, federal share of funding, airport privatization pilot program, defederalization allowing PFCs as primary funding, limitations on AIP funds for security projects, accommodating new aircraft classes, and earmarks in legislation. Congress may also consider raising the cap on AIP funding. Congress may consider options to raise the cap on PFC levels and make airport bonds more attractive to investors. Cost control measures for operating and maintaining the national airspace system are a key concern during the FAA reauthorization debate. This is crucial as Congress balances escalating operational costs with the need to support infrastructure development in the short and long term. Outsourcing is considered for cost control in FAA operations, including the contract tower program and automated flight service stations. Further outsourcing options like expanding the contract tower program and privatizing aeronautical charting functions may be explored. Critics argue that these options may not result in significant cost savings and could face opposition from labor organizations. The current administration has no plans to privatize en route and terminal air traffic control facilities, but may expand the contract tower program. Consolidation of facilities and functions is seen as a way to control operational costs at the FAA, with plans to consolidate weather services at en route centers. Opposition from labor organizations remains a point of contention regarding outsourcing measures. Under the privatized AFSS program, there is ongoing consolidation of flight service facilities. Some suggest using a process similar to the military's BRAC to address future consolidation plans for facilities and functions. Congress may discuss this during the FAA reauthorization. Long-term plans under NGATS could involve consolidating air traffic services and facilities. Automation and increased autonomy for flights in the NAS may reduce the ratio of air traffic controllers to aircraft. This may be offset by the growth in air traffic operations. The FAA is considering consolidation of air traffic control facilities in the United States due to changing responsibilities and functions of controllers. This could help address staffing issues and match controller skills with airspace complexity, while reducing costs. The FAA is facing challenges with controlling operational costs, particularly with air traffic controller pay, which accounts for a significant portion of total operating costs. Despite attempts to negotiate concessions from controllers in 2005 and 2006, an agreement could not be reached, leading to Congress not taking action on the impasse. This allowed the FAA to implement its final contract proposal in September 2006. The FAA's law allowing negotiation of compensation and benefits aims to attract and retain skilled employees but has led to higher costs and strained relations. Congress may need to consider ways to control costs and improve management-labor relations. One proposed option is adding binding arbitration after an impasse. The FAA may introduce binding arbitration after contract negotiation impasses, potentially during FAA reauthorization debates. Other options to streamline labor negotiations and address controller staffing issues may also be considered. Congress could authorize funding for new controller hires and allow direct entry from accredited air traffic programs. The current FAA reauthorization cycle includes authorization for new hires from accredited air traffic programs to enter on-the-job training, funding for advanced simulation technologies in controller training, and consolidation of air traffic facilities for staffing flexibility. This is crucial for addressing capacity needs at high-volume airports and congested routes. Technology may be needed to reduce aircraft spacing standards for future air traffic growth. Some experts caution that busy airports may still exceed capacity even with proposed options and expansions. Congress and the FAA face challenges accommodating new airspace users, including large jets like the Airbus A-380 and very light jets (VLJs). VLJs are expected to grow rapidly from 2007 onwards. VLJs, introduced in 2007, are projected to grow rapidly over the next decade. They aim to improve air transportation access for small communities, sparking debates on enhancing air transportation policies. VLJs and UAVs pose challenges for airspace management and safety, especially in congested areas. The FAA and Congress may need to address capacity limitations and accommodate new airspace users. The FAA and Congress may face tough decisions on maintaining access and addressing demand at capacity-constrained airports. Options like negotiated scheduling, peak-period pricing, slots, and quota systems are being considered. Capacity constraints at LaGuardia Airport are a key issue, especially as the slot system expired in 2007. Challenges at major airports contrast with the loss of commercial air service in rural areas. The Essential Air Service (EAS) air carrier subsidy program is becoming more attractive to rural communities due to the loss of commercial air service. However, despite increased funding, it is challenging for the EAS program to generate additional air service. Issues facing the EAS program, such as prioritizing access and efficient fund usage, are likely to be addressed in upcoming reauthorization legislation. Without a significant funding increase, limitations on EAS program funding may need to be considered. Additionally, the Small Community Air Service Development (SCASD) Program aims to improve air carrier service for communities with insufficient access to national air services. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program aims to provide air carrier service to communities with insufficient access to the national air transportation system. Efforts to modernize air traffic facilities are focused on developing the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS) to triple system capacity by 2025. The Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO) is leading the integration of NGATS development under Vision 100. The FAA reauthorization process will focus on funding and management challenges for building the NGATS, with estimated costs between $69 billion and $76 billion by 2025. Managing the NGATS development effort is a significant issue, as the JPDO can set objectives but funding for implementation is a hurdle. The funding for the NGATS framework will come from the budgets of agencies like the FAA and NASA. Congress may consider aligning budget elements for the NGATS. Balancing ancillary functions like security and environmental impacts with the main goal of improving air traffic efficiency is crucial. Some believe the JPDO should focus more on implementation rather than policy and collaboration paradigms. The NGATS project lacks a cohesive blueprint with detailed engineering specifications and timelines. One proposed solution is to use a lead systems integration contract. Experts agree on the core technologies needed for NGATS, including precision navigation capabilities and advanced aircraft positioning. The investment strategy for NGATS technologies in the next three to five years will impact the end-state and path to reaching it. Phasing out existing air traffic communication, navigation, and surveillance systems must be carefully addressed. The phasing out of existing air traffic communication, navigation, and surveillance systems must be carefully addressed to balance cost and safety concerns. Congress is interested in how new technologies will ensure equivalent safety to the current radar-based system and how the phase-out plans will impact airspace system users, especially smaller operators. The transition to NGATS compliant avionics and aircraft systems aims to increase system capacity by reducing aircraft spacing through advances in precision navigation and information sharing. However, wake turbulence from large transport aircraft currently limits spacing, even in ideal weather conditions. Some argue for decreased separation standards with accurate wake vortex prediction capabilities to boost airport capacity, while others cite technology limitations and wake vortex complexities as challenges in predicting and utilizing wake turbulence forecasts. The development of wake vortex advisory systems is authorized to address the challenges of wake turbulence propagation, which hinders the prediction and reduction of arrival and departure spacing at airports. Emerging technology for wake turbulence detection shows potential to increase landing capacity by up to 20%, but is still in early stages of research. Congressional oversight of FAA safety initiatives has been overshadowed by aviation security concerns post-9/11, despite room for improvement in safety aspects within the industry. The safety of the airport environment, particularly runway safety, is a growing concern. The FAA's approach to mitigating runway incursions has been criticized, with a focus on improving pilot awareness. Oversight of air carrier operations and maintenance by the FAA is also a long-standing safety concern. The FAA's oversight of air carrier operations and maintenance, including the trend of outsourcing maintenance to third-party facilities, raises concerns about compliance with standards. Congress may need to enhance regulatory requirements and FAA oversight, particularly for repair facilities servicing commuter aircraft and small shops not certified by the FAA. Another safety concern is the airworthiness of aging aircraft, highlighted by a commuter seaplane crash in 2005. The crash of a commuter seaplane in 2005 has raised concerns about the FAA's oversight of small commuter aircraft and aging general aviation fleet. Critics are frustrated with the slow progress in implementing measures to prevent fuel tank explosions on large transport-category aircraft, despite advancements in fuel inerting systems. Congress may discuss ways to accelerate safety initiatives. During FAA reauthorization processes, Congress may debate safety initiatives to reduce fuel tank flammability and address financial impacts on air carriers. Concerns about passenger safety, comfort, and public health in aircraft cabins, including the spread of infectious diseases like avian flu, may generate considerable debate. The potential threat was highlighted by the SARS virus, prompting discussions on research for prevention methods in the aircraft cabin. The FAA recently debated whether infants and toddlers should be restrained in child seats on airline flights to prevent the spread of infectious diseases in the cabin. The NTSB advocates for child restraints for all occupants, but the FAA fears families may choose riskier travel options if forced to purchase an additional ticket for their young children. The use of cell phones and portable electronic devices on aircraft is a growing concern due to safety implications and potential interference with aircraft instrumentation. Technological advances are outpacing the FAA's ability to study the issue, leading to a debate on whether more research is needed to determine the safe use of these devices in-flight. Issues related to energy, environment, and fuel may play a significant role in the current debate on the reauthorization of aircraft technology. Growing concerns over global warming and environmental impacts could lead to discussions on alternative fuels, reducing aircraft emissions, and promoting more efficient and quieter aircraft. Congress may consider options for studying alternative aircraft fuels, monitoring international approaches to mitigating emissions and noise, sponsoring research on emissions reduction and quiet aircraft technologies, and providing incentives for these advancements. The FAA may address aircraft emissions reduction and quiet technology, while international aviation issues under the DOT's jurisdiction, such as the \"Open Skies\" agreement with the EU and foreign ownership rules for domestic carriers, could impact FAA reauthorization legislation. The DOT has not issued a final rule for international aviation reform due to congressional opposition, including legislation and appropriations riders. Meaningful reform requires Congress to repeal the \"citizenship test\" limiting foreign ownership of U.S. air carriers. Cabotage, the transportation of passengers or cargo by foreign carriers within the U.S., is generally prohibited by law with limited exceptions. The FAA reauthorization process presents Congress with a unique opportunity to address international aviation issues. Funding for the federal aviation system, including aviation taxes and fees, will expire at the end of FY2007. Concerns have been raised about the adequacy of the current funding system. The FAA primarily relies on the airport and airway trust fund for funding. The FAA receives funding from the airport and airway trust fund and annual appropriations from Treasury general funds. The trust fund covers the FAA's airport improvement, facilities and equipment, and research programs. Funding for these programs has not always matched authorized amounts. The FAA's funding from the airport and airway trust fund and annual appropriations from Treasury general funds has not always matched authorized amounts. There are concerns within the aviation industry and the FAA about the need for greater funding for FAA programs in the future. The upcoming reauthorization debate will focus on whether the trust fund can generate enough revenue for the FAA's growing needs and if the current tax and fee system is the best way to fund trust fund revenues. The debate for FAA funding revolves around whether the current tax and fee system can generate enough revenue for the agency's needs. Trust fund income increased significantly after the Taxpayers Relief Act of 1997, but dropped after September 11th, taking until FY2005 to surpass FY2001 levels. FAA spending has not always matched authorized amounts. The FAA's trust fund income has decreased, leading to a reduction in the uncommitted balance from over $7.3 billion in FY2001 to around $1.2 billion by the end of FY2006. The FAA is seeking ways to increase the trust fund income stream to prevent further erosion of the fund balance. They are considering a reexamination of the tax and fee system to address this issue. The FAA is seeking a reexamination of the tax and fee system to ensure the trust fund receives adequate revenues to finance future aviation system needs. Treasury estimates show modest annual revenue increases to the trust fund, projected to reach $14.7 billion in FY2011. The FAA is concerned that current revenue levels may not be enough to fund future air navigation program upgrades. The Congressional Budget Office predicts a positive outlook for the trust fund's finances, with an estimated uncommitted balance of $4.3 billion in 2011 and $18.6 billion in 2016. The trust fund could potentially support an additional $19 billion in spending over baseline levels, as long as most of it occurs after 2010. The FAA is concerned about future funding for air navigation program upgrades. The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association predicts a sufficient revenue stream from rising airline fares, fuel taxes, and ATC modernization to maintain a trust fund balance of over $4 billion by FY2011. The debate on FAA funding revolves around user fees, defined as charges for transportation services to recover costs. Aviation funding concerns include maintaining a trust fund balance over $4 billion by FY2011. User fees in aviation are not limited to transportation and are mainly focused on recovering costs related to the national air navigation system. These fees can be direct, such as charges for specific activities like radio contacts with ATC or weight-distance charges. Indirect fees, like fuel taxes or aircraft registration fees, are seen as proxies for user fees by economists. Indirect fees in aviation, like the airline passenger tax, are commonly used in the U.S. aviation system. President Nixon signed the Airport and Airway Development and Revenue Acts of 1970, establishing the trust fund financing system still in place today. This fee system includes taxes on airline tickets, freight/cargo waybills, international departures, and a per gallon tax on noncommercial gasoline and jet fuel. The FAA's funding system, established in 1970, includes taxes on airline tickets, freight/cargo waybills, international departures, and a per gallon tax on noncommercial gasoline and jet fuel. Over the years, additional fees like a segment fee, international arrivals tax, and frequent flyer tax have been added. In 2005, the FAA began examining the possibility of replacing indirect taxation with direct charges for air navigation services. The FAA is considering replacing indirect taxes with direct user fees for air navigation services. Aviation interest groups are actively supporting or opposing potential elements of a new funding mechanism. Cost-allocation among system users and non-users is a key issue in the discussion of federal aviation user fees. The FAA is studying a new user fee system for air navigation services. Aviation interest groups are proposing different financing systems, with the Air Transport Association suggesting a \"Smartskies\" fee-for-service model that could shift $2 billion in costs to certain general aviation users. The ATA proposal suggests making the FAA's air traffic organization autonomous, funded by fees from aviation system users. They would have the authority to issue bonds for infrastructure improvements. General aviation groups disagree with the proposal, arguing that certain users do not underpay for ATC services. The General Aviation (GA) perspective is that the current ATC system was designed for commercial airlines and they are not overburdening it. They believe fuel taxes are the most suitable user fee and oppose the ATA's proposal to reorganize the ATO. The debate over aviation user fees has been ongoing for decades, mainly between the government and the aviation industry. The views of airline passengers, who are major contributors to the aviation trust fund, are not well-known. Calls for ATC privatization in the United States and the potential for corporatization within the FAA have sparked debate on the efficiency of the airways system, with other nations already exploring privatization. The lack of non-government funded research on aviation user fees is a notable gap in the discussion. The idea of ATC privatization in the United States was considered in the 1990s during the Clinton Administration but ultimately failed to gain much congressional support. Privatization would likely move the ATC organization outside of government control and require it to operate like a private corporation, setting fees to cover costs and provide capital for investment. Privatization of ATC has been adopted in various countries like Canada, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand to recoup costs and fund investments. There are strong proponents for privatization, but it remains uncertain if the FAA or Congress will seriously consider it. The existing tax structure has a public interest component that funds the FAA's operation from the Treasury general fund. The aviation funding debate revolves around the contribution to the aviation trust fund by military and nonuser beneficiaries. Aviation interest groups argue that the federal general fund contribution to the FAA is inadequate compared to the benefits of the airways system. Conversely, government agencies and congressional committees believe the general fund contribution is too large. The trust fund was originally intended to support FAA capital programs, but there are differing opinions on its purpose. Several studies suggest that the 1970 Act allowed trust fund revenues to be spent on noncapital activities, leading to a debate on maximizing fund use for all aviation purposes or directing it primarily towards capital activities. The general fund contribution to FAA appropriations has varied over the last decade, with a consistent share of around 20% in recent years. This issue is closely tied to spending guarantee provisions. The fund share is closely tied to spending guarantee provisions in FAA reauthorization legislation since 1971. These provisions aim to ensure fully authorized funding for U.S. airports and airways, with a significant general fund share for the FAA budget. Funding guarantee proposals have been part of every FAA reauthorization debate since 1976, consisting of both \"cap\" and \"penalty\" mechanisms. The guarantees from FY1977 to FY1990 included \"cap\" and \"penalty\" provisions to limit aviation trust fund money for FAA operations. Resistance to adhering to penalties grew in the 1980s, leading to the elimination of penalties in 1990. The unintended consequences of these provisions continue to impact funding guarantee mechanisms. The mechanisms to restrict spending from the aviation trust fund did not always lead to full appropriation of authorized funding levels. Congressional support for annual caps and penalties was not consistently enforced, with some members more concerned about the overall budget size or deficit. The unexpended balance of the trust fund offset spending elsewhere in the budget, especially during the 1990s. The C&P mechanisms to restrict spending from the aviation trust fund were not always fully enforced due to broader budget priorities. In FY1999 and FY2000, the general fund share dropped significantly when no spending guarantee was authorized. AIR21 in 2000 introduced new spending guarantees to ensure full funding for FAA's capital programs. The AIR21 guarantees introduced in 2000 aimed to ensure full funding for FAA's capital programs, including Airport Improvement Program (AIP) and Facilities and Equipment (F&E). While initial years saw successful funding, congressional support declined in later years leading to mixed adherence to funding levels. AIP remained close to authorized levels, but F&E saw significant cuts in funding from FY2004 to FY2006. The F&E funding levels fell below authorization in FY2004, FY2005, and FY2006, leading to non-compliance with guarantees. Congress lacked confidence in FAA's ability to oversee NAS modernization, impacting funding adherence. Weaknesses in the guarantee mechanism have also been evident in recent years. In recent years, spending guarantees enforced by point-of-order actions only work if raised by a Member and not waived by rule. Points-of-order have been waived in recent annual appropriations bills in the House, and Senators have not raised points-of-order against violations of funding guarantees. \"Pop-up\" AIP budget authority has been rescinded, allowing appropriators to reduce the total cost of Transportation/Treasury Appropriations bills. Spending guarantees can still be overridden by broader budget policy goals or deficit reduction. Aviation funding guarantees are up for debate in the 110th Congress during the FAA reauthorization. Options include maintaining the current system, modifying guarantees, or implementing budgetary \"fire walls.\" Some argue against guarantees, preferring the normal budget process. The absence of a large trust fund balance may impact support for aviation spending guarantees. The Airport Improvement Program (AIP) is a major source of federal airport grants, along with tax-exempt bonds, passenger facility charges (PFCs), state and local grants, and airport revenue. Different airports use various funding sources based on their financial situation and project type. Small airports rely more on AIP grants, while larger airports often use tax-exempt bonds and PFCs. Each funding source comes with different constraints. The AIP and PFC programs are significant federal financing sources for airports. AIP provides grants for airport development and planning, focusing on construction and improvements related to aircraft operations. However, certain improvements like commercial revenue-producing terminals or off-airport road construction are generally not eligible for AIP funding. Airports smaller than medium hub have broader eligibility for terminal projects under certain conditions. AIP funding cannot be used for operational expenses. PFC funds, a local tax on boarding passengers, can be used for a wider range of projects than AIP grants, including ground side improvements. FAA and ACI/NA have estimated U.S. airports' capital needs for 2005-2009 based on airport master plans and state system plans. The FAA and ACI-NA estimated U.S. airports' capital needs for 2005-2009. The FAA focused on AIP eligible projects, estimating $39.55 billion, while ACI-NA estimated $71.5 billion, indicating a $3-4 billion annual shortfall through FY2009. ACI-NA's study included projects funded by bonds, PFCs, airport revenues, or local funding. The $14.3 billion estimate for airport development projects is based on proposals, leading some to argue it reflects wants rather than needs. The Air Transport Association's estimates in the past were limited to AIP eligible projects at primary airports and tended to be lower than FAA or ACI-NA estimates. FAA's goal is to increase capacity at the top 35 U.S. airports by 30% over a ten-year period. The FAA's Operational Evolution Plan (OEP) aims to enhance the National Airspace System's capacity and efficiency over a decade to meet the growing demand for air travel. The plan focuses on infrastructure improvements and technological advancements at the top 35 airports. A key issue for AIP reauthorization is the funding levels, which have seen a major increase in FY2001 followed by small annual increments. The future of AIP funding will depend on decisions regarding aviation trust fund taxes and general fund allocation. The future of AIP funding depends on decisions regarding the aviation trust fund and general fund allocation. Budget constraints could lead to changes in the AIP program's funding, scope, and distribution. Failure to secure more revenues for the FAA budget may constrain attempts to increase the AIP budget. If AIP is not reauthorized by October 1, 2007, the program will go into abeyance. If AIP is not reauthorized by October 1, 2007, the program will go into abeyance, with existing projects funded but no new projects allowed. AIP grants are distributed through formula grants and discretionary funds, with discretionary funds often earmarked by Congress. AIP discretionary funds, ranging from 25%-30% of total annual funding, are supported by smaller airports and advocates. Air carriers criticize entitlements and set-asides benefiting noncommercial airports. Business aviation advocates argue all airports are critical to the national system, especially reliever airports in managing traffic. Apportioned funds, or entitlements, are a key component of AIP funding. Apportioned funds were increased in AIR-21 and Vision 100, benefiting smaller airports. The ACI-NA supports maintaining AIP funding for smaller airports and increasing flexibility in entitlement use. If budget constraints arise, project eligibility may need to be reconsidered. The broadening of AIP eligibility at small airports has made it difficult to identify the federal interest met by such spending. Air carriers are skeptical of proposals to broaden project eligibility. Discretionary funds are subject to set-asides for various programs, reducing the amount of truly unrestricted funds available. U.S.C. 47115 requires a minimum amount to remain in the discretionary fund after all apportionments and set-asides are satisfied. The minimum discretionary fund provision in AIP funding has not been a factor due to historically high levels of funding. However, if AIP's budget is substantially reduced or entitlements increased, the minimum discretionary fund level may need to be reconsidered. Accepting AIP funds comes with obligations such as maintaining and operating facilities safely, not discriminating against air system users, adhering to wage requirements, and using airport revenue solely for airport spending. The ACI/NA is seeking to simplify airport grant assurances to allow airports to use non-aeronautical revenue sources for attracting new air service. Grant assurances help enforce federal policy priorities and protect airports from local efforts to restrict operations due to noise or land development. Airport noise is a key factor in local opposition to airport capacity projects. The debate may include raising the AIP noise compatibility set-aside. One issue is whether to raise the AIP noise compatibility set-aside and address funding eligibility concerns. This includes granting the FAA flexibility to use AIP funds for noise mitigation projects beyond designated noise impact areas. Additionally, there is a discussion on making noise mitigating arrival and departure procedures eligible for AIP funding. Vision 100 expanded AIP noise funding eligibility to include grants for land use compatibility planning around airports without a part 150 noise compatibility plan. Congress may need to review and potentially extend or modify this provision. Vision 100 increased federal share for smaller airports, but it reverts back to 90% after 2007. Congress may need to adjust federal share if budget constraints occur. The Airport Privatization Pilot Program allows exemptions for certain airports from federal restrictions on revenue use. Only one airport has been approved for exemption so far. Congress may consider reviewing the pilot program. The Airport Privatization Pilot Program allows exemptions for certain airports from federal restrictions on revenue use. Most U.S. airports are public entities, but activities are carried out by private firms under contract. Chicago is interested in leasing Midway Airport. Large and medium hub airports could opt out of the AIP program for higher PFC financing, giving them more flexibility in managing their airports. Vision 100 repealed language from the Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996. Vision 100 repealed language from the Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996, which allowed the use of AIP and PFC funds for security-related improvements. Despite prohibitions, some still see AIP as a potential funding source for security-related airport upgrades in the future. Predictions of rapid growth in very light jets have raised concerns. The rapid growth of very light jets (VLJs), which are designed to operate at most existing general aviation airports, has raised concerns about the need for increased airport funding to accommodate them. If VLJs lead to demands for all-weather capabilities or specific runway requirements, the demand for AIP funded improvements at small airports could increase over time. Small airports rely more on AIP funding for capital projects than larger airports. The impact of the Airbus A380 on AIP funding is a concern, with 18 U.S. airports making changes to accommodate the super jumbo at a cost of $927 million. Some policymakers oppose using federal funding for these projects, as Congress has not typically earmarked AIP discretionary funding for specific projects. The impact of earmarking on grant applications and limited discretionary funds for national priorities like the operation evolution plan (OEP) is a concern. Airports are debating whether to raise the $4.50 per boarding passenger ceiling or eliminate it altogether. There are calls for more flexibility in PFC eligibility requirements to allow funding for off-airport projects. Streamlining the application process is also a priority for airports. Airports seek streamlined application process and elimination of competition plan requirement for PFCs. ACI-NA proposes making tax-exempt airport bond income exempt from AMT to attract investors, despite potential cost to U.S. Treasury. Airlines oppose PFC increase, citing constraints on pricing ability due to passenger taxes. Bonds historically major funding source for capital projects at primary airports owned by public authorities. The proposal to make tax-exempt airport bond income exempt from AMT could attract investors but would cost the U.S. Treasury. Private activity airport bonds could facilitate public-private partnerships for airport development projects. The idea is similar to the private facility bond funding allowed for highways in the SAFETEA-LU act. The FAA and Congress have been focused on reducing operational costs in airport improvement processes, with measures such as facility consolidation and outsourcing. Options include shifting operational functions to private-sector users and forming government-industry partnerships for cost savings. The FAA is consolidating administrative and support staff into three regional facilities in Seattle, Fort Worth, and Atlanta, and flight services information offices into a single facility in Kansas City. This move is expected to save $38-41 million by relocating employees to areas with lower costs of living. The FAA is consolidating administrative and support staff into three regional facilities in Seattle, Fort Worth, and Atlanta, and flight services information offices into a single facility in Kansas City. This move is expected to save between $360 and $460 million over the next 10 years by relocating employees to areas with lower costs of living. The ongoing personnel transitions are set to be completed by December 2006, and Congress may focus on whether this consolidation effort can be a model for future plans. The FAA is consolidating administrative and support staff into three regional facilities and flight services information offices into a single facility to save money. Agencies like DOT OIG or GAO could help identify areas for improvement in future consolidation efforts, especially in air traffic services. This could help address staffing shortages and adapt to changes in the controller workforce. Congress may be interested in the FAA's future consolidation plans in this area. The FAA's future consolidation plans may impact regions and congressional districts, creating political pressures. Observers suggest using a BRAC-like model for assessments. The FAA may consider adopting a similar approach for future consolidation assessments during the reauthorization debate. Congress may weigh the benefits of this process for controlling costs and adapting to changes in air traffic services. The ongoing consolidation of weather support functions at air traffic control facilities could provide insight into larger scale consolidation efforts. The FAA is pursuing the consolidation of weather forecasting services for air traffic control facilities, aiming to centralize functions into Joint Aviation Weather Sites (JAWS) to provide continuous support. Prototype testing by the National Weather Service (NWS) is underway to demonstrate remote service capabilities. However, the plan is controversial, criticized by the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) and NWS employees fearing job losses and competitive sourcing. The FAA's plans for consolidating weather forecasting services may lead to job losses for NWS meteorologists and potential competitive sourcing of air traffic weather support functions. Concerns have been raised to Congress, and the FAA's initiatives are expected to face congressional scrutiny. The lack of a clear strategy for consolidation may prompt discussions on adopting a BRAC-like process for a cohesive approach during FAA reauthorization. This could provide insights into broader consolidation efforts. The FAA Administrator stated that privatization of air traffic control is not being considered by the current administration, despite the use of competitive sourcing for cost-saving in certain government functions. The focus remains on running a federal system of air traffic control. The FAA has focused on converting smaller scale services to contract operations, such as the Federal Contract Tower program and the outsourcing of automated flight service stations. Some in Congress opposed this shift to the private sector. While some in Congress opposed the outsourcing of certain FAA positions, they were unsuccessful in preventing the FAA from moving forward with contracting AFSS positions. Most FAA positions, including air traffic controllers, are considered commercial and can be outsourced at the FAA's discretion under existing guidelines. Specific initiatives to outsource functions within the FAA do not require additional authority and are not central issues in reauthorization debates. The 109th Congress introduced legislation to prevent outsourcing of flight service station positions in the FAA. Outsourcing initiatives aim to control costs but can impact morale and productivity of federal workers. FAA is expanding the federal contract tower program and consolidating automated flight service station functions under private contracts. These initiatives may serve as a model for competitive sourcing in other FAA functional areas. The FAA is expanding the federal contract tower program to streamline operations and improve cost savings through competitive sourcing. Concerns over privatization of air traffic services were raised during congressional debate, but further privatization was put on hold in FY2004. The program has continued to expand since then. The Federal Contract Tower (FCT) program, which began in 1982 as a pilot program at five airports, has expanded to encompass about 45% of all federally funded towers in the United States. Initially endorsed by the National Performance Review in 1993, the program rapidly grew to 160 towers by 1994. The Federal Contract Tower (FCT) program rapidly expanded to 160 towers by the end of FY1997, advocated for cost-saving effectiveness. A 2003 audit by DOT OIG found average annual cost savings of about $917,000 per tower due to lower staffing levels and salaries compared to FAA-run towers. FAA analysis in 1999 showed average annual savings of $787,000 per tower, attributed to increased costs in controller pay system. The Federal Contract Tower (FCT) program, implemented in FY1998, has faced challenges from the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) on legal grounds. Despite this, the program has expanded to include over 230 airport control towers. Congress funded a cost-sharing program in 1999 to support towers that do not meet FAA's cost-to-benefit criteria. By January 1, 2006, over 30 airports were part of the contract tower cost-sharing program. Audits by the DOT OIG have shown that contract towers maintain safety levels comparable to FAA-staffed towers, although NATCA disputes these findings. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) has challenged the findings regarding contract towers, claiming they have fewer controllers, provide less training, and have inadequate work conditions. However, these claims have not been substantiated by independent assessments. In 1999, Congress mandated an FAA study to expand the Federal Contract Tower (FCT) program, which identified additional airports for possible inclusion. The Federal Contract Tower (FCT) program was expanded in 1999 to include airports with limited radar monitoring and aircraft separation services under IFR. NATCA objected to further expansion in 2003 due to concerns about staffing and costs compared to federally-operated towers. Despite audits showing no significant differences in quality and safety, the program is seen as a cost-effective way to operate certain towers. The Federal Contract Tower (FCT) program has shown no significant differences in quality and safety compared to FAA-run towers. Ongoing issues include oversight of costs and consideration of factors like volume and complexity of operations for new tower inclusion. In 2005, the FAA completed a large public-private competitive source selection process for AFSS facilities. Lockheed-Martin Corporation won a contract to manage and operate AFSS facilities in the United States, excluding Alaska. The transition to Lockheed-Martin is expected to save the government $2.2 billion over 10 years through consolidation of facilities. The number of AFSS facilities will be reduced from 58 to 20, with three larger hub facilities coordinating services. The transition to Lockheed-Martin Corporation will consolidate AFSS facilities from 58 to 20, with three larger hub facilities coordinating services for different sectors of the country. Modernized computing capabilities will link the sites, providing access to local airport and airspace conditions. The consolidation will result in the elimination of AFSS positions, but a transition plan was designed to minimize impacts on displaced federal employees. AFSS specialists were guaranteed jobs with Lockheed-Martin for at least three years, and separation incentives were used to downsize staff before the transition. Congress approved an amendment to the FY2006 Transportation Appropriations Act (P.L. 109-115) to allow involuntarily separated AFSS employees nearing retirement eligibility to work under the Lockheed-Martin contract as temporary federal employees until they reach federal retirement eligibility, provided they do so before October 4, 2007. This was done after failed attempts to block outsourcing funding. In the context of FAA reauthorization, Congress may examine the AFSS station. The FAA is undergoing a full audit of the AFSS transition process to assess cost savings and operational needs. Congress may consider applying lessons learned to other agency consolidations. The aeronautical charting function could be a potential candidate for future competitive sourcing. The aeronautical charting function, managed by the FAA's National Aeronautical Charting Office (NACO), produces and distributes charts and flight information publications in various formats. NACO took over this responsibility from the National Ocean Service in FY1999. The shift towards digital geospatial data has facilitated easier data sharing for creating aeronautical chart products. NACO, the FAA's aeronautical charting office, has adapted well to technological changes in aviation. As the industry shifts towards digital charts and flight information, NACO may need to develop new digital products to interface with avionics technology. Commercially provided data is widely used by airlines and operators, competing with NACO's products in the market. The FAA's aeronautical charting office, NACO, faces competition from commercial vendors in the market. There are debates about outsourcing NACO functions due to safety and security concerns, with arguments for keeping it under FAA control for flight safety, national security, and compliance with regulations. Advocates for government-run NACO highlight its efficiency as a reason not to privatize. Advocates argue that privatizing the FAA's aeronautical charting office, NACO, would provide little benefit due to its high efficiency. The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) seeks to classify NACO positions as \"inherently governmental\" to maintain essential information sources for flight safety, national defense, and FAA compliance. Concerns also arise about potential cost increases for general aviation users if charting functions were outsourced. Congress did not pass legislation to protect FAA functions from privatization. Congress did not include legislation to protect FAA functions from privatization, including NACO functions, which closely resemble aeronautical charting functions provided by commercial vendors. NACO functions could be a prime candidate for competitive sourcing, but the small size and efficiency of the organization may limit cost savings from outsourcing. The FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure (FTI) is a complex program aimed at replacing aging equipment for air traffic control. Experts suggest outsourcing operations and maintenance for cost-saving. The FTI system will be performance-based, with the FAA not owning or operating any network equipment or software. The FTI program, led by Harris Corporation, requires close collaboration with the FAA to meet user requirements. There is significant risk in development and ongoing support for FAA telecommunications needs. If successful, the FTI program could serve as a model for government contracts supporting FAA operations in NGATS, which may be of interest to Congress during FAA reauthorization. Designees are individuals authorized by the FAA to carry out regulatory functions. The FAA utilizes designees, such as medical examiners, pilot examiners, and manufacturing representatives, to supplement regulatory oversight functions and control operational costs. There are over 11,000 designees, with some controversy surrounding their use in aircraft design and manufacturing. The FAA uses designees to supplement regulatory oversight and control costs, but concerns have been raised about their use in aircraft design and manufacturing. The GAO identified inconsistent monitoring and inadequate oversight of designees as significant weaknesses. To address safety concerns, the FAA may prioritize qualified retirees for designee functions and expand their use at facilities with effective safety management programs. By increasing the use of designees among operators and facilities, the FAA can focus its inspector workforce on sectors with safety concerns, like contract repair stations and smaller commercial operators. Utilizing qualified former FAA employees and federal annuitants with aviation experience as designees can enhance workforce quality and reduce dependency on companies. Adequate controller staffing is crucial due to upcoming retirements and mandatory retirement age for operational controllers. The pending controller retirement wave is a significant issue in the FAA reauthorization debate. Vision 100 mandated a controller workforce strategy to address this, with a focus on accelerated hiring and increased productivity. Over 11,000 controllers are projected to retire or leave between 2005 and 2014, with 8,250 specifically due to retirements. The FAA plans to hire 12,500 controllers to replace losses due to retirements. They are implementing a proactive strategy with a surge in hiring to train replacements, aiming to keep pace with attrition rates. The FAA is implementing strategies to address controller attrition rates, including allowing high-quality controllers to work beyond the mandatory retirement age and improving selection and training processes. They are also utilizing simulation technologies and working with universities to recruit and train future controllers. Congress may debate whether staffing standards and funding levels ensure safety. The FAA is implementing strategies to address controller attrition rates, including allowing high-quality controllers to work beyond the mandatory retirement age and improving selection and training processes. Congress may also consider options to streamline controller training and improve productivity to achieve cost savings by 2010. The FAA is implementing strategies to address controller attrition rates and improve staffing balance by restricting transfers and offering voluntary reassignments. This progress may be of interest during congressional debate over FAA reauthorization. The challenge in improving controller allocations and maintaining staffing balance is reducing on-the-job training failures among developmental controllers at en route centers. Congress may consider better screening tools like simulation training to identify controller aptitude for busy en route centers. Increased use of air traffic automation technologies could also help improve staffing imbalances in the future. One long-term option for reducing staffing imbalances is to consolidate air traffic facilities, which can help controllers progress to more complex airspace and provide career advancement opportunities. Congress may consider requiring the FAA to examine consolidation alternatives. Congress may also consider whether a BRAC-like process could evaluate air traffic control facility consolidation options and address contentious issues such as air traffic controller pay and labor negotiations. Options to improve existing laws and policies regarding FAA personnel system may help control operational costs and maintain positive management-labor relations within the FAA. The proposal suggests binding arbitration for labor negotiations in the FAA, which may resurface during FAA reauthorization debates. Congress authorized a new personnel management system for the FAA in 1995. The FAA authorized a new personnel management system in 1995, aiming for greater flexibility in hiring, training, compensation, and personnel location. Initially, chapter 71 of the U.S. Code did not apply to the new system, but in March 1996, Congress amended it to be applicable. In October 1996, additional requirements were considered, including consultation and negotiation as outlined in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 40122(a). The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration is required to negotiate with employee representatives and consult with other employees when making changes to the personnel management system. If an agreement is not reached, mediation services will be used. Proposed changes will not take effect until 60 days after objections are transmitted. The Senate version of the 1996 Act required the Administrator and exclusive bargaining representatives to find cost savings and increase productivity. The House version did not include provisions on consultation, negotiation, and mediation. In 2005, a federal court considered the impact of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 40122 on labor-management relations at the FAA. In 2004, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) and the Professional Airways Systems Specialists (PASS) sought assistance from the Federal Service Impasses Panel (FSIP) to resolve bargaining impasses with the FAA. FSIP initially declined to provide assistance due to uncertainty about its authority in cases involving the FAA. However, a district court later ruled that complaints related to an agency's participation in FSIP's impasse resolution procedures could be considered an unfair labor practice, with jurisdiction resting exclusively with the Authority and the Courts of Appeals. The court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction and should defer to the FLRA. The U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed the district court decision, stating that FSIP did not have a clear mandate to assert jurisdiction over bargaining impasses. The FAA's refusal to participate in FSIP proceedings could lead to an unfair labor practice charge before the FLRA. The FAA imposed a new labor contract on NATCA after negotiations, saving $1.9 billion over five years. A bill to repeal federal mediation requirements in contract impasses was defeated. The FAA's offer was chosen over the union's, which would have cost $600 million more. The current FAA reauthorization cycle is crucial. The current FAA reauthorization cycle is crucial due to increasing capacity needs at high-volume airports and congestion in airspace. Air traffic is rising again after a decrease post-9/11, leading to delays. Long-term solutions are needed to address future air traffic growth projections and strains on the national airspace system. The FAA's ground delay programs have helped smooth traffic flows, but challenges are mounting as airport traffic levels surpass those from previous years. Delays are not solely caused by weather, with only a small portion attributed to it. Delays are primarily caused by the current system's inability to cope with weather, congestion, and maintenance issues, as well as cascading effects from late arriving aircraft. System delays reflect inefficiencies in the air traffic control system and highlight capacity needs at busy airports. Increasing the system's ability to handle traffic is crucial to alleviate capacity-related delays. Priority must be given to increasing the system's ability to handle traffic during low visibility conditions at busy airports. Technology may be needed to reduce aircraft spacing standards to accommodate future growth in air traffic operations. However, certain very busy airports may still exceed capacity limitations even with planned expansions. Delays are geographically specific and impact capacity-constrained airports and surrounding airspace. The geographic distribution of congestion and delay in air traffic is highly specific, linked to population trends and socio-economic factors in major metropolitan areas. Air traffic is concentrated in a small number of airports, leading to an unbalanced distribution across the national airspace system. Choke points exist in high altitude airspace, particularly between cities in the northeast, Chicago, and the west coast, as well as along congested routes on the east and west coasts. The study found that future air traffic demand is projected to increase at congested major metropolitan airports and along busy flight routes. Despite efforts to expand capacity, constraints are expected at airports serving major cities and fast-growing areas. Socio-economic data was used to identify additional capacity needs by 2013. The study predicts that by 2013, 15 airports will require capacity improvements, including major airports in New York and Los Angeles. Without planned enhancements, the number of airports needing additional capacity could increase to 26. By 2020, the number is expected to grow to 18, with 23 more potentially needing capacity if improvements are delayed or cancelled. Los Angeles faces challenges with additional capacity if planned enhancements do not occur. The study identified significant challenges ahead for meeting aviation capacity needs in major metropolitan areas like Los Angeles and New York, as well as in fast-growing areas like Austin, San Antonio, and Tucson. Additional capacity will be needed at major commercial airports and reliever airports, even with planned enhancements in place. The capacity needs study identified challenges for meeting aviation capacity demand in large metropolitan areas. Congress and the FAA face the challenge of accommodating new classes of airspace users, including very big (Airbus A-380) and very small (VLJs) aircraft. VLJs are seen as a solution to improve access for small communities to the national air transportation system. The introduction of Very Light Jets (VLJs) aims to improve access to the national air transportation system for small communities, sparking public policy debate. VLJs will share airspace with commercial jets, impacting system capacity and air traffic control workload. Additionally, the emergence of pilotless Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and \"quiet\" supersonic aircraft pose safety challenges and airspace access issues. The introduction of Very Light Jets (VLJs) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is expected to impact the airspace system. The growth of commercial space transportation, including space tourism, also presents challenges for the FAA in ensuring safety and airspace management. The designation of supersonic corridors and the emergence of new airspace users will spark public-policy debates. Very Light Jets (VLJs) weighing less than 12,500 pounds with seating for two to seven occupants are marketed for fractional ownership and air-taxi operations. The FAA projects a 10.2% annual growth in general aviation turbojet activity over the next decade due to the anticipated popularity of VLJs. The impact of VLJs on the airspace system will depend on their utilization. The impact of Very Light Jets (VLJs) on the national airspace system is uncertain. Some believe that the speculation of a VLJ boom causing congestion is exaggerated, while others see potential in their low operating costs and ability to access small airports. The impact of Very Light Jets (VLJs) on the national airspace system is uncertain, with some seeing potential in their low operating costs and ability to access small airports for air transport in small communities. The FAA, NASA, and NCAM have promoted the Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS) as a possible option for providing air service to communities with limited access to air transportation, with VLJs considered the enabling technology for this vision. The realization of this vision depends on the development of a viable business case. The success of operating profitable air-taxi services using Very Light Jets (VLJs) depends on factors like public perception, demand, and operational costs. An operational issue may arise if the FAA requires two pilots for air-taxi operations, impacting costs in an environment with limited seating capacity. Only DayJet is currently exploring the use of VLJs in air-taxi operations. DayJet is set to launch VLJ air-taxi services in the southeast United States within a year, with safety compliance certification. Pogo Jet is taking a cautious approach. The uncertain market for VLJ air-taxi operations makes it hard to predict their impact on the national airspace system. Congress may consider using VLJs to serve small communities with limited air transportation access. Congress may consider options to provide stimulus for VLJ air-taxi operations in small communities through federal funding programs like the Essential Air Service program or the Small Community Air Service Development program. This concept has not yet been tested, but there is potential for VLJ air-taxi operations to receive support for meeting specific air transportation needs in geographically-specific areas. The FAA established a restricted airspace for unmanned aerial surveillance along the US-Mexico border in response to homeland security concerns. General aviation advocates, like AOPA, raised significant concerns about accommodating unmanned aerial systems safely in the national airspace. Advocates, such as AOPA, raised concerns over temporary flight restrictions for UAVs, fearing they could lead to widespread restricted airspace and disrupt air traffic flow. Safety worries were heightened after a DHS Predator UAV crashed in Arizona in 2006. The FAA predicts civilian UAV use will increase rapidly, requiring permission to fly in all US airspace, even in poor visibility conditions. The FAA predicts that UAV operations could dominate certain aviation sectors post-2015, particularly in areas like homeland security, law enforcement, pesticide application, and aerial surveying. There will be a push for a streamlined regulatory structure for approving UAV systems to operate in the National Airspace System (NAS). Demand for UAV operations will require the FAA to develop standard policies and regulations over the next five years, as technological advances and interest in UAV aircraft strain the agency. The FAA is under pressure to develop policies for safe UAV operations due to technological advances and increased interest in UAV aircraft. They are following NASA's lead with a phased approach called Access 5, starting with certifying high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) craft. Future phases may allow UAV operations in controlled airspace above 18,000 feet. This is expected to happen in late FY2008 or early FY2009. The FAA is working on policies for safe UAV operations following NASA's phased approach called Access 5. Progress is being made to allow UAVs to operate alongside manned aircraft at civilian airports and in more congested airspace, but there is uncertainty about the timeline due to technology advancements. This could be a topic of interest during FAA reauthorization debates. The FAA is addressing capacity constraints at airports in the United States, including LaGuardia Airport, by considering options such as negotiated scheduling, peak-period pricing, slots, and quota systems. This is in response to anticipated increases in operational efficiency under the NGATS plan and future growth projections. The FAA is considering options to address capacity constraints at LaGuardia Airport, with varying levels of government involvement. Airlines may negotiate schedules themselves or have government oversight to prevent antitrust violations. The government may play a more active role in discussing air traffic concerns and suggesting scheduling options to prevent antitrust violations at airports. This could include implementing incentives for off-peak scheduling and disincentives for peak hour operations, such as quota systems or increased fees. The government can address air traffic concerns by implementing incentives for off-peak scheduling and disincentives for peak hour operations, such as increased fees or quota systems at congested airports. Re-regulation of the airline industry, which was de-regulated in 1978, is not considered due to strong opposition. The debate continues on the appropriate level of government involvement in airline scheduling and airport access for efficient and fair access to limited airport capacity. Options to address equitable access to limited airport capacity and fair competition between air carriers include strategies to reduce peak hour demand and the use of slots or quotas at capacity-constrained airports. De-peaking strategies aim to alleviate congestion and delay, with varying levels of government involvement. Vision 100 established a collaborative decision-making trial program at highly capacity-constrained airports. The FAA established a collaborative decision-making trial program at capacity-constrained airports in the US, allowing airlines to discuss flight scheduling to optimize air traffic capacity. Airlines negotiated peak hour schedules at O'Hare airport with limited success. FAA limited unscheduled operations at O'Hare to 5 per hour to address congestion. The FAA has limited unscheduled operations at O'Hare to 5 per hour, causing complaints from operators who feel disadvantaged. Managing schedules at O'Hare is leading legacy carriers to lose market share to smaller airlines. The challenges of managing schedule demand at O'Hare without impacting competition are highlighted. Slots at O'Hare were eliminated in 2002 under AIR-21. The elimination of slots at O'Hare in 2002 under AIR-21 has led to challenges in managing schedule demand. Government intervention may be necessary to control schedules at busy airports like O'Hare. Airlines like American Airlines have found benefits in spreading out operations throughout the day to improve efficiency and reduce costs. American Airlines at Dallas-Fort Worth reduced daily departures by almost 10% compared to 2000 levels, but only lost 1.1% of available seats. De-peaking operations can increase productivity, make better use of gates, and streamline terminal operations. Airlines may adopt non-price de-peaking strategies for mutual benefit with FAA air traffic operations. If there are no clear business advantages to non-price de-peaking, the federal government or airport operators may implement incentives like peak hour pricing to manage schedule demand. Peak-hour pricing is opposed by many in the airline industry, including the ATA, regional airlines, and general aviation operators. They argue that it takes revenue away from airlines and gives it to airports, limiting access for smaller carriers and communities. Airport operators may prefer other alternatives like slots and quotas over peak-hour pricing. Peak-hour pricing schemes are seen as more complex to manage compared to slots and quotas, which are used to control airport scheduling. The use of slots has been phased out under AIR-21 due to concerns about preferential advantages for established carriers. Washington Reagan National Airport is the only airport still using a statutorily defined slot system. Policymakers may face challenges in managing demand without statutory slot systems. Policymakers may encounter challenges in managing demand to prevent congestion and delays at capacity-constrained airports. Debate over slot systems for these airports, like LaGuardia and JFK, may arise due to expired slot restrictions. The FAA proposed rule changes for slot allocations at LaGuardia to encourage larger aircraft use and increase access for carriers without slots. The FAA proposed rule changes for slot allocations at LaGuardia to ensure access for air carriers, including EAS and small community services. Concerns over potential market imbalances or disadvantages to small communities could lead to congressional oversight or legislative action on airport slot allocations. The ATA opposes the system, arguing that exceptions and variances undermine the basis of slot allocations. The FAA proposed rule changes for slot allocations at LaGuardia to ensure access for air carriers, including EAS and small community services. The Airport Council International\u2014North America (ACI-NA) favors slot auctions over congestion pricing for managing operational demand at busy airports. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program provides subsidies to air carriers for service in small communities to ensure access to the national air transportation system. In FY2006, 149 communities participated in the program, receiving $110 million in appropriations. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program receives annual appropriations, with a permanent $50 million per year appropriation since 1996. Congress can allocate additional funds, with recent proposals to limit funding to $50 million and require local cost-sharing. The program has withstood attempts to reduce its size and change community eligibility. Several trends, such as the decline of commercial air service in rural America, are making the Essential Air Service (EAS) program more appealing to rural communities. Despite increased funding, it is challenging for the EAS program to expand air service due to rising costs. Many rural locations have turned to the EAS program to maintain some air service as commercial carriers reduce or eliminate services. However, the limited annual EAS funding cannot subsidize all the air services desired by communities. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program faces challenges in prioritizing access and efficient use of funds. Restrictions already limit where and how EAS funds can be used, but without increased funding, Congress may impose further limitations. Vision 100 included incentives to transition communities out of the standard EAS program, but uptake has been low. The EAS program faces challenges in prioritizing access and efficient use of funds. Vision 100 included incentives for communities to participate, but uptake has been low. A trial program requiring community financial participation was proposed but has not been implemented due to lack of funding. The SCASD Program was established to improve air carrier service to communities with insufficient access to the national air transportation system. The Program funding provides grants to communities for air service improvements, requiring local financial participation. Despite receiving fewer funds than authorized, 182 grants have been awarded since FY2002. The number of grant applications has decreased as the program matured, with mixed results according to the Government Accountability Office. The Vision 100 program created the Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO) to develop the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS) to triple system capacity by 2025. The JPDO has started work on an enterprise architecture for NGATS, with future funding and management challenges to be addressed during FAA reauthorization. The FAA reauthorization process is focusing on obtaining cost estimates for building the NGATS. Preliminary analysis suggests an annual cost of $2.7 billion for NGATS facilities and equipment, totaling about $50 billion in constant 2005 dollars by FY2025. The estimated annual cost for NGATS facilities and equipment is $2.7 billion, totaling around $50 billion by FY2025. Additional costs not included in these estimates are related to FAA certification, research and development efforts, homeland security, and military spending to ensure NGATS compliance. The DOT OIG projects annual costs to be $600 million above FY2007 levels in FY2008, increasing to $1 billion above baseline by FY2012. The GAO and DOT OIG have different estimates for NGATS costs, with the GAO referencing averaged costs from FY2007 to FY2025 and the DOT OIG focusing on near term spending through 2012. The GAO acknowledges that costs will decrease as legacy systems phase out, but also notes the need for budgeting for a successor system and enhancements to NGATS technologies by 2020-2025. Preliminary cost estimates for FAA's F&E account through 2025 are shown in Figure 5. Estimates for NGATS costs vary between the GAO and DOT OIG, with the GAO projecting an average annual cost increase of $200 million above the baseline F&E funding level, while the DOT OIG provided estimates increasing to $1 billion above the baseline by 2012. An inflation-based increase of 2.5% annually was applied for analysis, with NGATS planners expecting some uncontrollable cost increases, particularly in labor rates. NGATS planners anticipate increased efficiencies and cost savings as the system transitions to lower-cost technologies, offsetting potential labor rate increases. F&E expenditures are estimated at almost $69 billion, $5 billion above the baseline assumption of a 2.5% inflation rate. Extrapolating beyond 2012, total F&E spending is projected to reach almost $76 billion, $12 billion over the baseline assumption. FAA's REDAC also considered costs for research and development, operations, and airport facilities. Based on initial cost estimates by REDAC, CRS computed estimated costs in FAA accounts over the next five years for facilities, equipment, research, development, operations, and airport improvements. These estimates will be important during the reauthorization process to establish funding levels. Future cost projections do not fully consider potential cost savings that could offset inflationary adjustments. FAA anticipates cost savings through initiatives, but the full amount is not yet identified in planning documents. Despite anticipated cost savings from various initiatives, the exact amount of projected savings remains uncertain. This uncertainty, stemming from both the initiatives themselves and the funding needs of NGATS, poses a challenge in determining funding authorization levels. Setting appropriate funding levels for NGATS development in the coming years may be difficult due to the high level of uncertainty in the deployment schedule. While increased funding may be necessary, the FAA could face challenges in efficiently utilizing these additional funds until the system architecture and development schedule for NGATS mature further. The curr_chunk discusses cost projections for the Next Generation Air Transportation System, based on reports from the U.S. Government Accountability Office and the U.S. Department of Transportation. The GAO estimates average annual costs in 2005 dollars, highlighting the challenges associated with funding authorization levels for NGATS development. The curr_chunk discusses the management of NGATS development during the reauthorization process, including issues like progress monitoring, defining timelines, and the role of the Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO). The curr_chunk focuses on key issues related to the management of the NGATS project, including the JPDO's access to budgeting and acquisition processes, the scope of the project, staffing concerns, and the need for a systems integration contractor. These issues are further examined in relation to the JPDO's role as outlined in Vision 100. Vision 100 mandated the establishment of the JPDO as a multi-agency entity led by the FAA to oversee the NGATS project. The National Research Council raised concerns in 2005 about the JPDO's focus on resolving demand issues and increasing capacity in the NAS. Despite recommendations to restructure and focus on specific operational solutions, the JPDO has chosen to continue with its broader approach. The JPDO has chosen to continue with its broader approach for the NGATS development, despite concerns raised by the National Research Council about the lack of focus on specific operational solutions. The NRC also highlighted issues with the integrated product teams not functioning effectively as multidisciplinary teams. The JPDO's ability to exploit synergies among government agencies and aviation stakeholders is crucial for developing the NGATS enterprise architecture. The GAO's analysis was more positive than the NRC's, noting challenges in defining common objectives and leveraging resources. Funding for NGATS plans will come from various agency budgets. The JPDO does not have authority over funding for NGATS plans, which will come from agencies like the FAA and NASA. Congress may align budget elements within the NGATS framework. The JPDO's scope includes airport-to-airport issues like security and environmental concerns, which could benefit or hinder the NGATS blueprint. Some observers believe that the JPDO's focus on policy and collaboration has hindered progress on improving the efficiency and capacity of the air traffic system. Concerns have been raised about the lack of specific goal-directed products and processes, as well as a cohesive blueprint with engineering specifications for the NGATS. Some experts are concerned about the lack of specificity and detail in the JPDO's development of the NGATS, urging the need for a more detailed enterprise architecture to ensure timely progress towards the 2025 completion date. One suggestion for streamlining the system development is the use of an overarching lead systems integration. The FAA reauthorization process may debate the use of an overarching lead systems integration contract for overseeing the NGATS project. The JPDO faces challenges in coordinating budgetary objectives and research processes across multiple agencies. The JPDO's progress report lacks detail on leveraging research projects and funding for coordinated development. The DOT OIG emphasized the need for improved interagency coordination and transparency in budget alignment for NGATS development. Congress may consider requiring specific budgetary alignment reporting to ensure progress and avoid duplication of effort. This information is crucial for setting authorization levels and appropriations for NGATS-related programs. The NGATS development requires improved interagency coordination and transparency in budget alignment. Experts agree on technological objectives and core technologies for the system, which aim to address capacity needs in the national airspace system through the deployment of new technologies. A glossary of key terms is provided in the planning documents. The NGATS aims to increase air traffic flow while maintaining safety and efficiency. Key technologies include precision navigation and integrated information networks for shared situational awareness. The operational concept incorporates new approaches to air traffic management and communication. The JPDO defines technological objectives for air traffic management and communications, including trajectory-based operations, performance-based operations, collaborative traffic flow management, flexible airspace allocation, and reduced aircraft separation. The JPDO aims to enhance air traffic management through improved separation of aircraft, advanced weather forecasting tools, and technological approaches like network-centric infrastructure and precision navigation capabilities. Investment in these technologies is a key focus for the future of air traffic systems. Investment strategies for new technologies in air traffic management are crucial for the future of the National Airspace System. These decisions are currently a significant focus within the FAA and will be a key topic during the upcoming FAA reauthorization process. Considerations include technology selection, transition plans, support for existing systems, backup systems, and research needs to integrate emerging technologies effectively. The National Airspace System requires investment in new technologies to achieve its objectives. The current focus is on integrating emerging technologies effectively to transform the existing airspace system. The National Airspace System relies on ground-based navigational signals and radar surveillance for aircraft tracking and separation. Air traffic controllers play a crucial role in ensuring safe distances between aircraft by providing radar services and issuing instructions to pilots. Maintaining communication between controllers and pilots is essential for safe operations in both en route and terminal airspace. The National Airspace System relies on voice communications between controllers and pilots for aircraft separation. Controller workload, radio frequency congestion, and navigational limitations impact capacity in busy terminal areas and en route airways. Standardized navigation procedures can help reduce workload and expand capacity, but limitations exist due to imprecise navigation infrastructure and flight monitoring methods. Experts agree that achieving the NGATS goal of tripling system capacity by 2025 using existing infrastructure would be extremely difficult. The NGATS will rely on revolutionary systems concepts for air traffic management and communication, navigation, and surveillance, including satellite-based navigation, digital communications, shared information technology architectures, and advanced automation tools. The future airspace system will rely on precision navigation capabilities for pinpointing aircraft locations with greater accuracy and reducing uncertainty in flight plans. The FAA is setting performance-based requirements for navigational accuracy instead of specific technology standards. The FAA is establishing performance requirements for navigation in the future airspace system, likely relying on satellite-based systems like GPS. This shift will move away from ground-based navigation to satellite systems for more accurate aircraft location pinpointing. The FAA is transitioning to satellite-based systems like GPS for future navigation requirements, as GPS is currently the only fully operational system with worldwide coverage and meets performance expectations. Other systems like GLONASS and Galileo are less capable or still in development. The FAA's focus is on performance-based requirements rather than specific technologies. The federal government has heavily invested in GPS for precision navigation, with the military committed to deploying the next generation of GPS satellites. The FAA has also invested in the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) to augment GPS signals, spending nearly $3 billion over the past 10 years to achieve initial operating capability. WAAS, comprised of ground-based reference sites, master stations, and geostationary satellites, improves GPS accuracy by monitoring and correcting satellite signals. Corrections are transmitted to WAAS-enabled GPS units, improving position accuracy to within 1.5 to 2 meters. FAA certifies WAAS-enabled GPS avionics for guaranteed accuracy of 50 meters vertically and 40 meters horizontally. The WAAS system, operational since July 2003, offers guaranteed accuracy of 50 meters vertically and 40 meters horizontally. FAA has approved instrument approaches for aircraft with WAAS-enabled GPS avionics, allowing descent to 200 feet in instrument weather conditions. FAA is exploring a more precise Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS) for precision landings during low visibility operations at selected airports. Questions remain about the future of LAAS, including cost justifications and navigational accuracy improvements over WAAS. The FAA is considering the future of LAAS for precision landings at selected airports, questioning its cost justifications and navigational accuracy compared to WAAS. WAAS is seen as an enabler of performance-based navigational procedures like RNAV and RNP, with RNP defining the required position accuracy to keep aircraft within a specified containment area 99.9% of the time. RNAV is a navigational performance standard for aircraft that allows for precise waypoint establishment without the need for ground-based navigational stations. It has been around since the 1970s and can be met using various technologies, including satellite-based navigation. The FAA is transitioning to WAAS-enabled GPS as the primary technology for aircraft navigation, with DME as a backup. Mandates for RNP are expected at busy airports and high altitude airspace in the next five to ten years, to meet NGATS requirements and phase out ground-based navigation infrastructure. The transition to WAAS-enabled GPS for aircraft navigation is underway, with precision navigation likely required for high altitude airspace, busy en route corridors, and operations at large commercial airports. Equipping aircraft with WAAS-enabled GPS systems will be necessary, but questions remain about backup navigation capabilities and specific performance requirements for different airspace classes and operations. The current air traffic system heavily relies on radar for tracking air traffic. The existing airspace system heavily relies on radar for air traffic surveillance, with protocols in place to ensure operational safety. However, capacity is limited by controller workload and separation requirements. The Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS) aims to improve air traffic surveillance and aircraft separation. The Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS) aims to establish a shared responsibility for air traffic surveillance and separation between service providers and users. This includes creating a data network for shared situational awareness services, providing information such as weather, traffic, flight plans, and airspace conditions. Users can access this data at different levels of detail. The Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS) aims to establish a shared responsibility for air traffic surveillance and separation between service providers and users. This includes creating a data network for shared situational awareness services, providing information such as weather, traffic, flight plans, and airspace conditions at different levels of detail. Pilots, air traffic controllers, and air traffic managers receive specific data pertinent to their roles, facilitated by a reliable air-ground data network. ADS-B technology is being introduced to enhance aviation system capabilities. ADS-B technology, utilizing GPS signals, broadcasts aircraft position, speed, and other information to ground stations and equipped aircraft. It is expected to replace radar facilities in the future, with the FAA planning dual frequency broadcasts on the 1090 MHZ and 978 MHZ spectrum bands. The FAA plans to expand ADS-B availability and usage, transitioning to it as the primary means for air traffic surveillance. Benefits include cost savings, more accurate tracking, and improved safety through shared situation awareness for pilots and controllers. ADS-B also provides a datalink communication platform for receiving weather and flight information. The ATA and AOPA support the transition to ADS-B surveillance, with a focus on controlling costs for system users. The AOPA emphasizes keeping costs low for small general aviation aircraft owners and operators. Detailed assessments of costs and benefits are needed to determine the feasibility of the technology. The AOPA proposes using the current cost of transponder equipment as a benchmark for future ADS-B requirements, suggesting a 10-year transition period before mandatory compliance. They emphasize the importance of providing free access to datalink traffic and weather information for improved flight safety. The FAA has requested $80 million for initial full-scale ADS-B implementation, with existing infrastructure in Alaska and along the east coast. The FAA plans to deploy ADS-B in the Gulf of Mexico under the Safe Flight 21 program to improve flight surveillance in radar-limited areas. Ground stations will be placed on oil rigs to benefit helicopter operations for the offshore oil industry, smaller aircraft below 18,000 feet, and high altitude commercial flights. The program aims to enhance aerial surveillance for national security and law enforcement purposes, with Congress likely to show interest in the FAA's deployment plan during reauthorization. The FAA's deployment of ADS-B in the Gulf of Mexico under the Safe Flight 21 program is of interest to Congress. Key issues include the transition timeline to ADS-B, regulatory impacts on system users, availability and reliability of the system, and selection of a backup system for situation awareness in case of equipment failures. The FAA also envisions a data network for sharing operational information through System Wide Information Management (SWIM). The FAA plans to implement the SWIM infrastructure using commercially available equipment and industry standards. SWIM aims to create a seamless data network similar to the World Wide Web, improving access to authorized data. Key issues include determining user access, ensuring data availability, integrating robust security measures, and establishing interfaces with ADS-B. Interoperability between ADS-B and SWIM is crucial for NGATS system architecture. Congress may be interested in how FAA leverages military and corporate networks for SWIM. Phasing out existing air traffic systems must be carefully managed to balance costs and resource allocation. The shift to satellite-based navigation will lead to gradual phase-outs of ground-based navigational facilities over the next fifteen years, resulting in cost savings for the FAA. Non-directional beacons (NDBs) are already being phased out and will be fully decommissioned within the next ten years. The current plans involve the gradual phase-down of ground-based VOR transmitter sites, starting in 2010. About 30% of VORs in the US will be reduced by 2012, with further reductions to half by 2020. DME transmitters are seen as a potential backup to GPS for aircraft navigation in case of disruptions. Plans call for a gradual phase-down of standard instrument landing systems for airport runways, starting in 2015. Advanced ILS equipment providing lower landing minimums in poor visibility will not be phased out. These systems cater to a small user community, mainly large commercial aircraft operators. The FAA is evaluating if LAAS can match the performance of advanced ILS systems. LAAS can offer navigation performance equivalent to advanced ILS systems. Radar facilities, especially long-range radar, may be decommissioned if ADS-B becomes the primary aircraft surveillance method in the NGATS. However, ADS-B relies solely on aircraft-based systems for transmitting position data, making aircraft vulnerable to complete invisibility in case of equipment or power failures. This contrasts with radar, which provides controllers with the ability to at least see an aircraft's primary target. The loss of this capability without a backup means of identifying aircraft could pose safety and airspace security risks. Terminal radars may be retained as an option. One option being discussed is to keep terminal radars around busy airports as backup for safety and maintain radar coverage near major cities and potential terrorist targets for airspace security. Long-range radar sites may be decommissioned, with ADS-B as the primary means of aircraft surveillance. Small aircraft without redundant systems may face challenges in maintaining safety. Congress may be interested in how proposals address providing equivalent safety to the current radar environment. The transition to new aircraft surveillance methods aims to ensure safety equivalent to radar-based systems. Congressional focus is on the impact of legacy system phase-out on airspace users, especially smaller operators. While advancements in navigation and information sharing can increase system capacity, wake turbulence from large aircraft limits spacing even in good weather. Wake encounters occur throughout flight phases, not just during takeoff and landing. Experts are concerned about the increased risk of wake turbulence encounters during all phases of flight due to reduced aircraft spacing. Over an 18-year period between 1983 and 2000, there were 130 accidents and 60 incidents, mostly involving smaller aircraft. Even a widebody MD-11 aircraft was substantially damaged following a wake turbulence encounter. Safety concerns over wake turbulence encounters impose significant limitations on various approaches to address capacity needs. Current air traffic procedures specify separation standards for aircraft departing behind large and heavy jets to allow their wake vortices to dissipate. Some argue that accurate wake vortex prediction capabilities could decrease separation, increasing airport capacity. However, limited technology and complexities in wake vortex propagation make it challenging to predict wake turbulence accurately. The focus is on wake turbulence separation standards as regulators consider appropriate following distances behind the Airbus A380. The FAA and international regulators are discussing the appropriate following distance behind the Airbus A380 super-jumbo aircraft. The International Civil Aviation Organization has set an interim following distance of 10-nautical miles, double that of current heavy jets. Airbus is concerned that these separation requirements could impact system and airport capacity as A380s enter service. Vision 100 authorizes funding for the development of wake vortex advisory systems and directs an assessment of the FAA's wake turbulence research program. The FAA is allocating $500,000 for wake turbulence prediction using LIDAR and acoustic sensors to track aircraft wake turbulence trials. Research shows that turbulence dissipates rapidly, potentially increasing landing capacity by 20%. Regulatory changes for spacing aircraft will require safety demonstrations. Commercial airline travel in the US is considered very safe. Commercial airline travel in the United States is very safe, with major accidents being extremely rare. Experts are divided on whether further improvements can be made to enhance safety, considering factors like maintenance practices, aircraft design issues, and airport operations to prevent collisions. Airport design initiatives and operational considerations are being examined to prevent ground collisions and runway overruns in commercial aviation. Safety enhancements are being considered for all-cargo operations, air tour, and air ambulance operations to improve the overall safety record of the aviation industry. Bringing the safety standards of all-cargo operations on par with passenger airline operations is suggested to reduce accidents due to unique risks posed by the size of aircraft and the range of operations in the all-cargo sector. Various approaches to improving safety have been proposed and implemented in response to persisting and emerging safety concerns. Options to improve safety in commercial aviation, including preventing runway accidents, improving maintenance oversight, and addressing safety concerns in the all-cargo industry, may be discussed during the FAA reauthorization process in Congress. Runway overrun accidents have been a focus of concern since the last FAA reauthorization, with efforts to enhance safety measures in response to persisting and emerging safety issues. On August 2, 2005, an Air France Airbus A340 overran the runway at Toronto Pearson International Airport during a thunderstorm, leading to a post-impact fire. Despite the crash, all 309 occupants survived. The investigation pointed to runway contamination and a long, fast touchdown as possible factors. Later that year, a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 also overran the runway at Chicago's Midway Airport during a snowstorm, resulting in a collision with a vehicle on a highway and the death of a six-year-old boy. These incidents highlighted safety concerns in the airline industry. The crash at Chicago Midway Airport in 2005 reminded many of a previous runway overrun incident at Burbank in 2000. Runway overrun accidents have also involved business jets, such as one at Teterboro Airport in 2005. Concerns arise from airports not meeting FAA's runway safety area criteria. Following the NTSB's recommendation after the Burbank crash in 2000, the FAA has been urged to ensure all airports with commercial passenger flights meet safety criteria. Engineered Materials Arresting System (EMAS) beds are being deployed at airports where runway criteria cannot be met, providing a solution for overrun accidents. EMAS, made of lightweight concrete, allows for rapid deceleration of aircraft. Examples include installations at Little Rock and Laguardia airports. Laguardia Airport has EMAS to prevent runway overrun accidents, with 22 installations at 18 US airports since 1996. EMAS can be effective even with less than 600 feet of land available for installation. Other options to slow aircraft, such as frangible barriers, provide a less than optimal solution. Land acquisition to extend runway safety areas or construct effective EMAS arrester beds is a preferable long term solution for mitigating runway overrun accidents. Congress may consider identifying airports with the highest risk of such incidents during the reauthorization process. The FAA is prioritizing efforts to improve inadequate runway safety areas at airports with high risk of runway overrun accidents. Operational changes and adding a 15% safety margin to landing distance calculations are being implemented to enhance safety measures. The FAA is implementing operational changes by adding a 15% safety margin to landing distance calculations to enhance safety measures for in-flight aircraft landing. Airlines and operators must incorporate this safety margin into their procedures, which must be approved by the FAA. The NTSB is considering eliminating the assumption of thrust reversers properly deploying during landing calculations. The 15% safety margin added to landing distance calculations by the FAA is supported by the airline industry but criticized by charter operators for being arbitrary. Developing effective means for airports to maintain runway braking action under adverse weather conditions is another option to prevent overrun accidents. Ongoing research aims to improve contamination removal and runway friction coefficients, especially in winter conditions. Funding for these programs has historically come from NASA's aeronautics research program, but Congress may review this in the future. Since 1990, there have been four runway collisions in the United States involving large commercial airliners. The deadliest runway collision in the United States occurred on February 1, 1991, at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), resulting in 36 fatalities. The most recent major runway collision accident worldwide occurred at Milan, Italy's Linate Airport on October 8, 2001, killing 118 people and injuring 4. The 1977 collision of two Boeing 747 jumbo jets on the island of Tenerife resulted in 583 fatalities, making it the world's deadliest aircraft accident. Mitigating the risk of runway collisions has been a top priority for aviation safety experts, with the FAA and NTSB focusing on prevention measures since 1990. Errors leading to runway collisions, whether by pilots, air traffic controllers, or ground vehicles, pose a significant threat during takeoff and landing. The FAA has prioritized reducing runway incursions, which are errors that can lead to collisions. Despite efforts, the rate of incursions has remained around five per million flight operations since 1999. However, the severity of these incidents has decreased slightly in recent years. High-profile events, like two incidents at Chicago's O'Hare airport in 2006, continue to raise concerns about the potential for disasters. The NTSB raised concerns about controller training, fatigue, and runway safety technology effectiveness. The AMASS system, used to reduce runway incursion incidents, lacks direct warning capability to flight crews. The NTSB deemed FAA's response to preventing runway collisions as \"unacceptable\" due to AMASS limitations in providing sufficient warnings to prevent collisions. The NTSB recommended the FAA develop a system similar to TCAS to alert controllers to runway incursions, but the AMASS system lacks direct warning capability to flight crews. The NTSB concluded that technological approaches aimed at improving air traffic controller situational awareness were insufficient in preventing runway collisions. The NTSB recommended specific actions to address changes in operational procedures at airports, including installing ground movement safety systems with direct warning capability to pilots. They also suggested changes to increase pilot and controller awareness, resolve ambiguities in runway crossing clearances, and modify airport movement instructions to be consistent with international standards. The FAA continues to work on implementing these recommendations. The FAA is addressing procedural changes to enhance runway safety, but the NTSB is frustrated with their progress. There is no single solution to mitigating runway incursions, and continued investment in airport design, training, and technology is needed. ASDE-X is viewed as a primary means to provide controllers with situation awareness of airport surface movements, but costs have escalated. The cost of ASDE-X has increased by $85.9 million due to adding seven more airports. The full deployment timeline has been delayed to FY2009 from FY2007 because of budget cuts in FY2004 and FY2005. Various policy options and technology approaches have been implemented to improve runway safety, but the NTSB and safety experts still believe that direct warning technology for flight crews is necessary. The FAA acknowledges the failure to reduce runway incursion rates and the residual risk of runway collisions at airports with ASDE-X and AMASS. The estimated cumulative risk across all airports is $200 million. The new runway status lights system is expected to address a significant portion of this risk by illuminating red when the runway is unsafe. The FAA plans to deploy runway status lights at airports to improve safety during high-speed operations. Cost-benefit data supports limited installations at 15-20 airports, with a requested appropriation of $13.7 million for FY2007. While runway status lights offer near-term benefits, future technologies like GPS and ADS-B may enhance situational awareness to prevent runway incursions. During reauthorization debates, Congress is interested in FAA's progress on technologies like multilateration for aircraft ground separation and oversight of air carrier maintenance practices. FAA inspections of domestic repair stations are only required annually, with limited direct oversight of foreign repair stations. Outsourced maintenance now accounts for over 50% of air carriers' total maintenance costs. The FAA has limited oversight of repair stations in foreign countries, with concerns raised about staffing levels and oversight at stations working on air carrier fleets. Congress is pushing for improved oversight and quality control at these facilities, both domestically and abroad. Growing concern over maintenance and repair work conducted by on-site contract workers and non-certificated subcontractors, lacking FAA regulation. Weaknesses in regulations for contract maintenance, with no relief requirements for fatigue among workers servicing commuter and air taxi aircraft. Lack of supervision in contract maintenance operations, with high worker to supervisor ratios. The NTSB's investigation into a US Airways commuter flight crash in 2003 revealed concerns over FAA oversight of contract maintenance practices. Subcontracted maintenance workers at non-certificated facilities were found to have improperly rigged elevator control cables. The FAA had little knowledge of the contract arrangements and work conditions in this case, prompting a DOT OIG audit. The DOT OIG audit found that non-certificated maintenance facilities were extensively used by air carriers for major repairs and overhauls without FAA's knowledge. These facilities operate beyond regulations for certificated repair stations, with no specific limitations on the type of work they can perform. FAA oversight and air carriers' monitoring of work at these facilities were deemed inadequate. The audit recommended improvements in FAA oversight. The DOT OIG audit found non-certificated maintenance facilities were extensively used by air carriers for major repairs without FAA's knowledge. Recommendations include inventorying maintenance vendors, limiting non-certificated entities' work, and enhancing oversight. Concerns also exist about FAA inspectors lacking training on current technologies. Congress may focus on FAA's actions to address these issues. The GAO found that the FAA's approach to inspector training was effective but suggested a more systematic approach to identifying technical training needs. Congress is concerned about the adequacy of the FAA's inspector workforce and the increased use of designees for inspection duties. Vision 100 directed the National Academy of Sciences to study FAA's staffing methods for air safety inspectors. This ongoing work may help Congress examine how the FAA can adapt its maintenance inspector workforce to changing maintenance practices among air carriers. The FAA faces challenges in overseeing air charter operators due to complex leasing and management arrangements. NTSB investigations have raised concerns about compliance with regulatory requirements. For example, a charter jet crash in 2005 revealed violations of FAA regulations. The FAA is ensuring that charter certificate holders maintain \"operational control\" over aircraft for charter flights. They are providing briefings to clarify this concept and oversee charter operators to ensure safety. Congress may address FAA oversight in the air charter industry during reauthorization. Safety concerns also extend to the air tour industry. The air tour industry, which provides sightseeing flights to the public, is largely unregulated due to exemptions from commercial operator regulations within 25 miles of the base airport. However, there are specific regulations for air tour operators in Hawaii, the Grand Canyon, and National Parks. The FAA proposed national safety standards for commercial air tour operators in response to safety concerns. The FAA proposed national safety standards for air tour operators to address safety concerns, but the proposal faces opposition from affected entities due to the significant cost of regulatory compliance for small businesses in the industry. Objectors are calling for a systematic rulemaking approach with input from advisory groups to better balance safety with operational constraints. The crash of TWA flight 800 in 2006, attributed to a fuel tank explosion, raised concerns about air tour operators' regulation. Since then, two ground explosions have been documented. The risk of fuel tank explosions in aviation has been a concern, with incidents like the destruction of a Thai Airways Boeing 737 in Bangkok in 2001 and an explosion on a Transmile Airlines Boeing 727 in Bangalore in 2006. Despite discussions on using less volatile fuels and fuel inerting foam technology, progress in addressing these risks has been slow. The NTSB and safety advocates are disappointed with the FAA and airline industry for not implementing interim measures to reduce fuel tank flammability. Simple steps like adjusting fuel levels and minimizing heat-generating equipment could mitigate risks until long-term solutions are in place. The FAA did not mandate these steps despite their effectiveness in reducing the risk of explosions and fires in aircraft fuel tanks. Recently, technology advances in fuel inerting systems have led to the development of small, light-weight fuel inerting pumps that extract oxygen from the air in fuel tanks, replacing it with a nitrogen-rich mixture that greatly reduces flammability. The FAA announced an innovative prototype inerting system in May 2002, which is more reliable and cost-effective for retrofitting into existing airplanes. Boeing is now incorporating these systems into new aircraft. The FAA is proposing a rule to reduce fuel tank flammability in passenger airline aircraft over the next eight years by requiring the installation of fuel inerting systems. The rule does not cover wing tanks or all-cargo aircraft. The proposed rule aims to reduce fuel tank flammability in passenger airliners by setting a flammability exposure criterion. Airbus is pushing for certification of its A380 without fuel tank inerting systems, arguing that design considerations already mitigate the risk. The FAA's proposed timetable requires 50% of an air carrier's fleet to be in compliance by 2009-2011. The FAA proposed rule requires airlines to achieve 100% compliance with fuel tank flammability reduction measures between 2012 and 2014. It is estimated to cost passenger airlines about $809 million over the next 50 years. The estimated benefits of the rulemaking over this time period range from $490 million to $890 million in 2005 dollars, depending on the assumed cost of a human life. The FAA calculated a 37% chance of five or more accidents occurring over the next 50 years. The FAA proposed rule requires airlines to achieve 100% compliance with fuel tank flammability reduction measures between 2012 and 2014, costing passenger airlines about $809 million over 50 years. The FAA calculated a 37% chance of five or more accidents occurring during that period, with potential benefits being higher for accidents involving large jets. The FAA justified the costs of the proposed action, considering the effectiveness of special regulations put in place in 2001 in reducing ignition sources. Some observers may question this conclusion due to slight alterations in assumptions affecting the benefit to cost ratio. The FAA proposed a rule requiring airlines to comply with fuel tank flammability reduction measures, with varying benefit to cost ratios. The FAA estimated potential revenue losses of $5 billion per accident due to public fear of terrorist acts. Despite potential challenges from aircraft manufacturers and airlines, the FAA believes the benefits justify the compliance cost. The NTSB supports the proposed rulemaking to reduce fuel tank explosions but is frustrated by the slow process. Congress may examine the FAA's approach to reducing fuel tank flammability for transport category aircraft. The FAA proposal aims to address concerns about fuel tank explosions in passenger airlines, but there are debates about the scope of aircraft covered and compliance timelines. Age-related structural fatigue and wiring issues are significant worries for the aviation industry, especially for all-cargo aircraft with older fleets. General aviation aircraft may also face similar risks. The average age of jet freighters is over 20 years, while general aviation aircraft face risks due to their aging fleet, expected to reach 50 years by 2020. Advocates resist proposals for continuing inspections of aging aircraft, citing concerns over operational costs. Aging aircraft used in commuter and charter service may pose safety risks, as the FAA's regulatory framework does not cover smaller aircraft. Congress passed the Aging Aircraft Safety Act of 1991 to establish an inspections program. The Aging Aircraft Safety Act of 1991 (P.L. 102-143) established an inspections program to study age-related structural issues in the air carrier fleet after incidents like the Aloha Airlines Boeing 737 fuselage separation in 1988. The Aviation Safety Research Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-591) mandated research on fatigue and environmental degradation effects on aircraft structures. The FAA increased maintenance inspection requirements to check for fatigue cracks under the aging aircraft inspection program. Inspections are conducted to check for small fatigue cracks and prevent corrosion on aircraft structural components. Ultrasound techniques help identify fatigue cracks, but can be costly and time-consuming. Concerns have been raised about widespread fatigue damage affecting airframe airworthiness. The FAA proposed rulemaking to establish operating limits for transport category aircraft based on the number of cycles. This would set a maximum number of cycles for airframes, after which an aircraft must be retired unless an operator can demonstrate an extension through detailed inspections and maintenance. The proposed FAA rule would impose operating limits on transport category aircraft based on cycles, potentially leading to faster depreciation of aircraft, higher leasing costs, and lower resale value. Cargo operators using older aircraft may face increased fleet replacement rates, but transitioning to a younger fleet could offset some costs. Transitioning to a younger fleet of aircraft due to the proposed FAA rule results in lower maintenance costs. The rule would only apply to aircraft over 75,000 pounds, prompting questions about similar regulations for smaller aircraft like the commuter seaplane in the 2005 Miami crash. The crash highlighted the dangers of structural fatigue in aging aircraft used by smaller airlines and charter operators. The NTSB investigation into the crash, which killed 20 people, revealed fatigue cracks near the suspected wing failure location shortly after takeoff. The NTSB investigation into the 2005 Miami crash highlighted concerns about aging aircraft used by smaller operators. The FAA regulatory change in 2005 limited inspection requirements for older aircraft, prompting recommendations to broaden inspection and records-keeping requirements for all commercial passenger and cargo aircraft. The FAA has identified aging aircraft as a concern in both commercial and general aviation sectors. The average age of general aviation aircraft is 35 years, expected to increase to 50 years by 2020. Several accidents have been linked to aging aircraft structures and component failures. The AOPA has opposed specific aging aircraft inspection programs, citing concerns about costs and lack of data on the impact of age-related issues on specific aircraft models. The AOPA advocates for individual operators to adopt best practices for maintaining and inspecting aircraft to reduce maintenance-related crashes. The FAA is considering a more proactive approach to address age-related effects in the general aviation fleet to prevent catastrophic failures. Congress may discuss implementing formal inspection programs to assess the impact of aging on general aviation aircraft. Advocates for general aviation operators, like the AOPA, are concerned about the potential imposition of aircraft life limits on vintage airplanes. Congress may debate the costs and benefits of aging aircraft inspections and the scope of applying these measures across all sectors of aviation during FAA reauthorization. Large cargo carriers like FedEx and UPS operate under less stringent rules compared to passenger airlines, with exemptions from typical operating requirements. Smaller regional freight haulers also have less strict requirements, allowing air cargo pilots to work longer hours. Air cargo pilots have more direct responsibility for safety-critical aspects of flights, including assessing weather and airport conditions. They often work longer hours during late-night and early-morning periods, increasing susceptibility to fatigue. Cargo pilots face pressures to maintain delivery schedules, leading to competing safety considerations regarding weather and airport conditions. Additionally, they frequently operate in night conditions, with smaller operators often making safety-critical decisions independently. Airports may lack adequate air rescue and firefighting equipment for emergencies involving all-cargo aircraft, especially during late-night and early-morning operations. The FAA's hands are tied due to regulations focused on scheduled passenger operations, leading stakeholders to seek clarification from Congress. This could become an issue during airport reauthorization, as highlighted by the Air Line Pilot Association's \"One Level of Safety\" initiative. The Air Line Pilot Association (ALPA) is advocating for changes in air cargo industry regulations to align them with passenger airline standards under the \"One Level of Safety\" initiative. ALPA is specifically addressing pilot fatigue concerns by recommending lower flight and duty limits for all-cargo operations, especially during late-night flights and long-haul trips. Additionally, ALPA is highlighting safety issues related to the transportation of hazardous materials in cargo planes. HAZMAT poses unique challenges for firefighters in cargo aircraft crashes and flight environments. Undeclared HAZMAT is a concern, with solutions including better information dissemination to shippers and improved screening at origin points. Regulation of HAZMAT carriage involves the FAA, PHMSA, and USPS, with the TSA playing a growing role in cargo screening. Inconsistencies in HAZMAT regulations enforcement have frustrated the industry. The regulation of HAZMAT carriage and handling, including concerns about loading, crew training, and lithium batteries, is a key issue for Congress during FAA reauthorization debates. Recent incidents, like an in-flight fire involving lithium batteries on a UPS cargo plane, highlight the importance of standardized security procedures and improved screening for all-cargo operations. Flight crews also raise concerns about information and training regarding HAZMAT handling. The NTSB held a hearing on an in-flight fire on a UPS DC-8 cargo plane in Philadelphia in 2006. Concerns about lithium batteries were raised after a previous incident in 1999. Recommendations were made to assess fire hazards, ban lithium battery shipments on passenger aircraft, and require proper labeling. The DOT banned primary shipments of lithium batteries on passenger planes and ALPA recommended banning bulk shipments on all-cargo aircraft. The DOT banned bulk shipments of lithium batteries on all-cargo aircraft due to fire risks. Congress may consider more detailed safety assessments for shipments containing lithium batteries. Several air carrier accidents have been linked to improper loading practices. Improper cargo handling practices, such as improperly distributing loads and inadequately securing freight, can lead to weight shifts during flight and damage to aircraft. The NTSB has called for improved oversight of loading procedures, but pilots often cannot observe the process. ALPA suggests incorporating industry best practices into universal standard operating procedures and implementing better training, supervision, and certification requirements for cargo handlers to improve safety. Establishing certification requirements for loadmasters would improve safety. The NTSB recommends drug and alcohol testing for cargo handlers, load planners, and ramp supervisors. These recommendations may be debated in Congress during the FAA reauthorization process. Congress previously directed the FAA to establish a research program on airliner cabin air quality and incident reporting. However, experts doubt the FAA's planned actions will address these recommendations adequately. Public health concerns over the spread of infectious diseases on commercial airline flights, such as avian influenza, may also be elevated during the reauthorization process. Additionally, issues related to rapidly changing cell phone and wireless technology are also being considered. During the FAA reauthorization process, debates continue on allowing cell phone use on flights and whether infants should be restrained in child restraints. Safety concerns and public health issues related to airliner cabin safety are also being discussed. During FAA reauthorization debates in Congress, concerns about airliner cabin safety, comfort, and public health are being addressed. Congress has mandated studies on cabin air quality and health effects, leading to FAA monitoring of ozone levels, pesticide exposure, and contaminants in cabin air. The 2004 GAO study found that while the FAA was making progress in addressing cabin air quality, more steps were needed to fully assess air quality, conduct surveillance of the air carrier fleet, evaluate the costs and benefits of air filtration, and inform the public about health risks. The study concluded that additional research would likely be necessary to fully understand the potential health effects of airliner cabin environments. The GAO found that while HEPA filters are recommended for larger aircraft, they are not commonly used in commuter aircraft. Retrofitting smaller aircraft with filters could be costly, and further cost-benefit analyses are needed. Concerns over air quality and infectious disease spread on aircraft may prompt action. Research efforts are focused on screening and detection methods, as well as decontamination techniques to control the spread of infectious diseases like avian flu in the aircraft cabin. The Center of Excellence for Airliner Cabin Environmental Research (ACER) is federally funded and leading these efforts. Congress may examine these research initiatives in the current reauthorization process. In the current reauthorization process, Congress may assess the adequacy of the federally funded research efforts by Auburn University on screening and detection methods for infectious diseases in airliner cabins. Potential policy considerations to improve the US response to disease outbreaks may be identified, including the impact of air travel restrictions during pandemics. Recent medical findings suggest that the slowdown in air travel post-9/11 delayed the onset of the flu season by two weeks. Experts caution that travel restrictions may not be an effective long-term strategy for mitigating flu outbreaks, as observed during a previous year when a slowdown in air travel post-9/11 only delayed the onset of the flu season by about two weeks. Implementing travel restrictions could have significant economic implications for airlines and pose challenges in screening infected individuals, especially those not showing symptoms. Additionally, there are concerns about privacy issues and potential interference with avionics equipment from cell phone use aboard aircraft. Interference to avionics equipment from cell phone signals can be mitigated by ensuring cell phones transmit at low power. The pico cell concept aims to achieve this by forcing active cell phones to transmit at low power. However, there are concerns about additive power outputs from multiple devices on aircraft and the lack of safeguards to prevent excessive transmissions. Other portable electronic devices like laptops and PDAs have historically posed less concern for interference. A new breed of intentional transmitters in portable electronic devices, using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth\u00ae protocols, is a growing concern for potential RF emissions on commercial aircraft. Researchers found that cell phone calls are regularly made in violation of regulations, raising safety concerns about spurious emissions from various PEDs. Emissions from portable electronic devices, particularly cell phones, are a safety concern for aircraft navigation systems. GPS receivers are most at risk for interference, as they are crucial for aerial navigation. The FAA allows individual airlines to determine which PEDs are safe for use, with cell phones being banned. However, most consumer PEDs are generally permissible. The rapid advancement of wireless technologies has outpaced research on their potential to interfere with aircraft systems. Protection of avionics from interference is crucial as aircraft systems become more integrated with technologies like ADS-B and GPS. Safety concerns may conflict with passenger demand for in-flight wireless communication. Congress may need to assess safety implications of RF emitting devices on aircraft and establish clearer safety standards. Defined safety standards and monitoring capabilities for assessing RF interference and reporting suspected interference with aircraft systems. Lithium batteries in carry-on electronic devices pose a fire hazard, but fires in accessible cabin areas are quickly detected. Any fire during flight poses a significant threat to cabin occupants. Prohibitions against carrying PEDs with lithium batteries on aircraft are unpopular due to their common use. During reauthorization, Congress may consider closer collaboration between the FAA and other government entities to minimize risks from consumer PEDs. The lack of regulations for restraining children under two in airliner cabins has been a point of contention between the FAA and NTSB. The FAA has resisted issuing child restraint requirements despite NTSB recommendations since 1995. The FAA withdrew a proposed rule in 2005, citing concerns that requiring a seat for young children would lead families to drive instead of fly. The NTSB believes all aircraft occupants, including infants and small children, should be restrained during takeoff, landing, and turbulence with a system tailored to their size. They question the validity of not mandating child restraints for those under two years old, despite airlines fearing revenue loss from families choosing to drive instead of fly. The FAA encourages voluntary compliance with child restraint recommendations, promoting safe practices. Congress has allowed the FAA to pursue regulatory options, but debate continues on improving child safety in airliner cabins. Options to increase the use of child restraints on aircraft, including public education and incentives for airlines, may be debated in the current FAA reauthorization process, alongside growing policy interest in alternative fuel sources for aviation. Debate in Congress over FAA reauthorization may focus on aircraft emissions policies and noise reduction. The key issue is whether industry demand for fuel-efficient aircraft will be enough to reduce emissions or if stricter policies are necessary. Discussions may also center on the effectiveness of quiet aircraft technologies in reducing noise levels. Recently, high oil prices have led to increased interest in reducing fuel consumption in aviation to lower air emissions. Efforts are focused on improving fuel efficiency of jet aircraft and exploring alternatives to petroleum fuels, as 99% of civilian aviation fuel in the US is jet fuel. Synthetic diesel fuel, derived from natural gas or biological oils, can potentially be used as blending components or direct substitutes for conventional jet fuel. However, there are cost and technical barriers, such as issues with reliability, safety, and performance. For example, biodiesel freezes at higher temperatures than conventional jet fuel, posing challenges in high-altitude, low temperature environments. Research is ongoing to explore additives that could address this issue. The U.S. Department of Defense and the Air Force are interested in alternative jet fuel supplies, aiming to use a single fuel, JP-8, for all battlefield operations. The Air Force is testing a blend of GTL and JP-8 in a B-52 bomber, exploring additives to lower freezing points and maintain fuel temperature. In September 2006, the Air Force tested a blend of GTL and JP-8 in a B-52 bomber. If successful, they plan to acquire 100 million gallons of the fuel by 2008. There is interest in expanding the use of ethanol and other alternatives in smaller piston engine planes. Research is ongoing on new engine technologies. Research is ongoing on new engine technologies to incorporate alternative fuels and engines in aviation. Alternative fuel airport service vehicles, such as natural gas, propane, and electric vehicles, are widely used for ground services. These vehicles are chosen for air quality purposes and can lead to cost reductions. They are often included in State Implementation Plans under the Clean Air Act to improve air quality in non-compliant areas. State and federal funding are available for airports to purchase alternative fuel vehicles and install fueling infrastructure to support them. Vision 100 allows passenger facility fees to be used for low-emissions airport vehicles and equipment, with a cost limit compared to non-low-emission vehicles. Congress may review how airports utilize this provision during reauthorization debates. The provision in Vision 100 allows airports to use passenger facility fees for low-emission vehicles. Aircraft contribute to air pollution by not meeting air quality standards and emitting greenhouse gases. Emissions are concentrated at airports in major cities, leading to the need to reduce nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds to improve air quality. Aircraft and ground support equipment contribute to air pollution by emitting nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon monoxide at airports. In the Dallas-Fort Worth area, aircraft were estimated to produce 3% of NOx and 5% of carbon monoxide, while ground support equipment accounted for nearly 3% of NOx. When combined, the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport was responsible for 6% of nitrogen oxides in the metropolitan area. Auxiliary power units at terminals also contribute significantly to emissions. Aircraft and airport operations are significant sources of emissions, with aircraft emissions at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport representing a high end estimate. In comparison, Boston's Logan Airport emissions contribute less than 1% to the area. As air traffic grows, aircraft emissions are expected to increase, as they are not subjected to stringent controls like other mobile sources. Emission standards for aircraft are typically imposed after agreement with the International Civil Aviation Organization. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) imposes emission standards for aircraft, with a 20% reduction in NOx emissions by the end of 1999 and a further 16% by the end of 2003. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets these standards, not the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), to ensure progress is maintained without burdening manufacturers. Aircraft emission standards are unlikely to be a major focus in FAA reauthorization. The FAA has the authority to control aircraft emissions through legislation reauthorizing FAA, which could raise jurisdictional issues. Airport operations are more likely to be addressed in an FAA bill. Several airports have implemented programs to require the use of alternative fuels in ground support equipment. The electrification of airport gates is also being considered to reduce emissions. The Voluntary Airport Low Emissions (VALE) program allows airport sponsors to finance low emission vehicles using grants and funds. The Voluntary Airport Low Emissions (VALE) program allows airport sponsors to use grants and Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) funds for low emission vehicles, refueling stations, gate electrification, and other air quality improvements. VALE funding is limited to capital improvements and cannot cover operational costs like fuel purchases. PFC funds have a broader range of uses compared to VALE, allowing for clean conventional fuels. VALE funding is restricted to the cost difference between low-emission and conventional vehicles. Considerations for reauthorization include retaining, changing, or eliminating these restrictions. Aircraft emissions play a larger role in global climate change than ground-level pollution. Aircraft emissions are a significant contributor to global climate change, estimated to contribute about 3.5% of total radiative forcing by human activities. The United States is not part of the Kyoto Protocol, but its trading partners are considering measures to reduce airline emissions. Pressure is mounting to develop more fuel-efficient and lower-emission aircraft. The FAA bill's role in these efforts is uncertain. Significant reductions in noise emissions from civil jet airliners have been achieved since the early 1960s, with efforts to mitigate community noise exposure around airports. The United States has seen a decrease in the number of people exposed to significant noise levels, from 7 million in 1975 to less than 400,000 today. However, the country faces a crossroads in public policy towards aircraft noise mitigation, as experts predict a slowdown in noise reduction technology due to diminishing gains, potentially offset by increased air travel demand and population growth if policies remain unchanged. Policymakers face challenges in allocating budgets for noise reduction technology and mitigation efforts to address aircraft noise impacts on communities. There are debates on the effectiveness of noise reduction technology versus community-based mitigation strategies. Some question the feasibility of significant advancements in noise reduction technology, while others suggest setting realistic goals for reducing aircraft noise levels in the future. NASA has set ambitious goals to cut aircraft noise in half from 1997 baseline levels by 2007 and in half again by 2022. Technological advancements for noise reduction may depend on funding for aircraft noise technology programs, which are seen as high risk due to uncertainty in achieving significant advancements. Aircraft noise reduction technologies have been driven by national and international noise standards. Current Stage 3 noise standards were phased-in by the FAA to meet the mandate of the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990. Aircraft operators were required to transition to 100% Stage 3 compliant aircraft operations by 2000 for aircraft weighing 75,000 pounds or more. Stage 3 aircraft are quieter than earlier generation Stage 2 aircraft, with significant reductions in noise levels for 2-engine aircraft weighing between 125,000 and 600,000 pounds. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and FAA implemented more stringent noise standards for new aircraft designs, known as Chapter 4 and Stage 4 regulations respectively. Stage 4 requirements mandate noise levels to be three to four decibels lower than Stage 3 levels for all measurements, and two decibels lower for each noise certification configuration. These regulations only apply to new aircraft designs, but many modern aircraft like the Boeing 777 and Airbus A-340 already meet Stage 4 requirements. The federal government has supported aviation noise reduction technology through NASA's quiet aircraft technology (QAT) program. The program aims to reduce aircraft noise by 10 decibels by 2007 and another 10 decibels by 2022, keeping aggregate aircraft noise below a 65 decibel day-night average sound level (DNL) outside airport boundaries. NASA's QAT program focuses on technical solutions to reduce aircraft noise emissions and their impacts on residential communities. The federal government supports aviation noise reduction technology through NASA's quiet aircraft technology (QAT) program. This program aims to reduce aircraft noise through various technologies such as active noise reduction for turbine engines, engine fan blade and exhaust nozzle designs, and improved landing gear fairings. Additionally, the FAA has established a Center of Excellence in Aircraft Noise and Aviation Emissions Mitigation, led by Massachusetts Institute of Technology and involving seven other universities and 29 industry partners. The program has ongoing projects focusing on various aspects of noise reduction and policy options. The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) addresses airport noise mitigation policy through Title 14 CFR Part 150 and Part 161 processes. These regulations involve assessing noise levels, establishing noise compatibility programs, implementing noise-based access restrictions at airports, and making modifications to airspace management and noise abatement procedures. The FAA has formal procedures for addressing airport noise issues, including assessing noise levels, establishing noise compatibility programs, and implementing noise-based access restrictions. Compliance with Title 14 CFR Part 150 is required for federal funding of noise mitigation programs at airports. Part 150 outlines FAA compliance with NEPA and related statutes for noise exposure maps and compatibility programs at airports. It involves creating noise exposure maps, developing noise compatibility programs, and engaging in public participation for agreed-upon solutions. The FAA's Part 150 involves creating noise exposure maps, developing noise compatibility programs, and engaging in public participation for agreed-upon solutions. It aims to establish feasible noise reduction techniques and land use controls to confine noise levels within airport boundaries and maintain compatible land uses. Close cooperation with local officials is necessary to achieve compatible land uses due to the local nature of land use zoning. Having a Part 150 noise compatibility program serves as a guideline for zoning, but does not establish formal requirements or obligations regarding land use. The FAA's Part 150 program involves creating noise exposure maps and developing noise compatibility programs to control noise levels within airport boundaries. Local authorities are responsible for determining acceptable land uses, with a DNL of 65 or above considered incompatible with residential use and schools. Adhering to FAA guidelines for land use zoning is recommended but not obligatory. The ANCA mandates a national aviation noise policy for airports, limiting Stage 3 aircraft restrictions to those agreed upon by the airport and operators or approved by the FAA. Proposed restrictions must have substantial evidence of reasonableness for approval. The ANCA mandates a national aviation noise policy for airports, limiting Stage 3 aircraft restrictions to those agreed upon by the airport and operators or approved by the FAA. Restrictions on noisier Stage 2 aircraft were made easier to impose, with requirements for public notice, cost-benefit analysis, and phased elimination by December 31, 1999. The ANCA mandates a national aviation noise policy for airports, limiting Stage 3 aircraft restrictions to those agreed upon by the airport and operators or approved by the FAA. Naples Airport in Florida faced complexities in attaining noise access restrictions, with the FAA denying their proposal to ban all Stage 2 aircraft due to grant obligations. Despite this, Naples Airport proceeded with imposing the ban on Stage 2 aircraft. The Naples Airport challenged the FAA's decision to ban Stage 2 aircraft, leading to a favorable ruling by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Despite the success, justifying Stage 2 bans can be challenging due to the lengthy and costly process, especially when only a small percentage of aircraft are affected. The Part 161 process has proven to be a significant hurdle for airports seeking access restrictions. The Vision 100 Act included a waiver allowing airports with long-term lease agreements with federal agencies to impose restrictions on Stage 2 aircraft under 75,000 pounds. Jackson Hole Airport in Wyoming benefited from this provision to implement a Stage 2 ban within Grand Teton National Park. Jackson Hole Airport implemented a Stage 2 ban on June 28, 2004, under the Vision 100 Act waiver. Airports may seek relief from ANCA requirements and propose modifications to address ambiguities. Existing noise ordinances are grandfathered in but may need to meet federal grant obligations. The FAA may compel airports to justify noise restrictions that receive AIP grants to ensure they do not unfairly discriminate against users. An example is the upheld restriction on Stage 2 aircraft at Van Nuys Airport in California, challenged by the National Business Aircraft Association. The FAA's Part 161 requirements were challenged by the National Business Aircraft Association but upheld in federal court. Some airports have sought to restrict larger aircraft based on pavement load-bearing criteria, not just noise emissions. To address this, the FAA has proposed a policy for justifying airport restrictions. The FAA has proposed a policy for justifying airport restrictions based on pavement strength, separate from noise-related access restrictions. The policy considers pavement load-bearing capacity as a design standard that can occasionally be exceeded, requiring airports to demonstrate the reasonableness of weight-based restrictions. This policy aims to address operator investment in pavement and is not a substitute for noise restrictions. The FAA's proposed policy aims to limit airports' ability to impose weight-based restrictions without justification for improving pavement durability. Teterboro Airport in New Jersey has obtained an exemption to maintain its operational weight limit for aircraft over 100,000 pounds. Noise issues at airports can be addressed through airspace redesign or operational procedure modifications. The FAA's proposed policy aims to limit airports' ability to impose weight-based restrictions without justification for improving pavement durability. Noise issues at airports can be addressed through airspace redesign or operational procedure modifications, such as reconfiguring approach patterns and establishing airport traffic patterns that avoid noise-sensitive areas. Large scale airspace reconfigurations are currently in planning stages in regions like New York-New Jersey-Philadelphia and the Los Angeles Basin, providing an opportunity to address community noise implications. Recourse for seeking modifications to airspace layout or operational procedures may be formally sought through a petition for rulemaking. Implementing steeper, quieter descents is a specific option being studied to reduce community noise levels. Research has shown promise in using steeper approaches to runways for this purpose. This option may be considered as part of a larger Part 150 study or through informal dialogue with the FAA to discuss airspace modifications and operational changes to mitigate noise concerns. Discussions with the FAA can provide insight into viable options and constraints related to safety, efficiency, and traffic flow. Implementing steeper approaches to reduce community noise levels by keeping aircraft at higher altitudes for longer periods and delaying flap extension. Recent testing of Continuous Descent Approach (CDA) procedures yielded noise reductions of three to six decibels on average, with the most substantial reductions seen in communities located seven to 15 miles from the airport. Traffic flow issues may limit implementation of these approaches at specific airports, but further study is warranted to assess their applicability. The FAA faces three major international aviation issues: the \"Open Skies\" agreement with the EU, DOT's rulemaking on foreign ownership of domestic carriers, and the longstanding cabotage issue. Congressional opposition has delayed finalizing rules on these matters. The issue of cabotage, the transportation of passengers or cargo by foreign air carriers within the United States, is generally prohibited by U.S. law. The FAA reauthorization may provide Congress with an opportunity to address international aviation developments. The DOT introduced the \"Open Skies\" initiative in 1992, leading to agreements with countries like the Netherlands, Austria, and Germany. Negotiations are ongoing between the United States and the EU for a new Open Skies Agreement, following a 2002 ruling that previous agreements violated EU law. The proposed agreement would allow EU and U.S. airlines to fly between any city in the EU and the U.S., determine flights, routes, and fares based on market demand, and enter into cooperative arrangements. Some believe that meaningful reform in the international aviation market requires Congress to repeal the \"citizenship test\" limiting foreign ownership. The proposed Open Skies Agreement between the United States and the EU does not address foreign ownership and control of U.S. air carriers. The EU is disappointed with the U.S.'s failure to adopt changes to these rules. Current U.S. law requires air carriers to be owned and controlled by U.S. citizens to operate in the country. The Department of Transportation (DOT) is considering reinterpreting the requirement of \"actual control\" for U.S. airlines, which could potentially allow more foreign investment. There are mixed opinions on this proposal, with some arguing that the term is vague and open to interpretation, while others question the DOT's authority to make such changes. The proposed rulemaking on reinterpreting the requirement of \"actual control\" for U.S. airlines has sparked debate. Some argue it is vague and subject to interpretation, while others question the DOT's authority. Members of Congress have expressed concerns, with bills introduced to delay the final decision. Appropriations riders have also been mentioned. The proposed rulemaking on reinterpreting the requirement of \"actual control\" for U.S. airlines has sparked debate and concerns among members of Congress. Appropriations riders have been drafted to delay the final decision, with ongoing attempts to include language in various bills. Another major issue in international civil aviation law is cabotage, which is currently prohibited for foreign air carriers under the Federal Aviation Act. Congress last amended cabotage laws as part of Vision 100. The cabotage laws were last amended by Congress as part of Vision 100, allowing for limited exceptions for \"eligible cargo\" to be removed from foreign aircraft in Alaska. Foreign aircraft are not permitted to engage in cabotage activities within the United States without specific authorization. Statutory changes would be needed before any liberalization of cabotage rules could be considered in U.S. \"Open Skies\" agreements. The Federal Aviation Act can only be amended by Congress to allow foreign carriers cabotage rights. A glossary of technical terms related to air traffic management and infrastructure is provided for reference during FAA reauthorization debates. This includes terms like Global Positioning System (GPS) for broadcasting aircraft data. The ADS-B system utilizes GPS data for aircraft navigation and surveillance, with ADS-B out transmitting navigation data and ADS-B in receiving signals from other aircraft and ground stations. It is part of the proposed overhaul of the national airspace system to enhance capacity by 2025. The FAA, part of the federal government, is responsible for establishing the blueprint for the NGATS and ensuring interagency cooperation. RNP standards define the required position accuracy for aircraft navigation, allowing for various technologies to meet the standards. RNAV is a navigational performance standard for aircraft that uses WAAS-enabled GPS to establish accurate waypoints in the airspace system, eliminating the need for ground-based navigational stations. DME can serve as a backup for determining aircraft position and following precise flight routes. GPS, with the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), provides highly accurate position and time information for aerial navigation. The system improves GPS data accuracy to within three meters horizontally and vertically, enabling precise flight paths and approaches. FAA certified for primary navigational guidance, allowing aircraft to descend as low as 200 feet above ground. The proposed system for aviation data sharing, known as SWIM, aims to create a seamless infrastructure for real-time exchange of operational information such as flight plans, weather, and airport conditions. It will replace current cumbersome databases and communication protocols, allowing authorized users to access needed data easily. SWIM will function like the World Wide Web, sharing data across the entire airspace system."
