Interest in electrifying passenger vehicles has increased in major industrial countries like the United States, Europe, and China. Despite technological advancements, electric vehicles remain more expensive than traditional vehicles. Governments worldwide have implemented policies to promote the development and sales of electric vehicles. This report focuses on government policies in the United States to support the electrification of light vehicles and transit buses. In 2018, over 92 million light vehicles were sold globally. In 2018, over 92 million light vehicles were sold globally, with China, Europe, and the United States being the largest markets. The global market for electrified vehicles saw significant growth, with more than 2 million plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles sold worldwide. Electric vehicles accounted for about 2% of all passenger vehicle sales, with demand expected to continue increasing. China leads in the market for urban transit buses, with a significant number of electric buses in service. In 2017, China added 384,000 electric buses to its fleet, making it the largest electric bus market globally. In the EU, 200 electric buses were sold, totaling 1,700 in service, while the US saw 100 electric buses sold, totaling 300. Two types of electric vehicles are in use: Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and plug-in electric vehicles, with different charging methods. The electrification of vehicles has been limited by high battery production costs, limited range, and charging time/location issues. In 2018, over 361,000 plug-in electric passenger vehicles were sold in the US, along with 341,000 hybrid electric vehicles. In 2018, total sales of plug-in vehicles exceeded sales of hybrids for the first time. Tesla and Toyota had the highest number of vehicle sales, with over 1 million plug-in vehicles sold since 2010. The plug-in hybrid and battery electric share of the U.S. light vehicle market in 2018 was 2.1%. The high price of new electric vehicles hinders faster adoption, with the Nissan Leaf priced at $29,990 compared to the Nissan Sentra at $17,990. The federal government supports vehicle electrification through tax incentives for vehicle purchases and infrastructure construction. Research and development investments aim to reduce battery costs, increase vehicle range, and decrease charging times. Two types of tax incentives promote electric vehicles: consumer incentives for vehicle purchases and incentives for installing charging stations. Electric vehicles are more expensive due to the high cost of lithium-ion batteries. The federal government provides tax incentives for electric vehicles and charging stations. The tax credit for plug-in electric vehicles ranges from $2,500 to $7,500 per vehicle based on battery capacity. The credit phases out after a manufacturer sells 200,000 qualifying vehicles in the US. General Motors and Tesla have reached this limit. Tax credits for electric vehicles are phasing down as manufacturers reach the 200,000-vehicle limit. Studies show that tax incentives increase EV purchases, but some argue that credits may be claimed for purchases that would have happened anyway. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates a $7.5 billion reduction in federal tax revenues from the plug-in electric vehicle credit between FY2018 and FY2022, with higher-income taxpayers benefiting the most. Legislation in the 116th Congress aims to modify the plug-in electric vehicle tax credit. Some bills propose expanding the credit, such as the Driving America Forward Act and the Electric CARS Act of 2019. Other proposals suggest eliminating the credit, like the Fairness for Every Driver Act. The tax credit for alternative fuel vehicle refueling property (IRC \u00a730C) expired in 2017 and could be eliminated by H.R. 1027. The credit was 30% of the cost of qualified property, with limits for businesses and individuals. It included electric charging infrastructure and clean-fuel refueling property. The credit has been temporary since 2005 and has been extended six times, often retroactively. The Electric CARS Act of 2019 aims to extend the tax credit for electric vehicle infrastructure through 2029, potentially reducing federal tax revenues. Expanding the credit to include all qualifying property could further decrease federal revenue by an estimated $332 million between FY2018 and FY2027. The Electric CARS Act of 2019 aims to extend the tax credit for electric vehicle infrastructure through 2029. Level 2 charging at homes and workplaces could be a cost-effective solution, but for long-distance trips, a network of Level 3 DCFC chargers is necessary. Tax incentives reflecting the differences in costs and benefits between Level 2 and DCFC chargers could be beneficial. Access to DCFC infrastructure may have strong network benefits, driving demand for electric vehicles. Tax credits could be used to incentivize investments in public DCFC infrastructure over Level 2 charging stations to promote greater EV use. Storage incentives, such as tax credits for on-site battery storage systems, could also support EV infrastructure. The Energy Storage Tax Incentive and Deployment Act of 2019 offers investment credits for energy storage use. Tax-preferred bond financing options could be utilized for EV infrastructure investment, including state and local financing using tax-exempt bonds for EV charging projects. Tax-exempt bonds can be used for EV charging projects classified as serving a \"public purpose.\" A federal infrastructure bank or \"green bank\" could also support EV infrastructure investment through tax-favored bonds. The Highway Trust Fund, funded by motor fuel taxes, has seen a decrease in revenues compared to spending, leading to general fund transfers to keep the fund solvent. Electric vehicles do not burn motor fuels, so users do not contribute to the fund through fuel taxes. Legislation in the 116th Congress, the Fairness for Every Driver Act, proposes imposing an annual fee on alternative-technology vehicles like electric vehicles to compensate for not paying fuel excise taxes. This fee would increase the cost of ownership, but the impact on total vehicle cost would likely be minimal. Investment in transportation electrification R&D, including funding for battery R&D and construction of battery manufacturing plants, has been a national goal. Despite the Trump Administration's proposed funding reductions for vehicle technologies R&D, Congress increased funding levels for electric vehicles and charging infrastructure through the DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable. The DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) administers sustainable transportation R&D programs, including electric vehicles and charging infrastructure. Legislative proposals like the Vehicle Innovation Act of 2019 aim to support R&D for innovative vehicle technologies. Funding for electric vehicle technologies R&D is provided through annual appropriations to EERE. The Trump Administration's budget request for EERE in FY2020 was significantly lower than in FY2019. The budget request for EERE in FY2020 was $343 million, 86% less than FY2019. It focuses on early-stage R&D and private sector funding for later-stage research. $73.4 million is allocated to vehicle technologies, 79% less than FY2019. The FY2019 joint explanatory statement supported various vehicle technologies for transportation electrification research. The FY2020 DOE budget request includes funding for vehicle electrification research priorities such as new battery technologies to reduce costs, increase vehicle range to 300 miles, and advance fast charging capabilities. The FY2020 DOE budget request aims to reduce battery costs to $80/kWh, increase vehicle range to 300 miles, and decrease charge time to 15 minutes by 2028. Funding would prioritize early-stage activities, including critical materials-free battery technologies, while eliminating support for battery safety testing and Clean Cities coalition activities. The Clean Cities program supports local efforts to reduce petroleum use in transportation through funding transportation projects nationwide. The Clean Cities program supports EVs through local showcases promoting plug-in electric vehicle use. Congress directed DOE to continue supporting Clean Cities for alternative fuel deployment. The Trump Administration proposed cutting funding for Clean Cities in the FY2020 budget. In the 116th Congress, bills H.R. 2616 and S. 674 propose competitive grant programs for electric vehicle charging infrastructure. State and local governments, along with private entities, play a crucial role in building a reliable network of charging stations to support the purchase of electric vehicles. The FAST Act requires the Department of Transportation to designate national alternative fuel corridors by 2020 to promote the use of electricity, hydrogen, propane, and natural gas for vehicles. The Federal Highway Administration is working on AFC designations on interstate corridors. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is working with state and local officials and industry groups to designate alternative fuel corridors (AFC) on interstate highways. AFC designations categorize highways as either \"corridor ready\" or \"corridor pending\" based on the availability of fueling stations. FHWA aims to establish EV charging stations at 50-mile intervals with Level 3 DC Fast Charge infrastructure. They have developed standardized AFC signage, promoted public education, and encouraged regional cooperation in planning new fueling networks. FHWA has conducted three rounds of AFC nominations, prioritizing building out alternative corridors on heavily traveled Interstates like I-95 and I-80. Their goal is to secure nominations for areas targeted for EV investments. The Federal Highway Administration is working on designating alternative fuel corridors on interstate highways to establish EV charging stations at 50-mile intervals. Signage and installation of fueling infrastructure along these corridors are eligible expenses under FHWA's CMAQ Program. Public transportation agencies are increasingly interested in electric buses to replace diesel vehicles, especially in metropolitan areas with air quality issues. Interest in purchasing buses is high in metropolitan areas with air quality issues. The Federal Transit Administration supports transit agencies in buying buses, with funds available for various bus technologies. Transit buses typically operate on short fixed routes with frequent stops. In 1996, 95% of buses ran on diesel fuel, but more recently, buses fueled by compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, and biodiesel have been integrated into fleets. The use of lower-emission hybrid buses, including diesel buses with electric motors, has also increased since the last recession. Electric buses, with a smaller internal combustion engine and regenerative braking systems, offer greater range and emission reduction compared to diesel buses. Despite being more expensive to purchase and requiring infrastructure investment, major transit systems in the US plan to transition to zero-emission bus fleets by 2030-2040. Electric buses are quieter than traditional vehicles. Electric buses are quieter and have lower operating costs due to the absence of engines and transmissions. They can travel over 200 miles on one charge but still fall short of the range of conventional buses. A study by Carnegie Mellon University found that electric buses have lower total costs over a 12-year life cycle when considering social costs. They are eligible for FTA funding, including the Low-No program for low or no emission vehicles. The FTA bus program includes the Low-No program, which funds zero-emission and low-emission transit buses and supporting facilities. Electric buses are purchased through this program, with mandatory spending of $55 million per year authorized in the FAST Act. School buses, primarily funded locally, can benefit from the EPA's School Bus Rebate Program to reduce diesel emissions. Legislative proposals in the 116th Congress aim to support vehicle fleet electrification, including transit buses. The Green Bus Act of 2019 (H.R. 2164) and the FLEET Act (H.R. 2337) aim to support vehicle fleet electrification, requiring zero-emission buses for public transportation and authorizing the purchase of low-emission vehicles and infrastructure. Volkswagen Group settled Clean Air Act violations in 2016, pledging support for vehicle electrification. Volkswagen settled Clean Air Act violations in 2016 by investing $2 billion in zero-emissions vehicle infrastructure and education. $800 million is designated for California, and a $2.7 billion Environmental Mitigation Trust was established to mitigate the impact of excess diesel emissions. States can use funds for bus electrification. The first fuel economy standards were enacted in 1975 in response to the oil embargo. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) enforces Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for cars and trucks, set at 35 mpg by 2020. EPA regulates greenhouse gas emissions and collaborated with NHTSA to establish stricter CAFE/GHG standards aiming for nearly 50 mpg by 2025. The Trump Administration plans to maintain current standards through 2026 due to economic and technological changes. The EPA stated in 2018 that achieving goals for MY2026 would require more vehicle electrification than anticipated, rejecting previous assumptions about EV sales growth. Fully autonomous vehicles offer safer transportation and new mobility options, but their emergence timeline varies. The emergence of fully autonomous vehicles with electric motors is uncertain due to the lack of policies favoring EVs. Ford and Volvo have chosen to retain internal combustion engines for their ride-sharing ventures due to the expense, inconvenience, and battery life issues of electric vehicles. The drawbacks of using fast charging for electric vehicles include faster battery degradation and high energy intensity for autonomous driving systems. However, the advantages of electrification, such as compatibility with electronic components, lower operating costs, and reduced emissions, make electric vehicles a more attractive power source for autonomous vehicles. The power demands of autonomous vehicle equipment and computers will reduce the fuel economy of gasoline and diesel vehicles and increase emissions. Increased power requirements will raise emissions from combustion vehicles by over 60 grams of CO2 equivalent per mile, equal to reducing fuel economy of a 35 mpg vehicle to 29 mpg. Switching to electricity would diminish direct emissions. Incentives for electric vehicles vary by state, with 45 states and the District of Columbia offering incentives for certain hybrid or electric vehicles. Incentives for electric and hybrid vehicles include solo driver access to carpool lanes, tax credits, rebates, reduced registration fees, parking exemptions, and tax credits for home or business chargers. These incentives have varying effectiveness, with rebates being the most effective due to their clear value at the time of purchase. California Air Resources Board regulations in 1990 mandated automakers to sell light vehicles meeting low-emission standards in the state. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) established vehicle regulations in 1990, requiring automakers to sell light vehicles in the state that meet cleaner emissions standards. This includes the Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) program, which focuses on battery electric, plug-in hybrid electric, and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. ZEV sales percentages are set through a credit system, increasing annually to 2025. Nine other states have adopted these regulations, representing over one-third of U.S. new light vehicle sales. Electric utilities play a key role in integrating electric vehicles into the grid. Electric utilities are key in integrating EVs into the grid by offering incentives for off-peak charging and potentially installing public charging infrastructure. Regulatory barriers hinder electrification progress, but utilities see EVs as a growth opportunity. They may invest in EV infrastructure and support consumer adoption, possibly extending tax credits. The industry faces challenges due to slow energy demand growth. The challenges of providing tax incentives for EV infrastructure to utilities, cooperatives, and municipal power providers in the United States due to limited options for federal tax benefits. Incentives may need to be tailored to utilities or other electricity suppliers based on state regulations. In the United States, federal tax incentives for utilities to invest in EV infrastructure may provide a limited near-term incentive due to state regulations governing the sale of electricity for charging EVs. State regulatory commissions establish prices for utilities, and tax incentives may result in lower rates for electricity customers rather than higher returns for utilities. In the United States, state regulatory commissions govern the retail sale of electricity for charging electric vehicles. Electric vehicle charging station operators may be considered electric utilities under federal law, raising questions about the need for regulatory reform to address this new class of electricity transactions. States in the US have taken various approaches to regulate operators of electric vehicle charging stations, with some issuing guidelines for regulated utilities to operate them separately, while others limit operation to electric distribution utilities or exempt operators from public utility regulations. This raises questions about which regulatory agency is responsible for overseeing these operators. Some states in the US have refrained from regulating electric vehicle charging station operators, leading to uncertainty about how they will be regulated. This lack of clarity could hinder the spread of technology in these states. Operators may avoid regulation by providing free charging services or charging customers by the minute instead of by electricity usage. The regulatory framework for EV charging stations can impact the deployment of charging infrastructure. The federal government's role in regulating EV charging services may be limited by state jurisdiction over retail electricity transactions. Electric vehicle batteries could be used for vehicle-to-grid (V2G) storage, allowing them to provide grid services like demand response. Utilities in the US are testing V2G performance in demonstration projects, facing challenges in regulation, market, and end-user acceptance."
