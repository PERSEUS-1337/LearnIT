Section 1363 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to require health plans to provide disclosure forms with information on benefits, services, and contract terms in a clear and organized manner for public understanding. The director may standardize the presentation of materials to aid in plan comparisons. The disclosure form for health plans must include key details such as the principal benefits, coverage for acute and subacute care, exceptions, premium cost, copayments, renewability terms, and any potential changes in premiums. The disclosure form for health plans should state that it is a summary only and that the plan contract itself should be consulted for governing provisions. It must also include a notice stating that the evidence of coverage discloses the terms and conditions of coverage, and that applicants have the right to view the evidence of coverage prior to enrollment. The disclosure form for health plans should include a statement emphasizing the importance of reading it carefully, providing contact information for additional inquiries, specifying where to find the benefits and coverage matrix, and ensuring that the text is displayed prominently on the page. The disclosure form for health plans should include information on when benefits cease due to nonpayment, provider choice options, provisions required by law, use of arbitration for dispute resolution, and the process for authorizing health care services.

As of July 1, 1999, plans offering contracts to individuals or small groups must provide a uniform health plan benefits and coverage matrix with key provisions for comparison. The matrix includes categories like deductibles, lifetime maximums, professional services, outpatient services, hospitalization, emergency coverage, ambulance services, prescription drugs, durable medical equipment, mental health, chemical dependency, home health services, and others.

The matrix is a summary for comparing coverage benefits. Consult the evidence of coverage and plan contract for detailed information. A health care service plan contract must provide a uniform summary of benefits and coverage as required by federal law. The plan must also ensure that all benefit disclosure requirements are met in other documents provided to enrollees. The health care service plan contract must inform applicants and enrollees that they are not financially responsible for emergency care services beyond copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles. Starting October 1, 2016, the uniform summary of benefits and coverage is a vital document for Section 1367.04. By July 1, 2016, the department will provide written translations of the template for all language groups identified by the State Department of Health Care Services, except those already translated by the United States Department of Labor. These translations will be available on the department's website. (c) Subdivision (c) does not apply to health care service plan contracts under subparagraph (A). Plans can use footnotes or disclaimers to clarify coverage arrangements. Plans must provide a disclosure form to individuals when presenting a plan contract for examination or sale. For group contracts, the disclosure form and evidence of coverage must be given to the contractholder upon delivery of the plan agreement. Group contractholders must distribute disclosure forms to all eligible subscribers and provide evidence of coverage upon request. In case of conflicts, the evidence of coverage prevails over the group contract terms. In addition to required disclosures, health care plans must disclose premium costs to health services ratio to individual purchasers or small groups. Coverage for Medi-Cal or Medicare programs is exempt. The commissioner must create a standard supplemental disclosure form for disability insurance policies by April 1, 1975.

On January 1, 2014, disability insurers must provide a uniform summary of benefits and coverage as required by federal law. Insurers must ensure all necessary disclosures are met in other policy documents and submit the summary to the commissioner along with the health insurance policy. Starting October 1, 2016, the uniform summary of benefits and coverage is a crucial document. By July 1, 2016, the commissioner must provide translations in various languages for the template. These translations will be available on the commissioner's website. The United States Department of Labor may provide translations in various languages for the template. The disclosure form can be included with the evidence of coverage or policy. No reimbursement is required by this act as it creates new crimes or infractions."
