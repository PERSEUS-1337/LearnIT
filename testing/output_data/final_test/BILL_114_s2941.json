    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Women and Lung Cancer Research and Preventive Services Act of 2016\". It includes findings related to lung cancer. Congress finds that lung cancer is a significant health issue for women in the United States, with an average of 198 women dying each day from the disease. It is the leading cause of cancer death among women, surpassing other types of cancer such as breast, ovarian, cervical, uterine, and other gynecologic cancers. Additionally, two-thirds of never-smokers diagnosed with lung cancer are women, highlighting the importance of research and preventive services for this population. Women smokers have a significantly higher risk of developing lung cancer compared to non-smokers, with the risk increasing tenfold between 1965 and 2010. Women are also more likely than men to be diagnosed with lung cancer at a young age. Those with BRCA2 mutations, typically associated with breast cancer, have a 1 in 4 risk of developing lung cancer. The Government Accountability Office has called for more research on gender differences in lung cancer. Additional research and clinical trials are needed to understand the differences in risk factors, incidence, and treatment response in women, especially those who have never smoked. Lung cancer screening for high-risk individuals is cost-effective and can be safely conducted in community hospital settings. The technology used for lung cancer screening could also be utilized for early detection of breast and heart issues. Early detection of breast, heart, and lung diseases is crucial as they account for over 50% of deaths among women in the US. Public health campaigns should emphasize the impact of lung cancer on women and the importance of early detection. The sense of Congress is that there is a disparate impact of lung cancer on women, especially those who have never smoked. Additional research on women's lung cancer risk factors, incidence, histology, and treatment response is necessary. Accelerating preventive services for women and coordinating public education programs on early detection are also important. Study to evaluate and recommend acceleration of research on women and lung cancer, increase access to preventive services, and enhance public awareness and education campaigns. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of Veterans Affairs, will conduct a study to evaluate research on women and lung cancer, improve access to preventive services, and enhance public awareness campaigns. The study will include a review of previous research outcomes, existing activities, and knowledge gaps, as well as recommendations for a collaborative research program. The study aims to encourage innovative research approaches, evaluate factors related to lung cancer in women, advance imaging technology, develop a national screening strategy, and create a public education campaign on women and lung cancer. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will submit a report to Congress within 180 days after the enactment of the Act, focusing on the public education and awareness campaign on women and lung cancer, as well as the importance of early detection."
