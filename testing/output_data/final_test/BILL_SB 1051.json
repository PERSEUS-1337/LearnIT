    "title": "SB 1051",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 40240 of the Vehicle Code is amended to allow the City and County of San Francisco and the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District to install automated parking control devices on public transit vehicles for video imaging of parking violations in transit-only lanes. Citations can only be issued during posted hours of operation, with devices focused on capturing violations without unnecessary images of other drivers or pedestrians. Prior to issuing parking violation notices, San Francisco and Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District will start a 30-day warning notice program and make a public announcement beforehand. (c) A designated employee of the City and County of San Francisco or a contracted law enforcement agency for the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District can review video recordings to determine parking violations in transit-only lanes. Violations are subject to civil penalties. The registered owner can view the video evidence for free during normal business hours. The video image evidence from automated enforcement devices can be retained for up to six months or 60 days after final disposition of the citation, whichever is later. Records not showing parking violations in transit-only lanes must be destroyed within 15 days. The video image records are confidential and can only be used for authorized purposes by public agencies. The Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District has authority to enforce parking violations in transit-only lanes until January 1, 2022. Definitions for \"local agency\" and \"transit-only traffic lane\" are provided. Section 40240.5 is added to the Vehicle Code, allowing for automated enforcement. Section 40240.5 of the Vehicle Code requires the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District to submit an evaluation report on the automated enforcement system for parking violations in transit-only lanes to the Legislature committees by January 1, 2021. The report must cover effectiveness, privacy impact, implementation cost, and revenue generation. The submission should comply with government codes. A designated employee must issue a notice of parking violation to the vehicle owner within 15 days of the violation. The notice must include details of the violation, payment deadline, and procedures for contesting the citation. It should also specify the date, time, and location of the violation. The notice of parking violation must include the date, time, and location of the violation, vehicle details such as license number and color, and information on how to request a review of the evidence. The notice of parking violation is served by mailing it to the registered owner's address. Proof of mailing must be maintained by the local agency. If the owner pays or contests the violation within a specified timeframe, the penalty will only be the original amount. Within 21 days, a local agency can cancel a parking violation notice if deemed necessary for justice. A written explanation is required for the cancellation. After an administrative hearing, a contestant can appeal for court review. The City and County of San Francisco or the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District may use a private vendor for processing violations, but they must maintain control of the program. The Legislature deems a special law necessary for enforcing parking violations in the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District. Section 1 of the act amends the Vehicle Code, limiting public access to meetings and writings of public officials. The act limits public access to images captured by automated parking control devices on public transit vehicles to protect individual privacy rights."
