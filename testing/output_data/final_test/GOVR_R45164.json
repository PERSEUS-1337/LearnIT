    "content": "The CDC has declared a national opioid overdose epidemic, with overdose deaths quadrupling since 1999. Former AG Jeff Sessions called it the deadliest drug crisis in US history, and President Trump declared it a national public health emergency in 2017. Opioids are defined as drugs with addiction liability similar to morphine. The opioid epidemic in the United States involves prescription pain relief drugs like hydrocodone, oxycodone, and heroin, leading to addiction and overdose deaths. Over 40% of opioid overdose deaths in 2016 involved FDA-approved prescription opioids. The complexity of how the epidemic started and who is responsible remains unclear. The opioid epidemic involves prescription pain relief drugs like hydrocodone, oxycodone, and heroin, leading to addiction and overdose deaths. Pharmaceutical manufacturers, distributors, doctors, health insurance companies, rogue pharmacies, drug dealers, and addicts are all implicated in fueling the crisis. The origins of the epidemic can be traced back to pharmaceutical companies reassuring the medical community in the late 1990s that patients would not become addicted to prescription opioids, leading to excessive prescribing and widespread misuse before the addictive nature of these medications became apparent. Excessive prescribing of opioids since 1999 has been cited as a significant contributor to the proliferation of opioids. The opioid crisis has been fueled by various factors, including excessive prescribing of opioids since 1999, large-scale production and distribution of addictive opioids, availability of illicit heroin and fentanyl, unethical physician practices, and lack of education for medical professionals and patients. The CSA regulates the distribution of controlled substances, requiring registrants to register with the DEA, maintain accurate records, and implement security measures. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) regulates the distribution of controlled substances, including opioids, by requiring registrants to maintain accurate records, implement security measures, report to the DEA, meet production quotas, and prescribe for legitimate medical purposes. The CSA categorizes substances into schedules based on medical use, abuse potential, and safety. It also regulates listed chemicals and analogues to prevent illicit manufacturing. The Controlled Substances Act categorizes substances into five schedules based on their potential for abuse and medical use. Schedule I includes substances like LSD and heroin with high abuse potential and no accepted medical use, while schedules II-V include substances with recognized medical uses like oxycodone and morphine. These substances can be manufactured, distributed, prescribed, and possessed in accordance with the CSA. The CSA provides a framework for controlling substances by adding, removing, or transferring them between schedules. The DEA, HHS, or interested parties can initiate rulemaking proceedings for scheduling changes. The DEA Administrator requests a scientific evaluation from HHS to determine control status based on statutory factors. The DEA Administrator considers statutory factors to determine the scheduling of drugs, including abuse potential, pharmacological effects, public health risks, and precursor status. In 2009, HHS recommended rescheduling hydrocodone combination products due to diversion and safety concerns. In 2014, DEA reclassified hydrocodone combination products from Schedule III to Schedule II due to abuse and safety risks. Congress can also change drug scheduling through legislation, as seen with the Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act of 2012. The DEA Administrator has the authority to temporarily control unregulated substances. The DEA Administrator can temporarily place uncontrolled drugs or substances into Schedule I if necessary to prevent imminent public safety hazards. This temporary scheduling order requires notification to the public and the HHS Secretary, with consideration of the Secretary's comments. The temporary scheduling can last for two years, with a possible extension of up to one year. DEA has used this emergency authority eight times to control substances related to fentanyl. The DEA Administrator can temporarily place uncontrolled drugs into Schedule I to prevent public safety hazards, based on treaty obligations. The United States is party to three UN drug control treaties, including the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961, the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971, and the 1988 Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) requires registration from the DEA for anyone involved in manufacturing, distributing, or researching controlled substances. Registrations specify authorized activities, with over 1.73 million registrants currently regulated. The DEA Administrator can charge fees for registration and control of controlled substances under the act. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) mandates DEA registration for individuals involved in handling controlled substances. Registrants must meet criteria based on public interest, public health, safety, and compliance with laws. Registrations are required annually for manufacturers and distributors, and for dispensers, lasting one to three years. Individual registrations cease upon death or legal cessation. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) requires DEA registration for individuals handling controlled substances, which must be renewed annually. Registrations end upon death, legal cessation, or discontinuation of business. Transferring a registration requires Administrator consent. Separate registrations are needed for each location where controlled substances are handled. The CSA provides exceptions and exemptions from regulatory requirements. Certain individuals are exempt from DEA registration requirements, including officers or employees of federal agencies authorized to handle controlled substances, state law enforcement officers, and patients using controlled substances for medical purposes. Only those involved in manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing controlled substances need to register. The DEA registration requirement exempts certain individuals, such as officers of federal agencies and patients using controlled substances for medical purposes. Registrants are obligated to maintain records, secure storage, report information to the DEA, and prescribe and dispense controlled substances to prevent diversion. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) mandates registrants to maintain accurate records of all transactions involving controlled substances. Registrants must keep inventories for at least two years and it is illegal to refuse or fail to provide required information. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) requires accurate record-keeping by registrants, with provisions for exceptions in certain circumstances. Applicants for DEA registration must ensure secure storage and distribution of controlled substances and listed chemicals. DEA regulations require all applicants and registrants to provide effective controls and procedures to prevent theft and diversion of controlled substances. Specific security requirements vary for different types of registrants, such as storing Schedule I and II substances in monitored safes or cabinets. Practitioners must store controlled substances in securely locked cabinets and report any theft or loss to the DEA promptly. Hiring employees with drug-related felonies is prohibited. The DEA prohibits hiring employees with drug-related felonies or denied DEA registrations. Regulations require screening job applicants for criminal convictions and unauthorized substance use. Registered pharmacies must report controlled substance activities to the DEA, including internet dispensing. Manufacturers, distributors, and dispensers must operate compliant systems for reporting controlled substance activities. The DEA requires companies to design and operate systems to alert them of suspicious orders of controlled substances, and report such orders to the DEA. Suspicious orders include those of unusual size, frequency, or deviation from normal patterns. Reports must be filed through the Automated Reports and Consolidated Orders System (ARCOS) for Schedule I and II drugs. The DEA uses the ARCOS reporting system to track controlled substances transactions for narcotics in Schedules III and IV. This information is used by U.S. attorneys and DEA investigators to strengthen criminal cases. The CSA includes a production quota system to regulate the manufacturing of Schedule I and II controlled substances for medical, scientific, research, and industrial needs. The DEA establishes an aggregate production quota (APQ) for around 200 controlled substances. The DEA assigns production quotas to controlled substance manufacturers to prevent exceeding the APQ. Registrants can apply for quota increases based on disposal, inventory, and other requirements. Factors considered for APQ determinations include disposal rates, national trends, inventories, demand, diversion, and relevant information. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) regulates the manufacturing of Schedule I and II substances, with specific requirements for practitioners and pharmacists when prescribing. DEA assigns production quotas to prevent exceeding limits, considering disposal rates, inventories, demand, and diversion. Other factors include information from the Department of Health and Human Services and states, as well as changes in medical use, availability of raw materials, and unforeseen emergencies. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) regulates the manufacturing of Schedule I and II substances for legitimate medical purposes. DEA regulations hold prescribing practitioners and pharmacists responsible for ensuring proper prescription and dispensing. Pharmacists must exercise sound judgment in determining the legitimacy of controlled substance prescriptions before dispensing. Pharmacies are not required to dispense prescriptions of doubtful or suspicious origin. Under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), pharmacists must ensure that prescriptions for controlled substances are legitimate. They can be prosecuted for knowingly distributing controlled substances without a valid prescription from a licensed medical practitioner. Pharmacies are not obligated to dispense suspicious prescriptions. Practitioners can authorize pharmacists to fill prescriptions for controlled substances in Schedules II-V, including electronic prescriptions. Pharmacists can partially fill Schedule II prescriptions and refill prescriptions for Schedules III-V, but not for Schedule II substances. A pharmacist can fill prescriptions for controlled substances in Schedules III and IV up to five times within six months. Electronic prescriptions for controlled substances must comply with federal regulations. Controlled substances cannot be dispensed online without a valid prescription issued after a medical evaluation. The CSA imposes criminal sanctions for illicit activities. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) prohibits illicit possession, manufacture, and distribution of controlled substances outside the closed system of distribution. It outlaws simple possession unless obtained through a valid prescription or authorized by the CSA. Trafficking in controlled substances, including distribution or possession with intent to distribute, is also illegal. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) prohibits illicit possession, manufacture, and distribution of controlled substances. Criminal penalties for trafficking vary based on factors like substance type and quantity. The focus is on penalties for DEA-registered individuals, including regulatory offenses and non-compliance with CSA requirements. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) prohibits illicit possession, manufacture, and distribution of controlled substances. Registrants must comply with CSA requirements, such as maintaining accurate records and not distributing controlled substances in an unauthorized manner. Failure to comply with these obligations and other prohibited acts can result in penalties for DEA-registered individuals. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) prohibits unauthorized distribution of controlled substances and listed chemicals by registrants. Violations include distributing Schedule I and II substances without a valid order form, using an invalid registration number, providing false information in records, or presenting false identification. Violators may face injunctive actions by the Attorney General in federal court. Manufacturers must adhere to DEA regulations on controlled substances production or face penalties, including fines and imprisonment. Violations of the Controlled Substances Act may result in administrative, civil, and criminal consequences, with imprisonment possible for knowing violations. The Controlled Substances Act allows state governments to regulate controlled substances. The U.S. Supreme Court has stated that the Act does not intend to regulate medicine practice broadly, relying on state medical regulation to protect citizens' health. States have prescription drug monitoring programs to track controlled substance prescriptions for law enforcement and healthcare purposes. States have the authority to regulate controlled substances, with some implementing stricter regulations than the Controlled Substances Act requires. For example, Oregon and Mississippi have laws requiring prescriptions for pseudoephedrine due to its use in making methamphetamine. State laws and regulatory bodies play a role in the operation of CSA provisions, such as physicians needing state authorization to dispense controlled substances. The DEA Administrator must authorize practitioners to dispense controlled substances in accordance with state laws and public interest considerations. State laws regulating controlled substances may be preempted by the CSA in cases of conflict. The conflict between a CSA provision and state law may lead to preemption. The DEA's Office of Diversion Control enforces the CSA, manages registrants, and sets production quotas. The Assistant Attorney General enforces the CSA through litigation. Federal courts have ruled that private parties cannot sue registrants for noncompliance with the CSA. The DEA enforces federal controlled substances laws and monitors registrant compliance through various investigations. These investigations can be regulatory, complaint, or criminal in nature. Scheduled inspections are conducted every few years, primarily focusing on manufacturers, distributors, and importers. Physicians and pharmacies are overseen by state regulators. The DEA enforces federal controlled substances laws through various investigations, including regulatory, complaint, and criminal investigations. These investigations target manufacturers, distributors, importers, physicians, and pharmacies overseen by state regulators. The DEA may initiate investigations based on tips about potential diversion or unusual drug transactions, and can take enforcement actions against violators of the Controlled Substances Act. The DEA enforces federal controlled substances laws through various investigations, including regulatory, complaint, and criminal investigations. They may seek administrative, civil, and criminal penalties against noncompliant registrants under the CSA. The DEA can issue warning letters or hold informal hearings to address infractions and may deny, revoke, or suspend registration. The DEA Administrator can deny, revoke, or suspend registrations after providing an Order to Show Cause (OTSC) to the applicant or registrant. The OTSC outlines the basis for the proposed action and allows the individual to submit a corrective action plan (CAP) and appear before a DEA Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) for a hearing. The DEA Administrator can take action to deny, revoke, or suspend registrations under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). If a registrant submits a CAP, the DEA Administrator must review the evidence and ALJ's report before issuing a final order in the Federal Register. Controlled substances may be sealed during appeal processes. The DEA Administrator has the authority to issue immediate suspension orders (ISO) to revoke or suspend registrations in cases of imminent danger to public health or safety. Controlled substances may be forfeited to the United States once all judicial appeals have been exhausted. The DEA Administrator can issue immediate suspension orders (ISO) without prior notice or a formal hearing in cases of imminent danger to public health or safety. The suspension continues until the conclusion of proceedings, unless withdrawn by the Attorney General or dissolved by a court. The CSA did not define \"imminent danger\" before the EPAEDEA of 2016, giving the DEA Administrator discretion in determining threats to public health. The EPAEDEA amended the CSA to define \"imminent danger to the public health or safety,\" limiting the DEA Administrator's discretion to issue an ISO. The DEA must prove an immediate threat of death, harm, or abuse due to non-compliance with CSA requirements and the likelihood of such a threat without immediate registration suspension. The EPAEDEA amended the CSA to define \"imminent danger to the public health or safety,\" limiting the DEA Administrator's discretion to issue an ISO. Some argue that the changes weaken the DEA's power, while others believe the definition was necessary to prevent subjective determinations. Registrants can seek judicial review of an ISO in federal court, but face challenges in enjoining the DEA's enforcement pending revocation or suspension proceedings. The CSA requires registrants to establish likelihood of success, irreparable harm, equitable balance, and public interest for preliminary injunctive relief. Courts use substantial evidence standard for DEA's findings on ISOs and arbitrary and capricious standard for DEA's decisions on ALJ recommendations. Federal appellate courts review DEA's ISO issuance under APA to ensure relevant data examination and satisfactory explanation. The DEA has used various authorities to address the opioid crisis, including holding manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies, and physicians accountable for violating regulatory requirements. Registrants can request an expedited administrative hearing before an ALJ on the merits of revocation or suspension. DEA regulations require the Administrator to grant the request for an earlier hearing and set a date as soon as possible. In response to the opioid crisis, the DEA intensified enforcement efforts targeting prescribers and pharmacies suspected of diverting opioids, leading to revoked registrations and arrests. CVS Pharmacy Inc. settled with the DEA for $5 million and implemented a compliance plan for recordkeeping violations. CVS also paid $8 million for dispensing controlled substances in violation of the CSA. In 2013, Walgreens paid $80 million in civil penalties for record-keeping and dispensing violations related to oxycodone and other opioids. The settlement included ending the practice of compensating pharmacists based on prescription volume. The DEA also focused on wholesale distributors' compliance with recordkeeping and reporting requirements. In January 2017, McKesson Corporation agreed to pay a $150 million civil penalty for failing to report 'suspicious orders' of controlled substances to independent pharmacies. The settlement also required McKesson to suspend sales of controlled substances from some distribution centers. McKesson Corporation agreed to pay a $150 million civil penalty for failing to report 'suspicious orders' of controlled substances to independent pharmacies. The settlement also required McKesson to suspend sales of controlled substances from some distribution centers. Cardinal Health, Inc. agreed to pay $44 million to settle allegations of failing to report unusually large orders for controlled substances and maintain effective controls against diversion. In 2014, Masters Pharmaceuticals, Inc. failed to report suspicious orders to the DEA as required by the CSA, leading to the revocation of its registration. Despite a previous settlement agreement in 2009, the DEA suspected that Masters was not detecting and reporting suspicious orders of oxycodone products. The DEA ordered Masters Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to show cause why its registration should not be revoked for failing to report suspicious orders of controlled substances. Despite challenging the decision in federal court, Masters's petition for review was denied by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in June 2017. The DEA reached a $35 million civil penalty settlement with Mallinckrodt LLC, a major oxycodone manufacturer, for failing to report suspicious orders of controlled substances downstream in the drug supply chain. This marked the first time a drug manufacturer was held accountable for detecting and reporting suspicious orders between distributor customers and pharmacies. The DEA reached a $35 million civil penalty settlement with Mallinckrodt LLC for failing to report suspicious orders of controlled substances downstream in the drug supply chain. The settlement agreement includes the DEA's position that drug manufacturers need to monitor and report suspicious orders of oxycodone placed by distributor customers' customers. The DEA's position on drug manufacturers needing to monitor and report suspicious orders of controlled substances downstream in the supply chain, including oxycodone, has not been challenged in court. Fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid, is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine and heroin, and is used for severe pain management after surgery. Fentanyl overdoses often involve nonpharmaceutical fentanyl produced illicitly in labs in Mexico and China. Illicit fentanyl can be mixed with other opioids like heroin and sold as powder or tablets resembling prescription medications. The DEA states that fentanyl is a major contributor to drug overdose deaths in the US. The Justice Department's \"Operation Synthetic Opioid Surge\" targets fentanyl distribution in high overdose death rate areas. Overseas manufacturers create fentanyl variants to evade regulations, hindering federal efforts. The DEA has used emergency scheduling authority to control fentanyl-related compounds. In February 2018, a temporary scheduling order aimed to schedule all fentanyl-related substances not controlled in any schedule. The DEA's proactive approach to scheduling illicit fentanyl substances is a new strategy to combat the evolving nature of these drugs. The DEA's proactive approach to scheduling illicit fentanyl substances, including those not yet introduced into the U.S. market, may face legal challenges under the APA. The DEA has observed a decline in prescriptions for certain Schedule II opioids since 2014, leading to a reduction in the 2018 aggregate production quotas for prescription opioids. The DEA has reduced the amount of prescription opioids that can be manufactured in 2018 by nearly 20% compared to 2017 levels. This decrease is attributed to various activities and interventions at local, state, and federal levels. Concerns have been raised by organizations about potential shortages of injectable opioid medications used for pain management during medical procedures and surgeries. They suggest reallocating or revising the quotas to address these shortages. The DEA has proposed further reductions in the quantity of Schedule II opioids that can be manufactured in the United States in 2019. The proposed 2019 quotas for six frequently misused opioids would decrease by an average of ten percent compared to 2018. This request is specific to injectable medications and does not extend to other dosage forms or opioid products. The SUPPORT Act, signed into law in 2018, amends the CSA to address the opioid epidemic by reducing availability of prescription opioids through proper disposal methods. Young adults may access expired or unwanted opioids from parents' medicine cabinets or trash. The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 aims to reduce the availability of unwanted opioid medications by allowing patients to return them to pharmacies or prescribing physicians for proper disposal. Congress amended the Controlled Substances Act to facilitate the disposal of controlled substances, including opioids, to prevent diversion. The DEA regulations issued in September 2014 provide options for safe disposal of unwanted prescription opioids and controlled substances. Patients can participate in drug \"take-back\" events organized by law enforcement agencies or partner with private entities for community take-back events. DEA-registered entities like manufacturers, distributors, and pharmacies can also collect unwanted controlled substances for disposal. Authorized collectors, including on-site pharmacies and retail pharmacies, can seek DEA authorization to collect unwanted controlled substances for disposal. They can utilize mail-back programs for convenient transfer, manage secure collection receptacles at their registered location, or use on-site collection receptacles at long-term care facilities. DEA regulations specify requirements for packaging, tamper-resistance, and tracking numbers for shipping controlled substances. The regulations require collectors to follow specific procedures for destroying controlled substances to make them non-retrievable. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 includes provisions for prescription drug disposal and take-back programs, with grants available for addressing opioid addiction and abuse. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act of 2018 mandates coordination among various entities to expand disposal sites for unwanted prescription drugs. This includes home hospice employees facing challenges in disposing of controlled substances after a patient's death. The \"Safe Disposal of Unused Medication Act\" allows qualified hospice program employees to dispose of controlled substances after a patient's death, expiration, or change in care plan if authorized by law. The Act also requires a study on federal requirements for managing and disposing of controlled substances in homes. Chapter 6 of the SUPPORT Act, known as the \"Access to Increased Drug Disposal Act of 2018,\" addresses challenges faced by hospice programs in disposing of controlled substances. It grants the Attorney General authority to provide grants to states to increase the number of pharmacies and entities authorized to collect unused prescription drugs for disposal. The \"Access to Increased Drug Disposal Act of 2018\" designates a state agency to comply with grant conditions, increase participation of eligible collectors, and select collectors. Grants are awarded to five states, with at least three in the lowest quartile for collector participation. Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid abuse includes methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone. Practitioners must adhere to CSA regulations for administering these drugs. The CSA requires practitioners to obtain a separate DEA registration for administering methadone for maintenance or detoxification treatment. A waiver (DATA waiver) can be obtained for using Schedule III, IV, or V substances like buprenorphine. Naltrexone can be prescribed without DEA registration. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) requires practitioners to have a separate DEA registration to administer methadone for treatment. A waiver (DATA waiver) is needed for using buprenorphine. Naltrexone can be prescribed without DEA registration. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) expanded the types of practitioners who can dispense buprenorphine or other narcotics for opioid dependence treatment. The SUPPORT Act also includes provisions related to Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) by amending the CSA. The SUPPORT Act amends the CSA to remove time limits for nurse practitioners and physician assistants to dispense controlled substances for treatment under a DATA waiver. It also allows other nurse specialists to obtain waivers until 2023. The Act addresses issues with administering controlled substances in medical offices, such as buprenorphine for opioid use disorders. The SUPPORT Act amends the CSA to allow pharmacies to deliver controlled substances to practitioners for administration to patients within 14 days. The Attorney General may reduce this timeframe to prevent diversion or protect public safety. The SUPPORT Act requires the GAO to study access to controlled substances administered by injection or implantation. Manufacturers and distributors of Schedule I and II drugs must report transactions to the DEA through ARCOS. The \"Using Data to Prevent Opioid Diversion Act of 2018\" aims to provide access to anonymized information to help identify and stop suspicious orders of opioids. This chapter amends the CSA to require manufacturers and distributors to review data on opioid distribution through the ARCOS system quarterly. Failure to do so may result in new civil and criminal penalties, and the DEA Administrator can use this information to initiate administrative actions for noncompliance with CSA requirements. The \"Opioid Quota Reform Act\" in the SUPPORT Act amends the CSA to add statutory considerations for the DEA in setting annual production quotas for controlled substances. The DEA Administrator can establish quotas to address overproduction, shortages, or diversion of controlled substances. The Attorney General is required to report to Congress on how data from ARCOS is used to identify and stop suspicious activity. The SUPPORT Act amends the CSA to require the DEA Administrator to estimate and reduce quotas for fentanyl, oxycodone, hydrocodone, oxymorphone, or hydromorphone based on diversion. It also mandates registrants to report suspicious orders of controlled substances to the DEA. The SUPPORT Act, under the Preventing Drug Diversion Act of 2018, defines \"suspicious order\" and requires DEA registrants to report such orders of controlled substances to the DEA. Registrants must have a system in place to detect suspicious orders and inform the DEA Administrator and Special Agent in Charge. Additionally, the DEA Administrator is tasked with establishing a centralized database for storing reports of suspicious orders. The SUPPORT Act establishes a centralized database for storing suspicious orders reports of controlled substances. Registrants must report suspicious orders to the DEA to comply with notification requirements. The DEA Administrator shares information on suspicious orders with state-designated entities. The Act also imposes a maximum criminal fine for intentional failure to report suspicious orders for opioids. The 116th Congress may consider further amendments to the CSA related to opioid legislation introduced in the 115th Congress. Proposals in the 115th Congress include changes to the DEA's authority regarding registration and immediate suspension orders. The DEA Opioid Enforcement Restoration Act of 2017 would repeal the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act of 2016, restoring DEA discretion in interpreting the phrase \"imminent danger to the public health or safety\" for immediate suspension orders. The Opioid Immediate Suspension Order Act of 2017 (H.R. 4073) would remove the option for a corrective action plan before DEA registration denial, revocation, or suspension. It also eliminates the definition of \"imminent danger to public health or safety\" for immediate suspensions but retains the corrective action plan provision from a previous law. Additionally, the Opioid Addiction Prevention Act of 2017 (S. 892) aims to limit opioid prescriptions by amending the Controlled Substances Act. The CARA 2.0 Act of 2018 (S. 2456) would amend the CSA to restrict practitioners from prescribing certain opioids for acute pain, limiting the supply to a seven-day supply with no refills allowed. It defines acute pain and excludes chronic pain, cancer-related pain, and palliative care. The Safer Prescribing of Controlled Substances Act (S. 1554) would require practitioners to complete training on best practices for pain management, responsible opioid prescribing, diagnosing substance use disorders, and managing controlled substance diversion. The Opioid Preventing Abuse through Continuing Education (PACE) Act of 2017 (H.R. 2063) and several other bills aim to increase penalties for fentanyl trafficking and require practitioner education on opioid prescribing and substance use disorders. The bills aim to reduce the quantity of fentanyl that triggers mandatory minimum sentences for trafficking offenses, from 400 grams to 20 grams, and for fentanyl analogues from 100 grams to 5 grams. The bills aim to reduce the quantity of fentanyl that triggers mandatory minimum sentences for trafficking offenses, from 400 grams to 20 grams, and for fentanyl analogues from 100 grams to 5 grams. Offenses involving specified amounts of fentanyl or its analogues would result in imprisonment ranging from 5 years to life, depending on the quantity and harm caused. The proposed changes would lower these thresholds to 2 grams and 0.5 grams, respectively."
