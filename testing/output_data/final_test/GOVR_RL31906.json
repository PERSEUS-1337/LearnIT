    "content": "Since the mid-1980s, South Korea has seen the deepening of democratic institutions and traditions after years of authoritarian rule. In 1997, Kim Dae Jung, a long-time dissident, was elected as president, marking the first time an opposition party had won in a South Korean presidential election. Kim was succeeded in 2002 by Roh Moo-hyun, a self-educated former human rights lawyer who campaigned on a platform of reform in Korean politics, economic policymaking, and U.S.-ROK relations. Roh Moo-hyun narrowly defeated conservative candidate Lee Hoi Chang in the 2002 presidential election with 48.9% of the vote. Despite limited government experience, Roh's image as a principled reformer was bolstered by previous defeats in legislative elections and mayoral bids. The election highlighted a generational divide, with younger voters overwhelmingly supporting Roh. Roh Moo-hyun's victory in the 2002 presidential election was supported by nearly 60% of people in their 20s and 30s, compared to less than 40% of those in their 50s and 60s. He represented a generational shift and called for South Korea to be a more equal partner in the U.S.-ROK alliance. Roh's criticism of U.S. policies on the Korean peninsula and pledge to continue the \"sunshine policy\" resonated with younger generations and mainstream Korean society. The 2002 presidential election in South Korea saw Roh Moo-hyun's victory with strong support from younger voters. Korean civil society groups played a significant role in organizing anti-American protests and supporting Roh's campaign. These groups, utilizing internet networking, effectively encouraged political activism among the youth, leading to higher turnout of younger voters in the election. The 2002 election had a record low turnout of 70%, compared to 80% in 1997. Roh Moo-hyun faced challenges due to deep divisions in South Korea, with the National Assembly controlled by the opposition Grand National Party. The ruling Millennium Democratic Party was also divided, complicating Roh's reform agenda. The upcoming National Assembly elections in April 2004 are expected to worsen the zero-sum politics in South Korea. Both the ruling MDP and opposition GNP in South Korea are facing internal stress, leading to speculation of a major political realignment before the next legislative election in April 2004. The National Assembly, consisting of 273 members, has the power to criticize and inspect the executive branch, with 227 members representing single-member constituencies and 46 selected through proportional voting. The Assembly's oversight of the executive has been a significant accomplishment since the 1987 constitution. The National Assembly in South Korea has institutionalized oversight of the executive branch since 1987, making policy-making more transparent. However, the President remains the dominant force due to limitations on the Assembly's ability to initiate major legislation, such as only being able to cut funds from the President's budget. South Korean legislators face limitations with little legislative support and staff. The opposition party aims to strengthen the National Assembly by creating institutions similar to U.S. agencies. Bills can be introduced by members or the executive branch and sent to the president if passed. The South Korean National Assembly plays a crucial role in the legislative process, with bills being sent to the executive branch for presidential promulgation. The Assembly can override a presidential veto with a two-thirds majority, appoint Supreme Court justices, ratify treaties, and consent to declarations of war or troop deployments. Political parties in South Korea are regionally-based and regularly form, disband, and merge. The South Korean political landscape is characterized by regionally-based parties and charismatic personalities. Members of the National Assembly often switch parties, leading to voter disaffection. Roh Moo-hyun gained popularity in the 2002 election for his principled stance against political maneuvering. Currently, there are three major political parties in South Korea, including President Roh Moo-hyun's center-left ruling Millennium Democratic Party. Roh Moo-hyun's center-left ruling Millennium Democratic Party (MDP) has 101 seats in the National Assembly, while the conservative opposition Grand National Party (GNP) has 153 seats. The United Liberal Democrats (ULD) has 14 seats and is declining in size and influence. The GNP increased its majority in April 2003, and there is speculation of a major political realignment before the April 2004 National Assembly elections. The MDP and GNP are both facing unsettled times. Roh Moo-hyun's MDP is recovering from Lee HoiChang's defeat, with divisions within the party. Roh's support is mainly from younger reformers. There is speculation of forming a new party with reformist politicians from different parties. South Korean politics is highly regionalized, with the MDP's base in the Cholla region where Roh won 93% of the vote in the 2002 election. In the 2000 National Assembly elections, the GNP won 64 of the 65 constituencies in the Kyongsang region, which is the party's stronghold. There has been discussion of combating regionalism by adopting multiple-seat constituencies in the National Assembly. Since the end of military rule, NGOs in South Korea have significantly increased, operating at local and national levels and focusing on various issues such as the environment, government corruption, disability rights, and revising agreements with the U.S. Many international NGOs have local chapters in Seoul. Unlike the militant groups of the 1980s, modern NGOs are professionalizing their operations with permanent staff and research offices, impacting domestic and foreign policy in South Korea. The growing influence of South Korean NGOs in forming coalitions and organizing protests has impacted domestic and foreign policy. The decentralization of power in South Korea has also contributed to the rise of civil society groups. The rapid adoption of the Internet has facilitated networking and coordination among these groups. Increased local autonomy in South Korea has led to greater political consciousness and activism. President Roh Moo-hyun aims to decentralize political power further by giving more autonomy to provinces and relocating certain executive offices outside of Seoul. Despite these changes, Seoul remains the center of political power due to limited authority of local governments to impose taxes. South Korea's media operated under strict censorship during military rule, but in recent years, there has been a shift towards more freedom and less government interference. Tensions have arisen between the South Korean government and the country's print media, particularly under the current Roh administration. The top three mainstream newspapers control 70% of the market with right-of-center political leanings. The leading left-of-center daily has a readership of 400,000. Many younger South Koreans are turning to internet news sources. Korean newspapers are heavily reliant on advertising revenues from chaebol conglomerates, leading to alleged hostility towards chaebol reforms. Hostility towards chaebol reforms by the government has led to tensions with mainstream newspapers in South Korea. The newspapers have been criticized for their opaque operations, biased news coverage, and reliance on advertising revenues from chaebol conglomerates. President Kim Dae Jung's tax probe in 2001 targeted critical papers, while President Roh complained about media bias during the 2002 campaign. President Roh criticized media bias during the 2002 campaign and implemented reforms to increase media openness. He replaced restrictive press clubs with open press briefings and required daily summaries of newspaper articles to be classified into five categories. These moves led to the resignation of his appointee at the state-run Korean Broadcasting System. Roh also granted greater access to internet publications, popular among younger readers who supported him during the election. Roh Moo-hyun won the South Korean Presidency by adopting a mantle of reform, focusing on Korea's relations with the United States, economic policy, and politics. He pledged to continue Kim Dae Jung's sunshine policy towards North Korea, renaming it the \"peace and prosperity\" policy. Anti-American sentiments in South Korea have become less ideological and more issue-specific, with criticisms of US policy moving into the mainstream. Critics in South Korea accuse the Bush Administration of not listening to South Koreans, blocking rapprochement between North and South Korea, and covering up alleged atrocities from the Korean War. Anti-U.S. sentiments intensified after President Bush included North Korea in the \"axis of evil\" and the killing of two Korean schoolgirls by a U.S. military vehicle in June 2002. Critics of the United States in South Korea tend to be younger than 50 and fall into three main groups: radical leftists who reject the U.S.-ROK alliance, nationalists who resent U.S. intrusions into South Korea's sovereignty, and individuals who support the alliance but oppose specific U.S. policies. The latter group, which is the majority among anti-American activists, could potentially turn their concerns into a nationalistic or ideological-based opposition to the U.S.-South Korean alliance if not addressed. Opinion polls show majority favor partial withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea, with conditions for improvement in North-South Korean relations. Bush Administration's plans to reduce forces calmed anti-base movement. Roh government asks for no moves until North Korea nuclear issue is settled. Roh tapped into anti-American sentiments during campaign, criticizing Bush Administration for not negotiating with North Korea. Roh criticized the Bush Administration for not negotiating with North Korea and called for modernizing the U.S.-ROK alliance. He demanded a renegotiation of the U.S.-South Korea Status of Forces Agreement and sought to reduce bilateral tensions by moderating his statements. Additionally, he supported the U.S.-led war in Iraq and promised to send troops there. Relations with North Korea have been affected by South Korea's opposition to the war in Iraq. Despite President Roh expressing reservations about the war, he justified sending troops to maintain influence over U.S. policy towards North Korea. The deployment faced opposition in South Korea, leading to anti-war demonstrations and delays in the National Assembly. The deployment was eventually approved with support from the opposition party, which has a history of close alliance relations with the United States. The declining sense of threat from North Korea has contributed to anti-American sentiments in South Korea. During his presidential campaign, Roh advocated for engagement with North Korea, criticized the Bush Administration's refusal to negotiate, and called for a peaceful resolution to the nuclear dispute. He emphasized the need for North Korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons program and proposed a \"policy of peace and prosperity\" for the Korean Peninsula. Roh advocated for engagement with North Korea and proposed a \"policy of peace and prosperity\" for the Korean Peninsula, with greater transparency than the sunshine policy. He faced criticism for secret payments made by Hyundai to North Korea, leading to calls for an independent prosecutor to investigate. Lee Hoi Chang, Roh's opponent, also called for greater reciprocity in North-South relations but focused more on implementation issues rather than a wholesale change in policy direction. Lee proposed that South Korean aid should be conditional upon reductions in North Korea's military threat and no new aid should be given until North Korea dismantles its nuclear weapons program. President Roh emphasized market-oriented reforms to turn South Korea into an international logistics and financial hub, continuing Kim Dae Jung's economic reforms and pushing for transparency in conglomerates. Roh aggressively pushed chaebol reforms, investigating fraudulent accounting at SK Global. His administration is discussing proposals to reduce founding family power and cross-shareholding. Some chaebol leaders oppose the reforms, which may be challenged by the economic slowdown in South Korea. Roh's administration faced challenges such as declining exports, the SK Global scandal repercussions, and a slump in consumer confidence. Economic reforms could strain relations with organized labor, a key interest group for Roh. He sought political reforms by allowing the National Assembly to investigate Hyundai's payments to North Korea, aiming to improve transparency and reduce corruption. Collaboration with the opposition GNP is crucial due to their control of the legislature. The upcoming National Assembly elections in April 2004 may hinder cooperation between Roh and the opposition GNP, risking alienating his base in the MDP. The deepening of democracy in South Korea could complicate U.S.-ROK alliance relations and limit U.S. options in dealing with North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. Confronting Pyongyang would require Seoul's cooperation, while a preemptive attack on North Korea's nuclear facilities would face strong opposition from the Roh government and the South Korean people. Anti-American sentiment is also on the rise. The recent surge in anti-American sentiment in South Korea could strain the U.S.-ROK alliance. President Roh's election presents an opportunity for the Bush Administration to influence South Korea's approach towards North Korea. Roh's advocacy for engaging North Korea may help sell a more aggressive policy to the divided South Korean public. NGO activity in South Korea has a fluctuating nature due to diverse agendas, resulting in large-scale protests that fade when issues lose steam. Recent anti-American demonstrations in South Korea have diminished, but it doesn't necessarily indicate a decrease in anti-American sentiments. The recent decrease in anti-American demonstrations in South Korea may not indicate a decline in anti-American sentiments, as these feelings could resurface with new triggers or unresolved issues. The U.S. Department of Defense's plans to realign forces in South Korea could address some concerns that fuel anti-American attitudes. NGO influence in South Korean politics puts pressure on the government to be more transparent, suggesting a need for U.S. public diplomacy to engage with Korean interest groups and online news sources. The USIS centers in South Korea have been permanently closed for security reasons, replaced by Internet libraries and increased public affairs staff in Seoul. South Korea's foreign policy was dominated by elites with a strong U.S.-ROK alliance worldview, but this changed with the election of Kim Dae Jung in 1997. The new leadership, like Roh, is younger and represents a shift in the South Korean polity. The new leadership in South Korea, following the election of individuals like Roh, is younger, less tied to elite schools, and more critical of the United States, especially regarding North Korea and the U.S. military presence on the Korean Peninsula. There are concerns about a decreasing number of U.S. defenders outside of the conservative South Korean elite, prompting calls for increased outreach efforts by the U.S. government. The House version of The Foreign Relations Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2004 and 2005 includes sections focused on U.S. public diplomacy. The House version of The Foreign Relations Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2004 and 2005 (H.R. 1950) includes sections aimed at U.S. public diplomacy in Korea. This involves creating a new program for summer institutes in the U.S. for Korean students, increasing funding for the Fulbright English Teaching Assistant Program in Korea, expanding the U.S.-Korea Fulbright program beyond traditional elites, and establishing a diplomatic presence in Pusan."
