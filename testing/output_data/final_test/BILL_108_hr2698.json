    "content": "The \"Health Insurance Certificate Act of 2003\" establishes a program. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a program to issue health insurance certificates to eligible individuals for purchasing qualified health insurance coverage. Eligible individuals must be citizens, nationals, or lawful permanent residents of the United States. The program issues health insurance certificates to eligible individuals for purchasing qualified coverage. No certificates are issued to family members already covered under the same insurance. The program issues health insurance certificates to eligible individuals for purchasing qualified coverage. The term \"spouse\" is defined as per chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code. No more than 2 family members (excluding the spouse) can be considered for certificate value. An individual is not eligible if covered under a public program. An eligible individual must be covered under specific medical care programs to qualify for benefits. COBRA continuation coverage is also considered for certain individuals under federal law. The Secretary will design health insurance certificates for qualified coverage, allowing the issuer to obtain a specified value towards purchasing the coverage without seeking reimbursement. The health insurance certificate allows the issuer to obtain reimbursement if incorrect information is provided. The certificate covers costs for obtaining health insurance for a specified individual and family members in a year. The value of the certificate cannot exceed 70% of the premium for the coverage period. The value of a health insurance certificate for a year is determined based on income methodology specified by the Secretary, similar to needs-based Federal programs. Alternate State methodologies may be used for ease of administration. The Secretary may allow self-certification for program administration. Individuals eligible for group health plan coverage with premiums not exceeding 50% of the cost are eligible for a certificate under section (d)(2). No health insurance certificate shall be issued if the annualized value exceeds a minimum threshold. Value of health insurance certificate for eligible individuals is determined based on income and family status. For unmarried individuals with no dependents and income below $13,000, the annualized value is $1,000. If income exceeds $13,000, the value is different. No certificate will be issued if the annualized value exceeds $200. For eligible individuals with dependent family members, the annualized value of the health insurance certificate is determined based on income. If the family's income is $25,000 or less, the value of the certificate is $1,000 for the individual and $750 for each family member. The annualized value of the health insurance certificate for eligible individuals with dependent family members is determined based on income. If the family's income is over $25,000, the value is calculated by subtracting 10% for each $1,000 over $24,001. Married individuals can choose separate insurance coverage. For individuals with self-only coverage, if their resources exceed $12,500, the annualized value of the insurance certificate is 0. For those with self and family coverage, if family resources exceed a certain threshold, the value of the certificate is determined based on income. For individuals with self-only coverage, if resources exceed $12,500, the insurance certificate's value is 0. In cases of group health plans, certain exclusions do not apply, and the certificate's value is 40% of the determined amount. Amounts not multiples of $12 are rounded down. Qualified health insurance coverage, as defined in this section, includes health benefits coverage that is creditable coverage and does not consist entirely of excepted benefits. Certificates under this provision can be used for qualified health insurance under any group health plan available to family members based on their employment status. The term 'qualified health insurance coverage' excludes certain arrangements such as flexible spending accounts, insurance with mostly excepted benefits, group health plan coverage related to employment (excluding COBRA), and specific medical programs. Authorization of appropriations is provided to implement this section and related provisions. Authorized appropriations under section 2745 of the Public Health Service Act are set at $28.457 billion for fiscal years 2004-2008 and $49.965 billion for fiscal years 2004-2013. SEC. 3. EXTENSION OF FUNDING FOR STATE HIGH RISK HEALTH INSURANCE POOLS. Section 2745 of the Public Health Service Act, as amended by the Trade Act of 2002, updates provisions related to qualified health risk pools, premium rates, covered benefits, and enrollees in high-risk pools. Funding of $40,000,000 is allocated for fiscal year 2003. Funding of $40,000,000 for fiscal year 2003 and $75,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2004 to 2009, subject to availability of funds under the Health Insurance Certificate Act of 2003."
