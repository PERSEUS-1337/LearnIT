    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Syria Accountability Act of 2003\". The findings of Congress highlight the mandate for states to refrain from supporting terrorist acts, with Syria being prohibited from receiving US assistance due to its sponsorship of terrorism. Despite being listed as a state sponsor of terrorism, fewer US sanctions apply to Syria. States sanctions apply more to Syria than any other country listed as a state sponsor of terrorism. Terrorist groups like Hizballah, Hamas, and others operate in Syria and receive supplies from Iran through Syria. UN Resolution 520 calls for respect of Lebanon's sovereignty and political independence. Since 1990, the US government has called for the withdrawal of Syrian armed forces from Lebanon, as Syrian troops occupy Lebanese territory, undermining its political independence. The Lebanese people have peacefully demanded the withdrawal of the Syrian Army, while Israel has already withdrawn its forces from Lebanon in compliance with UN Security Council Resolution 425. Syria allows attacks on Israeli outposts at Shebaa Farms and civilian targets, hindering Lebanon's deployment of troops in compliance with Resolution 425. Hizballah controls the Israeli-Lebanese border, attacking Israeli positions with support from Iranian Revolutionary Guards. The United States provides financial assistance to Lebanese people through private organizations. President George W. Bush vows to prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. Syria is developing ballistic missiles and chemical weapons. Syria has violated UN sanctions by importing Iraqi oil and is suspected of developing chemical weapons. President Bush mentioned positive signs of Syria cooperating on harboring fugitive Iraqi officials on April 20, 2003. President Bush mentioned positive signs of Syria cooperating on harboring fugitive Iraqi officials on April 20, 2003. SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. The sense of Congress is that the Government of Syria should immediately stop supporting terrorism, renounce all forms of terrorism, and close terrorist offices in Syria. Additionally, Syria should commit to withdrawing its armed forces from Lebanon in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 520. The Government of Syria should halt the development and deployment of ballistic missiles and cease production of chemical and biological weapons. Syria should also stop illegal imports of Iraqi oil and comply with UN resolutions. Lebanon and Syria should engage in peace talks with Israel, and the US should provide humanitarian aid to Lebanon through private organizations. Lebanon should receive humanitarian aid through private and international organizations until it achieves full political independence and control over its territory as per UN Security Council Resolution 520. The statement of policy outlined in Section 4 emphasizes the need for Lebanon to receive humanitarian aid until it attains full political independence and control over its territory as mandated by UN Security Council Resolution 520. The United States policy holds Syria accountable for supporting terrorist groups like Hizballah, denying Syria the ability to support terrorism and acquire weapons of mass destruction. Syria will remain listed as a state sponsor of terrorism until it stops supporting terrorist groups and complies with anti-terrorism laws and UN resolutions. Resolution 1373 (September 28, 2001) emphasizes the importance of restoring Lebanon's sovereignty and independence. It also highlights Syria's violation of UN Security Council Resolution 520 through its occupation of Lebanese territory and acquisition of weapons of mass destruction, posing a threat to the Middle East and US national interests. The United States will restrict assistance to Syria and oppose multilateral assistance until Syria withdraws armed forces from Lebanon, halts weapons of mass destruction development, and complies with relevant UN Security Council resolutions. SEC. 5. PENALTIES AND AUTHORIZATION. Sanctions will be imposed if the President does not make a certification. This includes prohibiting the export of defense articles and services to Syria and imposing multiple sanctions. The Act imposes sanctions on Syria, including prohibiting US exports (excluding food and medicine), US business investments, restricting Syrian diplomats' travel, reducing diplomatic contacts, and blocking transactions involving Syrian government interests. The President may waive sanctions on Syria if it is in the national security interest of the United States and provides a report to Congress. Assistance can be provided to Syria and Lebanon under the Foreign Assistance Act if certain conditions are met. The President can waive sanctions on Syria if it benefits the US national security and reports to Congress. Assistance can be given to Syria and Lebanon under the Foreign Assistance Act if specific conditions are fulfilled. Substantial progress has been made in negotiations for peace agreements between Israel and Syria, as well as Israel and Lebanon. Syria is respecting Lebanon's sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity, and political independence as mandated by UN Security Council Resolution 520. The Government of Syria has met specific conditions to no longer support international terrorist groups, withdrawn military personnel from Lebanon, halted the development of weapons, and is in compliance with relevant UN resolutions. The Government of Syria has met specific conditions to no longer support international terrorist groups, withdrawn military personnel from Lebanon, halted the development of weapons, and is in compliance with relevant UN resolutions. SEC. 6. REPORT. The Secretary of State must submit a report every 12 months on Syria's progress towards meeting specified conditions and any connections between terrorists in Syria and the September 11 attacks. The report on Syria's progress must be submitted annually in unclassified form, with the option of including a classified annex.
