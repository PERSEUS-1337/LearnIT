    "content": "Under the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, the House and Senate must adopt a budget resolution each year. This resolution serves as a statement on revenue, spending, and debt policies, guiding legislation at agency levels. The House and Senate Budget Committees enforce these policies using mechanisms like points of order, relying on baseline budget projections from the Congressional Budget Office. The budget resolution relies on baseline budget projections from the Congressional Budget Office. If committees do not pass legislation to change revenue and spending levels, they will likely remain the same. The budget reconciliation process helps Congress adjust current laws to align with the budget resolution's policies. Reconciliation is a powerful budget enforcement tool used by Congress to align revenue and spending with budget resolution policies. It involves instructions in the budget resolution for committees to develop legislation to achieve desired budget outcomes, which are then incorporated into an omnibus reconciliation bill without substantive revisions. The resulting legislation is considered by the House and Senate under expedited procedures, with limited debate time in the Senate. The reconciliation process in Congress involves limited debate time and amendments, with instructions in the budget resolution for committees to develop legislation. Once the reconciliation legislation is approved or vetoed by the President, the process is concluded. Congress cannot develop another reconciliation bill without first adopting another budget resolution with reconciliation instructions. Reconciliation was first used in 1980 during President Jimmy Carter's administration. Since then, 20 reconciliation measures have been enacted into law, with four being vetoed. In some years, reconciliation was proposed but not activated. For example, in FY1999, the House included reconciliation directives in the budget resolution, but the Senate did not. Ultimately, reconciliation procedures were not used that year. The FY2013 budget resolution passed by the House included reconciliation directives to six committees. The House passed H.R. 5652, the Sequester Replacement Reconciliation Act, based on the deemed enforceability of the budget resolution. However, the Senate did not consider H.R. 5652 as a reconciliation measure due to the lack of agreement on the budget resolution. Reconciliation procedures in the Senate have been used to reduce deficits through cuts in mandatory spending or revenue increases. However, it has also been used to decrease revenues and sometimes increase spending levels. In 2006, reconciliation led to a net deficit increase. Rules regarding reconciliation have been amended over the years to prevent actions that would raise deficits or direct spending. The reconciliation process has primarily focused on mandatory spending programs, not discretionary ones. In some instances, it has been used to raise the statutory debt limit. Efforts were made in 2000 to reduce the public debt through reconciliation. The 1974 Congressional Budget Act originally required two budget resolutions each year, with reconciliation being a key component. The reconciliation process was initially intended to make last-minute changes to legislation to align with budget resolution policies. However, it was realized that major changes in revenue and spending laws could not be made within the tight timeframe. As a result, reconciliation was shifted to be used in conjunction with the first budget resolution adopted in the late spring. The 1974 Congressional Budget Act incorporated changes in congressional practice, including the adoption of only one budget resolution with reconciliation instructions. The deadline for the budget resolution was moved to April 15, with a deadline of June 15 for reconciliation legislation. The 1974 Congressional Budget Act changed congressional practice by setting a deadline for the budget resolution on April 15 and reconciliation legislation on June 15. The House has a provision to prevent a July adjournment if reconciliation is not completed, while the Senate does not have a similar rule. Reconciliation legislation processing time varies, taking an average of five months from budget resolution adoption to approval or veto by the President. The reconciliation process often exceeds the two-month deadline set by the 1974 Congressional Budget Act, taking about five months on average. Congress has completed action on multiple reconciliation measures in both sessions, with some measures enacted in the second session based on directives from the prior session. During the period from 1980 to the present, Congress has adopted 21 budget resolutions with reconciliation instructions. Most resolutions were adopted in April, May, or June, but some were delayed. The reconciliation process can be lengthy, with measures enacted or vetoed as early as August or as late as December, sometimes carrying over to the following year. During the period from 1980 to the present, Congress adopted 21 budget resolutions with reconciliation instructions. Resolutions were typically adopted in April, May, or June, but some were delayed until August or October. Timely adoption of the budget resolution can expedite reconciliation legislation enactment, while delays can prolong the process. For instance, the FY2002 budget resolution was adopted 25 days late, leading to a 28-day delay in the reconciliation process. Conversely, the FY1986 resolution was adopted 108 days late, resulting in a 249-day delay in reconciliation. However, the speed of the reconciliation process is not solely determined by the budget resolution's timing. The reconciliation process can proceed quickly or slowly depending on various factors. In some years, it took 131 days and 161 days to complete reconciliation legislation after the budget resolution was adopted on time. The time given to committees to prepare their recommendations also impacts the speed of the process, with deadlines ranging from one week to over five months after the budget resolution adoption. Extensions were sometimes granted, especially to accommodate the August recess. During the August recess, submission deadlines for reconciliation bills were extended. Since 1980, the House and Senate completed action on 24 reconciliation bills, with 20 enacted into law and four vetoed. Occasionally, one chamber considered reconciliation legislation not taken up by the other. In the second session of the 106th Congress, the Marriage Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2000 was passed by both chambers but vetoed by President Clinton. The House passed five other reconciliation measures during the session, which the Senate did not act on. The Senate spent 81 days on initial consideration of 24 measures, while the House took 33 days. On average, it took 155 days to develop, consider, and enact a reconciliation bill, with half of the time spent on initial passage in both chambers. The remaining days involved conference meetings, adoption of the conference report, enrollment of the legislation, and approval by the President."
