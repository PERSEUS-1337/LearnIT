    "content": "The \"Community College Partnership Act of 2005\" aims to enhance student retention, transfer opportunities to 4-year institutions, and prepare students for high-demand occupations at community or technical colleges. The \"Community College Partnership Act of 2005\" defines a community or technical college as an institution of higher education that admits students beyond compulsory school age, does not primarily offer baccalaureate programs, and provides a 2-year program transferable to a bachelor's degree. A community or technical college must offer a 2-year program in engineering, mathematics, or the physical or biological sciences, accredited by a recognized agency, to be considered an eligible entity. The curr_chunk describes three possible partnership models for governance or coordinating boards overseeing community or technical colleges and institutions offering baccalaureate degrees. The curr_chunk discusses the authorization of grants to eligible entities for partnership models between colleges and institutions offering baccalaureate degrees. The Secretary will award 6 to 12 grants based on established criteria, and interested entities must submit applications containing required information. The Secretary will prioritize eligible entities that can address college retention and transfer issues. Grants awarded will last 5 or 6 years for planning and implementation. Funds must be used to develop policies for community college students to earn baccalaureate degrees. The program aims to enhance academic credits transfer agreements, provide support services like tutoring and counseling, and improve academic programs at community colleges to increase program quality and student participation in dual degree programs. The Secretary will prescribe regulations to implement the program, including partnerships with higher education institutions and identifying barriers to student transfers. Authorization of appropriations for the program: $70,000,000 for fiscal year 2006 and necessary sums for the following 3 years."
