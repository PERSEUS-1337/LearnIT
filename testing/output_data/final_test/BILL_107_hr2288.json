    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Asthma Awareness, Education and Treatment Act of 2001\". The Congress finds that asthma affects millions of Americans, with a significant impact on children and school absenteeism. The prevalence of asthma has increased over the years, especially among low-income families and women. Asthma disproportionately affects low-income families, with higher rates in households earning less than $10,000 compared to those earning $20,000-$35,000. In 1997, over 5,000 Americans died from asthma attacks, with higher mortality rates among African Americans compared to Caucasians. The annual cost of asthma in the US is estimated to be over $12 billion, with increasing prevalence leading to higher future costs. African Americans have higher rates of seeking emergency care for asthma and face higher death rates, especially among children. Tailored treatment programs are needed for children with asthma as exercise can sometimes trigger negative responses in asthmatics. Grants are available for asthma-related activities in low-income communities. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may provide grants for projects in low-income communities focusing on asthma, allergies, and respiratory issues. This includes screenings, education, and workshops for individuals serving children in these communities. The Secretary ensures comprehensive screenings and referrals for asthma, allergies, and respiratory issues in various settings including medical facilities, schools, community centers, and government offices. Information and education on these conditions are also provided. Information and education on asthma, allergies, and related respiratory problems is provided in the appropriate language and cultural context. It includes understanding symptoms, prevention, monitoring, and managing conditions, such as avoiding triggers and knowing about medication. The importance of developing a treatment plan for asthmatic children to engage in physical activities is emphasized in various settings, including traditional and nontraditional ones. The evaluation of projects under this program includes determining the number of low-income children benefiting from it. The evaluation of projects under this program includes determining the number of low-income children and adults who have received screenings and referrals, assessing the impact on asthma prevention and management, and evaluating the effectiveness of information materials. A condition for grant receipt is that the applicant be a community-based organization serving the low-income community where the project is located. The Secretary may make a grant under subsection (a) if an application is submitted in the required form and contains necessary information. $8,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2002, with additional funding for fiscal years 2003 through 2006.

The campaign on asthma, allergies, and respiratory problems aims to provide information, screenings, referrals, and treatment in a culturally appropriate manner. It should have universal appeal and may receive $600,000 for fiscal year 2002, with additional funding for subsequent years.
