Concerns arose over debt repayment and potential European influence, especially from France or Germany, which could threaten access to the Panama Canal. After World War I broke out, Haiti descended into factional struggles in 1915, prompting the U.S. to intervene. Admiral Caperton landed forces to restore order and administer customhouses with little resistance. Admiral Caperton landed forces in Haiti to restore order and administer customhouses. The capital was quickly taken with minimal casualties. Additional U.S. forces were called upon to control coastal areas and suppress guerrilla resistance. By the end of 1915, the marine presence was reduced, with most assigned to garrison duty. The U.S. officials ensured the election process once firmly established in major population centers. The U.S. officials quickly established an amenable president, Philippe Sudre Dartiguenave, in Haiti and implemented censorship and martial law to address ongoing unrest. A treaty ratified by Haiti in November 1915 allowed for U.S.-nominated officials to manage taxes and debt repayments, as well as create a constabulary under American direction. The 1915 treaty with Haiti was extended to twenty years in March 1917. The Haitian National Assembly was uncooperative with U.S. officials, leading to the drafting of a new constitution by the State Department. Lt. Col. Smedley D. Butler dissolved the assembly in June 1917 to ensure the approval of the new constitution by plebiscite in June 1918. The new constitution in 1918 established a Council of State appointed by the Haitian president to act as the legislative body until a new Assembly could be formed. Despite the US occupation of major towns, guerrilla groups known as cacos continued to operate in the mountainous regions, causing unrest. The marines and Gendarmerie were able to suppress the guerrilla attacks through patrols, bounties for weapons, and targeting their leaders, leading to a decrease in violence after 1920. The Gendarmerie, formerly known as the Garde d'Haiti, played a crucial role in maintaining law and order in Haiti during the US occupation. Initially led by American officers, it gradually transitioned to Haitian leadership after 1929. Despite criticisms of the occupation, historians acknowledge that the Gendarmerie effectively ensured security for Haitians and functioned as an impartial agency. During the U.S. occupation of Haiti, minimal casualties were suffered by U.S. forces, with complaints of brutality leading to a congressional investigation in 1922. The investigation found instances of illegal executions by Americans during the counterinsurgency effort against the caco rebellion. After the rebellion was suppressed, there were no further physical attacks on U.S. marines or civilians. During the U.S. occupation of Haiti, General John H. Russell, USMC, served as the senior marine and U.S. High Commissioner, consolidating civilian and military authority. He became the most powerful figure in the country, overseeing officials in finance, public works, sanitation, and agriculture. The Great Depression and declining markets for Haitian products led to economic hardships and unrest among the population, culminating in riots in Les Cayes in December 1929. The December 1929 riots in Les Cayes led to increased unrest among the population in Haiti. A detachment from the Marine Brigade in Port-au-Prince was sent to restore order, resulting in the deaths of at least 12 Haitians. President Hoover appointed a commission to investigate conditions in Haiti and proposed changes for ensuring financial stability. In November, General Russell was replaced by Dana G. Munro, who proposed changes for the stability of Haiti, including separating civil and military responsibilities, increasing Haitians in the government, and reducing intervention in domestic affairs. An Executive Agreement in 1932 led to the complete Haitianization of the Garde by October 1934 and the withdrawal of the Marine Brigade earlier than planned. President Roosevelt visited Haiti, and national elections in October 1930 resulted in a strongly nationalistic majority. The Haitianization of the Garde was completed in July 1934, with President Franklin Roosevelt visiting Cap-Haitien. The last marines departed the following month, but a U.S. financial adviser stayed until 1941 to oversee Haitian debt payments. The U.S. occupation stabilized Haitian finances, with a focus on security for investors. A $16-million U.S. loan in 1922 helped consolidate Haiti's foreign debts, leading to efficient duty collection and debt repayment under U.S. supervision. During the U.S. occupation of Haiti in the 1920s, government revenues doubled to $8-10 million annually, with a focus on debt repayment. Critics argued that funds could have been better used for domestic projects. Despite some progress in coffee production and small businesses, there was little advancement in establishing a stable economic foundation. Public works projects, including roads and bridges, were completed, some through forced labor. During the U.S. occupation of Haiti in the 1920s, public works projects were completed, including roads and bridges, facilitated by forced labor. Efforts were made to improve agricultural productivity and provide modern healthcare through a National Public Health Service financed by the United States. During the U.S. occupation of Haiti, basic medical instruction was provided, financed by the Haitian government at U.S. encouragement. The U.S. did not focus on building democracy or promoting local self-government. Haitian presidents were appointed by the Council of State under U.S. influence, with no national elections until October 1930. Newspapers were censored, and editors were jailed. During the U.S. occupation of Haiti, newspapers were censored, and editors jailed. Efforts to promote democracy were neglected due to fear of elections unfavorable to U.S. interests and racial attitudes. Racial segregation in the U.S. influenced discrimination against Haitians, hindering development projects. Education was also neglected during the occupation. During the U.S. occupation of Haiti, education was neglected, with limited efforts to improve schooling for the population. The elite sought education that did not lead to careers in commerce and industry, while technical training initiatives were not widely embraced."
