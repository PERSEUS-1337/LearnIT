The Director must submit an annual report to Congress on grant activities and their impact on community economic development. The term 'eligible partnership' includes a public library and various entities such as an economic development corporation, local government, state government, schools, museums, higher education institutions, nonprofits, and corporations.

It can be operated by a nonprofit organization, corporation, or other entities identified by the Director."
