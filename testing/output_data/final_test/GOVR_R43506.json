    "content": "Long-term services and supports (LTSS) encompass a wide range of health services needed by individuals with disabilities. This includes care in nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and private homes. The cost of LTSS can be significant, with nursing home care costing over $82,000 annually. The median annual cost of home health aide services in 2016 was about $46,000. Medicaid is the largest payer of LTSS in the United States, covering 42.5% of total LTSS expenditures in 2015. Medicaid is a means-tested entitlement program that helps low-income individuals with health care and LTSS costs. Medicaid LTSS expenditures accounted for 30.7% of total Medicaid spending in 2015, with 4.1 million enrollees receiving LTSS in FY2013. Some states are reevaluating their Medicaid programs to control LTSS spending, while Congress has enacted laws to prevent individuals from divesting financial resources to qualify for Medicaid coverage. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA) and subsequent legislation like the Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 93) and the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA) have limited individuals from divesting resources to qualify for Medicaid LTSS. This report provides an overview of the financial requirements for Medicaid LTSS eligibility. The financial requirements for Medicaid LTSS eligibility are determined by federal and state laws, with states setting criteria within federal standards. Eligibility is based on categorical groups (e.g., aged, disabled, children) and financial criteria (income and resources). Rules include spousal impoverishment, asset transfers, income treatment, and estate recovery. Individuals seeking Medicaid-covered LTSS must meet categorical groups such as the aged and disabled, along with non-financial eligibility criteria like residency and citizenship. Functional eligibility criteria at the state level are also required. Financial eligibility is complex, with federal law mandating coverage for certain groups and allowing states flexibility for others. Medicaid benefits are traditionally linked to cash assistance programs, ensuring coverage for aged and disabled individuals. In accordance with federal Medicaid law, states must provide coverage to aged and disabled individuals receiving cash assistance through the SSI program. Medicaid eligibility for this group is based on SSI program rules, with the option for states to impose stricter financial criteria. SSI rules for 2017 set monthly income limits at $735 for individuals and $1,103 for couples, along with resource limits of $2,000 for individuals and $3,000 for couples. States can also extend Medicaid coverage to other aged and disabled individuals through optional eligibility groups. States have the option to use more liberal standards for determining Medicaid eligibility for aged and disabled individuals, allowing them to ignore certain types of income and resources. This can extend coverage to individuals with higher asset levels, such as those with income up to three times the basic SSI payment level. Additionally, states can cover elderly and disabled individuals who are not considered poor by SSI standards but still need help with medical expenses through the medically needy pathway. Medicaid eligibility for aged and disabled individuals can be determined using more liberal standards, allowing coverage for those with higher income and resources. The rules for financial eligibility vary, with some individuals needing to \"spend-down\" their income and resources to specified levels. MAGI rules apply to most non-elderly populations, including those eligible under the ACA Medicaid expansion. No additional resource requirements are used for MAGI individuals. In ACA Medicaid expansion states, individuals under 65 with disabilities and LTSS needs are likely to qualify for Medicaid under optional eligibility. Some adults with disabilities who need LTSS may qualify for Medicaid under the ACA Medicaid expansion, subject to MAGI financial eligibility rules. States have the option to include LTSS for individuals in the ACA Medicaid expansion group. The ACA Medicaid expansion allows states to include LTSS for certain newly eligible enrollees. States implementing the expansion must provide coverage through ABPs, which include EHBs. Some groups are exempt from mandatory ABP enrollment and must be offered a benefit plan with Medicaid state plan services. Adult beneficiaries may be eligible for mandatory LTSS like nursing facility services and optional state plan LTSS like personal care services. Some states may also choose to include LTSS in their ABPs. Prior to the ACA Medicaid expansion, eligibility pathways for adults with disabilities needing LTSS required income and resource standards. Under the expansion, adults with disabilities may receive LTSS without specified resource standards, raising beneficiary equity issues. CMS guidance explains how LTSS-related resource rules apply to MAGI individuals, impacting Medicaid eligibility assessment based on assets falling into income or resource categories. Assets fall into two categories: income and resources. Income includes earned and unearned income, while resources are cash or other liquid assets that can be converted to cash. States have flexibility in determining income and resource requirements for Medicaid eligibility groups. SSI program rules are used for financial eligibility, with options for more restrictive requirements in certain states. Resources may be counted based on their entire value or excluded under SSI program rules. Under SSI program rules, resources can be counted based on their entire value, excluded entirely, or excluded partially. Counted resources include liquid assets like bank accounts, stocks, and bonds. Excluded resources are a primary residence, personal items, essential property for income, and burial space. One automobile is excluded regardless of value if used for transportation. Burial funds and certain life insurance have partial value exclusion. For Medicaid eligibility under SSI program rules, the equity value of a home may impact receiving Medicaid covered LTSS. Federal law limits eligibility if home equity exceeds a set amount ($560,000 in 2017, potentially higher at state discretion). Exceptions apply for spouses, children under 21, or disabled children living in the home. States can choose to waive this rule if it causes hardship. For Medicaid LTSS eligibility, individuals with home equity above the state limit can use a reverse mortgage or home equity loan to reduce their equity interest. Proceeds must be spent or repaid to the lender in the same month to be excluded from countable resources. Any remaining amount in the following month counts against the state's limit, requiring depletion before qualifying for Medicaid LTSS. Medicaid LTSS eligibility rules include spousal impoverishment rules to protect the community spouse from impoverishment. States must establish income and resource amounts for the community spouse within federal limits, which are not applied towards the qualifying spouse's Medicaid eligibility or LTSS costs. In Medicaid LTSS eligibility, spousal impoverishment rules protect the community spouse from impoverishment by exempting their income from being considered for the institutionalized spouse. The community spouse's minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance ranges from $2,002 to $3,022, determined by the state. States can adjust this amount through a hearing requested by either spouse. Medicaid allows for additional income and resource allowances for the community spouse, with states having the flexibility to set minimum amounts within federal limits. All resources of the couple are combined and split equally, with the community spouse able to retain a minimum amount set by the state. If the community spouse's resources are below the state threshold, the Medicaid applicant must transfer their share of resources. The Medicaid applicant must transfer resources to the community spouse until their share reaches the state threshold. All other non-exempt resources must be depleted before qualifying for Medicaid. Spousal impoverishment rules now apply to beneficiaries receiving home and community-based services. The rules for Medicaid LTSS eligibility apply to individuals receiving HCBS through various waiver authorities and state plan amendments. These rules aim to prevent asset transfers for quicker Medicaid eligibility. Medicaid may require states to delay eligibility for applicants seeking LTSS who have disposed of assets for less than fair market value during a five-year \"look-back\" period. Spouses of applicants are also prohibited from transferring assets for less than FMV during this period. These rules apply to MAGI individuals seeking coverage for Medicaid LTSS. Applicants are asked about any transfers of monetary value during the look-back period to determine if a transfer for less than FMV occurred. During a five-year \"look-back\" period, Medicaid assesses transfers for fair market value (FMV). Improper transfers result in a penalty of ineligibility for Medicaid LTSS, calculated by dividing the transfer amount by the average monthly private pay rate for nursing facility services. The penalty period starts on the transfer date or when the individual is eligible for Medicaid. States may waive penalties for asset transfers if the applicant can demonstrate intent to transfer assets for FMV, transferred assets for a different purpose, or recovered previously transferred assets. Ineligibility for Medicaid coverage is limited to certain LTSS, and individuals may still be eligible for other Medicaid services. Certain asset transfers during the five-year look back period are not subject to penalties, such as transfers for FMV, transfers to spouses, and transfers to children with disabilities. Additionally, a home may be excluded from asset transfer penalties under certain conditions. For Medicaid asset transfer rules, all resources and income are evaluated to determine if assets were transferred for less than fair market value. Certain family members, like spouses, children under 21, disabled children, or those who provided care to delay institutionalization, are exempt from penalties. States typically follow SSI program rules for asset treatment. Medicaid law includes special rules but does not specify treatment for all assets. The Medicaid law includes special rules for asset treatment, such as annuities, CCRC fees, life estates, promissory notes, loans, mortgages, and trusts. The Secretary of HHS can issue guidance on other asset transactions. An annuity converts a sum of money into guaranteed future payments, affecting Medicaid eligibility by converting a countable asset into countable income during the look-back period. An annuity during the look-back period converts a countable asset into countable income. Federal Medicaid law outlines rules for annuities, including being irrevocable, non-assignable, purchased from a commercial insurance company, and paying back in equal monthly payments. These annuities are known as \"Medicaid compliant\" or Medicaid qualified annuities. Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs) offer housing and services, including long-term care, to older individuals. They provide various levels of care such as independent living, assisted living, and nursing facility care. CCRCs are primarily paid with private funds, but some also accept Medicaid. Residents of CCRCs or life care communities are required to spend their declared resources on care before applying for Medicaid. Federal law considers certain entrance fees as countable resources for Medicaid eligibility. A life estate allows individuals to possess, use, and profit from a property while another owns it. The purchase of a life estate allows the older individuals to retain possession and use of the home while the child has a remainder interest. Medicaid asset transfer rules apply, considering it a transfer for less than fair market value unless certain conditions are met. The penalty for not meeting specific requirements in promissory notes, loans, or mortgages is the outstanding balance due at the time of Medicaid application. Trusts are considered assets for care costs, and transferring them for less than fair market value can have consequences. Medicaid law distinguishes between revocable and irrevocable trusts, with rules for asset treatment outlined. A revocable trust can be altered after establishment, while an irrevocable trust cannot be changed. In a revocable trust, assets are considered available resources to the individual, with payments from the trust being counted as income. In an irrevocable trust, assets and payments are considered income and resources of the individual if payments can be made for their benefit. An irrevocable trust is subject to asset transfer rules, with states required to establish procedures for waiving these rules in cases of undue hardship. Medicaid has post-eligibility treatment of income rules for beneficiaries living in institutions or receiving HCBS waiver services. Beneficiaries receiving Medicaid LTSS in institutional facilities can retain a monthly personal needs allowance (PNA) from their income for personal expenses. The PNA is meant to cover items not included in the facility's basic charge, such as clothing. Medicaid statute requires states to allow individuals in nursing facilities to retain a minimum PNA of at least $30 per month, though the amount can vary by state. For beneficiaries enrolled in Section 1915(c) HCBS waivers, a monthly maintenance needs allowance (MMNA) is permitted to cover living expenses in the community. Beneficiaries can retain an MMNA for housing, food, and personal expenses, with the rest of their income going towards care costs. States must set a maximum MMNA amount based on need. Post-eligibility rules do not apply to Medicaid beneficiaries based on MAGI eligibility. The CMS is considering expanding post-eligibility rules to include MAGI individuals receiving LTSS coverage for equity reasons. States are required to recover Medicaid costs from beneficiary estates, including individuals in nursing facilities or ICF/DD and those aged 55 and older who received Medicaid. States are required to recover Medicaid costs from beneficiary estates, including individuals in nursing facilities or ICF/DD and those aged 55 and older who received Medicaid assistance. Estate recovery is limited to assets owned by the beneficiary at the time of recovery, such as their home and certain other assets. Medicaid statute defines an estate as all real and personal property subject to probate law, with the option for states to expand this definition to include other assets. States may expand the definition of estate to include other real or personal property and assets to which the Medicaid beneficiary has legal title or interest at the time of death. Estate recovery can only occur after the death of the individual and their surviving spouse, if any, and when there are no surviving children under age 21 or blind/permanently disabled children of any age. States can impose liens on certain beneficiaries' property before or after death if the individual resides in a nursing facility, ICF/DD, or other medical institution, and it is determined they cannot return home. Liens may also be placed based on a court's judgment of improperly paid Medicaid payments. Medicaid law prohibits states from placing liens on an individual's home in certain circumstances, such as if a surviving spouse, child under 21, blind/permanently disabled child, or sibling with equity interest resides in the home. Liens must be dissolved if the individual returns home from an institution. Liens only apply to beneficiaries receiving institutional care subject to post-eligibility treatment of income rules. MAGI individuals not subject to PETI are exempt from liens. CMS is considering expanding PETI rules to include MAGI individuals receiving LTSS coverage. Medicaid law allows exemptions for estate recovery in cases of undue hardship and when recovery is not cost-effective. Liens on homes are prohibited if certain individuals reside there, such as siblings or adult children meeting specific criteria. Medicaid estate recovery rules may create barriers to enrollment for some newly eligible individuals in ACA Medicaid expansion states. CMS is exploring options to eliminate estate recovery for certain individuals, including adult children who provided care to delay the need for nursing facility services. Special provisions apply to those who become eligible for Medicaid under a more liberal asset standard. CMS is considering eliminating estate recovery for certain Medicaid beneficiaries, including those who receive benefits other than LTSS and are 55 and older. States already have the authority to limit estate recovery for this group."
