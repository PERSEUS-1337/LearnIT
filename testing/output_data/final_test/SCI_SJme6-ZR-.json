    "content": "The goal of survival clustering is to map subjects to clusters based on risk levels. This paper introduces a loss function that differentiates between lifetime distributions of clusters using a modified Kuiper statistic. A deep neural network is trained using this loss function for soft clustering of users into survival groups. The method is applied to a social network dataset with significant improvement in C-index compared to alternatives. Survival clustering aims to assign subjects into clusters based on risk levels. A new loss function is introduced to differentiate between lifetime distributions of clusters using a modified Kuiper statistic. A deep neural network is trained with this loss function for soft clustering of users into survival groups, showing improved C-index in a social network dataset. In this work, the lifetime clustering problem is addressed without end-of-life signals for the first time. Two possible datasets are described where this clustering approach could be applied, including a social network dataset with users joining at different times and participating in activities. Covariates such as age, gender, and number of friends are considered, with censoring due to a fixed point of data collection denoted as tm. In this case, censoring is due to a fixed point of data collection denoted as tm. Time till censoring for a user is the time from her last activity to tm. Lifetime of a user is defined as the time from joining till account deletion. In a medical dataset, subjects are checked for a disease with covariates being attributes of disease-causing cells. Time to censoring is the difference between last observation of disease presence and final observation. Lifetime of the disease is from first observation to permanent cure. Using a deep neural network and a new loss function, we cluster subjects without end-of-life signals, addressing the challenge of unsupervised clustering without pre-defined end-of-life timeout. The problem is complex due to the lack of a hazard function to define the \"cure\" rate for diseases. Our contribution is a loss function and backpropagation algorithm using deep neural networks for unsupervised clustering of subjects based on their latent lifetime distributions, even without end-of-life signals. The algorithm can assign subjects into categories from high-risk to low-risk individuals. Our method uses deep neural networks for unsupervised clustering of subjects based on their latent lifetime distributions, assigning them into categories from high-risk to low-risk individuals. The approach is shown to be more robust than competing methods and achieves better clusters with higher C-index scores. Deep neural networks are chosen for their ability to generalize well despite overfitting in training data, unlike traditional optimization methods prone to p-hacking. In section 3, traditional survival analysis concepts are discussed assuming end-of-life signals. Section 4 introduces a loss function quantifying divergence between lifetime distributions of clusters without end-of-life signals, with a neural network optimization approach. The dataset used in experiments and results are presented in section 5. Section 6 covers related literature methods, while section 7 concludes by defining the statistical framework for the clustering approach introduced. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of the dataset with covariates and observed inter-event times, as well as the lifetime clustering problem for the dataset. It defines the latent lifetime distribution of subjects in clusters and aims to find a mapping for clustering based on covariates. The curr_chunk discusses clustering subjects based on covariates to maximize divergence between latent lifetime distributions. It uses a Random Marked Point Processes (RMPP) to define activity processes within clusters. The curr_chunk discusses defining lifetime and censored lifetimes using Random Marked Point Processes (RMPP) for clustered subjects based on covariates. The lifetime of a subject in cluster k is defined by a random variable, and censored lifetimes are defined using \u03a6 k. The random variable defines the last observed action time of a subject in a cluster. The challenge lies in not knowing when the end-of-life signal is reached, affecting the decision of censoring subjects. A probability of end-of-life is introduced to address this issue. Key concepts in survival analysis are reviewed, assuming an Oracle provides end-of-life signals for each subject. In survival analysis, the lifetime distribution and hazard function are key concepts. The hazard function represents the rate of death of a subject at a given time, while the lifetime distribution is the probability of a subject surviving until a specific time. Right-censoring complicates the observation of true lifetimes, even with end-of-life signals. The Kaplan-Meier method estimates lifetime distribution for subjects with right censoring. Cox regression model estimates hazard function using covariates. The Cox regression model assumes constant hazard ratios over time, but this assumption is often violated in real-world datasets. Survival based clustering methods have been proposed, including semi-supervised clustering using Cox scores and unsupervised clustering algorithms like k-means. Supervised sparse clustering has also been suggested as a modification to existing algorithms. In this paper, a modification to the sparse clustering algorithm is proposed, using distinct weights in the feature set. The goal is to cluster subjects into K groups based on survival distributions, without relying on end-of-life signals. A loss function is introduced to quantify the divergence between survival distributions of the clusters, which is minimized using a neural network to obtain optimal clusters. The aim is to create statistically significant differences in empirical lifetime distributions among the clusters. In this paper, a loss function is introduced based on divergence measures between empirical lifetime distributions of two groups, considering uncertainty about end-of-life. A probability of end-of-life is defined for each subject, discouraging highly imbalanced groups. This approach motivates the use of two-sample tests for probability distributions. The paper introduces a loss function based on divergence measures between empirical lifetime distributions of two groups, considering uncertainty about end-of-life. This approach motivates the use of two-sample tests for probability distributions, such as the Kuiper statistic to increase the statistical power of distinguishing distribution tails. The paper introduces a loss function based on divergence measures between empirical lifetime distributions of two groups, considering uncertainty about end-of-life. The goal is to optimize the Kuiper loss by soft clustering subjects into two clusters and calculating the probability of end-of-life. The loss function returns the logarithm of a p-value from the Kuiper statistic, with properties outlined in Theorem 1. The loss function introduced in the paper optimizes the Kuiper loss by soft clustering subjects into two clusters and calculating the probability of end-of-life. It solves issues such as the need for clear end-of-life signals, requires a sufficient number of examples in both groups, works for crossing survival curves, and accounts for differences at the tails. The probability of a subject being in cluster 0 is defined using a neural network. The paper introduces a loss function that optimizes the Kuiper loss by clustering subjects and calculating end-of-life probabilities. It assumes end-of-life probability is an increasing function of a subject's last activity. The function is defined using a neural network and does not depend on covariates. The paper introduces a loss function that optimizes the Kuiper loss by clustering subjects and calculating end-of-life probabilities based on a smooth non-decreasing function of a subject's last activity. The function is defined using a neural network and does not depend on covariates. The approach allows for learning the window size parameter and can be extended to K clusters by increasing the number of units in the output layer. The paper introduces a loss function that optimizes the Kuiper loss by clustering subjects and calculating end-of-life probabilities. A softmax function is applied at the output layer to define a soft clustering into K groups. The total loss for K groups is defined as the average of pairwise losses between individual groups. A feedforward neural network is implemented in Theano to optimize the loss function. The paper discusses optimizing the loss function by clustering subjects and calculating end-of-life probabilities using a feedforward neural network implemented in Theano. It involves L2 regularization, experimenting with neural network sizes, activation functions, weight initialization techniques, and applying deep learning techniques like batch normalization and dropout. The study analyzes a large-scale social network dataset from Friendster with 15 million users and 335 million friendship links. The dataset from Friendster includes 15 million users with 335 million friendship links. A subset of 1.1 million users with profile information participated in commenting. The data is available for public use. The dataset for clustering includes user profile features like age, gender, relationship status, occupation, and location. In the dataset from Friendster, 60 features were constructed for each model, including user activity over 5 months. Y u,i represents the time between a user's comments, and q(u) is the total number of comments a user participated in. Different neural network architectures were experimented with, showing results for a simple configuration with one hidden layer. The neural network configuration includes one hidden layer with 128 units and tanh activation. Batch size is 8192, learning rate is 10^-4, and L2 penalty of 0.01 is used for weight regularization. Models are evaluated using 10-fold cross validation, with 20% of training data used for validation. Comparison is made with two survival-based clustering methods in literature. The study compares two clustering methods, BID3 and BID17, using a 10-month window to identify end-of-life signals. The approach is tested with and without these signals, optimizing the loss function accordingly. Additionally, a loss function based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic is experimented with, and the clusters are evaluated using the concordance index. The study evaluates clustering methods BID3 and BID17 using a 10-month window to detect end-of-life signals. Concordance Index is used to assess the model's ability to predict survival order. The proposed neural network approach shows better performance with lower standard deviations compared to other methods. The proposed neural network approach outperforms other methods in detecting end-of-life signals in the Friendster dataset. Despite theoretical advantages, there is no significant performance difference between NN-Kuiper and NN-KS. Empirical lifetime distributions show distinct clusters at K = 2 but not at K = 3, 4, indicating only two types of users in the dataset. Increasing the number of clusters does not result in significant improvement in C-index values. In the Friendster dataset, there are two types of users - long-lived and short-lived. Survival analysis focuses on predicting outcomes with high feature-to-subject ratios. Feature selection methods have been proposed for survival data. In social networks, predicting relationship building time is explored. Unsupervised approaches identify cancer subtypes without survival consideration. Traditional clustering methods struggle with right censoring issues. Semi-supervised and supervised clustering methods are being explored. Recently, there has been a proposal for a nonparametric Bayesian approach for survival analysis in cases with multiple competing events. This approach considers end-of-life signals and the type of event causing the end-of-life. A deep neural network is used to predict the probability of survival at a specific point in time, optimizing a loss based on Cox's partial likelihood with a penalty. This work introduces the task of survival-based clustering using neural networks, which has not been explored before. In this work, a Kuiper-based nonparametric loss function and backpropagation procedure are introduced to train a neural network for clustering subjects into low-risk/high-risk groups without observing end-of-life signals. Unlike frailty models, this approach does not assume proportional hazards and aims to assign observed subject covariates into survival-based clusters. The study introduced a neural network to assign subject covariates into survival-based clusters without an end-of-life signal. The network produced clusters with better C-index values than other methods, showing only two user groups in the dataset. The proof involved defining a stochastic process to distinguish lifetime distributions in the clusters. The study introduced a neural network to assign subject covariates into survival-based clusters without an end-of-life signal, producing clusters with better C-index values. The distribution of S 0 (t;\u03ba,p) and S 1 (t;\u03ba,p) is distinct, with Kuiper score asymptotically equal to one or zero, depending on \u03ba and p. Clustering based on covariates results in random assignment, as there are no dependencies between covariates and subject lifetime. The censoring time of subjects in both clusters has the same distribution, leading to H 0 and H 1 having the same distributions. The study introduced a neural network for clustering subject covariates without an end-of-life signal, resulting in clusters with improved C-index values. The Kuiper p-value test shows H 0 and H 1 have the same distributions, with the C-index (%) shown in Table 4 for the proposed NN approach with Kuiper loss."
