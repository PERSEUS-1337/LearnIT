    "content": "The \"Accelerating Carbon Capture and Sequestration Act of 2008\" is also known as the SEC. 45Q, which provides a tax credit for carbon dioxide sequestration. The SEC. 45Q tax credit provides $20 per metric ton for captured carbon dioxide disposed of in geological storage and $10 per metric ton for carbon dioxide used in enhanced oil or gas recovery projects. Qualified carbon dioxide is defined as carbon dioxide captured from an industrial source. Qualified carbon dioxide is carbon dioxide captured from an industrial source that would otherwise be released as a greenhouse gas emission. It is measured at the capture source and verified at disposal or injection. The term includes the initial deposit used as a tertiary injectant but excludes recycled carbon dioxide used in enhanced oil and gas recovery. A qualified facility is an industrial facility owned by the taxpayer where carbon capture equipment is in service. The carbon capture equipment must capture at least 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide during the taxable year. The credit applies only to qualified carbon dioxide captured and stored or used within the United States. It must be stored in secure geological storage or used in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project within the country. The Secretary will establish regulations for secure geological storage of carbon dioxide to prevent its escape into the atmosphere. This includes storage at deep saline formations and unminable coal seams. The term 'tertiary injectant' has the same meaning as in section 193(b)(1). Qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery projects are defined. The term 'qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project' is defined as capturing and disposing of qualified carbon dioxide. The Secretary will establish regulations for recapturing any credits allowed for this purpose. The tax credit for qualified carbon dioxide under subsection (a) is subject to inflation adjustment starting in 2009. The credit applies before the end of the calendar year determined by the Secretary. The tax credit for qualified carbon dioxide is subject to inflation adjustment and applies before the end of the calendar year when 75,000,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide have been captured and disposed of or used as a tertiary injectant. Amendments are made to the Internal Revenue Code to include the carbon dioxide sequestration credit. The amendments made by this section apply to carbon dioxide captured after the enactment of this Act."
