    "content": "Indian tribes are quasi-sovereign entities with unique rights, considered \"domestic dependent nations.\" They retain self-government rights but are subordinate to the US. Courts have debated whether statutes like the NLRA, which doesn't mention tribes, apply to them. The NLRA grants employees the right to bargain collectively and obligates employers to negotiate in good faith. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) exempted tribal employers from the NLRA in 1976, but later abandoned the exemption for tribal employers off tribal land. Since 2004, the NLRB enforces the NLRA against tribal casinos, but the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act of 2015 aims to exclude tribal enterprises from the NLRA. The NLRB's position on enforcing the NLRA against tribal employers has evolved over time. In 1976, the Board considered the application of the NLRA to tribal employers in the Fort Apache Timber Co. case involving the White Mountain Apache Tribe. The NLRB later abandoned the exemption for tribal employers off tribal land and currently enforces the NLRA against tribal casinos. The Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act of 2015 aims to exclude tribal enterprises from the NLRA. The NLRB explored the legal status of Indian tribes and their sovereignty in relation to the NLRA. While the tribal timber company was not excluded from the definition of \"employer,\" the NLRB concluded it was \"implicitly exempt\" under the NLRA. The Board compared it to a utility district owned by private individuals, which was exempt as a political subdivision of a state. The Fort Apache Timber Company is administered by individuals responsible to the Tribal Council. The Timber Company, controlled by the Tribal Council of the White Mountain Apache Tribe, is considered exempt from the NLRA as a governmental entity. The NLRB's reasoning in Fort Apache Timber Co. and Southern Indian Health Council exempted tribal employers on reservations, but not those located outside like Sac and Fox Industries. The NLRB considered the application of the NLRA to tribal employers located off reservations, citing the need to determine when statutes of general applicability apply to tribes. The NLRB referenced the Supreme Court's opinion that general statutes apply to all persons, including Indians and their property. The NLRB found that a tribal business was subject to the NLRA, as it did not fit any exceptions that would exempt tribes from general statutes. The NLRB asserted jurisdiction over off-reservation tribal employers in cases like Yukon Kuskoksim Health Corp. The Board considered the location of the tribal employer determinative in applying the NLRA. In 2004, the NLRB decided in San Manuel Indian Bingo and Casino to reject the location-based test used in previous cases like Fort Apache and Sac and Fox Industries. This decision was influenced by the increasing number of non-Indians employed by tribal businesses and their competition with non-tribal employers. The NLRB overturned Fort Apache and modified Sac and Fox Industries, applying the NLRA to the tribal casino on a reservation. They adopted the Tuscarora/Coeur d'Alene test and assessed their discretionary jurisdiction to balance federal labor policy and federal Indian policy. The NLRB applied the NLRA to tribal enterprises that employ non-Indians, compete with non-tribal businesses, and engage in interstate commerce. This decision aimed to protect interstate commerce while respecting tribal sovereignty and statutory schemes. The NLRB applied a framework to determine the applicability of the NLRA to tribal activities, considering the tribe's self-government of internal matters and autonomy. In the case of San Manuel Indian Bingo and Casino, the NLRB concluded that applying the NLRA would fulfill its purpose. The casino's argument that NLRA interference would affect tribal self-governance was rejected. The NLRB narrowly interpreted the self-government exception in the Coeur d'Alene case, leading to the application of the NLRA to the San Manuel Indian Bingo and Casino. The casino appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which upheld the NLRB's decision using a different analysis. Despite the different reasoning, the NLRB continued to apply its Tuscarora/Coeur d'Alene test in subsequent enforcement actions. The tribes have argued against the NLRA's application to their casinos, but the NLRB has consistently analyzed and enforced it. In Little River Band, the NLRB enforced the NLRA against a tribal casino owned by the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians. The Tribe argued that it had inherent sovereignty over labor relations on its reservation, but the Board rejected this, stating that the labor ordinance regulating casino workers did not fall within the self-government exception. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the Board's ruling. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the Board's ruling on tribal jurisdiction over non-members at the periphery of the tribe's sovereignty. The Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan challenged the NLRB's jurisdiction to apply the NLRA to its casino, arguing that its treaties guaranteed its right to self-government and exclusive use of the reservation. The Tribe contended that the NLRA did not apply under the Tuscarora / Coeur d'Alene test. The NLRB found that the Tribe's casino operation did not fall under the self-government exception as it is a commercial activity employing non-Indians and competing with non-Indian businesses. Despite the Tribe's treaty right to exclusive use of the reservation, the Board ruled that this \"general\" treaty right was not enough to exempt them from federal law, as it would set a precedent for other federal laws not applying to treaty-created reservations. The NLRB found that the Tribe's casino operation, a commercial venture competing with non-Indian businesses, did not qualify for the self-government exception. Despite the Tribe's treaty right to exclusive use of the reservation, the Board ruled that this \"general\" treaty right was not sufficient to exempt them from federal law, as it would set a precedent for other federal laws not applying to treaty-created reservations. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit upheld the NLRB's enforcement of the NLRA against the casino, noting that policy considerations favored applying the NLRA in this case. The Chickasaw Nation argued that the NLRA should not apply under the Tuscarora / Coeur d'Alene test due to treaty rights guaranteed by the 1830 Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek. The Board focused on Article 4 of the treaty, stating that the Tribe will not be subject to all laws except those enacted by their National Councils or Congress for Indian Affairs. The Board concluded that the NLRA applies to the Tribe's casino operation. The NLRB concluded that the NLRA does not apply to the Tribe due to a treaty that guarantees specific rights. The 1866 treaty with the United States grants Congress and the President legislative power over the Tribe for the better administration of justice and protection of rights within Indian Territory. However, the NLRB rejected the argument that this treaty gives broad legislative power over the Tribe. The NLRB concluded that the NLRA does not apply to the Tribe due to a treaty guaranteeing specific rights. The Board found that the 1830 and 1866 treaties were compatible, preserving the Tribe's rights under Article 4. The NLRB's decision was based on the compatibility of the treaties, stating that enforcing the NLRA against the casino would abrogate specific treaty rights of the Tribe. The NLRB enforces the NLRA against tribal casinos following the San Manuel analysis, which considers labor and Indian policy interests. Tribes argue against NLRA application, citing sovereignty and self-government rights. Courts reject arguments, viewing casinos as commercial enterprises, not governmental activities. Treaty rights are also invoked, but the Board rejects these arguments. The Board rejected the self-government argument for the same reasons it rejected the argument in Little River Band. It concluded that the right to exclude guaranteed by the treaty was a \"general\" right that did not qualify for the treaty right exception under Coeur d'Alene. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, bound by the precedent of Little River Band, upheld application of the NLRA to the casino. In Chickasaw Nation, the tribe argued that its treaty right to self-government, its right to exclude, and its right to be free of federal laws exempted its casino from the NLRA. The Board accepted that the \"specific\" treaty right to be free of federal laws, except those concerning Indian affairs, would be abrogated by application of the NLRA. Therefore, it concluded the NLRA did not apply. The Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act of 2015, H.R. 511 and S. 248, would amend the definition of employer to exclude any enterprise. The Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act of 2015, H.R. 511 and S. 248, aims to exclude tribal enterprises located within reservations or on tribal trust land from the NLRA. It defines \"Indian lands\" to include lands within reservations, trust lands, and former reservation lands in Oklahoma. This bill would reinstate a location-based test for NLRA applicability. The bill would reinstate a location-based test similar to the one overturned in San Manuel."
