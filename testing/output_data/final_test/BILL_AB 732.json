    "title": "AB 732",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The fee for recording a brand in Section 20751 of the Food and Agricultural Code is $70. Owners must pay a biennial renewal fee of $70 in Section 20754 to continue using the brand. Section 20755 provides exceptions to this renewal fee requirement. Section 20755 of the Food and Agricultural Code allows the owner of a recorded brand to pay in advance a multiple of $70 by April 30, entitling them to use the brand for 2-10 years at a rate of $35 per year. Biennial renewals are not required if advance payment is made. If the right to use a brand is suspended due to non-payment, it can be reinstated within one year by paying the biennial renewal fee of $70 plus a $25 penalty fee. Section 20757 amends the fee for rerecording a forfeited or canceled brand to $140, or $70 if a penalty has been paid. Section 20758 sets the fee for recording a brand transfer at $70. Section 21060.4 states that inspection is not required for cattle sales or ownership transfers if the controlling interest remains unchanged. The cattle with unchanged controlling interest cannot be moved out of state or a modified inspection area. Ownership transfer requires self-certification within 30 days on a prescribed form. A fee may be charged for processing the form, not exceeding $50. Owners of exempt cattle can opt for inspection. Section 21283 of the Food and Agricultural Code is amended to require inspection fees to be paid at the point of inspection. The fee for inspection varies depending on the type of animal and location, ranging from $0.43 to $1.25 per animal. Violation of this section will result in penalties as described in Section 21051.3. Section 21283.5 of the Food and Agricultural Code is amended to require a fee of $1.25 per animal for private treaty transaction inspections. Section 21285 specifies the same fee for inspections before sale at public saleyards. Section 21288 is also amended regarding inspection fees. In modified point-of-origin inspection areas, the fee for inspecting cattle transported out of the area for purposes other than sale or slaughter is $1.25 per head. This fee also applies to cattle transported out of the state for non-sale or slaughter purposes with no change of ownership. Section 21563 of the Food and Agricultural Code is amended to set the fee for inspection of each carcass or hide at $1.70, except in areas with point-of-origin inspection where the fee remains the same. No reimbursement is required by this act according to the California Constitution because any costs incurred by a local agency or school district will be due to the creation, elimination, or change in penalties for crimes or infractions."
