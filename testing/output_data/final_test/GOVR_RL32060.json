    "content": "The World Trade Organization (WTO) has 157 member countries, representing over 95% of world trade flows. It was established in 1995 as a successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Decisions within the WTO are made by member countries through consensus. High-level policy decisions are made by the Ministerial Conference, while operational decisions are made by the General Council. The General Council of the WTO, with representatives from member countries, meets monthly and rotates its chair annually. The United States, an original signatory to the GATT, plays a significant role in shaping decisions within the WTO. Periodic negotiations, known as \"rounds,\" aim to revise or establish trade rules, with broader negotiations offering potential economic benefits, especially for developing countries. The fourth WTO Ministerial Conference in Doha, Qatar, in November 2001 led to a new round of multilateral trade negotiations. The negotiations focused on expanding trade in agriculture and services to achieve greater trade liberalization. Developing countries benefit from multilateral negotiations to prevent exclusion from selective agreements. Trade liberalization can also result in job losses and economic dislocations. The Doha Ministerial in November 2001 led to new multilateral trade negotiations aimed at greater trade liberalization. The negotiations were driven by various factors, including the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, a weakened world economy, and the rise of regional trade agreements. There is debate over the impact of regional agreements on the multilateral system. Some experts argue that regional agreements can be more effective in opening markets due to easier negotiations and greater liberalization. However, others believe these agreements violate the WTO's nondiscrimination principle, exclude many poor countries, and divert resources from WTO negotiations. Trade ministers met in Doha against a backdrop of economic challenges and adopted documents outlining future actions, including a broad agenda covering industrial tariffs and topics relevant to developing countries. The Doha Ministerial meeting adopted documents outlining a broad agenda covering industrial tariffs, topics relevant to developing countries, changes to WTO rules, and other provisions. Developing countries became more forceful in demanding their interests be addressed, leading to a shift in decision-making dynamics at the Ministerial Conference. At the Doha Ministerial meeting, trade ministers agreed on the Doha Development Agenda, with negotiations to be concluded by January 1, 2005. The outcome would be a single comprehensive agreement with a balance of concessions. Progress has been slow, with significant issues unresolved. Negotiations in the Doha Development Agenda round have been slow, with persistent disagreement on key issues. The 5th Ministerial Conference in Canc\u00fan in 2003 failed to reach an agreement, leading to a loss of momentum and doubts about meeting the January 1, 2005 deadline. The collapse was due to unresolved differences, particularly over the Singapore issues. The 5th Ministerial Conference in Cancun in 2003 faced challenges as developing countries refused to consider Singapore issues, some countries lacked serious negotiation intentions, wide differences between developing and developed countries hindered progress, and there was criticism of the meeting's procedure. At the end of the Cancun Ministerial meeting, trade ministers issued a declaration to continue working on outstanding issues and scheduled a General Council meeting by December 15, 2003. Ministerial chairman Derbez appointed facilitators to assist in negotiations on agriculture, non-agricultural market access, development issues, Singapore issues, and other topics, with the WTO Director-General leading discussions on cotton. The facilitators consulted with trade ministers and produced draft texts from their group consultations. The Derbez text, widely criticized at Cancun, drew on U.S.-EU and Group of 20 proposals for agriculture, offering better terms for developing countries and eliminating export subsidies. It also included new negotiations on government in the Singapore issues. After the standstill at Cancun, negotiations were suspended in 2003. In early 2004, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick proposed focusing on market access and eliminating agricultural export subsidies to move the round forward. This intervention revived interest in negotiations, leading to a Framework Agreement in July 2004 that addressed key issues like agriculture. The Framework Agreement in July 2004 addressed key issues in agriculture, providing guidelines for future discussions. However, negotiations in 2005 reached a stalemate, leading to increased importance on the 6th Ministerial in Hong Kong as a potential last opportunity to settle key issues before the 2007 deadline. Despite a flurry of negotiations, a comprehensive agreement on modalities was not reached. Pascal Lamy announced in November 2005 that a comprehensive agreement on modalities would not be forthcoming in Hong Kong. The final Ministerial Declaration of December 18, 2005, reflected areas of agreement in agriculture, industrial tariffs, and duty-free access for least developed countries. New deadlines were set for concluding negotiations by the end of 2006, including establishing modalities for agriculture and NAMA by April 30, 2006. On April 21, 2006, WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy announced no consensus for agreement on modalities by the April 30 deadline. Trade negotiators failed to reach agreement at a high-level meeting in Geneva on June 30-July 1, 2006. Director-General Pascal Lamy would conduct consultations to achieve agricultural and industrial modalities, proposing the \"20-20-20 proposal\" for the United States to accept a ceiling on domestic farm subsidies under $20. The offer proposed a ceiling on domestic farm subsidies under $20 billion and suggested using the Group of 20 proposal for tariff cuts. Despite criticism, the G-8 leaders pledged to reach an agreement on negotiating modalities for agriculture and industrial market access. However, talks were suspended by Director-General Lamy after a negotiating session failed to break the impasse. The United States, EU, Japan, Australia, Brazil, and India failed to reach an agreement on agricultural tariffs and subsidies. The EU blamed the US for lack of improvement in domestic support offers, while the US stated that no new market access offers were made by the EU or Group of 20. Talks were suspended in July 2006, but resumed in January 2007 with key players like the G-4 engaging in negotiations. In early 2007, G-4 and G-6 negotiations aimed to conclude the round by the end of the year. However, a G-4 summit in Potsdam collapsed in June 2007 over conflicting demands on agricultural subsidies and industrial tariffs. Despite setbacks, draft texts were proposed in July 2007 as a basis for concessions. Revisions to texts circulated in 2008 after negotiations in Geneva. Despite criticism, texts kept parties engaged. Summit in July 2008 aimed to reach agreement but failed due to disagreements on agriculture. Director-General Lamy claimed progress on 18 of 20 issues. The talks broke up with convergence on 18 of 20 issues. Brazilian President Lula da Silva expressed frustration, mentioning obstacles in agriculture, NAMA, and intellectual property rights talks. G-20 summit in November 2008 aimed to reach an agreement by year's end on Doha Round modalities. New draft texts were issued in December 2008, but differences between parties remained unresolved. Some states called for negotiations based on the December 2008 draft texts. The United States has pursued bilateral talks with developing countries to determine market access commitments. Despite G-20 leaders' exhortations, no breakthrough was achieved in 2009. The Seventh Ministerial Conference of the WTO in 2009 aimed to avoid negotiations on the Round. Ministerials focused on the Doha Round, aiming to conclude it in 2010. However, no breakthrough was achieved in 2010, with technical issues being addressed. G-20 and APEC leaders called for a successful conclusion of the Round in 2010. Director-General Pascal Lamy urged the submission of revised negotiating texts by March 2011. Director-General Lamy described NAMA differences as \"unbridgeable today,\" with fundamental gaps in sectorals. Market access differences persisted in agriculture and services. EU Trade Commissioner warned that without progress by summer, Doha could be over. Former USTR Schwab suggested giving up on saving Doha to salvage parts of the round. The Financial Times urged the WTO to focus on smaller agreements like trade facilitation, agricultural exports, reducing fishing subsidies, and green technologies. Negotiators were considering a \"plan B\" for the WTO's eighth Ministerial in December 2011, with a focus on deliverables for least developed countries. The WTO's plan for the December 2011 Ministerial meeting, which included provisions for LDCs, reached a stalemate and was abandoned due to disagreements over certain aspects such as fisheries subsidies and tariff-free goods and services. The meeting did not advance the Doha Round as expected, with significant differences remaining on key issues. Despite this, some activity related to LDCs was included in the final Ministerial declaration, including a \"services waiver\" for preferential treatment for services suppliers. Negotiators are working on a declaration for preferential treatment for services suppliers from LDCs, extending the time for LDCs to implement TRIPS obligations, and easing access to WTO membership. Failure to reach an agreement could lead to an increase in bilateral and regional free trade agreements, potentially undermining the WTO and causing trade diversion. The plethora of negotiated FTAs may lead to a 'spaghetti bowl' of tariffs and rules of origin, increasing reliance on WTO dispute settlement. This could stress the institution if decisions are not implemented fairly. A prolonged impasse may result in withdrawal of offers and agreements, impacting development-oriented proposals like aid-for-trade and duty-free access for least developed countries. The stalemate in WTO negotiations may hinder proposals like aid-for-trade and duty-free access for least developed countries. The EU's commitment to phase out export subsidies is tied to a broader agreement. The global economic crisis could lead to protectionist measures that undermine trade liberalization efforts. Some question the relevance of the Doha negotiations in light of other pressing trade issues not being addressed. The Doha negotiations have been criticized for focusing on minor issues while neglecting more pressing matters. Some economists suggest suspending the round to reevaluate its direction. The expiration of U.S. trade promotion authority in 2007 may prompt a debate on the status of the negotiations. Trade economists emphasize the importance of reducing trade barriers. Trade economists argue that reducing trade barriers allows for more efficient product exchange among countries, leading to economic growth. Multilateral negotiations, like those in the Uruguay Round and Doha Development Agenda, have shown potential benefits in the billions of dollars for the United States and the world. For instance, removing tariff cuts from the Uruguay Round could result in a $20 billion welfare loss for the US, while a 33% reduction in trade barriers could increase global welfare by $574 billion. Other studies predict more modest world net welfare gains. Multilateral trade negotiations are crucial for developing countries to benefit from global trade agreements. While these agreements can lead to economic growth and cooperation, they may also result in job losses and economic dislocations at the local level. Despite the potential benefits, not all individuals or communities may experience improvements in their economic well-being. Multilateral trade agreements can have both positive and negative impacts on economic well-being. Non-compliance with agreements may lead to WTO-sanctioned retaliation. Some oppose WTO rules that restrict a country's response to imports with undesirable production methods. Doha Round talks are overseen by the Trade Negotiations Committee, addressing topics like market access and development issues. The Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture aimed for progressive reductions in support and protection. Agriculture became central to the Doha Development Agenda, with U.S. goals including eliminating export subsidies and reducing trade-distorting support. The Doha Ministerial Declaration committed to negotiations for improved market access, phasing out export subsidies, and reducing trade-distorting support. The lead up to the Cancun negotiations was influenced by the EU's Common Agricultural Policy reform, particularly the approval of partial decoupling of payments to farmers. This was seen as a positive step for trade negotiations, addressing domestic support but not market access. The US and Cairns Group advocated for harmonizing tariff peaks, while the EU and Japan sought flexibility in cutting tariffs. The EU and Japan seek flexibility in cutting tariffs, especially regarding geographical indications like \"Bordeaux wine.\" Developing countries prioritize agricultural trade reform. Some developing countries prioritize agricultural trade reform, calling for an end to subsidies that harm their producers. The July 2004 Framework Agreement outlined reductions in domestic support and tariffs, with the EU agreeing to eliminate certain subsidies. The European Union agreed to eliminate export subsidies, a key goal for the United States. Members also agreed to cut domestic support programs and renew a commitment to achieve a tariff cutting formula. In parallel negotiations on cotton, export subsidies for cotton were also set to be eliminated. In parallel negotiations on cotton, members agreed to eliminate export subsidies for LDC cotton producers by year-end 2006 and reduce domestic support for cotton more ambitiously than for other agricultural commodities. Talks to reach modalities were unsuccessful at the July 23, 2006, meeting of the G-6 countries in Geneva, leading to the suspension of negotiations. U.S. concerns about deviations from market access commitments due to \"3-S flexibilities\" were a source of the stalemate. The United States is in disagreement with other countries over the scope of exemptions in the tariff formula, leading to market access concerns. Pressure from the EU and G-20 countries to improve subsidy reduction offers was met with no new offer from the US. The US links domestic subsidy reduction to improved market access offers from the EU and G-20 countries. WTO Agriculture committee chairman submitted a draft modality paper in July 2007 to address negotiating differences. The draft modality paper was revised multiple times following committee-based negotiations in Geneva. The final draft in December 2008 outlined reductions in U.S and European domestic support, with the U.S offering to cap overall trade-distorting domestic support at $14.5 billion during the WTO summit in July 2008. Other developed countries were also required to cut their support levels. The U.S offered to cap overall trade-distorting domestic support at $14.5 billion during the WTO summit in July 2008. Developed country tariffs would be cut in a tiered formula over five years, with reductions ranging from 70% to 50%. Developing countries would have a longer timeframe for tariff cuts. The modalities draft proposes tariff cuts for developed and developing countries over a 10-year period. Developed countries would cut 70% from tariffs above 75%, while developing countries face varying cuts based on tariff levels. Developing countries can designate 4% of agricultural tariff lines as sensitive. The draft also reaffirms the commitment to eliminate export subsidies by 2013. The December 2008 draft revised the special safeguard mechanism (SSM) for developing countries, allowing them to raise duties during import surges or price depressions. The proposal includes a two-tiered SSM triggered at 20% or 40% surge above base imports, with specific tariff increase levels. Disagreements over the SSM details contributed to the failure of the July 2008 summit. The latest draft on the special safeguard mechanism (SSM) for developing countries includes a compromise on surge triggers and safeguard duties. The United States aims to cap safeguard duties below existing bound rates, while the draft allows breaches for up to 2.5% of bound tariff lines. Services were also part of the Uruguay Round agenda, leading to the General Agreement on Trade In Services (GATS) for negotiations. Negotiations for higher liberalization levels under the WTO Agreement began in early 2000 with established guidelines and procedures by March 2001. The request-offer approach was used, where countries requested changes, received offers, and negotiated bilaterally. The Doha Ministerial Declaration in March 2001 directed participants to submit requests by June 30, 2002, and offers by March 31, 2003. Services talks progressed slowly, with 68 initial commitment offers received by July 2005.

Services talks progressed slowly, with 68 initial commitment offers received by July 2005. The EU represents 25 members and 24 offers remained outstanding from non-LDC members (55 if LDCs are included). Only 28 revised offers were tendered by November 2005, although the July Framework stipulated a March 31, 2005, deadline. Many have decried the poor quality of offers, many of which only bind existing practices, rather than offer new concessions and excluded some sectors entirely. At Hong Kong, members committed to submit a second round of revised offers by July 31, 2006, and to submit a final schedule of commitments by October 31, 2006. In order to expedite the negotiating process, members also agreed to employ plurilateral requests to other members covering specific sectors and modes of supply to be completed by February 28, 2006. In response to this deadline, 21 plurilateral requests concerning 17 sectors and 4 modes of supply were submitted, and 4 rounds of discussions have been held.

In response to this deadline, 21 plurilateral requests concerning 17 sectors and 4 modes of supply were submitted, and 4 rounds of discussions have been held. To some members, including the United States, the talks have not yielded adequate offers of improved market access. Various methods have been advocated to break the stalemate in negotiations, from calls to prepare a services modalities text to the convening of a signaling conference. A draft services negotiating text, released prior to the July 2008 mini-ministerial, called for countries \"to the maximum extent possible\" respond to requests with \"deeper and/or wider commitments ... commensurate with levels of development, regulatory capacity, and national policy objectives.\" Negotiations for higher liberalization levels under the WTO Agreement began in early 2000 with established guidelines and procedures by March 2001. Services talks progressed slowly, with 68 initial commitment offers received by July 2005. At Hong Kong, members committed to submit a second round of revised offers by July 31, 2006, and to submit a final schedule of commitments by October 31, 2006. In response to this deadline, 21 plurilateral requests concerning 17 sectors and 4 modes of supply were submitted, and 4 rounds of discussions have been held. Concerns about agriculture and industrial market access were discussed in a signaling conference on July 26, but little progress was made. The chair of the negotiating committee noted in March 2010 that there had been little to no significant progress in market access negotiations since July 2008. Members need to address gaps in sectoral coverage and levels of commitment in order to reach a satisfactory outcome in services negotiations. Progress in market access in services is dependent on resolving issues in other areas of the Round. Controversy surrounds \"Mode IV\" services.

The chair of the negotiating committee noted in March 2010 that there had been little to no significant progress in market access negotiations since July 2008. Members need to address gaps in sectoral coverage and levels of commitment in order to reach a satisfactory outcome in services negotiations. Progress in market access in services is dependent on resolving issues in other areas of the Round. One area of controversy is so-called \"Mode IV\" services. Developing countries want easier movement of their nationals under Mode IV, but developed countries, especially the United States, have opposed discussions on Mode IV services trade. Mode IV services will be a difficult issue to resolve. At a signaling conference, the US and EU showed flexibility on allowing more services professionals access to their markets. Exploratory talks for new global services negotiations, called the ISA, were launched by 47 WTO Members in 2012. These negotiations could be incorporated into the WTO system, expanding the agreement to other members and utilizing the existing dispute settlement mechanism. Frustration over the lack of progress in Services talks led to these new negotiations. Negotiators in the WTO are discussing a \"hybrid approach\" for Services talks within the Doha Round, aiming to combine a \"negative list\" approach for national treatment of services providers with the \"positive list\" approach for market access commitments. They are also considering disciplines on domestic services regulations and an accession mechanism for new members. The goal is to have a framework agreement by the end of 2012 to start negotiations on commitments in 2013. Negotiations in the WTO in 2013 are focusing on reducing tariffs on industrial or primary products, particularly on tariff peaks and tariff escalation. The talks also aim to address non-tariff barriers such as import licensing, quotas, conformity assessment procedures, and technical barriers to trade. The unresolved issue is whether to extend the benefits of the potential ISA to all WTO members or only to participants. Negotiators in the WTO have discussed reducing tariffs on industrial products and addressing non-tariff barriers. The deadline for reaching modalities for tariff reduction was not met, and NAMA issues were not discussed at Cancun. The July 2004 Framework Agreement introduced a non-linear tariff reduction formula, but there was no agreement on coefficients, leading to ongoing negotiations. Negotiators in the WTO are negotiating tariff reductions based on bound rates. They are also discussing flexibility for developing countries in formula cuts. The July Framework Agreement allowed for exemptions on certain tariff lines and agreed to provide tariff-free access for LCDs by 2008, with exceptions for sensitive products. The April 30, 2006 deadline for agreement on NAMA formula and other issues was breached. The Geneva summit in June also failed to reach agreement on NAMA modalities. Developing countries proposed a 25 percentage point differential in Swiss formula coefficients, while developed countries proposed a 5 or 10-15 percentage point differential. NAMA talks are linked to agricultural talks, with progress in one affecting the other. Developed countries are now tying further agriculture negotiations to progress in NAMA. The NAMA negotiations faced challenges with disagreement on agriculture, leading to a \"exchange rate\" between the two issues. A draft modality paper released in 2007 aimed to reconcile positions but faced criticism. Subsequent revisions in 2008 formed the basis of Geneva level negotiations, showing some narrowing of positions over time. The NAMA negotiations in 2008 saw some narrowing of positions, with the chairman revising the text to reflect areas of \"convergence\" despite not all members agreeing. The latest text in December 2008 included details on the Swiss tariff reduction formula, with coefficients specified for developed and developing countries based on flexibility choices. Developing countries can choose flexibilities based on coefficients x or y for the tariff reduction formula. They can apply less than formula cuts for a percentage of tariff lines, or keep tariff lines unbound for a certain percentage of non-agricultural imports. Countries choosing coefficient z would not have these flexibilities. The use of these flexibilities is complicated by the \"anti-concentration clause.\" The flexibilities for developing countries in tariff reduction formulas should not exclude entire chapters of the harmonized tariff schedule. The US and EU oppose excluding whole industrial sectors from cuts, while developing countries resist expanding the anti-concentration clause beyond full chapters. The December 2008 convergence text requires a minimum of 20% tariff reductions in each HS chapter or 9% of import value. The US and EU support sectoral tariff elimination as an additional approach in NAMA negotiations. Discussions are ongoing on product coverage and participation levels. The December draft discusses proposals for sectoral negotiations in various industries, with debates on the participation of developing countries. The United States pushes for major developing countries to participate, while developing countries argue for voluntary negotiations. The draft also addresses the challenge of defining members' commitment to sectorals without making them mandatory. The draft text includes sectoral proposals for reducing non-tariff barriers in various industries such as chemical products, electronics, textiles, and automotive products. The ITA is a plurilateral agreement aimed at eliminating tariffs on ICT products, with 73 member countries currently participating. The agreement does not address non-tariff barriers. The ITA is a plurilateral agreement aimed at eliminating tariffs on ICT products, with 73 member countries currently participating. However, it does not include disciplines on non-tariff measures affecting ICT products. Informal talks have been ongoing since May 2012 to expand and update the agreement, focusing on additional products to cover and reducing non-tariff barriers on ICT. The U.S. International Trade Commission released a draft list of ICT products for duty-free treatment in the negotiations. The Doha Ministerial discussed issues related to compulsory licensing of medicines, patent protection, special treatment for developing countries, and implementing trade obligations. A key topic was the balance between pharmaceutical companies' patents on medicines and public health needs in developing countries under the WTO Agreement on TRIPS. The TRIPS Declaration recognized the need for flexibility in addressing health emergencies. The Doha Ministerial discussed compulsory licensing of medicines under the TRIPS Agreement. The TRIPS Declaration recognized the need for flexibility in addressing health emergencies. WTO Members sought an expeditious solution to allow countries without manufacturing capacity to issue compulsory licenses for importing medicines. The U.S., representing pharmaceutical interests, opposed the draft for not providing enough protections against misuse of compulsory licenses. The United States opposed the chairman's draft on compulsory licenses for medicines, promising not to dispute least-developed countries issuing them. Concerns included diversion of medicines and misuse by more advanced developing countries. WTO members reached agreement on the TRIPS and medicines issue on August 30, 2003. At the General Council meeting, member governments approved an interim waiver under the TRIPS Agreement allowing export of pharmaceutical products made under compulsory licenses to certain countries. The decision aimed to protect public health and prevent diversion of products. Some countries opted out of the system as importers or agreed to use it only in emergencies. A permanent amendment incorporating the 2003 Decision was agreed upon at the 2005 Hong Kong Ministerial. The 2003 Decision amendment will be effective upon ratification by two-thirds of member states, with 46 countries, including the EU, having ratified it. The Doha Ministerial Declaration reaffirmed special and differential treatment for developing countries, aiming to strengthen and clarify these provisions. Trade ministers endorsed a work program on S&D treatment in the Implementation Decision, calling for a review of mandatory and non-binding provisions. The negotiations on converting S&D treatment measures into mandatory provisions were split between developing and developed countries. Developing countries wanted changes to S&D provisions with shorter deadlines, while developed countries preferred studying the provisions and leaving deadlines open. Developing countries accused developed countries of not negotiating in good faith. At the December 2005 Hong Kong Ministerial, members agreed to five S&D provisions for LDCs, including tariff-free and quota-free access for LDC goods. Developing countries face challenges in implementing agreements from the Uruguay Round due to limited capacity and lack of technical assistance. They seek clarification on language in existing agreements and unresolved implementation issues were addressed before the Doha Ministerial. The Doha meeting directed a two-path approach for further discussions. The Doha meeting directed a two-path approach for addressing outstanding implementation issues in various areas such as market access, investment measures, safeguards, rules of origin, and subsidies. The first WTO Ministerial Conference in Singapore established working groups on transparency in government procurement, trade facilitation, trade and investment, and trade and competition, known as the Singapore issues. These issues were pushed by some countries but opposed by most developing nations. The United States was hesitant about including the Singapore issues in trade negotiations, preferring to focus on market access. Deadlock over these issues at the Canc\u00fan summit in 2003 led to their removal from the agenda. A compromise was reached in the July 2004 Framework Agreement, dropping three Singapore issues and focusing on trade facilitation instead. Trade facilitation aims to improve international trade efficiency by harmonizing customs procedures and reducing delays. Negotiations have focused on clarifying and improving GATT articles related to trade facilitation. The first negotiating text was released in December 2009 and has undergone multiple revisions. Discussions have also included technical assistance and trade capacity building. Developing countries are assessing their trade facilitation status with the help of organizations like the World Bank and the World Customs Organization. Developed countries prefer a rules-based system with accountability, while some developing countries prefer flexible guidelines. The Doha Round negotiations aimed to clarify and improve disciplines under WTO Agreements on Antidumping and Subsidies. The United States wanted to keep trade remedies negotiations separate from the Doha Round. The Doha Ministerial Declaration called for clarifying and improving disciplines on fisheries subsidies and trade remedies. U.S. negotiators faced criticism for conceding on including trade remedies in discussions outside the Doha Round. The Declaration also addressed improving WTO disciplines on regional trade agreements. The negotiations aim to clarify and improve disciplines on trade distorting practices without set deadlines. The United States has been defensive in rules talks, facing criticism for antidumping actions seen as protectionism. Developing countries are now using antidumping actions themselves, prompting a reexamination of the necessity for discipline. Proposals focus on providing more specificity to the AD/ASCM Agreements, led by the \"Friends of Antidumping\" group. The \"Friends of Antidumping\" group, consisting of various countries, has proposed measures to reduce duties, some of which would require changes in U.S. laws. The EU, despite not being a member, has supported some of these proposals. The United States has also submitted its own proposals on antidumping and subsidies to the WTO. The draft modalities paper released on November 30, 2007, included language allowing zeroing in certain antidumping calculations, which was seen as a concession to the United States. However, criticism from various countries led to a subsequent draft that did not mention zeroing, showing deep divisions on the issue. Positions on zeroing in antidumping calculations remain divided. Some advocate for a total prohibition of zeroing, while others demand authorization for zeroing in all cases. The USTR criticized the removal of zeroing language, emphasizing its importance in Rules negotiations. Additionally, a proposed modality on fisheries subsidies in the November 2007 draft modalities paper suggested banning certain subsidies that boost fishing capacity or encourage over-fishing, with exceptions for fisheries management programs and special treatment for developing countries. The latest draft on fisheries subsidies removed language disciplining fish subsidies due to differences among delegations. Trade ministers at Doha called for a review of WTO dispute settlement rules, with negotiations directed towards improvements and clarifications of the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU). Negotiations on the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) were set to be separate from other talks, with a deadline of May 2003. A framework document with over 50 proposals was circulated in April 2003, leading to some dissatisfaction. A revised text was issued on May 16, 2003, with additional reforms favored by the US and EU. The Ministerial Declaration included provisions on trade and environment, with agreements on negotiations. The trade ministers agreed to negotiate on the relationship between existing WTO rules and trade obligations in multilateral environmental agreements, exchange of information between MEA Secretariats and WTO committees, and reduction of trade barriers to environmental goods and services. The US and EU proposed a two-tiered tariff elimination plan for goods related to climate change mitigation. The second phase of the trade negotiations involves creating a plurilateral Environmental Goods and Services Agreement (EGSA) to liberalize environmental-related goods and services among developed and advanced developing countries. However, this proposal has faced criticism from several developing countries, such as Brazil and India, for various reasons. Congress plays a key role in overseeing these trade negotiations, conducting hearings and meetings with executive branch officials to communicate their positions. In December 2008, the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committee urged President Bush to resist a possible year-end WTO Ministerial, emphasizing the need for meaningful new market access opportunities. Trade Promotion Authority expired in 2007, with Congress setting trade objectives for U.S. negotiators in the Doha Development Agenda. Congress outlined requirements for expedited procedures for legislation to implement trade agreements, including those from the Doha Development Agenda. The executive branch must consult with Congress during trade negotiations and follow expedited legislative procedures. It is uncertain if the Administration will request Trade Promotion Authority in its second term."
