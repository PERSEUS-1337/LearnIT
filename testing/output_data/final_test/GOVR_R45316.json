    "content": "Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis, decided by the Supreme Court on May 21, 2018, addressed the enforceability of arbitration agreements between employers and employees, waiving rights to class actions. The Court, in a 5-4 opinion by Justice Gorsuch, ruled that such agreements must be enforced under the Federal Arbitration Act, despite provisions of the National Labor Relations Act. This decision has significant implications for millions of employees' ability to pursue class actions against their employers. The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) generally governs arbitration agreements in commercial contexts, mandating alternative dispute resolution. In Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis, the Supreme Court upheld the enforceability of individualized arbitration agreements between employers and employees, despite attempts to bring class action suits. In Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis, the Supreme Court upheld individualized arbitration agreements between employers and employees. The question was whether Section 7 of the NLRA guarantees a worker's right to bring a class action lawsuit, which Justice Gorsuch concluded it does not. In Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis, the Supreme Court upheld individualized arbitration agreements between employers and employees. Justice Gorsuch concluded that Section 7 of the NLRA does not guarantee a worker's right to bring a class action lawsuit. The Court held that the NLRA could be read in harmony with the FAA, requiring the enforcement of contracts as written. In Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis, the Supreme Court upheld individualized arbitration agreements between employers and employees. Justice Ginsburg, joined by Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, disagreed with the majority on the interpretation of the NLRA and FAA, arguing for a right to collective action in litigation and criticizing the Court's jurisprudence on the FAA. The dissent in Epic Systems emphasized negative policy implications, arguing it would reduce employees' ability to enforce wage and hour violations. The case threatens workers' rights by diminishing the power of class action lawsuits against employers. Both majority and dissent highlighted Congress's role in reconciling federal statutes. Congress has the power to rewrite rules regarding arbitration agreements, as seen in Epic Systems case. In Carpenter v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that government acquisition of historical cell site location information constitutes a Fourth Amendment search, requiring a warrant supported by probable cause. The Supreme Court ruled in Carpenter v. United States that the government generally needs a warrant supported by probable cause to acquire historical CSLI, recognizing that the Fourth Amendment protects sensitive information held by third parties. This decision could lead to extending Fourth Amendment protections to other types of sensitive information held by technology companies. At Carpenter's trial for robberies, the government used his CSLI records as evidence. The government obtained Carpenter's CSLI without a warrant, arguing it did not violate the Fourth Amendment due to the third-party doctrine. Carpenter contended that this warrantless acquisition breached his privacy rights. The third-party doctrine states that individuals have no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties, such as phone numbers dialed or bank account statements. While most federal appellate courts have applied this doctrine to historical CSLI, some judges and Justice Sotomayor have raised concerns about its applicability in the smartphone era. In a 2012 case about GPS tracking, Justice Sotomayor expressed concerns about the third-party doctrine in the digital age. The Supreme Court, in agreement with Carpenter, ruled that individuals have a legitimate expectation of privacy in their physical movements captured through CSLI. The Court highlighted that historical CSLI provides intimate details of a person's life, extending beyond public areas into private spaces. The Court expressed concerns about historical CSLI's ability to act as a detailed surveillance tool, allowing the government to track a person's movements over an extended period. The majority argued that the third-party doctrine does not apply to CSLI due to the vast difference in the type and amount of personal information collected by wireless carriers today. The majority concluded that third-party disclosure may reduce privacy expectations but does not necessarily eliminate Fourth Amendment protection, especially for sensitive information like CSLI held by wireless carriers. The Court reasoned that CSLI warrants protection due to its revealing nature and automated disclosure, which is not voluntary. The Court did not overrule prior cases stating no reasonable expectation of privacy for dialed phone numbers or bank statements. Exceptions to the warrant requirement, like for ongoing emergencies, still apply. Justices Kennedy, Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch dissented, focusing on property interests in Fourth Amendment analysis. They argued Carpenter lacked a property interest in CSLI, so no Fourth Amendment violation occurred when the government obtained it without a warrant. Justice Gorsuch suggested that provisions of the Telecommunications Act protecting CSLI gave Carpenter a property interest shielding it from government search. Justices Kennedy and Alito argued that obtaining CSLI through a court order was reasonable and did not violate the Fourth Amendment. The Carpenter decision introduces a potential change to the third-party doctrine, indicating that courts must consider the circumstances before determining Fourth Amendment protections. The Carpenter decision introduces a potential change to the third-party doctrine, suggesting that courts must weigh privacy expectations against the sensitivity of information disclosed to third parties. Justice Kennedy mentioned a \"balancing test\" for future cases involving technologically generated information. The Court did not predict how the decision might apply in other contexts, such as with different types of CSLI or in emergency or national security situations. The Carpenter decision suggests a potential change to the third-party doctrine, indicating that historical CSLI could be considered sensitive enough to warrant Fourth Amendment protection. Congress could establish statutory parameters for law enforcement access to information held by third-party technology companies to address the uncertainty. Justice Alito has urged Congress to take action to avoid the need for new Fourth Amendment caselaw on rapidly changing technology. After the Carpenter decision, it is clear that law enforcement must obtain a warrant before accessing historical CSLI in most nonemergency situations, despite a federal statute allowing warrantless access. The Supreme Court's ruling in Murphy v. NCAA also highlights that statutory authorization for warrantless acquisition of personal information may not protect law enforcement from Fourth Amendment scrutiny if the information is deemed sensitive. This decision has implications not only for sports gambling but also for the broader scope of personal information protection. The Murphy Court decision limits Congress's power over states regarding sports gambling, stating that Congress can only preempt state law when directly regulating private actors, not state governments. PASPA made it illegal for most states to engage in sports gambling activities. In 2014, New Jersey partially repealed its laws related to sports gambling. In 2014, New Jersey partially repealed its sports gambling laws, leading to a legal battle over whether this constituted an \"authorization\" under PASPA. The NCAA argued that a partial repeal could be seen as authorization, while New Jersey claimed it was an unconstitutional commandeering of state legislature. The Murphy Court decision limited Congress's power over states in regulating sports gambling. The Supreme Court ruled that the anti-authorization provision of PASPA was unconstitutional as it placed state legislatures under the direct control of Congress, violating state sovereignty. The Supreme Court found PASPA's anti-authorization provision unconstitutional, stating it infringed on state sovereignty by regulating state legislatures instead of individuals. The Court also considered invalidating other provisions of PASPA in light of this ruling. The Supreme Court found that provisions prohibiting states and individuals from sponsoring, operating, advertising, or promoting gambling were inoperative due to the unconstitutional anti-authorization provision in PASPA. Justice Thomas concurred, expressing discomfort with the severability analysis. Justice Breyer partially dissented, arguing that the prohibition on authorizing sports gambling was severable. Justice Ginsburg dissented, criticizing the Court for dismantling PASPA unnecessarily. Justice Ginsburg criticized the Court for dismantling PASPA unnecessarily, arguing that the remaining provisions should have been severed from the unconstitutional anti-authorization provision. The decision in Murphy has implications for sports gambling and Congress's authority, allowing states to regulate sports gambling as they please. It also affects other federal statutes that restrict state legislatures from enacting certain laws. The Court distinguished PASPA from other federal laws, noting that not all federal laws regulate the activities of private parties. The Supreme Court's decision in Murphy has significant implications for federal regulation of private parties. It questions the constitutionality of federal statutes limiting state taxing authority and impacts state and local immigration enforcement policies. The distinction made in Murphy between federal laws that regulate private conduct and those that commandeer state regulatory authority will influence future legislation by Congress. Additionally, the Court's ruling in Janus v. AFSCME overturned a longstanding precedent regarding public-sector agency-shop arrangements violating the First Amendment. In Janus v. AFSCME, the Supreme Court overturned the precedent set in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, ruling that states and public-sector unions cannot require nonconsenting employees to pay agency fees. This decision was based on First Amendment concerns regarding compelled financial support for collective bargaining activities. In Janus v. AFSCME, the Supreme Court overturned the precedent set in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, ruling that nonconsenting employees cannot be required to pay fees for collective bargaining activities. In Janus v. AFSCME, the Supreme Court overturned the precedent set in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, ruling that nonconsenting employees cannot be required to pay fees for collective bargaining activities. Justice Alito, writing for the Court in Janus, stated that compelling public employees to financially support a union that takes political positions infringes on their First Amendment rights. The majority opinion in Janus v. AFSCME considered whether the Illinois statute served a compelling state interest that cannot be achieved through less restrictive means. The Court concluded that promoting labor peace and preventing free riders could not justify agency fees. Labor peace was the main defense of agency fees in Abood, but the Court held that it could be achieved through less restrictive means. In Janus v. AFSCME, the Court rejected the argument that agency fees prevent free riding and noted that the government cannot compel nonmember beneficiaries to subsidize speech. The Court also found that agency fees could not be upheld under the Pickering v. Board of Education decision, which acknowledges public employees' First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court in Janus v. AFSCME rejected agency fees as a means to prevent free riding and noted that the government cannot compel nonmember beneficiaries to subsidize speech. The Court found that the Pickering balancing test was not suitable for the context of the case, giving three reasons for its unsuitability. The Supreme Court concluded that public-sector agency-shop arrangements violate the First Amendment, overturning the Abood decision. The Court found that Abood was poorly reasoned, lacked a workable rule, and had been eroded by legal, economic, and political developments. The Supreme Court overturned the Abood decision, stating that public-sector agency-shop arrangements violate the First Amendment. The Court found that Abood's factual assumptions were not supported by experience as public-sector union membership grew, and that the decision applied a lower level of scrutiny than other cases involving First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court overturned the Abood decision, ruling that public-sector agency-shop arrangements violate the First Amendment. Justice Kagan's dissent argued that Abood was correctly decided and consistent with the Court's usual attitude towards regulating public employees' speech. The dissent in the Supreme Court case argued for respect for the government's authority as an employer to regulate employees' speech and emphasized the importance of adhering to the Abood decision for the sake of established legislative and contractual arrangements. The Janus decision now prohibits public-sector unions from collecting agency fees without employee consent, affecting millions of public employees and their unions. This change is expected to lead to decreased union membership and potentially weaken unions. The Janus decision may lead to decreased union membership and weaken unions' political power. Some believe unions and states may respond in ways to strengthen the labor movement. Nonconsenting public employees are seeking repayment of mandatory union dues. Questions arise if Janus could impact private-sector agency-shop arrangements. Litigants challenging these arrangements would need to show state action. The ruling may also raise concerns about the constitutionality of mandatory dues. The Janus decision may impact union membership and weaken their political power. Litigants are challenging mandatory union dues, and there are concerns about the constitutionality of such dues. The Supreme Court is considering a challenge to mandatory membership in the State Bar Association of North Dakota, citing Janus as precedent. In another case, the Supreme Court found notice requirements in the California FACT Act likely unconstitutional under the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause. The Supreme Court rejected the \"professional speech\" doctrine and suggested that some commercial disclosure requirements may be subject to strict scrutiny. The FACT Act required licensed facilities to provide notice about public programs for family planning services, prenatal care, and abortion. The FACT Act required unlicensed facilities to provide notice on-site and in advertising materials that they are not licensed as medical facilities by the State of California. The notices had to be in English and other languages determined by the state. NIFLA and other non-profit corporations sought to enjoin enforcement of the FACT Act, arguing that the notice requirements were content-based regulations subject to strict scrutiny under the First Amendment. The State of California claimed that the requirements of the FACT Act should be analyzed under a less stringent standard, but should be upheld under any standard of review. The U.S. Solicitor General argued that the disclosure requirements for licensed pregnancy centers were unconstitutional. Justice Thomas held that the licensed notice requirement regulated protected speech on the basis of content, which is presumptively unconstitutional. The majority opinion rejected the existence of a separate category of \"professional speech\" and explained that the Court has afforded less protection for professional speech in certain circumstances. The Court reviewed exceptions to content-based regulations of speech and concluded that none applied. The NIFLA Court rejected applying the Zauderer standard to the FACT Act, stating it did not relate to licensed clinic services but rather required disclosure of state-sponsored services, including abortion. The Court also noted that regulations of professional conduct that incidentally burden speech have been upheld, but concluded that the FACT Act was not such a regulation. The NIFLA Court concluded that the FACT Act was not an informed-consent requirement or tied to a medical procedure. It suggested that content-based regulations of professional speech should be subject to strict scrutiny and found that the licensed notice did not survive even intermediate scrutiny. The regulation was deemed underinclusive and targeted disfavored speakers. The NIFLA Court found that the FACT Act targeted disfavored speakers and failed to meet the Zauderer standard for disclosure requirements. California's interest in informing pregnant women about medical care from licensed professionals was deemed unsupported and purely hypothetical. The Supreme Court found that the FACT Act burdened protected speech by requiring disclaimers on pro-life billboards, targeting speakers rather than speech. Justice Breyer dissented, arguing the law was likely constitutional but warned of potential litigation over its validity. Justice Breyer dissented, warning of potential litigation over the constitutional validity of government regulation, particularly laws requiring individuals to speak a specific message. He suggested evaluating such laws under a standard closer to rational basis than strict scrutiny, focusing on prior cases related to disclosure laws in reproductive health. Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey upheld a state statute requiring doctors to provide information on adoption services and financial assistance to patients seeking abortion. Justice Breyer argued that if a state can mandate information on adoption, it should also be able to require counseling on childbirth and abortion services. The dissent disagreed with the majority's distinction between the FACT Act disclosure and medical procedures, warning of potential constitutional challenges to government-mandated speech. The dissenting opinion in the case argued that the disclosure requirement for licensed clinics was justified and related to the services they provide. Justice Breyer disagreed with the majority's evaluation of the unlicensed notice requirement, stating that the State's interest was reasonable and there was no cause for heightened scrutiny. The dissent in the NIFLA case disagreed with the majority's conclusion that the FACT Act was overly burdensome, stating that there was no convincing evidence of discrimination. The decision could have broad implications for First Amendment law, especially regarding commercial speech regulation. The NIFLA case clarified that disclosure requirements not related to services provided may be subject to strict scrutiny. Future litigants may challenge various disclosure requirements based on this decision. The Court did not mention Central Hudson, which typically evaluates commercial speech under intermediate scrutiny. The NIFLA case applied strict scrutiny instead of the Central Hudson standard for regulating commercial speech. Justice Thomas's opinion in NIFLA relied on Reed v. Town of Gilbert, which also used strict scrutiny for content-based restrictions. The Court did not mention Central Hudson in relation to the FACT Act's requirements, casting doubt on lower court rulings regarding regulations on commercial speech. In Trump v. Hawaii, the Supreme Court upheld Presidential Proclamation No. 9645, which restricts entry into the US from certain countries. President Trump relied on 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(f) as authority for the proclamation. This decision may impact future challenges to commercial disclosure requirements. The Supreme Court upheld Presidential Proclamation No. 9645, which restricts entry into the US from certain countries under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(f). The Court interpreted the statute as granting the President broad power to impose entry restrictions for national security reasons, rejecting arguments that the proclamation targeted Muslims. The decision may impact future challenges to commercial disclosure requirements. The Supreme Court upheld Presidential Proclamation No. 9645, restricting entry into the US from certain countries under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(f). The State of Hawaii and other plaintiffs challenged the proclamation on statutory and constitutional grounds, arguing it exceeded the President's authority by indefinitely excluding nationals of seven countries. Plaintiffs challenged Presidential Proclamation No. 9645, arguing it exceeded authority by indefinitely excluding nationals of seven countries and engaging in nationality-based discrimination. They also claimed it violated the Establishment Clause by targeting Muslims for exclusion. The Supreme Court upheld Presidential Proclamation No. 9645, stating it falls within the President's exclusion authority under \u00a7 1182(f). Plaintiffs' challenges, including claims of nationality-based discrimination and violation of the Establishment Clause, were rejected by a five-Justice majority. President Trump's national security justification was deemed \"bona fide\" despite past statements proposing to exclude Muslims from the United States. The Supreme Court upheld Presidential Proclamation No. 9645 under \u00a7 1182(f), stating it falls within the President's exclusion authority. The Court emphasized the deference traditionally accorded to the President in national security and immigration matters, and ruled that the proclamation's nationality-based classifications did not violate the INA. The Supreme Court upheld Presidential Proclamation No. 9645 under \u00a7 1182(f), stating it falls within the President's exclusion authority. The Court emphasized deference to the President in national security and immigration matters, ruling that the proclamation's nationality-based classifications did not violate the INA. The Court also affirmed that matters concerning the admission or exclusion of aliens are largely immune from judicial control, with limited inquiry allowed. The Supreme Court upheld Presidential Proclamation No. 9645 under \u00a7 1182(f), emphasizing deference to the President in national security and immigration matters. The Court ruled that the proclamation's nationality-based classifications did not violate the INA and that matters concerning alien admission or exclusion are largely immune from judicial control. The inquiry may extend beyond facial neutrality to apply rational basis review, considering whether the entry policy is related to protecting the country and improving vetting processes. The decision to review the proclamation under a rational basis standard, taking extrinsic evidence into account, is a novel aspect of the legal analysis. Lower courts typically posed a binary choice in considering the proclamation's constitutionality. The Supreme Court upheld Presidential Proclamation No. 9645 under \u00a7 1182(f), emphasizing deference to the President in national security and immigration matters. The Court ruled that the proclamation's nationality-based classifications did not violate the INA and that matters concerning alien admission or exclusion are largely immune from judicial control. The inquiry may extend beyond facial neutrality to apply rational basis review, considering whether the entry policy is related to protecting the country and improving vetting processes. The decision to review the proclamation under a rational basis standard, taking extrinsic evidence into account, is a novel aspect of the legal analysis. Lower courts typically posed a binary choice in considering the proclamation's constitutionality. The Supreme Court proceeded under a different framework, rejecting the need for exacting scrutiny based on anti-Muslim animus and focusing on whether the proclamation is rationally related to national security concerns. The Supreme Court upheld Presidential Proclamation No. 9645 under \u00a7 1182(f), emphasizing deference to the President in national security and immigration matters. The Court ruled that the proclamation's nationality-based classifications did not violate the INA and that matters concerning alien admission or exclusion are largely immune from judicial control. Justice Sotomayor dissented, arguing that the majority failed to provide sufficient explanation for limiting its analysis to rational basis review. Justice Sotomayor dissented, criticizing the majority for tolerating religious discrimination in the name of national security and comparing their decision to Korematsu v. United States. She argued that the proclamation sought to exclude Muslims and failed to satisfy rational basis review due to anti-Muslim animus in the President's statements. The Supreme Court overruled Korematsu v. United States, calling it \"gravely wrong.\" Justice Breyer dissented, arguing for further review of the government's application of the proclamation's waivers for aliens. Justice Breyer argued that the Proclamation's exemption system strengthens the claim that it is a 'Muslim ban' rather than a 'security-based' ban. He concluded that evidence of antireligious bias is enough to set the Proclamation aside. Trump v. Hawaii establishes Congress granting the President broad power to impose entry restrictions not in the INA, contrary to the Ninth Circuit's view. The Supreme Court held that \u00a7 1182(f) is a comprehensive delegation of power. The Supreme Court held that \u00a7 1182(f) is a comprehensive delegation of power to the President, giving him discretion over entry restrictions, including when to suspend entry, whose entry to suspend, for how long, and on what conditions. The Court also stated that the President's discretion extends to determining if the statute applies, with deference to his findings on the detrimental impact of entry by a class of aliens. The remaining question is whether the President can create entry restrictions that override specific provisions of the INA. The Supreme Court upheld the proclamation as a valid exercise of immigration authority granted by Congress, without considering inherent presidential authority under Article II of the Constitution. The Court's analysis maintains that Congress holds the power to regulate admission and exclusion of aliens, with no express assignment to any specific branch of government. The Supreme Court upheld the President's authority to establish entry restrictions based on delegation from Congress. In Lucia v. SEC, the Court ruled that administrative law judges must be appointed according to the Appointments Clause if they hold significant authority. The Supreme Court's decision in Lucia v. SEC clarified that administrative law judges must be appointed according to the Appointments Clause if they hold significant authority, which has important implications for the administrative state. The case focused on whether ALJs at the SEC qualify as officers of the United States based on the exercise of significant authority, following the precedent set in Freytag v. Commissioner regarding special trial judges. The Freytag Court recognized that special trial judges have specific duties beyond ministerial tasks, including taking testimony, conducting trials, ruling on evidence, and enforcing compliance with discovery orders. They exercise significant discretion and can render binding independent decisions in certain cases. The D.C. Circuit ruled that SEC ALJs were not officers because they did not render final decisions, unlike special trial judges in Freytag who have significant discretionary authority. Lucia argued that SEC ALJs perform similar functions as officers, which was supported by the Solicitor General but opposed by the amicus appointed by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court held that SEC ALJs must be appointed according to the Appointments Clause, as their duties mirror those of special trial judges in Freytag. Justice Kagan reasoned that SEC ALJs qualify as officers because they hold a continuing position established by law. SEC ALJs must be appointed according to the Appointments Clause as they hold a continuing position established by law and exercise significant discretion in important functions similar to special trial judges in Freytag. SEC ALJs have more independent authority to render decisions, making them officers who must be appointed accordingly. The Court ordered that Lucia receive a new hearing before a properly appointed ALJ (or the Commission), and that the presiding judge could not be the one who originally presided over the hearing, even if he was subsequently appointed correctly. Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Gorsuch, emphasized the need for clarity on what is \"necessary\" to conclude someone is an officer of the United States under the Appointments Clause. Justice Breyer concurred in the judgment that the ALJ was appointed improperly, citing statutory rather than constitutional grounds. He argued that the Administrative Procedure Act and the SEC's authorizing statute did not permit the delegation of ALJ appointments. This approach was deemed necessary in light of the Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB case. Justice Breyer concurred that the two layers of removal protection for a constitutional officer were unconstitutional. He raised concerns that SEC ALJs, who also have two layers of removal protection, might face similar issues. Justice Sotomayor dissented, arguing that SEC ALJs were not officers because they lacked the power to make final, binding decisions for the government. She suggested that requiring such power would provide clarity for Congress and the Executive Branch. The Supreme Court's decision on the status of ALJs may have significant consequences for the federal government and the nearly 2,000 ALJs in federal service. The SEC Commissioners ratified the appointment of ALJs and ordered new hearings for pending cases. The impact of the decision on other federal agencies remains uncertain, as the Court did not clarify the test for determining if an individual is an officer. The Supreme Court's decision on the status of ALJs may have future repercussions for the appointment and removal of ALJs in federal service. President Trump issued an Executive Order changing the hiring process for ALJs, granting agency heads greater flexibility in their hiring. The Court's decision may also impact statutory restrictions on removing ALJs from federal service. The Supreme Court's decision on the status of ALJs could impact the appointment and removal process. The constitutionality of dual removal restrictions for ALJs may be challenged in the future."
