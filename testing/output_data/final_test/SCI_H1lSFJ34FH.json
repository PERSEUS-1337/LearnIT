    "content": "Importance sampling (IS) is a standard Monte Carlo (MC) tool used to compute information about random variables with unknown distributions. Importance sampling is a Monte Carlo method that is asymptotically consistent as the number of samples increases. To address the issue of retaining infinitely many particles, a scheme is proposed to keep a finite representative subset of particles and their importance weights, leading to nearly consistent results. This is achieved by approximating importance sampling through kernel density estimates and projecting them onto lower-dimensional subspaces. The scheme allows for a tunable tradeoff between consistency and memory, with experiments showing a favorable balance between memory usage and accuracy. Importance sampling is a Monte Carlo method used in Bayesian inference for computing expectations of unknown parameters. It involves generating weighted samples from a proposal distribution to approximate functions of the parameter. Recent developments include using importance distributions in updates for faster deep network training and reinforcement learning. The proposed compression scheme operates within importance sampling, deciding which particles are significant for integral estimation by drawing connections between optimization methods and importance distribution updates. The compression scheme in importance sampling involves projecting empirical distributions onto lower-memory subspaces using greedy compression with a fixed budget parameter. This method combines kernel smoothing and matching pursuit to achieve a tradeoff between consistency and memory for Monte Carlo methods in Bayesian inference. The text discusses inferring the posterior distribution based on available observations, with a focus on efficient estimation from an online stream of samples using importance sampling. The method involves defining posterior distributions and un-normalized posteriors to compute the posterior mean or moments. The complexity of estimating the posterior distribution is highlighted, emphasizing the need for efficient estimates in Bayesian inference. The text discusses inferring the posterior distribution based on available observations using importance sampling. It involves defining posterior distributions and un-normalized posteriors to compute the posterior mean or moments efficiently. The method highlights the complexity of estimating the posterior distribution in Bayesian inference. Importance sampling allows for sampling from an importance distribution to approximate the target distribution when the true posterior is unknown. Different priors and measurement models can be used, such as Gaussian, Student's t, and Uniform. The normalizing constant can be estimated using importance sampling. The self-normalized importance sampling (SNIS) estimator replaces the normalizing constant Z with an estimated value \u1e90. It integrates a function \u03c6 with respect to a particle approximation of q using weighted counts of samples across the space. Importance sampling requires the number of samples N to grow unbounded for consistent estimates. The importance distribution parameterization grows unbounded with accumulating particles, overcoming the curse of dimensionality in Monte Carlo methods. A compressed kernelized importance sampling algorithm is proposed, with conditions established for its application. The compressed kernelized importance sampling algorithm proposed overcomes the curse of dimensionality in Monte Carlo methods. Conditions are established for its application, showing nearly asymptotic consistency with tunable tradeoffs between bias and memory. The compressed kernelized importance sampling algorithm overcomes the curse of dimensionality in Monte Carlo methods by balancing model parsimony and statistical consistency. A numerical experiment demonstrates its efficacy in estimating expected values of functions with target and proposal distributions. The compressed kernelized importance sampling algorithm effectively balances model parsimony and statistical consistency, overcoming the curse of dimensionality in Monte Carlo methods. Experimental results show minimal error with kernel smoothing and memory reduction, stabilizing the number of particles retained around 56. The error settles around 10^-3 relative to the number of particles generated, while the complexity of the empirical measure without compression grows linearly with sample index n."
