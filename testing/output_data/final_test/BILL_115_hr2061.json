    "content": "The \"North Korean Human Rights Reauthorization Act of 2017\" was established in response to grave human rights violations in North Korea, including forced starvation, sexual violence, and arbitrary detention. The Act also addresses China's role in aiding and abetting these crimes against humanity by repatriating North Korean refugees. The Government of China violates non-refoulement principles by forcibly repatriating North Korean refugees, leading to imprisonment, torture, and execution. Estimates suggest 80,000 to 120,000 people are in political prison camps in North Korea, with harsh conditions, limited food, sexual abuse, and forced labor. The COI report highlighted the persecution of religious minorities, especially Christians, in North Korea where there is no freedom of religion. Christians face torture, detention, and even execution for practicing their faith. North Korea profits from human rights abuses, with thousands of workers forced to labor overseas under harsh conditions and low pay. The United States imposed sanctions on North Korean officials for human rights violations under the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016. The act requires penalties for those involved in serious human rights abuses by the North Korean government, potentially leading to significant profits from forced labor overseas. The United States has resettled 212 refugees from North Korea since the enactment of the North Korea Human Rights Act of 2004. Congress believes in improving information access in North Korea and the UN should promote human rights in the country. The United States should urge China to halt the forcible repatriation of North Koreans, allow UN access to determine refugee status, and fulfill obligations under international refugee agreements. The United States should urge China to address concerns of the United Nations Committee against Torture, recognize the legal status of North Korean women marrying Chinese citizens, and designate individuals committing violations under the North Korea Sanctions Act. The United States should take steps to increase public awareness about the risks of travel to North Korea, seek cooperation from foreign governments for refugee resettlement, and promote the protection of North Korean refugees through diplomatic efforts.
