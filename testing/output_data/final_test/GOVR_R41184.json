    "content": "The Small Business Administration (SBA) offers loan guaranty programs through nonprofit Certified Development Companies (CDCs) to provide long-term fixed rate financing for small businesses' major fixed assets. The 504/CDC program requires a third-party lender to provide 50% of the financing, with the CDC providing up to 40%. The 504/CDC program requires a third-party lender to provide at least 50% of the financing, the CDC provides up to 40% backed by a 100% SBA-guaranteed debenture, and the applicant provides at least 10%. The borrower makes two loan payments, one to the third-party lender and another to the CDC. The third-party loan can have a fixed or variable interest rate, is negotiated between the lender and the borrower, and must have at least a 7-year term for a 10-year debenture and at least 10-year term for a 20- or 25-year debenture. The CDC loan has a fixed interest rate and term of either 10 years or 20-25 years. The SBA's debenture is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States and is sold to underwriters forming debenture pools. In the 504/CDC program, the SBA guarantees timely payment of debentures sold to underwriters. Investors purchase interests in debenture pools and receive DCPC certificates. The SBA pays investors if small businesses fall behind on loan payments. In FY2018, 5,874 504/CDC loans were approved totaling $4.8 billion, with 56,601 loans outstanding. In FY2018, 56,601 504/CDC loans had an unpaid balance of $25.8 billion. Congressional interest in small business access to capital has increased, leading to changes in the 504/CDC program during the 111th Congress. For example, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided $375 million to reduce fees in SBA's loan guaranty programs. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $375 million to reduce fees in the SBA's loan guaranty programs and increase the maximum loan guaranty percentage. Congress later appropriated additional funds to extend the subsidies and loan modifications. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 further increased loan guaranty limits for the 504/CDC program. The Continuing Appropriations and Surface Transportation Extensions Act of 2011 expanded project eligibility for refinancing under the 504/CDC program, provided funding for fee subsidies in the 7(a) loan guaranty program, and established an alternative size standard for 504/CDC assistance. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 reinstated the expansion of project eligibility for refinancing under the 504/CDC loan. The Small Business Access to Capital and Efficiency (ACE) Act reinstated the expansion of project eligibility for refinancing under the 504/CDC loan program. The act also increased the threshold amount for requiring an independent real estate appraisal for a 504/CDC loan. The Trump Administration proposed increasing the maximum dollar amount for a 504 loan to a small manufacturer to $6.5 million from $5.5 million. The report discusses the rationale for the 504/CDC program, borrower and lender eligibility standards, program requirements, and statistics. Congressional actions to enhance small business access to capital are also reviewed. The report discusses small business access to capital through the 504/CDC program, including key legislation such as ARRA, P.L. 111-240, P.L. 114-113, and P.L. 115-371. It highlights issues with SBA's oversight of 504/CDC lenders and outlines the main participants in 504/CDC projects. The CDC provides up to 40% of financing through a 504/CDC debenture, which is 100% guaranteed by the SBA, while the borrower contributes at least 10% of the financing. The CDC's contribution and the SBA's guaranteed debenture cannot exceed certain percentages based on the type of loan. The SBA lists 27 limited and special purpose properties, such as dormitories, golf courses, hospitals, and bowling alleys. Borrowers must contribute a minimum of 10% of the financing for standard 504/CDC loans and at least 15% if the loan is for a limited-market property or special purpose property. If the borrower is a new business, they must contribute at least 20% for these types of properties. Small business applicants must be located in the United States to be eligible for a SBA business loan. To qualify for a SBA business loan, a small business applicant in the United States must be for-profit, meet size requirements, show a need for credit not available elsewhere, and be certified by a lender. Certain businesses like financial institutions, foreign-based businesses, and those involved in gambling or adult entertainment are prohibited from participating. To qualify for a SBA business loan, applicants must be creditworthy and able to assure repayment. The SBA requires lenders to consider character, reputation, credit history, management experience, business strength, earnings, cash flow, future prospects, equity investment, long-term success potential, collateral value, and affiliates' impact on repayment ability. A 504/CDC loan can be used for land purchase and improvements. The SBA 504/CDC loan can be used to purchase land, make improvements to buildings, install machinery and equipment, buy furniture and fixtures, pay professional fees, finance short-term debt, cover interim financing costs, and create a contingency fund. The SBA 504/CDC loan can finance various expenses such as renovations, machinery installation, and debt refinancing for business expansion. Borrowers must meet economic development objectives by creating or retaining jobs based on project debenture amounts within two years of completion. The SBA 504/CDC loan requires borrowers to create or retain jobs based on project debenture amounts within two years of completion. Borrowers must meet job creation or retention requirements, with 75% of jobs created in the community where the project is located. If job creation requirements are not met, borrowers can retain eligibility by meeting specific community development, public policy, or energy reduction goals. The SBA 504/CDC loan requires borrowers to create or retain jobs based on project debenture amounts within two years of completion. Borrowers must meet job creation or retention criteria of at least 1 job opportunity created or retained for every $75,000 in project debenture (or $85,000 in special geographic areas). Loans to small manufacturers are excluded from the calculation. Community development goals include improving the economy, stimulating business development, bringing new income, assisting manufacturing firms, and helping businesses in labor surplus areas. Public policy goals involve revitalizing business districts, expanding exports, developing women-owned small businesses, and more. The public policy goals involve revitalizing business districts, expanding exports, developing women-owned and -controlled small businesses, aiding rural development, increasing productivity and competitiveness, modernizing facilities, assisting businesses in areas affected by federal budget reductions, and reducing unemployment rates in labor surplus areas. Energy reduction goals include reducing energy consumption by 10% and increasing the use of sustainable designs. The Small Business Administration's guidelines for 504/CDC loans include promoting sustainable designs to reduce environmental impact, upgrading equipment with renewable energy sources, and increasing the use of micropower and renewable fuel producers. The maximum debenture amount has been increased to $5 million for loans directed towards public policy goals. The Small Business Administration has increased the maximum debenture amount for 504/CDC loans to $5.5 million for projects that align with public policy goals, small manufacturers, energy consumption reduction by 10%, and upgrades for renewable energy sources. Loan terms are determined by the SBA and published in the Federal Register, with maturities ranging from 10 to 25 years based on the asset being financed. The third-party lender's mortgage for a CDC/504 loan must be at least 7 years for a 10-year term or 10 years for a 20 or 25-year term. Borrowers make payments to both the lender and the CDC. The third-party loan can have a fixed or variable interest rate, subject to an interest rate cap set by the SBA. The maximum interest rate allowed is 6% above the New York prime rate or the state maximum. The interest rate for a 504/CDC loan is determined after the loan application is submitted to the SBA. The exact rate is finalized after pooling with other loan requests and selling to investors. The rate includes the debenture interest rate, note rate, and effective rate, with investors receiving interest semi-annually and borrowers making monthly payments. The SBA determines the interest rate for 504/CDC loans based on market conditions and pegged to an increment above the current market rate. In May 2019, the debenture rates for 10-year, 20-year, and 25-year 504/CDC loans were 2.66%, 2.88%, and 3.07% respectively, with effective full-term interest rates at 4.69%. In May 2019, the debenture rate for 25-year 504/CDC loans was 3.07%, with an effective full-term interest rate of 4.97%. The SBA may require additional collateral or increased equity contributions if certain criteria are not met, such as strong cash flow, proven management, and operational history of more than two years. All collateral must be insured as per SBA requirements. The CDC in the event of impending lapse of coverage. For 504/CDC loans, the applicant's cash flow is the primary source of repayment. If the lender's financial analysis shows lack of repayment assurance from the business's cash flow, the loan must be declined. CDCs must be nonprofit corporations in good standing, comply with laws, provide tax exempt status, specify area of operations, and have a board of directors. The CDC must meet specified requirements to maintain its status, including having a board of directors with at least nine voting members and meeting quarterly. Newly certified CDCs are on probation for two years, after which they must petition for permanent status or an extension. Satisfactory performance is determined by factors such as risk rating, historical performance measures, and loan volume. In FY2018, 194 CDCs provided 504/CDC loans. The CDC's board can establish a loan committee with specific requirements, including members with commercial lending experience, residing or working in the project's state, and no CDC staff on the committee. Multistate CDCs must have separate loan committees for each state they operate in. The SBA requires CDCs to have qualified staff, including an executive director, to manage loan operations. CDCs must comply with SBA loan program requirements and provide accurate information. CDCs with $20 million+ loan portfolios need audited financial statements, while those with less must have a review by an independent CPA. CDCs with loan portfolios over $20 million must submit a review of their balances by an independent CPA in accordance with GAAP. The analysis must include a financial analysis of the applicant's pro forma balance sheet, repayment ability, ratio analysis, and owners' relevant experience. The SBA established the ALP in 1991 to expedite the loan process for CDCs with a good track record in promoting local economic development. CDCs submit detailed information on owners' experience, collateral adequacy, credit history, and other relevant details to the Sacramento loan processing center. The Small Business Administration established the ALP in 1991 to expedite loan processing for CDCs with a good track record. CDCs can apply for ALP status based on various factors. ALP-CDCs receive quicker loan processing due to their credit analysis. About one-third of CDCs have ALP status, accounting for 60-70% of all 504/CDC lending each year. The Small Business Administration established the Premier Certified Lenders Program (PCLP) to expedite loan processing for CDCs with a good track record. CDCs with PCLP status have increased authority to process, close, service, and liquidate 504/CDC loans. Selection is based on various factors, including compliance with Loan Loss Reserve Fund requirements and a processing goal of 50%. PCLP-CDCs with a processing goal of 50% have the ability to process, close, service, and liquidate 504 and/or PCLP loans. They must maintain a Loan Loss Reserve Fund (LLRF) to reimburse the SBA for any losses. As of September 30, 2017, 15 CDCs had active PCLP status, but the number and amount of PCLP loans have declined in recent years. In FY2009, 373 PCLP loans totaling $185.4 million were disbursed, compared to 27 loans totaling $23.8 million in FY2018. CDCs must conduct independent appraisals for projects with property values exceeding federal limits. SBA-approved 504/CDC loans require independent appraisals for project properties exceeding federal limits. Appraisers must be state licensed or certified, with state certification necessary for properties valued over $1 million. Loans are disbursed within 48 months of approval, and interim financing can be obtained before the sale of a debenture. The borrower can obtain interim financing from a third-party lender for 50% of the total 504 project financing. The debenture sale repays the interim lender for the advanced project costs. The CDC closes the loan before a specific debenture funding date, with the project mostly complete at closing. SBA's district counsel reviews the closing package for approval, and the CDC forwards necessary documents to the Central Servicing Agent for debenture funding. CSA using a transmittal letter or spreadsheet. The 504/CDC program provides permanent or take-out financing, with an interim lender covering the period between SBA approval and debenture sale. Borrowers are charged fees totaling 3.5% of net debenture proceeds plus annual servicing and guaranty fees of 1% of the unpaid balance. The SBA charges CDCs five fees to recoup expenses: guaranty fee, servicing fee, funding fee, development company fee, and participation fee. The SBA charges CDCs various fees including a one-time guaranty fee of 0.5% of the debenture, an ongoing servicing fee, and a funding fee not to exceed 0.25% of the debenture. The servicing fee for FY2019 is 0.368% for regular loans and 0.395% for refinancing loans. The SBA charges CDCs various fees including an annual development company fee of 0.125% of the debenture's outstanding balance. Third-party lenders are charged a one-time participation fee of 0.5% of the senior mortgage loan. CDCs can charge borrowers various fees such as processing, closing, servicing, late, assumption, CSA, agent, and underwriters' fees. The CDC can charge various fees to borrowers, including processing, closing, and servicing fees. These fees can be reimbursed from the debenture proceeds. The CDC can also charge an annual servicing fee of 0.625% to 2% on the unpaid loan balance, with higher fees requiring SBA approval. Fees can be accrued without interest and collected from the borrower when payments are made. CSAs in 504/CDC financing can accrue fees without interest, collect late payment fees, and charge initiation and ongoing monthly servicing fees. CDCs may charge an assumption fee with SBA approval. Agent fees for debentures and certificates can be assessed to borrowers or investors. CDCs must review agent fees for debentures and certificates to ensure they are necessary and reasonable. If fees are deemed excessive, CDCs should contact the SBA for investigation. Borrowers are charged an up-front underwriters' fee for 10 or 20-year loans. Underwriters are approved by the SBA for forming debenture pools. The SBA provided over $1.1 billion in funding in 2009 and 2010 for fee subsidies and loan guaranty percentage increases in the 504/CDC and 7(a) programs. The last extension authorized fee subsidies and a 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage through March 4, 2011. The Obama Administration argued that additional funding for the SBA's loan guaranty programs, including the 504/CDC program's fee subsidies, improved the small business lending environment and supported job creation. Critics suggested alternative methods such as small business tax reduction and financial credit market regulation reform. Data from FY2005-FY2018 shows that 5% to 15% of SBA-approved 504/CDC loans are canceled annually for various reasons. The number and amount of 504/CDC loans declined in FY2008 and FY2009 due to decreased small business demand for capital during the recession, difficulties in credit markets, and tightening lending standards. However, they increased in FY2010 and FY2011, reaching prerecession levels, attributed to fee subsidies and economic recovery. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 contributed to increased loan volume in FY2011 and FY2012 for the 504/CDC program through refinancing of existing commercial debt. Loan volume declined in FY2013 and FY2014 after the temporary expansion expired, but has since somewhat increased. The SBA aims for a zero subsidy rate for its loan guaranty programs. In FY2016, borrowers used 504/CDC loan proceeds for various purposes such as purchasing land, buildings, machinery, making renovations, and covering other expenses. In 2008, a survey by the Urban Institute found that two-thirds of 504/CDC borrowers rated their overall satisfaction with their loan as excellent or good. Additionally, 87% of respondents reported that the 504/CDC loan was important to their business success. In March 2014, the Government Accountability Office released a report on the 504/CDC program. In FY2003 through March 31, 2013, top small businesses funded by 504/CDC loans were hotels, restaurants, doctor's offices, and dentist's offices. 85% of approved loans went to existing small businesses. In FY2018, 28.7% of approved loans went to minority-owned businesses and 10.6% to women-owned businesses. Urban Institute found that 9.9% of small business loans were issued to minority-owned businesses in 2008. Loans under the 7(a) and 504 programs were more likely to be made to minority-owned, women-owned, and start-up businesses compared to conventional small business loans. The average loan amounts for these types of firms were substantially greater under the 7(a) and 504 programs. This suggests that these programs align with SBA's objective of providing credit to firms facing capital gaps. The SBA received over $1.1 billion in funding in 2009 and 2010 to support these programs. The Obama Administration increased the guaranty percentage for all standard 7(a) loans to support small business lending and job creation. Critics argue for alternative methods like tax reduction and financial credit market reform. The SBA's Office of Inspector General and the GAO identified deficiencies in the oversight of 504/CDC lenders. The OIG audited 25 CDC/504 loans approved under PCL authority in FY 2008, finding that 68% of the loans totaling nearly $8.9 million were approved without prudent practices, with issues in underwriting and eligibility. In 2008, the OIG found that at least 572 loans totaling $254.9 million had weaknesses in underwriting, eligibility, and loan closing processes. Additionally, $56.4 million in loans were made based on faulty repayment analyses. The OIG also discovered issues with CDC executive compensation, with 4 out of 5 CDCs reviewed having high executive compensation levels. Recommendations were made to address these issues. The OIG recommended changes to the SBA's Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for lenders to use actual cash flow method, historical salary levels, and sales data for borrower repayment ability. The SBA disagreed with the recommendations and did not believe additional processes were necessary for lender assessments. The GAO recommended that the SBA strengthen oversight of lenders extending loans to small businesses. The SBA's lender risk rating system was found to be underutilized for on-site reviews and targeting high-risk lenders. The GAO found that 97% of high-risk lenders identified by the SBA's risk rating system in 2008 were not reviewed. On-site reviews by the SBA do not consider lenders' risk ratings or credit decisions. The SBA's oversight efforts need improvement, especially in on-site review processes. The number and amount of 504/CDC loans made through the PCLP have declined in recent years. The SBA's Office of Credit Risk Management introduced new metrics in 2015 for monitoring lender loan performance. The SBA introduced SMART metrics in 2016 to assess lender performance and reduce risk. Congress approved additional funding in 2009 to support SBA loan programs. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 provided funding to enhance small business access to capital, including fee subsidies and increased loan guaranty percentages for the SBA's 504/CDC and 7(a) loan programs. Loan limits were also raised for the 504/CDC program. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 increased loan limits for the 504/CDC program, expanded eligibility for refinancing existing commercial debt, and authorized the SBA to establish alternative size standards for the 7(a) and 504/CDC programs. The Obama Administration proposed increasing the maximum loan limits for SBA programs to support larger projects and help small businesses drive economic growth. Critics raised concerns about potential defaults and increased guaranty fees. Some stakeholders suggested a modest increase in maximum loan limits for the 7(a) program to focus on startup and early-stage small firms. Others proposed creating a direct lending program within the SBA to streamline access to capital for small businesses. Critics argued against providing additional resources to the SBA or modifying existing loan programs. The SBA's impact on small businesses' access to capital is limited according to some critics. They suggest focusing on small business tax reduction, financial credit market regulation reform, and federal fiscal restraint for economic growth. Legislation was introduced during the 112th Congress to extend the 504/CDC refinancing program, aiming to create jobs by lowering small business owners' monthly payments. The Small Business Administration 504 Loan Refinancing Extension Act of 2011 aimed to lower small business owners' monthly payments without cost to taxpayers. Opponents raised concerns about potential future funding needs and argued for alternative ways to support small businesses. The INVEST in America Act of 2012 proposed extending the ability to refinance projects without expansions using 504/CDC loans for an additional year beyond the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010. However, the amendment was deemed irrelevant and not included in the final bill approved by the Senate. S. 1828, a bill introduced in 2011, aimed to increase small business lending by reinstating fee subsidies for loan guaranty programs. Another bill during the 113th Congress sought to extend the temporary expansion of projects eligible for 504/CDC program refinancing. The Commercial Real Estate and Economic Development (CREED) Act of 2013 aimed to reinstate the temporary expansion of projects eligible for 504/CDC program refinancing for five years. Its companion bill in the Senate, S. 289, also sought to reinstate this expansion during fiscal years with zero subsidy. Additionally, the Increasing Small Business Lending Act, H.R. 4652, was introduced to support small business lending. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 reinstated the expansion of eligible projects for 504/CDC program refinancing in fiscal years with zero subsidy. It also set limits on refinancing amounts and waived restrictions for good cause. An interim final rule was issued by the SBA to implement the new refinancing program. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 reinstated the expansion of eligible projects for 504/CDC program refinancing in fiscal years with zero subsidy. It eliminated an alternative job retention goal provision and set limits on refinancing amounts. The Obama Administration had requested authority to reinstate the 504/CDC refinancing program without a business expansion requirement. The Small Business Access to Capital and Efficiency (ACE) Act in FY2016 increased the threshold amount for CDCs to secure an independent real estate appraisal for a 504/CDC loan. The act also raised the threshold amount for when a CDC may be required to secure an independent real estate appraisal for a 504/CDC loan. The Small Business Access to Capital and Efficiency (ACE) Act in FY2016 increased the threshold amount for CDCs to secure an independent real estate appraisal for a 504/CDC loan. The act also raised the threshold amount for when a CDC may be required to secure an independent real estate appraisal for a 504/CDC loan. The change was designed to remove the uncertainty lenders now have juggling two different real estate appraisal thresholds. S. 347, the Investing in America's Small Manufacturers Act, would allow CDCs to provide up to 50% of project costs instead of up to 40% for small manufacturers under certain conditions. Congressional debate during the 111th Congress focused on the impact of proposed changes to SBA's loan guaranty programs on small business access to capital, job retention, and job creation. President Obama and others argued for additional resources for the SBA to help small businesses access capital and create jobs, while some advocated for business tax reduction and fiscal restraint. Specific program changes were made to enhance job creation and retention, such as continuing fee subsidies for the 504/CDC program and increasing loan limits. During the 112th-115th Congresses, oversight focused on SBA's administration of program changes enacted earlier, impact on lending, and ways to minimize increased costs associated with loans. Critics raised concerns about potential defaults and higher guaranty fees, advocating for a more modest increase in loan limits to focus on start-ups and early-stage small firms. During the 116th Congress, oversight will likely focus on the SBA's administration of the 504/CDC program to ensure efficiency and its efficacy in job retention and creation, amidst federal fiscal constraints."
