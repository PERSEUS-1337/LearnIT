The HIPAA Privacy Rule applies to health care providers, plans, clearinghouses, and vendors known as \"business associates\" who handle protected health information. The HIPAA Privacy Rule applies to covered entities and their business associates, imposing penalties for unauthorized use or disclosure of protected health information. Clearinghouses play a crucial role in converting provider information into electronic claims and facilitating payments, allowing for longitudinal and geographical data analysis. Clearinghouses, as both covered entities and business associates under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, face limitations in analyzing claims data. Removing the business-associate role would allow clearinghouses to utilize health-related data more effectively for the benefit of the healthcare system and medical innovation in the 21st Century. Clearinghouses, as covered entities, would still be subject to civil and criminal penalties under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Specific analytical uses should be authorized for clearinghouses, with disclosure of health information following the current protection principles of the Rule. SEC. 13451 of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act authorizes analytical functions for health care clearinghouses to improve the health care system.
