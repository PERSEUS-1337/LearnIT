    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Welcoming Business Travelers and Tourists to America Act of 2011\". Congress finds that international travel to the United States generates over $134 billion annually in exports, supports 1.8 million U.S. jobs, and creates a balance-of-trade surplus of $31.7 billion. Global travel spending is projected to double to $2.1 trillion in the next decade, but the U.S. market share of long-haul travel decreased from 17% to 12% between 2000 and 2010. The United States missed out on welcoming 78 million visitors and generating $606 billion in spending over a decade. Lagging overseas arrivals are partly due to an inefficient visa application process perceived as time-consuming and inaccessible. Efforts to address staffing and consular constraints are reported as temporary, unsustainable, and insufficient by the Government Accountability Office. Instituting new procedures to streamline visa processing can address backlogs and inefficiencies. Increasing international travel to the United States can boost the economy and support foreign policy objectives. The Department of State has implemented reforms to speed up visa processing in China and Brazil, but more changes are needed to meet demand. Removing barriers in the visa application process could benefit the United States economically and in terms of public diplomacy. The Secretary of State will set a visa processing standard of 12 days or fewer in China, Brazil, and India, using machine-readable nonimmigrant visa fees to hire more officers. Additionally, visa video-conferencing is addressed. The Secretary of State will conduct a two-year pilot program for processing nonimmigrant visas using secure remote video-conferencing technology. This program aims to include as many visa applicants as possible by establishing reasonable enrollment costs. Additionally, within 90 days of the Act's enactment, a rulemaking process will be initiated to establish program criteria and fees. The Secretary of State may impose a fee for the pilot program described in subsection (a), not exceeding the aggregate costs associated with the program. The fees collected will be credited to the Department of State for program purposes. Additionally, the Secretary of State is required to submit reports to the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives at specific intervals. The House of Representatives and Senate committees require a report on a pilot program using secure remote video-conferencing for visa interviews. The report will evaluate the effectiveness of this method in assessing credibility and detecting fraud, with recommendations on whether to continue, expand, or modify the program. SEC. 5. DATA ON VISA INTERVIEW WAIT TIMES. The Secretary of State must publish data on nonimmigrant visa wait times for interview appointments and processing for each U.S. diplomatic and consular mission. SEC. 6. VISA SYSTEM PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT. The Secretary of State must provide a report to the House and Senate Committees on Foreign Affairs and Foreign Relations, including an annual forecast of nonimmigrant visa demand in Brazil, China, and India through 2020. The report should detail the methodology used for forecasting, including internal and external studies, and whether it incorporates the Department of Commerce's analysis of visitor arrival projections. The report to the House and Senate Committees on Foreign Affairs and Foreign Relations must include a comparison of visa demand projections and visitor arrival projections for Brazil, China, and India through 2020. It should also describe current practices for managing visa workload and outline plans to meet future demand, including facility expansion needs. Additionally, the report should address the number of consular officers needed for non-career appointments. The Department of State needs to hire consular officers annually through 2020 to maintain a 12-day visa processing standard in Brazil, China, and India. Strategies to maximize existing consular and embassy space for the new personnel are also required. SEC. 7. VISA VALIDITY PERIOD. The Secretary of State may modify visa validity periods with certain countries on a non-reciprocal basis if no adversarial effects to the United States are demonstrated."
