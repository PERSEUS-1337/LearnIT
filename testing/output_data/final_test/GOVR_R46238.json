    "content": "FOIA requires federal agencies to make agency records available to the public and any person who requests them. The key terms \"agency,\" \"agency records,\" and \"any person\" determine the scope of FOIA, specifying which entities must comply, what materials must be disclosed, and who has the right to request records. The APA defines \"agency\" broadly as any authority of the US government. FOIA defines \"agency\" broadly as any executive department, military department, Government corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Government. It does not apply to Congress, federal courts, or territorial governments. Some entities within the Executive Office of the President are also not subject to FOIA. In the case of Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, the Supreme Court ruled that transcripts of Henry Kissinger's phone conversations as Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs were not subject to FOIA disclosure. The Court clarified that certain units in the Executive Office, like the President's immediate personal staff, are not considered \"agencies\" under FOIA. Entities within the EOP that have substantial independent authority, such as the Office of Management and Budget, are considered agencies under FOIA. FOIA requires disclosure of \"agency records\" controlled by the agency at the time of the request. The Burka test determines agency control of records based on the document's intent. The \"Burka test\" developed by the D.C. Circuit assesses agency control over records by considering the creator's intent, agency's ability to use the record, reliance on the document by agency personnel, and integration into the agency's record system. FOIA does not require agencies to disclose personal records of employees, as it only applies to agency records already under their control. Tax Analysts explained that the term 'agency records' is not broad enough to include personal materials in an employee's possession, even if physically located at the agency. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit uses a \"totality of the circumstances test\" to determine if material is an \"agency record\" under FOIA. In Consumer Federation of America v. Department of Agriculture, the court ruled that electronic calendars of USDA officials were considered \"agency records\" as they were created by agency employees, located within the agency, updated daily, and maintained on the agency's computer. The court ruled that electronic calendars of USDA officials were considered \"agency records\" based on their use for scheduling agency operations and distribution to staff. However, a separate USDA official's electronic calendar was not deemed an agency record as it was only shared with secretaries and not relied upon by others for agency business. FOIA does not require the disclosure of personal materials, but issues may arise when nonofficial electronic accounts are used by agency personnel. In Competitive Enterprise Institute v. Office of Science & Technology Policy (OSTP), the court addressed the issue of agency personnel using nonofficial electronic accounts for communication. The director of OSTP used a private email account for work-related purposes, which the agency denied access to. The D.C. Circuit ruled that records maintained by the agency head, even if taken out of the office, still retain their agency character and must be accessible. The D.C. Circuit's decision in Competitive Enterprise Institute v. Office of Science & Technology Policy states that agency records, even if in nonofficial electronic accounts, are subject to FOIA. FOIA allows disclosure of nonexempt agency records to any person, including individuals, corporations, and foreign governments. Access to records under FOIA is not limited to American citizens. The Supreme Court has clarified that a requester's identity does not affect the disclosure of records under FOIA. Agencies are required to proactively disclose certain information to the public, in addition to responding to specific requests. FOIA allows any person to request covered records from federal agencies. FOIA imposes affirmative disclosure provisions on federal agencies, requiring them to proactively disseminate certain agency records to the public. This includes publishing important government materials in the Federal Register and providing electronic access to final agency adjudicative opinions and frequently requested records. The goal is to enable the public to readily access necessary information for effective engagement. FOIA requires federal agencies to proactively publish information for public access, including agency organization details, procedural rules, forms, substantive rules, and policy statements. The goal is to enable the public to engage effectively with agencies. FOIA imposes penalties for agencies failing to publish required information, ensuring affected parties are not adversely affected by unpublished materials. Courts allow judicial review of agency withholding of materials but may have limited remedies. In Kennecott Utah Copper Corporation v. DOI, the court ruled that FOIA does not authorize courts to order agencies to publish materials in the Federal Register. The court in Kennecott Utah Copper Corporation v. DOI ruled that FOIA does not authorize courts to order agencies to publish materials in the Federal Register. The court explained that providing documents to the individual relieves informational injury, while requiring publication goes beyond that need. The penalty for materials not published in the Federal Register gives agencies an incentive to comply with their obligation. FOIA's second affirmative disclosure provision, known as the \"reading-room provision,\" requires agencies to electronically disclose certain information unless promptly published and offered for sale. This includes final opinions, policy statements, administrative manuals, and released records in response to FOIA requests. The FOIA's second affirmative disclosure provision mandates agencies to electronically disclose specific information that has been requested multiple times or is likely to be requested again. This provision aims to make agency orders, opinions, and instructions accessible to the public, preventing the existence of \"secret agency law.\" Materials falling under this provision are typically available on agency websites. The FOIA's second affirmative disclosure provision requires agencies to maintain and make available for public inspection in an electronic format indexes of specific materials. Agencies cannot rely on certain materials without indexing and making them available to the public. Judicial review is authorized for challenges to the availability of these materials. There is debate over whether courts have the authority to order agencies to make these records available in agency reading rooms. Under FOIA, agencies must proactively disclose specific information under affirmative disclosure provisions. Requested records not covered by these provisions are disclosed on a case-by-case basis. FOIA sets procedural requirements for requesters and agencies, including the right to appeal agency decisions before seeking court review. Section 552(a)(3)(A) of title 5 of the U.S. Code governs the prompt production of requested records. An agency must promptly provide records in response to a valid FOIA request that reasonably describes the records sought and complies with the agency's rules. The agency must conduct a search that is reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents. The D.C. Circuit emphasizes the adequacy of the government's search for responsive documents under FOIA. Agencies are required to make reasonable efforts to search for records in electronic form, promoting electronic database searches. FOIA mandates agencies to respond within specific timeframes and allows for administrative review of unfavorable decisions. Upon receiving a valid FOIA request, agencies have twenty business days to determine compliance and notify the requester promptly. In response to a FOIA request, agencies must determine whether to comply and notify the requester promptly. The agency may extend the deadline by ten days in unusual circumstances. The D.C. Circuit ruled that agencies must indicate the scope of documents they will produce and exemptions claimed within the timeframe. Under \u00a7 552(a)(3)(A), agencies must make records promptly available after disclosing the scope of records and exemptions. Requesters can appeal adverse determinations within the agency, with a 20-day timeline for a determination. If the agency upholds its decision, the requester can seek judicial review after exhausting administrative remedies. FOIA requires requesters to exhaust administrative remedies by submitting a valid request and appealing adverse decisions internally. If an agency fails to respond within FOIA timeframes, the requester is considered to have constructively exhausted remedies and can seek court review. FOIA aims to provide public access to government information while also protecting certain interests through exemptions. FOIA's exemptions, codified at 5 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 552(b), aim to strike a balance between public disclosure and government confidentiality. The exemptions, listed in Table 1, cover a range of information from national security to geological data. Despite agencies having the ability to withhold records, the Supreme Court has emphasized that FOIA's exemptions should be narrowly construed. The Supreme Court has directed that FOIA's exemptions should be narrowly construed, with agencies required to take reasonable steps to disclose nonexempt information. The 2016 amendments to FOIA limit agencies from withholding information unless harm is foreseen or disclosure is legally prohibited, aligning with the statute's prodisclosure mandate. The Supreme Court has emphasized that FOIA's exemptions must be narrowly interpreted, with agencies obligated to disclose nonexempt information. In a recent case, the D.C. Circuit ruled that agencies cannot redact information as \"non-responsive\" when disclosing records under FOIA, but must adhere to the nine exemptions provided by the act. The focus of FOIA is on information disclosure, not document withholding. FOIA calls for disclosure of a responsive record, not disclosure of responsive information within a record. Certain statutes may prohibit agencies from disclosing material exempt under FOIA, such as Exemption 3 and Exemption 4 which cover confidential commercial or financial information and trade secrets. Disclosure of information protected by an Exemption 3 withholding statute could violate that statute. The TSA prohibits unauthorized disclosure of certain confidential materials not authorized by law. Agencies must disclose records within FOIA's coverage if not exempt under FOIA or prohibited by another law. Courts have ruled that prior disclosure of information may waive an agency's ability to apply an exemption. The first FOIA exemption allows agencies to withhold information related to national defense or foreign policy, authorized under specific criteria. This exemption reflects Congress's interest in maintaining confidentiality, but not all national-security-related information can be withheld under Exemption 1. The second FOIA exemption pertains to the classification of national security information under Executive Order 13526, covering military plans, scientific matters, and nuclear safeguarding programs. Information withheld under this exemption must meet the requirements outlined in the executive order. Exemption 2 of the FOIA allows agencies to withhold information related to internal personnel rules and practices, such as hiring, firing, work rules, discipline, compensation, and benefits. This exemption covers information that agencies must keep for their own use and is not of significant public interest. Exemption 2 of the FOIA allows agencies to withhold internal records that could risk circumvention of agency regulations or statutes. The Supreme Court clarified that this exemption only applies to employee relations and human resources records, not broader internal information. Agencies must now seek alternative exemptions under FOIA for withholding such information. Exemption 3 under FOIA allows agencies to withhold information protected by non-FOIA statutes. Congress has enacted various statutes restricting government information disclosure, covering visa determinations, drug pricing data, patent applications, and tax returns. However, Exemption 3 is limited to specific categories of statutes to ensure information protection. Exemption 3 under FOIA covers two categories of statutes to ensure that policy decisions on governmental secrecy are made by the Legislative branch. The first category mandates absolute confidentiality without agency discretion, while the second allows for some administrative discretion based on specific criteria or standards. Exemption 3 under FOIA limits statutes subject to its coverage, requiring statutes enacted after 2009 to specifically cite the exemption. Third parties often submit sensitive information to the government, covered by Exemption 4 of FOIA. Exemption 4 of FOIA allows agencies to withhold trade secrets and commercial information obtained from outside entities. Trade secrets are defined as valuable plans, formulas, or processes used in the production of goods. This exemption covers a wide range of information, including drug manufacturing details. Most Exemption 4 litigation focuses on commercial or financial information rather than trade secrets. Courts often debate whether such information is considered confidential under Exemption 4. Prior to 2019, the leading test for determining the meaning of \"confidential\" under Exemption 4 was developed by the D.C. Circuit in National Parks & Conservation Association v. Morton. The National Parks test considered commercial or financial information confidential if its disclosure could impair the Government's ability to obtain necessary information in the future or cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person providing the information. However, in Food Marketing Institute (FMI) v. Argus Leader Media, the Supreme Court rejected this test and held that commercial or financial information is confidential if it is both customarily and actually so. The Supreme Court's decision in Food Marketing Institute (FMI) v. Argus Leader Media broadened the definition of \"confidential\" under Exemption 4 to include commercial or financial information that is both customarily and actually treated as private by its owner and provided to the government under an assurance of privacy. This allows agencies to withhold a larger category of information from FOIA's disclosure mandate. The Court did not clearly define the boundaries of this new test, but it emphasized the importance of the first condition being met for information to qualify as confidential. Additionally, Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. Exemption 5 of the FOIA allows agencies to withhold inter-agency or intra-agency documents that would not be available to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. The exemption aims to protect the \"full and frank exchange of opinions\" within the executive branch to ensure effective functioning. Documents must meet specific criteria to fall under Exemption 5's coverage, including originating from an agency and falling within a privilege against discovery in litigation. Exemption 5 of the FOIA allows agencies to withhold inter-agency or intra-agency documents that would not be available to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. In DOI v. Klamath Water Users Protective Association, the Supreme Court ruled that certain communications from external consultants may not be protected under Exemption 5 if they seek a government benefit at the expense of others. Documents must not be routinely or normally disclosed in litigation against the agency to qualify for the exemption. Exemption 5 of the FOIA protects records that are not routinely or normally disclosed in litigation, incorporating government privileges under relevant laws. Privileges mentioned in FOIA's legislative history are covered, but novel or less universally accepted privileges may not be. The Supreme Court and lower federal courts have identified several privileges embraced by Exemption 5. The deliberative process privilege is a component of executive privilege, protecting agency records that are predecisional and deliberative. Factual material is generally not protected, and the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 amended Exemption 5 to exclude the privilege for documents created 25 years or more before the date of request. The presidential communications privilege, a component of executive privilege, protects communications related to a President's responsibilities and decision-making process. It also includes communications from senior White House advisers and immediate staff involved in preparing recommendations for the President. The presidential communications privilege protects communications from senior White House advisers and immediate staff involved in preparing recommendations for the President. It also incorporates the attorney-client privilege, which generally protects confidential communications made for the purpose of obtaining legal assistance. The attorney work-product privilege under Exemption 5 protects materials prepared in anticipation of litigation by an agency, even if the litigation has ended. This privilege aims to maintain an effective adversarial litigation system, as seen in Federal Trade Commission v. Grolier. The Supreme Court's decision was based on Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and federal judicial interpretations of work-product materials. Federal judicial decisions have determined that work-product materials retain their immunity from discovery even after the termination of the litigation for which they were prepared. Exemption 5 incorporates privileges like the work-product privilege, making such materials not routinely available in subsequent litigation. Other privileges, such as the Machin privilege for confidential statements to air crash safety inspectors, are also protected under Exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects confidential commercial information generated by the government in the contract award process. Exemption 6 shields personal files to prevent unwarranted invasion of privacy, including health records and social security numbers. It applies to individuals but not corporations. Courts have not extended Exemption 6 protections to corporations. The term \"similar files\" broadly encompasses any information that applies to a particular individual, such as personnel and medical files. Examples of qualifying information types include names and addresses of federal annuitants, citizenship information, asylum requests, and marital status. The information regarding marital status, legitimacy of children, identity of fathers, medical condition, welfare payments, alcoholic consumption, family fights, and reputation is not exempt from disclosure under FOIA. Agencies and courts balance the privacy interest against the public interest in disclosure, requiring a substantial privacy interest to justify withholding information. The core purpose of FOIA is to contribute significantly to disclosure. FOIA's seventh exemption applies to \"records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes,\" where disclosure could result in specified harms. Exemption 7 allows agencies to keep certain records confidential to avoid hindering investigations. Records must be compiled for law enforcement purposes to qualify for exemption. Exemption 7 of the FOIA applies to records compiled for law enforcement purposes, even if not originally intended for that purpose. The Supreme Court has ruled that this exemption also covers material gathered for law enforcement purposes before responding to a FOIA request. Additionally, material originally compiled for law enforcement purposes remains exempt when reproduced or summarized in a new document for a non-law-enforcement purpose. The term \"compiled\" in Exemption 7 requires that the document be created, gathered, or used by an agency for law enforcement purposes before invoking the exemption. This exemption has been applied to records compiled for criminal, civil, and administrative enforcement, as well as materials related to national and homeland security. Exemption 7 of the FOIA applies to records compiled for law enforcement purposes, including materials related to national and homeland security. The exemption applies to agencies primarily engaged in law enforcement as well as mixed-function agencies. Agencies must establish that withheld materials are compiled for law enforcement purposes to invoke the exemption. However, simply establishing that material was compiled for law enforcement purposes is not sufficient to exempt it from disclosure under FOIA. Exemption 7(A) of the FOIA allows for the withholding of law enforcement records if disclosure could interfere with enforcement proceedings. Courts have set limits on its application, requiring agencies to prove that harm will occur from releasing information that the targets of the investigation already possess. Exemption 7(B) allows withholding of information that could interfere with a fair trial or adjudication. The D.C. Circuit requires pending or imminent proceedings and a high likelihood of interference for this exemption to apply. Exemption 7(C) permits withholding records to protect personal privacy. Exemption 7(C) provides more protection for personal privacy than Exemption 6, as it covers disclosures that \"could reasonably be expected to\" invade privacy. Both exemptions involve a case-by-case balancing of private and public interests. Exemption 7(D) applies to disclosures that could reveal the identity of a confidential source or information provided by a confidential source in criminal or national security investigations. A source is considered confidential if the government promises to keep the information confidential or if it can be reasonably inferred from the circumstances. Exemption 7(E) allows withholding of records that could disclose law enforcement techniques and procedures or guidelines to prevent circumvention of the law. The Court in Landano rejected the presumption of confidentiality for FBI sources but acknowledged it in certain circumstances related to the nature of the crime and the witness' involvement. Exemption 7(F) and Exemption 8 of FOIA protect against disclosure that could endanger individuals' safety or financial institution reports prepared for regulatory purposes. The 1986 amendments expanded Exemption 7(F) to cover any individual, not just law enforcement personnel. Exemption 8 applies to reports related to financial institutions' regulation or supervision. Exemption 8 of FOIA protects financial institution reports by limiting access to overseeing agencies to safeguard their security and relationship with supervising agencies. Exemption 9 exempts geological and geophysical information concerning wells. FOIA also includes three records exclusions, allowing agencies to withhold certain law enforcement records from FOIA requirements. FOIA's exclusions allow agencies to withhold records without comment, while exemptions require agencies to disclose the grounds for withholding. Exclusion (c)(1) covers records that could interfere with enforcement proceedings. Exclusion (c)(1) of FOIA allows agencies to withhold records related to ongoing law enforcement proceedings if disclosure could interfere with the investigation by tipping off the subject. This exclusion is no longer applicable once the investigation becomes public. The second exclusion under FOIA allows criminal law enforcement agencies to withhold records maintained under an informant's name to protect their identity from being exposed by sophisticated requesters. This exclusion aims to prevent individuals from uncovering confidential informants within organizations. The second exclusion under FOIA allows law enforcement agencies to protect the identities of confidential informants by withholding records maintained under an informant's name. This exclusion prevents the disclosure of informant identities by requiring suspected informants to request their own law enforcement records or submit a privacy waiver. However, agencies cannot use this exclusion if the informant's status has been officially confirmed. Additionally, the third exclusion under FOIA protects FBI records related to foreign intelligence, counterintelligence, or international terrorism. The FBI may exclude records related to foreign intelligence, counterintelligence, or international terrorism from FOIA if their existence is classified information under Exemption 1. Exclusion (c)(3) aims to prevent harm by allowing agencies to withhold sensitive records as long as their existence remains classified. FOIA provides a statutory right of access to agency records and allows requesters to enforce this right through judicial review. Legal actions can also be taken to prevent agencies from disclosing requested information in certain situations. Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B), federal district courts have jurisdiction to enjoin agencies from withholding agency records and order the production of improperly withheld records. The Supreme Court clarified that agency records are considered improperly withheld when an agency refuses to disclose requested records not protected by an exemption. However, a court order prohibiting disclosure can make an agency's decision to withhold a record not improper. In Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, the Court clarified that records are not \"withheld\" under \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) if they were removed from the agency's possession before a request was filed. The question remains unanswered whether an agency \"withholds\" a record by routing it out of agency possession to avoid a FOIA request. An agency's FOIA obligations may extend to documents outside its immediate custody or control if there is evidence of attempts to shield records from search or disclosure. An improper withholding is not limited to explicit rejections of requests. An improper withholding under FOIA is not just limited to explicit rejections of requests. It also includes situations like an inadequate search for responsive records. Courts review appeals from agency withholding decisions \"de novo,\" without deference to the agency's decision. However, some deference may be given in cases involving national security. Review of fee waiver decisions is de novo but limited to the agency's record. In FOIA lawsuits, agencies defending withholding decisions often provide a \"Vaughn Index\" to justify their decisions. This index helps address the informational asymmetry between the plaintiff and the agency by detailing the reasons for withholdings and correlating them with specific parts of the withheld documents. Agencies can justify nondisclosure decisions through affidavits of agency officials that describe justifications with specific detail, demonstrate logical exemption claims, and are uncontroverted by contrary evidence. Courts may conduct in camera reviews of withheld information when agencies fail to provide detailed explanations for exemptions. Courts may authorize agencies to submit in camera agency affidavits, but in camera inspection of withheld records is generally disfavored. Requesters can seek judicial review of an agency's decision to withhold information under FOIA, and parties may pursue reverse-FOIA lawsuits to prevent disclosure of sensitive information. In Chrysler Corporation v. Brown, the Supreme Court ruled that neither the FOIA statute nor the TSA allows for a private right of action. The Court held that there is no private right of action under the FOIA or TSA to stop an agency from disclosing information, but judicial review is available under the APA. In reverse-FOIA suits, courts review agency decisions under the APA's criteria for unlawful actions. The burden of proof lies with the plaintiff in reverse-FOIA actions. Executive Order 12600 requires agencies to notify submitters of confidential commercial information if disclosure is being considered in response to a FOIA request. The executive order requires agencies to notify submitters of confidential commercial information if disclosure is being considered in response to a FOIA request. The Supreme Court's decision in FMI v. Argus Leader Media changed the test for Exemption 4, advising agencies to use a broader definition of \"confidential.\" Congress is not subject to FOIA, but the act raises questions relevant to the legislative branch, such as agencies not withholding information from Congress. The act prohibits agencies from withholding information from Congress based on FOIA exemptions. There is debate on whether this applies to individual Members of Congress or only to requests from each house or committees. Congress is not obligated to disclose its own materials under FOIA, but agency possession of congressional documents depends on Congress's control expression. FOIA implicates congressional interests in various ways beyond these topics. FOIA's \"special access\" provision clarifies that agencies cannot withhold information from Congress under FOIA exemptions. This provision ensures transparency between the executive branch and Congress, emphasizing that FOIA does not authorize withholding information from Congress. The Department of Justice has a dispute over whether individual Members of Congress have access to exempt records under FOIA. DOJ maintains that agencies can withhold materials in response to individual Member requests, while requests from a House of Congress benefit from FOIA's withholding prohibition. The Department of Justice disputes whether individual Members of Congress can access exempt records under FOIA. DOJ argues that agencies can withhold materials in response to individual Member requests, while requests from a House of Congress are protected by FOIA's withholding prohibition. However, some criticize DOJ's narrow interpretation of the special access provision, which limits access for individual Members acting in their official capacities. The court ruled that the Army did not waive Exemption 5 protection for an internal agency memorandum by sharing it with an individual Member of Congress. The court's decision was based on the special access provision, stating that agencies will not waive the exemption as Congress has reserved the right to receive information not available to the public. The court emphasized that all Members of Congress have a constitutionally recognized status entitling them to access executive information, and it would be inappropriate for the courts to decide otherwise without congressional direction. The court ruled that the special access provision allows individual Members of Congress to request information from the executive branch in their official capacity. This decision was in response to the Department of Justice's narrow interpretation, which was a reaction to the Murphy case. Members from both political parties have cited Murphy to support their right to access information. The Department of Justice's narrow interpretation of FOIA's application to individual Members of Congress conflicts with the court's ruling that allows them to request information from the executive branch in their official capacity. DOJ argues that interpreting \"Congress\" to include individual Members goes against the Constitution and legislative history. The D.C. Circuit's interpretation of FOIA exempts Congress from responding to FOIA requests for documents in its possession, including those obtained from or created in response to congressional requests. This conflicts with the Department of Justice's narrow view on FOIA's application to individual Members of Congress. In American Civil Liberties Union v. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the D.C. Circuit ruled that a confidential report by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence evaluating a CIA program on detention and interrogation was a congressional record exempt from FOIA. The committee's final report, completed in 2014, was distributed to the President and other executive branch officials. The committee's intent to control the document was deemed clear by the court. The committee's chair and vice chair sent a letter to the CIA outlining conditions for examining CIA documents at a secure reading room. The documents generated by Committee staff or Members are considered congressional records and will remain under the Committee's control even after the review is completed. The CIA will notify the Committee of any external requests for access to congressional records, and the Committee maintains control over its work product, including the 2014 final report on the CIA's oversight investigation. The report was intended to prevent the repetition of criticized practices and aid in the development of CIA programs and executive branch guidelines. The final report on the CIA's oversight investigation is under the Committee's control. Congress's intent to control records depends on the language used in their directive to the agency. In a case involving the IRS, the court ruled that a letter from Congress did not fully protect the agency's response. The court ruled that the language in Congress's directive to the IRS did not fully protect the agency's response, except for parts that would disclose the committee's request. The case was remanded to determine if redactions could be made to release non-protected information under FOIA exemptions. The D.C. Circuit has outlined principles for determining congressional intent to control records under FOIA exemptions. Post-hoc objections and general expressions may not convey sufficient intent. In Paisley v. CIA, letters from the Senate Committee on Intelligence were not deemed enough to control documents. The D.C. Circuit has outlined principles for determining congressional intent to control records under FOIA exemptions. In cases like United We Stand and American Oversight, the manifestation of intent to control documents varied, with specific criteria and circumstances playing a crucial role. In Oversight, Inc. v. Department of Health & Human Services, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia found that Congress intended to retain control over certain email messages, leading to the decision that the materials were not agency records subject to disclosure under FOIA. FOIA is the main way for the public to access federal government records, but other laws like FACA, the Sunshine Act, and the Privacy Act also regulate access to government information. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) governs the establishment and operation of advisory committees providing advice to federal agencies. FACA mandates public availability of committee documents and allows public attendance at meetings. The Sunshine Act requires transparency in meetings of certain boards and commissions, with exemptions similar to FOIA. The Privacy Act also regulates access to government information. The Privacy Act governs the collection, use, and disclosure of agency records containing identifiable information about U.S. citizens and permanent residents. It prohibits disclosure without consent, with exceptions including disclosure required by FOIA. Individuals can request access to and amendment of their records, subject to exemptions."
