The Act defines \"coal-to-liquid\" as the use of coal resources in the United States to produce synthetic fuel for transportation using Fischer-Tropsch reactions. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the relevant department. The Act defines \"coal-to-liquid\" as using coal resources in the US to produce synthetic fuel for transportation. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. The Act establishes a Coal-to-Liquid Fuel Loan Guarantee Program. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to include large-scale coal-to-liquid facilities that produce at least 10,000 barrels a day of liquid transportation fuel using U.S. coal resources. Appropriations are authorized for guarantees for these projects under the Coal-to-Liquid Fuel Loan Guarantee Program. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to include large-scale coal-to-liquid facilities producing at least 10,000 barrels a day of liquid transportation fuel using U.S. coal resources. Eligible applicants can choose alternative funding by paying the estimated cost of the loan guarantee to the Secretary. Limitations are set on the number of loan guarantees issued and production capacity covered. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to include large-scale coal-to-liquid facilities producing up to 20,000 barrels of coal-to-liquid fuel per day. Non-federal funding is required for facilities producing more than 20,000 barrels per day. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to include guidelines for coal-to-liquids loan guarantees, with applications accepted within a year and final determinations made within another year. The Secretary must report to Congress on the status of the coal-to-liquids loan guarantee program within specific timeframes after enactment, approval of first and fifth applications. SEC. 4. COAL-TO-LIQUID FACILITIES LOAN PROGRAM. The Secretary will establish a program providing loans up to $20,000,000 for eligible recipients to cover costs for planning, permitting, and constructing coal-to-liquid facilities producing at least 10,000 barrels per day. Applicants must submit required information for consideration. Eligible recipients must provide a non-Federal match to receive a loan. To be eligible for a loan under this program, recipients must provide a dollar-for-dollar non-Federal match. Repayment of the loan must be made within 5 years, and can come from any financing received for the coal-to-liquid facility. Requirements and guidelines will be provided within 180 days.

Reports on the program's status must be submitted to Congress every 180 days and 1 year after the Act's enactment. $200,000,000 is authorized for this section. The Secretary will promulgate regulations to support coal-to-liquid manufacturing facilities on Federal land, including carbon dioxide capture. Additionally, there will be guidelines for loan applications and reporting requirements for the program's status. $200,000,000 is authorized for this initiative. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act is amended to include a study on maintaining coal-to-liquid products in the Reserve. The Secretary and the Secretary of Defense are required to conduct a feasibility study and submit the findings to relevant Senate committees. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act is amended to allow the Secretary to construct storage facilities near pipeline infrastructure and military bases for coal-to-liquid fuel products. Additionally, amendments are made to Section 160 regarding petroleum products storage in the Reserve. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act is amended to allow the Secretary to include coal-to-liquid products in the Reserve, not exceeding 20 percent of total petroleum products. Conforming amendments are made to Section 167 regarding storage facilities and redesignating subsections.
