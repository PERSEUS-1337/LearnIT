    "content": "The National Park System includes various units with different physical features and designations bestowed by Congress. There are over 20 different designations used, some unique to the National Park Service. National parks, known as the \"crown jewels,\" are large areas with outstanding natural features and ecological resources, strictly protected from consumptive activities. National monuments are established by the President or Congress and are smaller than national parks, often preserving a single significant resource. They may contain historical artifacts or natural features. Some national monuments have been redesignated as national historic sites or parks. National preserves are similar in size to national parks and feature geological attractions and flora. National preserves allow certain activities not permitted in national parks, often adjoin national parks, and are managed in partnership with state, local, or private entities. National reserves are similar to national preserves but are managed in partnership with other entities. National recreation areas, originally designated for water-based recreation, now include other outdoor areas. National recreation areas, national lakeshores, national seashores, national rivers, and wild and scenic rivers are designated for recreational activities like boating, fishing, and hunting. These areas focus on preserving natural landscapes and offer facilities for beach visitation. The National Park Service manages wild and scenic rivers, national trails, and national parkways for recreational activities and preservation of natural landscapes. The George Washington Memorial Parkway in Virginia is a heavily used commuter route that connects to 78 national historic sites and 1 international historic site significant to U.S. history. These sites include structures like homes of notable Americans, public buildings, and military action sites. National historic sites are smaller than national parks, while national historical parks are known for their connection to historical events or people. National battlefields, battlefield sites, parks, and military parks are locations of significant military actions, including landscapes and structures from the American Revolution and Civil War. National memorials, on the other hand, do not have to be at historically significant sites. The National Park Service administers various areas in Washington, DC, including 30 national memorials like the Washington Monument and Thomas Jefferson Memorial. These memorials are structures erected to commemorate people or events, and may not always be at historically significant sites. Additionally, there are 11 units with \"other designations\" that offer different types of resources and attractions, such as historic buildings, natural attractions, or recreational opportunities. The title of a park unit can provide information about its establishment, management, and permitted activities. Designations indicate the type of attraction in the unit, such as natural, historical, military, or recreational. However, these distinctions are not always absolute, as units may contain multiple types of attractions. For example, national parks can have historical and cultural artifacts in addition to natural features. National seashores and lakeshores designated for natural attractions may also offer recreational facilities. The National Park Service recognizes a mix of resources in park units, integrating natural, recreational, and historical attractions. Title distinctions may indicate differences in park unit size, with national historical parks generally larger than national historic sites. The National Park Service administers various park units, including national historic sites and national historical parks. Size distinctions exist among these units, with some national historical parks being smaller than national historic sites. The NPS manages 409 units in the National Park System and also oversees related areas outside the system. The National Park Service administers various park units, including national historic sites and national historical parks. NPS is less involved in funding and managing related areas outside the park system. Only national monuments can be established by entities other than Congress. The President has the authority to proclaim monuments under the Antiquities Act of 1906, which has sometimes been controversial due to restrictions on public land use. Congress has limited the President's authority in Wyoming and Alaska after past controversies. Bills have been introduced to further limit this authority in western states and amend the Antiquities Act to require congressional or state approval for monument proclamations. Despite some opposition, there is ongoing support for many presidentially proclaimed monuments for resource protection. In many cases, Congress has affirmed support for presidentially proclaimed monuments by re-establishing them as national parks or other units. The Secretary of the Interior had the authority to designate national historic sites in the 20th century, but this authority was limited in 1992. Some park units were transferred to the National Park Service from other agencies in the past. National Park System units are strictly protected federal lands, with activities like hunting, grazing, mining, and logging limited or prohibited to avoid resource damage. Congress can authorize specific activities in parks through enabling legislation. Activities that may damage or consume resources are more often permitted in certain types of National Park System units than in others. Congress has been hesitant to allow consumptive uses in national parks, such as sport hunting and off-road vehicle use. However, consumptive activities are more open in national preserves, with Florida's Big Cypress National Preserve being an early example created in 1974. Big Cypress National Preserve, established in 1974, adjoins Everglades National Park and allows hunting, trapping, and oil and gas exploration. Congress designated it as a national preserve to accommodate these activities, distinguishing it from more restrictive national parks. Similarly, national preserves in Alaska, established in 1980, border national parks and permit sport hunting. Other recreational uses are encouraged in various types of parks, with national recreation areas being especially oriented towards recreational use. National seashores, lakeshores, and national reserves are managed for recreational development, often allowing hunting and fishing. Partnership management arrangements are increasingly common in various types of units, with only two national reserves currently in existence. In national park units, partnership management is becoming more common. Idaho's City of Rocks National Reserve is mostly federally owned and managed by the Idaho Department of Parks and Recreation with oversight from the Park Service. Ebey's Landing National Historical Reserve is only 14% federally owned and is managed by a local trust board with assistance from the Park Service. National recreation areas and national seashores also involve partnerships with federal agencies for management. National recreation areas and national seashores, such as Lake Mead, Curecanti, Lake Meredith, Whiskeytown-Shasta-Trinity, Assateague Island, and Cape Hatteras, are managed in partnership with various federal agencies like the Bureau of Reclamation, Forest Service, and Fish and Wildlife Service. Some park units belong to other land management systems, like \"wild and scenic rivers\" established under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968. \"Scenic rivers\" are designated under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968 to preserve natural free-flowing rivers without dams or diversions. The classification of the river determines the level of development restrictions and water rights protection. Not all designated rivers are managed by the National Park Service, with only three being full park units. National scenic trails, established under the National Trails System Act of 1968, include scenic, historic, recreational, and connecting trails with specific activity restrictions. Certain activities may be prohibited or encouraged on trails based on their type. Trails designated under the National Trails System Act may not be managed by the National Park Service. NPS manages three national scenic trails as full park units and 16 other trails as \"related areas.\" Wilderness designation in some park units provides special protections to restrict development. Wilderness areas generally prohibit commercial activities, roads, motorized access, and structures. Congress can designate wilderness in any type of park unit or federal lands outside the park system. A high number of national parks contain wilderness areas, but not all do. Legislation is required to change the title of a park unit, such as redesignating a national monument as a national park. Several bills have been proposed in Congress to redesignate various park units, including Rock Creek Park, Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site, and Ocmulgee Mounds National Monument. In the past, Pinnacles National Monument was redesignated as Pinnacles National Park. The redesignation of Pinnacles National Monument in California as Pinnacles National Park, and similar title changes to other units, may be motivated by economic reasons. Members of Congress and stakeholders may seek to retitle a unit as a national park to attract more visitors and provide a financial boost to surrounding communities. For example, when the 112th Congress redesignated Pinnacles National Monument as a national park, supporters stated it would attract more visitors from around the world. The bill aims to redesignate Chiricahua National Monument in Arizona as a national park to boost tourism and economic benefits. Local groups believe the change will raise the profile of the region and attract more visitors. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton also supports redesignating Rock Creek Park as a national park to protect and revitalize the area. The effectiveness of this strategy in increasing tourism is uncertain. The bill aims to redesignate Chiricahua National Monument in Arizona as a national park to increase tourism and economic benefits. While national parks generally attract more visitors, redesignated units do not always see a significant increase in visitation. One study found that the name change led to an average of 13,000 additional visitors annually per site, but this did not always offset losses from other factors. Beyond economic reasons, changing park designations can also help clarify the type of attraction in the unit. Measures to redesignate park units, such as changing the title to \"national park,\" may face challenges. Supporters must prove the unit's attractions are exceptional to warrant the prestigious label. Concerns include whether the unit has all the resources typically found in national parks. Additionally, renaming units could lead to controversial proposed changes. Redesignation of park units, like changing the title to \"national park,\" may bring about challenges and controversial proposed changes. Concerns may arise regarding potential impacts on road access, air quality standards, and local residents' interests. Stakeholders may oppose such redesignations due to these concerns. Opposition to redesignating Mt. St. Helens National Volcanic Monument as a national park stems from concerns about transferring administrative responsibilities and potential impacts on air quality and hunting policies. The National Parks Second Century Commission recommends reducing the variety of park titles to avoid confusion for visitors. The National Parks Second Century Commission recommended reducing the number of park titles to enhance branding and recognition of the parks. NPS Director Jonathan Jarvis also supported a simplified naming system to make the public more aware of the national park system as a whole. Recommendations have been made to consolidate park titles and enhance branding of the National Park System. This could potentially increase park visitation and bring economic benefits to surrounding communities. However, a stricter naming system may limit Congress's flexibility to choose names that reflect a park's unique features. Some iconic park units may not fit into a prescribed designation, and efforts to change their names could be unpopular. The lack of specific guidelines for park designations in the National Park System gives Congress wide latitude in assigning titles to park units. However, changes in park titles could lead to opposition if they come with unwanted restrictions or altered management arrangements. The title of a park unit can provide important information about the unit and influence congressional decision making on activities allowed within the park. The title of a park unit can influence public perception and economic consequences, leading Congress to consider simplifying park nomenclature. A consolidated naming system could increase public interest in park units, but rigid naming conventions may limit Congress's flexibility in choosing appropriate names."
