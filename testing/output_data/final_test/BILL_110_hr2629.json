    "content": "The \"Agricultural Border Safeguard Protection Act\" restores import and entry agricultural inspection functions to the Department of Agriculture. The \"Agricultural Border Safeguard Protection Act\" repeals the transfer of functions from the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and amends the function of the Secretary of Homeland Security. It requires the Secretaries of Agriculture and Homeland Security to enter into an agreement to return functions and may allow the use of Homeland Security employees by the Department of Agriculture. The Department of Homeland Security delegates authorities to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service for protecting domestic livestock and plants. Full-time positions transferred to DHS from the Department of Agriculture must be restored. The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has the authority to collect agricultural quarantine inspection user fees and manage reserve accounts. The Secretary of Agriculture is responsible for developing procedures for agricultural inspections and ensuring a national electronic tracking system for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The Secretary will establish a real-time communication system for import agricultural inspections and create an advisory committee to advise on inspection policies. The Secretary will establish an advisory committee for import agricultural inspections, modeled after the Agricultural Trade Advisory Committee. The committee will include members from State departments of agriculture, ports and airports, the transportation industry, the public, and other entities as determined by the Secretary. A report will be submitted at least once a year. The Secretary will submit an annual report to Congress assessing resource needs, inspection procedures, and technologies for import agricultural inspection. The costs of inspectors will be covered by the Department. The amendments made by this section allow funds to be sourced from the Department of Agriculture or the Commodity Credit Cooperation. The effective date is 180 days after the enactment of this Act."
