    "content": "The Act titled \"Commercial Spectrum Enhancement Act\" allows for the relocation of eligible federal entities to reallocate spectrum for commercial purposes. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act is amended to allow eligible federal entities operating government stations to receive payment for relocation costs incurred due to frequency reallocation. The eligible frequencies for relocation costs include specific bands like 216-220 MHz, 1432-1435 MHz, 1710-1755 MHz, and 2385-2390 MHz, as well as any other bands reallocated from Federal to non-Federal use after January 1, 2003. The term 'relocation costs' refers to expenses incurred by a Federal entity to achieve comparable system capability, whether through frequency relocation or alternative technology. These costs include equipment modifications, training, engineering, site acquisition, and other related expenses. The Federal entity incurs additional costs related to relocation, including recurring costs for replacement facilities, expenses for engineering studies and economic analyses, and one-time costs for equipment modifications necessary for commercial use of frequencies before termination of primary allocation. The Federal entity incurs additional costs for relocation, including expenses for engineering studies and equipment modifications for commercial use of frequencies. The Commission must notify the NTIA 18 months before any auction of eligible frequencies. The NTIA notifies the Commission of estimated relocation costs and timelines for auctioning eligible frequencies. Federal entities can request information on alternative frequency assignments for calculating relocation costs. The NTIA provides information on federal entities' facilities and frequency bands for relocation. It also notifies congressional committees and the GAO of initial relocation cost estimates and timelines. The NTIA ensures timely relocation of Federal entities' spectrum-related operations to frequencies or facilities of comparable capability. If a Federal entity achieves comparable capability by relocating or using alternative technology, NTIA terminates authorization and notifies the Commission. NTIA also terminates authorization if an entity unreasonably fails to comply with relocation timelines submitted by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. SEC. 3. MINIMUM AUCTION RECEIPTS AND DISPOSITION OF PROCEEDS. (a) Auction Design.--Section 309(j)(3) of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to include provisions for auctioning eligible frequencies described in the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act. This includes the recovery of 110 percent of estimated relocation costs.\n(b) Special Auction Provisions for Eligible Frequencies.--Section 309(j) of the Act is further amended to include special provisions for eligible frequencies. The Commission will revise regulations to ensure that auction proceeds for eligible frequencies meet relocation cost requirements. Auction conclusion is contingent on meeting minimum proceeds. The Commission will not conclude an auction if the cash proceeds from eligible frequencies are less than 110% of the estimated relocation costs. In such cases, the auction will be canceled, deposits returned to bidders, and bidders released from any further obligations to bid in a reauction. The Commission may issue a license for eligible frequencies before a Federal entity's authorization ends, with the condition that the licensee cannot interfere with the entity. Proceeds from auctions must meet certain criteria to avoid cancellation. Cash proceeds from the auction of eligible frequencies must be deposited in the Spectrum Relocation Fund as per the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act. SEC. 118. SPECTRUM RELOCATION FUND is established under the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act. The Spectrum Relocation Fund is established by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act. It is a separate fund administered by the Office of Management and Budget in consultation with the NTIA. The Fund is credited with specified amounts from the Communications Act of 1934 and can be used to pay relocation costs for eligible Federal entities moving from certain frequencies. The Spectrum Relocation Fund appropriates sums for relocation costs specified in subsection (c). Funds cannot be transferred to eligible Federal entities without OMB approval and a detailed plan submitted to relevant committees. The Spectrum Relocation Fund requires a detailed plan for fund usage and timeline for relocation costs. Any unused funds revert to the Treasury after 8 years. Funds are transferred to eligible Federal entities defined in the Act. An eligible Federal entity may receive multiple transfers from the Spectrum Relocation Fund, but subsequent transfers exceeding 10 percent of the original transfer require prior approval from the Director of OMB. Notice to committees must be given at least 45 days in advance, including a plan and explanation for the excess transfer. The Comptroller General must review and assess any plan for subsequent transfers from the Spectrum Relocation Fund within 30 days. Transferred amounts are credited to the eligible Federal entity's appropriations account and remain available until expended. Any excess amounts must be reported to OMB and may be retransferred to the fund. The Spectrum Relocation Fund will transfer excess amounts back after relocation completion or if the entity fails to relocate within the required timeline. SEC. 5. TELECOMMUNICATIONS DEVELOPMENT FUND amends lending and credit operations for small businesses. SEC. 6 states no modification to a specific Act. SEC. 7 exempts from sequestration. The Spectrum Relocation Fund is exempt from budget reductions under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. A report is required. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration must submit an annual report to specified committees on the progress of relocating communication systems from eligible frequencies, including estimated and actual relocation costs incurred. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration must report annually on the progress of relocating communication systems from eligible frequencies, including estimated and actual relocation costs paid from the Spectrum Relocation Fund."
