    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2016\" and focuses on the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. Section 118(c)(7) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to prioritize programs and projects addressing toxic substances, invasive species, and nearshore health in coordination with non-Federal partners. The Administrator shall collaborate with Federal partners to select projects for the Initiative focusing on nearshore health, nonpoint source pollution mitigation, habitat and wildlife protection, wetlands restoration, and accountability activities. The Administrator collaborates with Federal partners to select programs and projects for Great Lakes protection and restoration based on strategic and measurable environmental outcomes, prompt implementation, and timely achievement of results. The Administrator collaborates with Federal partners to select programs and projects for Great Lakes protection and restoration, focusing on strategic outcomes, prompt implementation, and interagency coordination and collaboration. Consultation with Great Lakes States, Indian tribes, and non-Federal stakeholders is also prioritized. The Administrator designates a coordinator to oversee projects involving harmful algal blooms in the Great Lakes, collaborating with Federal partners, Great Lakes States, Indian tribes, and non-Federal stakeholders. Funds for the Initiative are to be strategically used for its implementation. The Initiative will strategically implement Federal projects, projects with various partners, and Program Office activities including sediment contamination remediation. Agreements with non-federal entities will also be established. The Administrator or head of a Federal department may make grants or agreements with qualified non-Federal entities for project planning, research, monitoring, outreach, or implementation. The Administrator or head of a Federal department may make grants or agreements with qualified non-Federal entities for project planning, research, monitoring, outreach, or implementation to support the Initiative Action Plan or the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. Projects under the Initiative can be carried out on multiple levels by qualified non-Federal entities. The Great Lakes Initiative prohibits the use of funds for water infrastructure activities unless it is a green infrastructure project improving habitat and ecosystem functions in the Great Lakes. Financial assistance from State water pollution control revolving funds or State drinking water funds cannot be used for such activities. The Great Lakes Initiative restricts funding for water infrastructure projects to green infrastructure projects that enhance habitat and ecosystem functions in the Great Lakes. Federal agencies must maintain funding levels for Great Lakes activities and identify new projects. Funding can come from State water pollution control revolving funds or State drinking water funds, or through the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 2014. The Administrator, along with the Great Lakes Interagency Task Force, reviews and revises the Initiative Action Plan every 5 years to guide activities for restoring and protecting the Great Lakes system. The Administrator consults with Great Lakes States, tribes, and stakeholders for input on the Initiative Action Plan. They establish a monitoring process, make project information public, and report progress to relevant committees. The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works receives yearly progress reports on the Great Lakes restoration Initiative Action Plan and funding allocations to federal departments and agencies. The Appropriations Act, 2010 authorizes $300,000,000 annually for fiscal years 2017 through 2021 for specific programs under the Administrator's authority. This funding does not expand the Administrator's authority to implement programs outlined in the Initiative Action Plan or the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. The House of Representatives passed the bill on April 26, 2016. Attest: KAREN L. HAAS, Clerk."
