    "title": "SB 1076",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1253.7 of the Health and Safety Code defines \"observation services\" as outpatient services provided by a general acute care hospital for patients with unstable or uncertain conditions that require close monitoring but not inpatient admission. This includes the use of a bed, nursing care, and other necessary services to evaluate a patient's condition. When a patient in a hospital's inpatient or observation unit is receiving observation services, they must be informed in writing that they are on observation status. This means their care is outpatient, which could impact their health care coverage reimbursement. An observation unit in a hospital is an outpatient area outside of the emergency department or inpatient unit. The unit must be clearly marked with signage using the term \"outpatient\" to distinguish it from inpatient services. Naming the unit differently does not exempt the hospital from compliance with regulations. An observation unit in a hospital must adhere to the same nurse-to-patient ratios as supplemental emergency services. Reports filed under the Health and Safety Code must be maintained by the office and made available for inspection upon request, with certain exceptions for patient confidentiality. The reports required by Section 128745 must include an executive summary in plain English, discussing findings, conclusions, and trends in medical outcomes. They will be widely disseminated to hospitals, providers, the media, and consumers via the office's website. Copies certified by the office of reports filed under this chapter shall be used as evidence in hearings by governmental agencies purchasing health services. These reports influence policy decisions on reimbursement methods for publicly financed healthcare programs. The office compiles and publishes summaries of facility and aggregate data for public disclosure, excluding patient-specific information. Summaries, including observation services data, are posted on the office's website. The office conducts studies to advance its purposes. A public liaison function is established to provide technical assistance on health facility data usage and to report changes for improving public data access. No reimbursement is required by this act as it creates new crimes or infractions, eliminates existing ones, or changes penalties, as defined by the Government Code and California Constitution."
