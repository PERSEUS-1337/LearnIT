    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Union Member Protection Act\". Congress finds that labor unions make significant political contributions and expenditures that influence elections and support political causes. Union leadership and management, rather than union membership, typically make decisions on using union dues for political purposes. Unions should conduct business in the best interests of their members. Historically, union members have lacked transparency and influence over unions' political activities, and both members and the public have a right to know how union dues are spent on political contributions and expenditures. Unions should be accountable to their membership for political contributions and expenditures, ensuring necessary transparency and approval. SEC. 201A. DISCLOSURE AND APPROVAL OF CERTAIN POLITICAL EXPENDITURES BY LABOR ORGANIZATIONS. The report required under section 201 shall include a description of proposed political expenditures for the upcoming fiscal year and a disclosure of how each officer voted on past political expenditures. Labor organizations are restricted from making political expenditures unless they align with those proposed. Labor organizations must obtain written authorization from a majority of members for expenditures. A mechanism for obtaining authorization by secret ballot must be adopted within a year. Officers who authorize expenditures without member approval are liable for dues paid during the 1-year period. Labor organizations must obtain written authorization from a majority of members for expenditures, including independent expenditures, contributions to political parties, committees, or electioneering communications, and dues to trade associations or tax-exempt organizations. Officers who authorize expenditures without member approval are liable for dues paid during the 1-year period prior to the expenditure. Labor organizations must obtain written authorization from a majority of members for expenditures, including independent expenditures, contributions to political parties, committees, or electioneering communications, and dues to trade associations or tax-exempt organizations. The term \"expenditure\" does not include direct lobbying efforts through registered lobbyists, communications to members and personnel, or the establishment of a separate fund for political purposes. Amendments are made to Section 201(c) of the Act regarding information availability. Amendments are made to the Act by changing the wording in Section 209(a) and removing certain information requirements. Amendments to the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act require a vote by principal officers on political expenditure exceeding $50,000, with public disclosure of individual votes within 48 hours. The Comptroller General of the United States will annually study labor organizations' compliance with the Act and submit a report to Congress by April 1 each year. The amendments in this Act will be effective upon the enactment of the Shareholder Protection Act of 2010."
