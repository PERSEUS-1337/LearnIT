    "content": "The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is administered by the Farm Service Agency (FSA) at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) with technical support from the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Enrollment is limited to 27.5 million acres in FY2014 through general sign-up and continuous sign-up. Offers are ranked based on an Environmental Benefits Index (EBI) to determine environmental benefits. The USDA determines an EBI threshold to accept offers for enrollment into the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). Producers aim to maximize EBI points to increase acceptance chances. As of July 2014, 19.7 million acres were enrolled in CRP under general sign-up contracts. The most recent general sign-up (#45) accepted 1.68 million acres for enrollment starting October 1, 2013. Contract holders of eligible FY2014 expiring contracts qualify for a one-year extension. Continuous sign-up for the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) allows for the enrollment of environmentally desirable land at any time without competitive bidding. Offers meeting eligibility requirements are automatically accepted, with contracts effective the month following approval and including financial incentives. This initiative targets specific resource concerns and conservation practices, with 5.75 million acres enrolled as of July 2014, accounting for 23% of total CRP acres. Sub-programs like the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) and Farmable Wetland Program (FWP) contribute to this enrollment. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) allows for continuous sign-up of environmentally desirable land without competitive bidding. Specific sub-programs like the Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) and Farmable Wetland Program (FWP) contribute to the enrollment of 5.75 million acres as of July 2014. To be eligible for CRP enrollment, a producer must show control of the land for the duration of the contract, with certain exceptions for ownership changes. USDA may consider highly erodible cropland for enrollment in CRP. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) allows for continuous sign-up of environmentally desirable land without competitive bidding. Specific sub-programs like the Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) and Farmable Wetland Program (FWP) contribute to the enrollment of 5.75 million acres as of July 2014. To be eligible for CRP enrollment, a producer must show control of the land for the duration of the contract, with certain exceptions for ownership changes. USDA may consider highly erodible cropland for enrollment in CRP, including erodible cropland that could reduce future agricultural production capability, marginal pasture land, and grasslands with ecologically significant populations. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) allows for continuous sign-up of environmentally desirable land without competitive bidding. Eligible land includes newly created grass sod waterways, wildlife habitats, windbreaks, and riparian buffers. Participants receive payments from USDA to offset costs of retiring land from production and implementing conservation practices. The program has a maximum acreage limit and is authorized to spend necessary funds. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) allows for continuous sign-up of environmentally desirable land without competitive bidding. Participants receive payments from USDA to offset costs of retiring land from production and implementing conservation practices. The program is authorized to spend necessary funds to enroll up to the maximum level of allowable acres. The average annual federal cost for CRP is close to $2 billion, with the majority being annual rental payments. Producers have a choice of conservation practices to consider for installation on their land when enrolling in CRP, with assistance from USDA. Once an offer is accepted for enrollment, the participant must develop a conservation plan of operation. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) allows for continuous sign-up of environmentally desirable land without competitive bidding. Participants receive payments from USDA to offset costs of retiring land from production and implementing conservation practices. The program is authorized to spend necessary funds to enroll up to the maximum level of allowable acres. The most widely applied conservation practices are described in Table 2. The 2014 farm bill reauthorized CRP and reduced the enrollment cap from 32 million acres to 24 million acres by FY2018. Recent enrollment has declined from its peak in FY2007 of 36.8 million acres to 25.6 million acres in FY2013 due to high commodity prices, low rental rates, and declining interest in retiring land from production. Conservation and wildlife groups are concerned about the impact of reduced enrollment. The 2014 farm bill reduced Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) enrollment, saving $3.3 billion over 10 years. Programmatic changes allow for emergency harvesting and grazing without rental rate reduction. The Grassland Reserve Program (GRP) was repealed, with grassland contracts now eligible under CRP. Participants can terminate contracts early after five years of enrollment. The 2014 farm bill allowed for emergency harvesting and grazing on CRP land without rental rate reduction. Livestock owners requested access due to a prolonged drought and flooding. Annual rental rates were reduced by 10-25% following amendments in the bill. Following amendments in the 2014 farm bill, harvesting and grazing are permitted on CRP land under certain conditions, with reduced or eliminated payment penalties. Rate reductions for permitted activities include no reduction for emergency forage response and a 25% reduction for activities consistent with soil conservation, water quality, and wildlife habitat. Harvesting and grazing on environmentally sensitive land may have restrictions during nesting season. Annual prescribed grazing for invasive species control on CRP land requires a 25% reduction in rental rate, occurring every 5 years. Routine grazing also requires a 25% reduction, limited to once every 2 years. Wind turbine installation mandates a 25% reduction, with restrictions on number and location. Seasonal use of vegetative buffer practices does not affect rental rates if vegetation is not damaged. Livestock grazing by beginning farmers or ranchers must align with conservation practices, with no reduction in rental rates. The 2014 farm bill repealed GRP and incorporated elements into CRP, allowing for common grazing practices, haying, mowing, fire presuppression, and fencing. Grassland enrollment is limited to 2 million acres between FY2014 and FY2018. Recent droughts have raised concerns about reducing CRP acres. Recent droughts have raised questions about the impact of reducing CRP acres on livestock relief and wildlife habitat. Changes in CRP enrollment since 1985 have led to shifts in program priorities and fluctuating total acres enrolled. The role of CRP in providing drought relief and the effects of harvesting and grazing on wildlife, plant quality, and erosion control are also being questioned. Program priorities have shifted, total acres enrolled have fluctuated, farming technologies have advanced, and producer preferences have changed. CRP contracts are typically 10 years long, with options for reenrollment or letting the contract expire. In 2006, USDA offered two- to five-year reenrollment and extension contracts to stagger the expiration of 27 million acres. Approximately 83% accepted these extensions, while over 8.5 million acres expired from the program during that time. Between FY2007 and FY2014, over 17.1 million CRP acres under contract have expired and were not reenrolled in the program. The majority of these acres in FY2013 are located in the central part of the United States. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) has seen a reduction in enrolled acres over the years, with the enrollment cap decreasing from 45 million acres in 1985 to 24 million acres by FY2018. This reduction limits the opportunity for reenrollment of expiring acres and new sign-ups. Early termination of a CRP contract incurs a penalty of full repayment with interest. Program advocates are concerned about the potential loss of environmental benefits, such as migratory and grassland bird habitat. The CRP contract early termination incurs a penalty of full repayment with interest, plus a 25% fee on rental payments received. The Secretary of Agriculture can release land from CRP without penalty, but this option is rarely used. An early-out provision has been in place since the 1996 farm bill, allowing for a one-time early release. The 2014 farm bill amended the CRP contract early termination provision to allow for a one-time early release in FY2015. Requirements include restrictions on land use and eligibility criteria. Additionally, Section 2006 of the bill expands the provision to allow termination before contract expiration under certain conditions. The CRP contract early termination provision was amended in the 2014 farm bill to allow for a penalty-free early release in FY2015. This option includes restrictions on land use and eligibility criteria. Conservation and wildlife organizations generally oppose this early-out option but believe that additional restrictions on ineligible land could help minimize the overall impact. CRP rental payments are determined by county and other factors. CRP rental payments are based on county average rental rates and soil productivity. The average rates are $51.09 per acre for general sign-up, $97.25 per acre for non-CREP continuous sign-up, $136.70 per acre for CREP continuous sign-up, and $111.70 per acre for farmable wetlands. Producers raised concerns about CRP rental rates being lower than commodity prices since 2008. Producers claim CRP rental rates are lower than what they could get for production land. Contracts are long-term investments, but low rates may deter enrollment or renewal. A 2011 study by USDA's ERS suggested that increasing rental rates could meet enrollment goals, but at the cost of a lower EBI. The USDA Office of Inspector General (OIG) issued a report in July 2012 on the use of CRP rental rates for the 39th general sign-up in 2010. The report found that FSA did not use the most recent NRCS soil productivity factors and allowed states and counties to propose alternate rates that did not adhere to its own policies. OIG accepted two of the four agency responses to its recommendations. The USDA OIG report in July 2012 found FSA's use of CRP rental rates for the 39th general sign-up in 2010 unacceptable. Two responses were not adhered to, regarding NRCS productivity data and approving alternate rental rates. Despite potential limiting factors, CRP enrollment has increased, with almost 5.8 million acres enrolled through continuous sign-ups by July 2014, offering additional financial incentives for environmentally sensitive acres. CRP rental payments and local rental rates are used to enroll more environmentally sensitive acres. More contracts and farms are enrolled under continuous sign-ups than for general sign-ups. The IRS has issued rulings on whether CRP rental payments are subject to self-employment taxes. The IRS changed its position on CRP payments, now subjecting them to self-employment tax. The 2013 U.S. Tax Court ruling of Morehouse v. Commissioner upheld this decision, stating that CRP participants are in the business of farming. This has raised concerns among producers and conservation advocates, fearing it may discourage CRP participation and lower the value of CRP. Some argue that the 15.3% tax on CRP payments could impact investor income. Concerns also arise about the potential decrease in CRP acres leading to reduced environmental benefits like soil erosion control and wildlife habitat development. The expiration of conservation practices on CRP land between FY2015 and FY2017 adds uncertainty to the situation. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) has significantly reduced soil erosion and provided environmental benefits since its inception in 1986. The potential expiration of CRP contracts could lead to the loss of grasslands and other conservation practices, impacting soil erosion control and wildlife habitat development. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) has achieved significant environmental gains, including reducing nitrogen and phosphorus levels, establishing wildlife habitats, and producing millions of pheasants and ducks annually. Despite challenges such as reduced acreage caps and high crop prices, supporters advocate for maintaining CRP enrollment to preserve water quality, soil health, and wildlife species habitat. Continuous sign-up initiatives under the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) aim to enroll environmentally sensitive land through specific conservation practices. The Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) is a joint federal-state program targeting regions with agricultural-related environmental concerns. Projects address specific environmental objectives through targeted CRP enrollments in areas like Maryland's Chesapeake Bay and Florida's Everglades. The Farmable Wetland Program (FWP) enrolls farmable or prior converted wetlands into CRP for additional financial incentives. Landowners agree to restore wetland hydrology, establish vegetative cover, and prohibit development. Eligible land must meet specific criteria. The Farmable Wetland Program (FWP) enrolls farmable or prior converted wetlands into CRP for financial incentives. Landowners agree to restore wetland hydrology, establish vegetative cover, and prohibit development. Enrollment is limited to 100,000 acres per state and 750,000 acres nationally. Wetland enrollment is limited to 40 contiguous acres, while flooded farmland is limited to 20 contiguous acres under the program. The Transition Incentive Program (TIP) allows for transitioning expiring CRP contracts back into sustainable grazing or crop production. The Transition Incentive Program (TIP) allows for transitioning expiring CRP contracts back into sustainable grazing or crop production by a beginning, veteran, or socially disadvantaged farmer or rancher. The land must be from a retired or retiring owner or operator (not a family member) in exchange for up to two additional years of annual CRP rental payments following the expiration of the CRP contract. The program was authorized to spend up to $33 million between FY2014 and FY2018.
