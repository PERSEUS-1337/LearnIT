    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Jamestown 400th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act of 2004\". The Congress finds that the founding of Jamestown in 1607 was significant in US history, bringing together people from different cultures. The institutions developed in Jamestown continue to impact the US, particularly in law, language, cross-cultural relationships, manufacturing, and economy. The National Park Service, the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities, and the Jamestown-Yorktown Foundation collectively own and operate resources related to Jamestown's early history. In 2000, Congress established the Jamestown 400th Commemoration Commission to ensure a national observance of the Jamestown 2007 anniversary and support marketing efforts for a commemorative coin and stamp. The commemorative coin will bring attention to Jamestown's legacy, with proceeds assisting in financing the 400th-anniversary observance in 2007. The Secretary of the Treasury will mint $5 gold coins and $1 silver coins with specific weights, diameters, and compositions. These coins will be legal tender and considered numismatic items under the Act. The Secretary will obtain gold and silver for minting coins as authorized by law. The design of the coins will be determined under this Act. The design of the coins minted under this Act shall symbolize the settlement of Jamestown, Virginia. Each coin will feature the coin's value, the year \"2007\", and inscriptions of \"Liberty\", \"In God We Trust\", \"United States of America\", and \"E Pluribus Unum\". The design will be chosen by the Secretary in consultation with various committees and organizations. The design of the coins minted under this Act shall symbolize the settlement of Jamestown, Virginia and will be reviewed by the National Park Service, the Commission of Fine Arts, and the citizens advisory committee established under section 5135 of title 31, United States Code. SEC. 5. ISSUANCE OF COINS. Coins minted under this Act shall be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities.

The sale of coins under this Act includes a surcharge of $35 per coin for $5 coins and $10 per coin for $1 coins.
