    "content": "The \"America's Partnership for Nursing Education Act of 2007\" aims to address the nursing shortage by supporting state and private efforts to increase capacity in nursing programs at colleges and universities. This is crucial in states with rapidly growing populations to improve patient care quality and reduce healthcare costs. SEC. 832 of the Public Health Service Act introduces grants to increase the number of qualified nursing faculty. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will provide grants to qualified States to increase the number of nursing faculty in college and university programs. States receiving grants must implement a program to support nursing faculty, including salaries, benefits, training, and operational costs. The grant under this section is for qualifying States to increase nursing faculty in college and university programs. States must use the grant for costs related to additional nursing faculty beyond 2006-2007 levels and cannot use funds for capital expenses. The minimum grant amount is $2,000,000 per fiscal year. As a condition for receiving a grant under this section, a qualifying State must use the funds to supplement, not replace, existing state funds for nursing faculty. Additionally, the State must allocate at least $2,000,000 annually from 2008 to 2012 to increase the number of qualified nursing faculty in college and university programs. The Secretary must submit reports to Congress on grants awarded under this section, including the number of grants, recipient States, new nursing faculty added, and projected new nurses graduating. The text chunk discusses the projected increase in population by over 50% between 1990 and 2025, a shortage of nurses expected in 2020, and the implementation of programs to increase qualified nursing faculty in college and university programs. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is responsible for carrying out this section. Authorization of Appropriations: $20,000,000 authorized for each fiscal year from 2008 to 2012 to carry out the section under the Secretary of Health and Human Services."
