    "content": "The Act titled \"Federal Building Renewal and Energy Savings Act of 2007\" mandates the use of energy and water efficiency measures in federal buildings. Section 543 of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act is amended to require Federal agencies to conduct energy and water evaluations for their buildings and facilities, and implement efficiency measures identified in the evaluations. Federal agencies must implement energy and water-saving measures identified in evaluations every 3 years, with a focus on measures with a 15-year payback period. Federal agencies must implement energy and water-saving measures every 3 years, focusing on measures with a 15-year simple payback period. This period is determined by dividing the estimated initial implementation cost of a measure by the annual cost savings, with a quotient less than or equal to 15 indicating a 15-year payback. The Secretary may modify or make exceptions to the calculation of a 15-year simple payback for cost savings in energy, water, operations, maintenance, and other costs based on guidelines issued. Federal agencies must follow up on implemented measures by carrying out commissioning, operations, maintenance, repair, and measurement and verification of energy and water savings. The Secretary will issue guidelines for implementation within specific timeframes after the enactment of this subsection. The Secretary will issue guidelines for web-based certification of compliance with energy and water requirements for buildings and facilities funded by different sources. The Secretary will deploy a web-based tracking system to monitor covered buildings and facilities, evaluations, identified measures with costs and savings, implementation status, measured savings, and persistence of savings within 1 year of enactment. The Secretary will make a web-based tracking system available to Congress, Federal agencies, and the public for monitoring energy use data of federal facilities. Exemptions may be granted for national security reasons. The Secretary will establish a building energy use benchmarking system for Federal agencies, including quarterly scorecards for energy management activities. The Director will provide scorecards for energy management activities of Federal agencies, summarizing the status of energy and water evaluations, implementation of measures, follow-up on implemented measures, and other performance metrics deemed appropriate. The scorecards will be made available to stakeholders. The Director will provide scorecards for energy management activities of Federal agencies, summarizing the status of energy and water evaluations, implementation of measures, follow-up on implemented measures, and other performance metrics. Scorecards required under this paragraph will be available to Congress, Federal agencies, and the public through the Internet. Funding options include appropriated funds and private financing. Federal agencies can utilize a combination of appropriated funds and private financing for energy and water savings measures. Lack of appropriated funds is not a valid reason for non-compliance. Federal agencies must comply with paragraphs (1) through (3) regardless of funding sources. SEC. 3. ENERGY SAVINGS PERFORMANCE CONTRACTS. Section 801 of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act is amended to promote longer contract terms and remove limitations on obligations under energy savings performance contracts. The National Energy Conservation Policy Act is amended to include measurement and verification requirements for private financing related to energy savings performance contracts. The National Energy Conservation Policy Act is amended to include requirements for Federal agencies to modify existing energy savings performance contracts within 180 days of enactment. The National Energy Conservation Policy Act is amended to require Federal agencies to modify existing energy savings performance contracts within 180 days of enactment, including conforming to amendments made by the Federal Building Renewal and Energy Savings Act of 2007."
