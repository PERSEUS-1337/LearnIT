    "content": "The \"Federal Emergency Procurement Flexibility Act of 2002\" allows for emergency procurements for defense against terrorism or attacks involving nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological threats in fiscal years 2002 and 2003. The authorities in this title apply to fiscal year 2002 or 2003 procurement for defense against terrorism or attacks involving nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological threats. Advance approval is required for exercising these authorities, except in cases of urgent need. For fiscal year 2002 and 2003 procurement in support of humanitarian or peacekeeping operations, the simplified acquisition threshold amounts are $250,000 for contracts inside the US and $500,000 for contracts outside the US. The definitions for simplified acquisition threshold are specified in the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act and the Federal Property Act. The simplified acquisition threshold amounts for fiscal year 2002 and 2003 procurement in support of humanitarian or peacekeeping operations are $250,000 for contracts inside the US and $500,000 for contracts outside the US. The definitions for the threshold are specified in various sections of different Acts. SEC. 103. INCREASED MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD FOR CERTAIN PROCUREMENTS. The head of each agency may designate employees to make procurements under section 101 with a threshold of $15,000. The number of designated employees should be fewer than those authorized to make purchases without competitive quotations, ensuring geographic dispersal of procurement authority. The procurement authority can be used at potential terrorist targets, with limited monitoring of designated employees. Section 836 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 is repealed. SEC. 104. APPLICATION OF CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS AUTHORITIES TO CERTAIN PROCUREMENTS. The head of an executive agency may apply certain commercial item laws to a procurement without regard to whether the property or services are commercial items. These laws include sections 31 and 34 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act. The Administrative Services Act of 1949 and other related sections set limitations on the use of simplified acquisition procedures, increasing the threshold from $5,000,000 to $10,000,000 for certain property or services. Authority for simplified purchase procedures under certain provisions of law will continue to apply for fiscal year 2002 or 2003 procurements, despite expiration under the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996. SEC. 105. USE OF STREAMLINED PROCEDURES. The head of an executive agency must use streamlined acquisition authorities and procedures for procurements under section 101, including those authorized by the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 and Title 10 of the United States Code. Title 10, United States Code, chapter 137 includes provisions related to competitive procedures and orders under task and delivery order contracts. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, section 18(c), addresses the inapplicability of a requirement for procurement notice. Non-discrimination against small-business concerns is emphasized in the application of these provisions. The provisions in Title 10, United States Code, chapter 137 related to competitive procedures and orders under task and delivery order contracts emphasize non-discrimination against small-business concerns as per the Small Business Act. SEC. 106. OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET GUIDANCE. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will issue guidance on procurements for defense against terrorism or attacks, employee designations under section 103, and use of simplified acquisition procedures. The guidance will also require monthly reviews of procurements made under section 103. The supervisor overseeing procurements under section 103 should review no more than 7 employees on a monthly basis. SEC. 107. REVIEW AND REPORT BY COMPTROLLER GENERAL. The Comptroller General must submit a report to the Senate and House committees within 180 days after fiscal year 2003. The report will assess the impact of property and services acquired under this title on enhancing the Federal workforce's ability to defend against terrorism or attacks, evaluate the pricing of acquired items, and provide the number of employees designated by each executive agency. The Comptroller General's report will assess the number of employees designated by each executive agency under section 103 and their necessity for defense against terrorism or attacks. It will also evaluate the monitoring of procurement authority to prevent fraud and abuse, and include recommendations for improving the effectiveness of the Act. Title II of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 is amended to include a new section granting authority for certain transactions related to defense against terrorism or attacks. The head of an executive agency can conduct research and development projects related to defense against terrorism or attacks, with authority similar to the Secretary of Defense, as per a new section in the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949.
