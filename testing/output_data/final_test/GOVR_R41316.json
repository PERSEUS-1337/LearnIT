    "content": "The Senate and House Armed Services Committees report their versions of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) annually, containing provisions affecting military personnel, retirees, and their families. Differences between the House and Senate versions are resolved by a Conference Committee. Congressional staff receive many requests for information on NDAA provisions. This report focuses on personnel-related issues in the FY2011 House and Senate versions of the NDAA. The House and Senate versions of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2011 were introduced and passed by their respective chambers. The Senate version, S. 3454, was not passed, leading to the introduction of a new bill, H.R. 6523, which was eventually signed into law as the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011, signed into law on January 7, 2010 as P.L. 111-383, authorized the growth of the Army by 65,000 and the Marine Corps by 27,000. The bill addresses various issues, some of which were previously considered in the FY2010 National Defense Authorization Act. Contact information for CRS analysts is provided for more detailed background information. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 authorized the Army to grow by 65,000 and the Marine Corps by 27,000. The Army was also authorized additional increases in FY2009 and FY2010, with high deployment rates and dwell time concerns. Observers recommend further increases in end strength, while others advocate reducing it due to the potential Army drawdown in 2012 and high personnel costs. Deployment rates impact dwell time, readiness, and unit manning concerns. The House-passed version of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 authorizes increases in end-strength for the Army and Air Force, a decrease for the Navy, and no change for the Marine Corps. The overall authorized end-strength of the Selected Reserves has declined over the past nine years, despite extensive use in operations since September 11, 2001. The authorized end-strength of the Selected Reserves has declined over the past nine years, with notable shifts in strength for various components. The Army National Guard, Coast Guard Reserve, Air Force Reserve, and Navy Reserve experienced the largest changes in end-strength between FY2001 and FY2010. The authorized end-strength of the Army Reserve and Marine Corps Reserve has remained stable. The Air Force Reserve saw an increase in authorized end-strength from 69,500 to 71,200 in FY2011. Ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan continue to drive interest in military pay raises. The military pay raise is determined by a formula linked to the Employment Cost Index. Congress has approved pay raises above the formula in recent years. Different types of pay raises, including across-the-board and targeted raises, have been authorized. The House recommended a 1.9% pay raise, but the Senate and H.R. 6523 did not address the issue. The Title 37 provision resulted in an automatic 1.4% pay raise effective January 1, 2011. Hostile Fire or Imminent Danger Pay (HP/IDP) is a special pay for servicemembers exposed to hostile fire or explosive devices. For more information, refer to CRS reports RL34590, R40711, and RL33446. Contact Charles Henning at x[phone number scrubbed] for further details. The Hostile Fire or Imminent Danger Pay (HP/IDP) is a special pay for servicemembers exposed to hostile fire or explosive devices. It was temporarily increased from $100 to $225/month by the FY2004 NDAA and then made permanent by the FY2005 NDAA. The Family Separation Allowance (FSA) is paid to servicemembers with dependents when deployed to a dependent-restricted area, on board ship for more than 30 days, or on temporary duty (TDY) for more than 30 days. It was temporarily increased from $100 to $250/month by the FY2004 NDAA and then made permanent by the FY2005 NDAA to compensate for inflation. The House-approved increase to the Family Separation Allowance would cost $288 million over the 2011-2015 period, and the increase to the Hostile Fire Pay would cost $188 million over the same period. The 109th Congress enacted a provision providing a special payment of up to $3,000 to reservists experiencing income loss due to frequent or extended involuntary mobilizations. The 111th Congress enacted a provision to minimize income loss for federal civilian employees involuntarily ordered to active duty by providing \"differential pay.\" This payment equals the difference between a reservist's military pay and allowances and their civilian basic pay. This provision applies to all federal government employees, not just in cases of extended or frequent activations. Section 601 would prevent these employees from claiming benefits under 37 U.S.C. \u00a7910 if they are eligible for \"pay differential\" benefits under 5 U.S.C. 5538 or a similar program. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 established the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program for National Guard and Reserve members and their families, providing information, services, and outreach throughout the deployment cycle. The Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program offers outreach on various topics such as marriage counseling, mental health awareness, veterans' benefits, and employment workshops. Changes have been made to enhance the program's effectiveness and scope. The TRICARE program requires beneficiaries to share in healthcare costs. Legislative measures have been enacted to prevent increases in cost-share provisions for healthcare. DOD can increase cost shares for retirees and beneficiaries in TRICARE Prime if there is no legislation prohibiting it. For example, inpatient copayments under TRICARE Standard increased when the previous prohibition expired. The inpatient cost share for retirees under 65 and their family members was set to increase to 25% of total hospital charges, but a legislative measure prevented this increase. The prohibition on increasing fees or copayments under TRICARE Standard, Extra, and Prime plans was extended until FY2011. The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) oversees the military health system. The military health system delivers care through military hospitals and clinics, known as military treatment facilities (MTFs), and civilian providers. Each military service manages its MTFs, with the TRICARE Management Activity overseeing contracts for civilian care support. Some view the command structure as fragmented. Some suggest unifying the command elements of the military health system in a \"Unified Medical Command\" to address fragmentation. The concept of a Unified Medical Command (UMC) has been debated for a long time, with potential benefits including eliminating command fragmentation and increasing integration for all elements of the medical command. The Unified Medical Command (UMC) aims to improve integration in the military health system, enhancing healthcare delivery and readiness for war. Critics argue that unclear objectives and potential weakening of service-specific doctrine and culture are concerns. Congress has tasked the DOD to explore unified medical command options, but the Government Accountability Office found shortcomings in the analysis of potential options. The Obama Administration strongly opposes the provision in H.R. 5136 to authorize the creation of a new military medical command, as it would undermine the role of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs and impose additional organizational costs. The Obama Administration opposes creating a new military medical command due to conflicting with efforts to eliminate bureaucratic layers and organizational costs. TRICARE eligibility ends when a dependent child turns 23 or 21 if not enrolled in school. PPACA extends dependent coverage until age 26, but it may not apply to TRICARE. The enacted bill amends TRICARE to offer premium-based dependent coverage until age 26, unlike the coverage mandated by PPACA. PPACA extends dependent coverage without separate premiums, while TRICARE now charges a premium for this new policy. Under the new TRICARE program, concerns have been raised about the potential premiums that may be charged, especially for \"grey-area\" retirees. Previously, reserve component members with 20 or more years of service but under 60 were not eligible for care at military facilities, but TRICARE Standard coverage has now been extended to them. Grey-area reservists can now purchase TRICARE Standard coverage under the TRICARE Retired Reserve program for an unsubsidized premium, allowing access to private sector care. Section 643 would eliminate restrictions on space-available care at military treatment facilities for retired reservists, without requiring the purchase of TRICARE Standard insurance. Congressional Budget Office estimates appropriations of $125 million over FY2011\u2013FY2015. Personnel Issues: Questions and Answers, by [author name scrubbed]. Background: Congress enacted P.L. 103-160, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994, which describes homosexuality in the ranks as an \"unacceptable risk\" to morale, good order, and discipline. The law outlines grounds for discharge related to homosexual acts, self-identification, or same-sex marriage. DOD was instructed to brief new entrants and members regularly on the law and policy. Resuming questions on sexuality for new recruits was also mentioned. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 allowed for the resumption of asking questions about sexuality to new recruits on a discretionary basis, leading to the implementation of the \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy. Despite discussions and hearings, the policy remains in effect until the 112th Congress addresses issues related to its repeal and implementation. Congress may be interested in issues related to the repeal of the \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy, including proposed changes to military regulations, the impact on military family benefits, contentious issues regarding morality and religious practices, and oversight of the certification process and training plans for integrating openly gay and lesbian servicemembers. The integration of openly gay and lesbian servicemembers in the military is a key focus. There are no laws regarding the recruitment, training, and deployment of women in the Armed Forces, with the last law barring women from serving on combat ships repealed in 1993. The \"risk rule\" policy, which excluded women from combat units based on exposure to combat, was replaced in 1994 with new criteria for exclusion. In Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, female troops have been deployed in combat roles despite restrictions on direct engagement with the enemy. The non-linear battlefield and insurgent nature of these operations make it challenging to determine safe areas for deployment. Despite commendable service, there are concerns that the Department of Defense may be violating its rules by placing women in situations with direct contact with hostile forces. The military is considering opening combat arms units to women and integrating them into submarine crews. Since the end of the draft, the number of women in the military, military families, divorces, and overseas deployments have increased. There is also a rise in single military parents with custody of children. The military is facing challenges with custody issues for single parents during deployment. Section 544 of a House bill aimed to protect the best interests of the child and prevent adverse court orders for deployed military personnel, but this provision was not enacted. Congress previously required the Department of Defense to establish a central database on domestic violence incidents involving armed forces members. The Department of Defense Task Force on Domestic Violence was established by law to create a strategic plan for addressing domestic violence within the military. The task force submitted over 200 recommendations from 2001 to 2003. In 2003, the Family Violence Policy Office was created to oversee the implementation of these recommendations. In 2006, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that while DOD had acted on most recommendations, accurate data was lacking. GAO recommended better data collection, an oversight framework, and a plan for adequate personnel. In 2010, GAO noted improvements in DOD's domestic violence program. The Department of Defense has implemented some recommendations from the 2006 report on its domestic violence program but has not taken action on four recommendations. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found inaccuracies in data provided by DOD and recommended better data collection, an oversight framework, and a plan for adequate personnel. DOD did not agree with GAO's recommendation on collecting chaplain training data due to privileged communication concerns. GAO suggests DOD develop an oversight framework for implementing task force recommendations. On May 12, 1975, the U.S. merchant ship S.S. Mayaguez was seized by the Khmer Rouge Navy after the Vietnam War. A rescue operation on May 15 resulted in four U.S. helicopters shot down, 41 Marines killed, and 39 sailors captured. The House-passed language would authorize the Vietnam Service Medal for participants in the rescue. Military families often relocate frequently, causing frustration for non-military spouses seeking employment in new locations. Congress enacted a program in 2008 to provide training opportunities for military spouses to expand their career options. The proposed pilot program in the House passed bill aims to expand existing opportunities for military spouses to receive education and training in portable counseling skills. The enacted law now seeks a review of available programs. JROTC is a program in secondary educational institutions that aims to instill citizenship, service to the US, and personal responsibility. Currently offered above 8th grade, expanding it to 7th and 8th grades could significantly increase participation. Some parents object to the perceived militarization of youth in the program."
