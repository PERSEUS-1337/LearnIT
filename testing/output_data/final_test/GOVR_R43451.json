    "content": "Recent disclosures of NSA surveillance programs have raised concerns about government collection of foreign intelligence. The FISA Court reviews applications for electronic surveillance, prompting calls for changes to legal authorities and FISA Court procedures. The report analyzes proposals to reform the FISA Court, including introducing a public advocate, altering procedural mechanisms, displacing judge designation authority, and requiring the release of FISA Court opinions. The FISC is composed of 11 district court judges selected by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. The FISC, with judges designated by the Chief Justice, has jurisdiction over foreign intelligence collection methods like electronic surveillance and physical searches. It can review government certifications and targeting procedures. Appeals can be made to the FISA Court of Review for denied applications. The FISC has jurisdiction to review decisions on directives and compliance, may hold en banc hearings, operates in secret with the government presenting arguments, and rarely releases opinions. The FISC operates primarily in secret, with public access being the exception. Recipients of production orders can challenge the legality of orders, with the executive branch classifying most filings as Secret or Top Secret. The FISC's opinions and orders are also classified, but the executive branch can choose to declassify portions or entire opinions. Critics have noted the infrequency of FISC rejections of government surveillance requests. Legislative proposals aim to introduce an advocate to challenge government's FISA requests in FISC proceedings to protect civil liberties. The advocate would represent public interests, have a significant role in court proceedings, and be able to intervene in cases. The advocate in FISC proceedings has various responsibilities, including intervening in cases, briefing the court, conducting discovery, filing motions for relief, and appealing rulings. Proposals suggest giving the advocate independence from the President to oppose government applications. The advocate's status as a government actor depends on being a permanently constituted entity, not just Congress's labeling. Courts will consider if establishing a public advocate serves a government objective before examining constitutional implications. A public advocate seeking injunctive relief based on a violation of law in the interest of the general public may be considered a government function. If the advocate is permanently constituted, they are subject to constitutional constraints, including the Appointments Clause of Article II of the Constitution. Principal officers must be appointed by the President with Senate confirmation, while employees are not subject to this clause. The Supreme Court has defined an officer of the United States as any appointee exercising significant authority under the laws of the United States. The Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel argues that this includes the delegation of sovereign authority and a continuing position. A permanent public advocate with the power to seek judicial relief on behalf of the public could be considered an officer. The court found that an entity responsible for civil litigation in the US courts for public rights must be discharged by Officers of the United States. Private attorneys for a single case or amici offering advisory briefs may not need to adhere to the Appointments Clause. The key question is whether a public advocate is a principal or inferior officer, as principal officers require appointment by the President with Senate confirmation. The proposals for a public advocate do not establish control by a principal officer. The proposals for a public advocate do not establish control by a principal officer, potentially creating an office headed by a principal officer. Utilizing a public advocate in FISA proceedings may raise Article III issues regarding courts adjudicating live cases and controversies. The role of the judiciary in FISA proceedings and the FISA advocate's role are key factors in determining the impact on court proceedings. The role of the judiciary in FISA proceedings may not need to satisfy the case or controversy requirement, as federal courts can engage in non-adversarial activities that are incidental to their judicial function. This reasoning is supported by previous Supreme Court cases like Morrison v. Olson and Mistretta v. United States. The FISA Court of Review may have used this argument to reject challenges to FISA proceedings based on Article III requirements. The FISA proceedings may be considered incidental to the judiciary's powers, suggesting that traditional Article III restrictions may not apply. Allowing a public advocate in FISA proceedings could avoid constitutional issues, but the nature of FISA proceedings differs from traditional warrant applications, making this argument less straightforward. Another argument for a public advocate in FISA proceedings stems from a more traditional interpretation of Article III. The argument for a public advocate in FISA proceedings is based on a traditional understanding of Article III, where a public advocate can participate as long as they meet necessary requirements like standing. The Department of Justice argued in the 1970s that two parties are not always required, as long as there is \"adversity in fact\" or \"possible adverse parties.\" Some district courts and the FISA Court of Review have accepted this argument, but the question remains whether a public advocate can participate in FISA proceedings. The Supreme Court requires a party to show personal, concrete, and particularized injury with a causal connection to the challenged action to establish standing. If one party meets standing requirements, a third party may seek identical relief, and an amicus can brief the court without needing standing. To engage in proceedings beyond the role of an amicus, a public advocate must satisfy standing requirements. Recent FISC opinion granted an interest group's motion for an amicus brief but denied motions for reconsideration, establishing a docket, releasing information, and ordering a hearing, citing lack of standing. Public advocates seeking judicial relief must likely meet constitutional standing requirements. The standing requirements for a public advocate to engage in proceedings beyond an amicus role are questioned, as it is unclear if they have personally suffered a specific injury to seek relief from a FISA Court. Representational standing may allow parties without standing to seek judicial relief on behalf of others. The doctrine of \"representational standing\" allows parties to assert the rights of absent third parties in certain situations, such as through next friend standing. To invoke this doctrine, a next friend must show that the actual party cannot appear on their own behalf due to reasons like inaccessibility or incompetence, and must have a significant relationship with them. However, providing standing for a public advocate may be challenging as the real party in interest must still suffer injury-in-fact, and they may be capable of asserting their own rights. The doctrine of next friend standing requires a significant relationship between the parties, typically involving a traditional legal obligation. However, a public advocate may lack this obligation to represent the general public in court, raising concerns about circumventing jurisdictional limits. The doctrine of next friend standing requires a significant relationship between parties, typically involving a traditional legal obligation. However, allowing a statute to override core constitutional standing requirements could enable Congress to bypass Article III's limitations. In the context of a FISA proceeding, it does not seem that an advocate may seek relief in federal court without a direct relationship with a party with standing. In a FISA proceeding, an advocate may not be officially authorized by those targeted by the government, and the typical elements of an agency relationship may not be present. While federal officials can litigate on behalf of the general public, most FISA proposals involve an independent advocate litigating against the government rather than acting as its agent. In FISA proceedings, an independent advocate may litigate against the government, rather than acting as its agent. The Supreme Court has taken a functional approach to intra-branch conflicts, looking beyond mere labels of litigating parties. Litigation in FISA proceedings may involve a dispute between a public advocate and the DOJ over conflicting sovereign interests. This raises concerns about having a federal court arbitrate such disputes and potential issues under Article II's vesting clause. The Supreme Court has upheld \"for cause\" removal restrictions. The Supreme Court has upheld \"for cause\" removal restrictions on independent agencies. Empowering an independent agency to override a foreign intelligence operation sought by the President could be seen as interfering with Executive power. Proposals to place a public advocate within the judiciary raise separation of powers concerns. Creating an independent agency in the judicial branch would also raise constitutional issues. Creating an independent agency in the judicial branch raises constitutional concerns if it merges judicial and political powers or undermines judicial integrity. Giving a judicial agency executive functions may violate restrictions, and having the judicial branch litigate against the government could compromise neutrality. Suggestions for FISA Courts include automatic review of final decisions by higher courts, but the feasibility of appeals without party requests is questionable. The FISC has proposed various options for judicial relief, including certifying questions of law to higher courts or allowing input from amicus curiae. Creating a permanent public advocate raises concerns about advisory opinions and standing issues. Alternatively, amicus curiae could provide input on specific legal issues in cases without violating constitutional boundaries. The FISC can appoint amici independently of Congress, but requiring the FISA Courts to appoint an amicus curiae may raise constitutional concerns regarding court independence. The FISC can appoint amici independently of Congress, but requiring the FISA Courts to appoint an amicus curiae may raise constitutional concerns regarding court independence. The traditional status of amici is changing to a party with an absolute right to be heard, potentially impacting the judiciary's role in ruling on cases. Legislation could require the FISC to sit en banc during certain proceedings, which has precedent in federal courts for specific situations without major constitutional issues. One proposal suggests changing the voting rules of the FISA Courts to increase scrutiny of their orders. This includes requiring a 60% concurrence for en banc panels and unanimous decisions in favor of the government by the FISA Court of Review. The constitutionality of Congress setting judicial voting rules is uncertain due to limited past legislation on the matter. In United States v. Klein, the Supreme Court ruled that Congress cannot dictate substantive outcomes of federal courts. A 60% concurrence requirement in en banc proceedings may not intrude on judicial function, while a unanimity requirement for the FISA Court of Review could interfere with its independence. Suggestions have been made to modify the selection process of FISA Court judges. The FISA Court judges are designated by the Chief Justice for seven-year terms and cannot serve a second term. Proposals have been made to disperse the Chief Justice's authority in selecting judges among the chief judges of circuit courts or involve the President and congressional leadership in the selection process. These proposals raise novel legal issues. The Chief Justice's authority to designate federal judges to sit on other federal courts, including the FISA Court, has been upheld. Extending this authority to the President or lower federal courts remains unresolved constitutionally. Congress has not vested similar authority beyond the Chief Justice and chief judge of each judicial circuit. Supreme Court case law provides little guidance, and proposals to vest authority in Congress may raise constitutional questions. The Supreme Court has emphasized that legislative acts altering legal rights outside the Legislative Branch must meet constitutional requirements. Proposals to increase transparency in FISA Courts may raise separation of powers issues. The extent of Congress's authority over national security information, including the release of FISA opinions, is a key unresolved question. The executive branch's argument is that compelling the release of FISA opinions may implicate the President's power under Article II of the Constitution, specifically regarding national security information. The President's authority to classify and control access to such information is seen as a constraint on Congress's ability to require disclosure of agency documents. The Supreme Court has recognized Congress's power to mandate disclosure of executive branch documents, but the issue of national security complicates this authority. The President's authority as Commander in Chief to classify and control access to national security information is derived from the Constitution. While courts have recognized Congress's power to impose classification procedures, statutes require consistent disclosure of sensitive information to relevant committees. The executive branch has been required by courts to disclose information to the public and judiciary. Proposals allowing the executive branch to redact classified information from FISA opinions before public release are constitutionally sound. Releasing past FISA opinions without any redactions by the executive branch may raise separation of powers issues."
