    "content": "There is no information provided in the prev_chunk to assist with summarizing the curr_chunk. Section 24 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act is amended to include a new subsection (d) regarding the registration of foreign pesticides by states. The term \"comparable domestic pesticide\" is defined as a pesticide registered under section 3 that is not subject to cancellation or suspension notices or enforcement actions. The term 'foreign pesticide' refers to a pesticide registered in a foreign country that is similar in composition to a pesticide registered domestically under section 3. The State may register a foreign pesticide for distribution and use if consistent with the Act and approved by the Administrator. Registration by a State is considered a registration under section 3, allowing distribution to other states. To register a foreign pesticide for distribution and use, a State must ensure it is consistent with the Act and approved by the Administrator. The State registering the pesticide is considered the registrant under the Act, and distribution to other states must align with the original State's registration. The State must ensure that a foreign pesticide is identical or substantially similar to a domestic pesticide before submitting the registration to the Administrator. For each authorized food or feed use, the State must determine if there is a tolerance or exemption under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for residues of the pesticide on the food or feed. The submission must include proposed tolerances for special local needs and require the pesticide label to specify compliance information, be identified as the only valid label, indicate the approved use and state restrictions, and provide usage directions and precautions. The submission for the registration of a foreign pesticide must include a description of the proposed registration, determinations made, proposed labeling, and supporting documentation. It must also include a statement indicating that it is unlawful to distribute or use the foreign pesticide in a manner inconsistent with the state registration. The Administrator must approve the proposed registration of a foreign pesticide by a State within 60 days if it aligns with the Act. Approval is not effective until written notice is provided by the Administrator to the State. The Administrator must approve foreign pesticide registrations within 60 days if they comply with the Act. Harmonization of registrations with foreign and domestic pesticides is a priority. States must provide approved labels for distribution of foreign pesticides. Foreign pesticides registered by a State must bear approved labels for use and containers must have approved labels before distribution. Distributors must provide a report to the State before distributing the foreign pesticide. Foreign pesticides registered by a State must have approved labels for use and containers must also have approved labels before distribution. Distributors need to report the recipient and quantity of foreign pesticides to the State. Affixing labels to foreign pesticides is not considered production under this Act. States registering foreign pesticides must prepare an annual report listing the registered foreign pesticides. The State must provide an annual report listing registered foreign pesticides, identifying users, and stating quantities. The Administrator can request a copy of the report. If necessary, the Administrator can request a recall of a foreign pesticide in a State. If a State fails to comply, the Administrator can suspend the State's authority to register foreign pesticides. If a State fails to exercise adequate control over registered foreign pesticides, the Administrator may suspend the State's authority to register foreign pesticides until control is ensured. Before suspension, the Administrator must provide notice and an opportunity to respond. The Administrator may suspend a State's authority to register foreign pesticides if control is inadequate. The State must be informed of the proposal and given a chance to respond. The Administrator can disclose necessary information to the State for registration if confidentiality is maintained. The Administrator may suspend a State's authority to register foreign pesticides if control is inadequate. If a State registers a foreign pesticide and a registrant of a comparable domestic pesticide fails to provide necessary information, the Administrator may suspend pesticide registrations without a hearing. Title 35, United States Code, does not apply to a foreign pesticide registered by a State. The Administrator may suspend a State's authority to register foreign pesticides if control is inadequate. A submission by a State under this section shall not be considered an application under section 3(c)(1)(F). A conforming amendment is made to the table of contents in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. The section outlines the registration process for foreign pesticides by States, including definitions, authority, requirements, approval, labeling, reports, recalls, and disclosure of information. The effective date for this section and its amendments is 60 days after the enactment of the Act."
