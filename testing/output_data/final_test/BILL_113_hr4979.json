    "content": "The \"Red River Private Property Protection Act\" disclaims the Secretary's interest in Red River lands south of the South Bank. Tribal sovereignty rights over lands north of the South Bank remain unaffected. The Act establishes a claims process and issuance of deeds. The Secretary will transfer all US rights to Red River lands to claimants meeting specific criteria, including holding title for 30 years, having a recorded deed, and paying all taxes. The process for submitting required documents will be published for claimants to follow. The Secretary will accept official county and State records proving right, title, and interest for Red River lands. A request for a special warranty deed must be approved or disapproved within 180 days, or it will be deemed approved. The final decision must include a field note description for property determination. To determine property claim for Red River lands, the submission must include a field note description, an accurate plat prepared by a Texas licensed State land surveyor, and any other required matters as deemed appropriate by the Secretary. SEC. 4. ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING. The Secretary will establish procedures for an administrative hearing for claimants to appeal final decisions regarding property claims and to resolve disputes between property owners. If a private property owner disputes the final determination, they can pursue a claim in a Federal district court in Texas. SEC. 5. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN. SEC. 5. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN. The Secretary will ensure that Red River lands are not considered Federal land in resource management plans until it is confirmed they are not subject to transfer under section 3. SEC. 6. CONSTRUCTION. This Act does not affect the rights and interests of the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache Tribes, tribal trust lands, allotted lands held in trust, lands with Federal restrictions, or tribal boundaries. It also does not impact the sovereign rights and jurisdiction of these tribes. SEC. 7. SALE OF REMAINING RED RIVER SURFACE RIGHTS. After ensuring Red River lands are not subject to transfer, the Secretary will offer remaining identified Federal lands for competitive sale at fair market value. Sales will respect existing tribal, State, and local rights, with proceeds used to offset Act costs. A report is required within 5 years of enactment. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress listing any Federal lands not sold and reasons why after offering identified lands for competitive sale at fair market value to offset Act costs. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"Red River lands\" as lands along a 116-mile stretch of the Red River between Texas and Oklahoma, \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Interior, and \"South Bank\" as the elevation along the southerly side of the Red River. The term \"gradient boundary survey\" refers to the measurement technique used to demarcate ownership or jurisdiction along the South Bank of the Red River, as established by the United States Supreme Court in a decree from March 12, 1923 in Oklahoma v. Texas. This methodology recognizes that the boundary line between the two states is subject to changes caused by erosion and accretion."
