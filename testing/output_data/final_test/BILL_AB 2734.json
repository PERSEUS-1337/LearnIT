    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature emphasizes the importance of a healthy housing market in California, stating that it is crucial for economic prosperity and quality of life. State funding approved by voters has supported the construction of over 14,000 shelter spaces, 149,000 affordable homes, and helped families become homeowners. The elimination of redevelopment agencies has led to the disappearance of a funding stream for affordable housing. The Legislature has allocated ongoing cap-and-trade funds and one-time funding for affordable housing initiatives, including support for veterans. Despite significant investments in affordable housing initiatives, the need in California surpasses available resources. Recent data reveals that a high percentage of mortgaged homeowners and renters in the state are spending a large portion of their incomes on housing. California, with 12% of the US population, accounts for 20% of the homeless population, including the highest percentage of unsheltered homeless individuals in the nation. Additionally, the state has a significant homeless veteran population and the largest number of unaccompanied homeless children and youth in the country. California has four of the top 10 metropolitan areas with the highest rate of homelessness. Los Angeles is now a majority renter area with overcrowded housing issues affecting children's health and academic performance. Millions of Californians, including seniors, veterans, people experiencing chronic homelessness, working families, and others, are affected by the state's chronic housing shortage. Eight of the top 10 hardest hit cities by the foreclosure crisis in the nation are in California, leading to longer commute times and congestion problems as people seek affordable housing outside their work areas. Many economists attribute the state's high unemployment rate to the significant decline in the construction industry from 2005 to 2009, resulting in massive job losses and reduced construction spending. Restoring a healthy construction sector is crucial for lowering the state's unemployment rate. The lack of adequate housing hinders economic growth by making it challenging for California employers to attract and retain employees. The Local Control Affordable Housing Act is introduced to address these housing issues. The Department of Finance determines General Fund savings annually from the dissolution of redevelopment agencies. 50% of the savings or $1 billion, whichever is greater, is allocated to the Department of Housing and Community Development for state and local housing programs. The Department of Housing and Community Development allocates funds to local agencies for housing purposes based on an equitable funding formula that considers factors like poverty rates and lack of affordable housing. Local agencies must use the funds for specified purposes. The Department of Housing and Community Development allocates funds to local agencies for housing purposes based on an equitable funding formula that considers factors like poverty rates and lack of affordable housing. The funds are used for the development, acquisition, rehabilitation, and preservation of affordable housing for low- and moderate-income households, including supportive housing, accessibility modifications, reuse of foreclosed homes, and infrastructure for infill development. The Department of Housing and Community Development allocates funds to local agencies for housing purposes. This includes the acquisition of land for affordable housing, rapid rehousing for homeless individuals, and specific expenditure requirements for extremely low and very low-income housing. Housing built with these funds must remain affordable for at least 55 years for rental units and 45 years for owner-occupied units. Any local agency receiving funds under this chapter must submit a plan to the Department of Housing and Community Development to ensure no net loss of affordable housing units. Administrative costs are limited to 5% of received funds, and agencies must report annual expenditures. Unspent funds must be returned after five years, with the department reallocating them to other qualifying agencies. Definitions for terms used in this chapter are provided. In this chapter, definitions are provided for terms like \"extremely low income households,\" \"low-income households,\" \"moderate-income households,\" and \"very low income households.\" These definitions align with specific sections and criteria outlined in the legislation."
