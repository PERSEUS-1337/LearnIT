    "content": "The Act titled \"Greenhouse Gas Registry Act\" includes definitions for key terms. The Act titled \"Greenhouse Gas Registry Act\" defines key terms such as Administrator, carbon dioxide equivalent, Climate Registry, and covered entity. The Greenhouse Gas Registry Act requires facilities in the electric power sector, industrial facilities, entities involved in petroleum or coal-based liquid fuels, natural gas distribution companies, and other entities as deemed necessary by the Administrator to report greenhouse gas emissions exceeding 10,000 carbon dioxide equivalents annually. The Greenhouse Gas Registry Act mandates reporting of greenhouse gas emissions exceeding 10,000 carbon dioxide equivalents annually by entities such as electric energy sellers, independent system operators, facilities producing or importing specific gases, sites for carbon dioxide sequestration, and other entities as determined by the Administrator. The Greenhouse Gas Registry Act requires reporting of greenhouse gas emissions exceeding 10,000 carbon dioxide equivalents annually by various entities. A \"facility\" is defined as buildings or structures of an entity in the US. \"Geologically sequestered\" refers to isolating greenhouse gases in geological formations. \"Greenhouse gas\" includes carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, sulfur hexafluoride, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and other gases designated by the Administrator. The term \"greenhouse gas emission\" includes emissions from stationary combustion sources, process emissions, and fugitive emissions from various equipment and sources. The term \"greenhouse gas emission\" includes emissions from stationary combustion sources, process emissions, and fugitive emissions from various equipment and sources. An industrial facility refers to manufacturing facilities, natural gas processing plants, and facilities producing petroleum or coal-based liquid fuel. A local distribution company is defined as per the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. The term \"reversal\" refers to the intentional or unintentional release of a significant quantity of sequestered greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. Sequestered greenhouse gases are those separated, isolated, or removed from the atmosphere. The Act aims to establish a national greenhouse gas registry to collect reliable data for energy security initiatives and emissions reduction strategies. It also provides better direction for the Administrator regarding the need for greenhouse gas emission information. Additionally, it determines the carbon dioxide equivalent value of greenhouse gases. SEC. 4 of the Act requires the Administrator to determine the carbon dioxide equivalent value of greenhouse gases within 90 days of enactment and publish it in the Federal Register. The methodology includes considering publications by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. SEC. 5 of the Act designates greenhouse gases based on their contribution to global warming, as determined by the Administrator. The designated gases are published in the Federal Register. SEC. 6 requires reporting of greenhouse gases. Each covered entity must report their greenhouse gas emissions to the Administrator annually by July 1, starting in 2011, following regulations issued under section 7. The Administrator must issue regulations by July 1, 2009, for a Federal greenhouse gas registry ensuring data accuracy and transparency on emissions and production in the United States. The regulations should incorporate best practices from various protocols for measurement and verification. The regulations for a Federal greenhouse gas registry must include protocols for measurement, accounting, reporting, and verification of emissions. They should consider the latest scientific research and require the use of monitoring systems for data accuracy. If a covered entity already uses a monitoring system consistent with the Act, it should be used for submitted data. The regulations for a Federal greenhouse gas registry must include protocols for measurement, accounting, reporting, and verification of emissions. This Act mandates the use of a monitoring system for submitted data, annual reporting starting from 2010, methods to prevent double reporting, strict verification protocols, electronic reporting, and consistent policies for calculating carbon content and greenhouse gas emissions. The Act requires immediate public dissemination of verified data on the Internet, excluding information vital to national security or confidential business data that could cause competitive harm. The Administrator must establish methods for cases where satisfactory data is not submitted. The Administrator must replace missing emission data with best estimates to prevent underreporting or overreporting, enforce data monitoring requirements, and have the same authority as under section 114 of the Clean Air Act for information gathering. SEC. 8. INTERRELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER SYSTEMS. The regulations will consider work done by the Climate Registry and other State programs, explaining differences in approach. No preemption of State or regional greenhouse gas registry efforts. SEC. 9. ENFORCEMENT. SEC. 9. ENFORCEMENT. The Administrator can take legal action against entities not complying with regulations, imposing a civil penalty of up to $25,000 per day for violations. Penalties will be adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index. SEC. 10. EFFECT ON OTHER PROVISIONS. This Act and its regulations do not impact the regulatory status or authority regarding carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act."
