    "content": "SECTION 1. PURPOSE AND FINDINGS. The Act aims to promote collaboration between Department of Defense facilities and US industry to boost technological advancements. Congress recognizes the valuable resources in defense facilities that can benefit industries. As technology development shifts to the commercial sector, the Defense Department will need private sector expertise. Both private industry and Defense Department have identified similar technologies. The Department of Defense and private industry have identified similar technologies as critical for their purposes, creating opportunities for cooperative development of dual-use technologies. However, Defense facilities lack incentives for collaboration with private industry, and private industry needs more input into Defense research facilities for more dual-use technology development. The Federal Defense Laboratory Diversification Program aims to promote collaboration between Defense facilities and private industry for the development of dual-use technologies. The Federal Defense Laboratory Diversification Program, established by the Secretary of Defense, aims to promote collaboration between Defense laboratories and private industry for the development of dual-use technologies. The Federal Defense Laboratory Diversification Program aims to promote the development and application of dual-use manufacturing technologies for civilian and defense products, commercialization of dual-use product technologies, transfer of technologies to the private sector for commercialization, and adaptation of civilian manufacturing technologies to defense needs. The Director of Research and Engineering, in cooperation with Defense laboratories and private industry, will develop benchmarks for diversification activities. Benchmarks will cover fiscal years 1993-1995 and include budget resources, manpower, facilities, and patents to be pursued by each laboratory. The Director will establish benchmarks for Defense laboratories participating in the Program, allocating 2-5% of the budget for cooperative agreements. Benchmarks must be set within 180 days of the Act's enactment and updated annually. Each laboratory must implement the benchmarks within its budget and collaborate with industry and academia. The Program requires Defense laboratories to establish advisory panels to promote cooperation with the private sector. The Director must submit a report to Congress by September 30, 1993, outlining the research being conducted and evaluating each laboratory's potential to meet program goals. The Director must submit reports to Congress on the effectiveness of Defense laboratories in implementing Program benchmarks, achievements in meeting Program elements, and steps to improve Program effectiveness by September 30 of 1994, 1995, and 1996. SEC. 3. INDUSTRY EVALUATION. The Director of the Office of Technology Assessment, with approval from the Technology Assessment Board, will evaluate effective practices in promoting the Program's elements. This includes assessing cooperation with private industry and making recommendations for improvements. The evaluations required under this section must be submitted within 24 months of the Act's enactment. The Director of Research and Engineering will use the study's recommendations for ongoing Program implementation."
