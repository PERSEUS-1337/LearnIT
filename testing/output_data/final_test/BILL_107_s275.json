    "content": "The \"Estate Tax Elimination Act of 2001\" repeals estate, gift, and generation-skipping taxes under Subtitle B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The repeal applies to estates of decedents dying, gifts, and generation-skipping transfers made after the enactment date. Additionally, it preserves the step-up in basis of certain property acquired from a decedent. The basis of property acquired from a decedent is amended to provide a step-up in basis, where the fair market value at the date of the decedent's death is used. There is a limitation that the total fair market value considered cannot exceed the sum of the decedent's aggregate basis plus $2,800,000. The executor must allocate the limitation of $2,800,000 when the fair market value exceeds the aggregate basis. For decedents after 2001, the dollar amount in paragraph (2)(B) is adjusted for inflation based on the cost-of-living adjustment. If the increase is not a multiple of $10,000, it is rounded to the nearest multiple of $10,000. The executor must allocate the limitation of $2,800,000 when the fair market value exceeds the aggregate basis. For decedents after 2001, the dollar amount is adjusted for inflation and rounded to the nearest multiple of $10,000. Additionally, regulations are prescribed by the Secretary to carry out the purposes of this section, and there are conforming amendments related to adjustments to basis and the heading for section 1014. The amendments made by this section apply to the estates of decedents dying after the enactment of this Act, changing the basis of property to a step-up in basis for certain property. SEC. 1022 introduces carryover basis rules for property acquired from a decedent, applying to estates of decedents dying after the enactment of this Act. The basis of carryover basis property acquired from a decedent is determined under section 1015. Carryover basis property is defined as property acquired from a decedent who died after the enactment of this section, excluding certain types of property. The term 'carryover basis property' excludes gross income items from a decedent and property with basis provided by section 1014. Additionally, information returns regarding special provisions are amended in subchapter A of chapter 61. Every executor must provide the Secretary with information on property acquired from a decedent under sections 1014 or 1022. A conforming amendment is made to the table of sections in subpart A of part III of subchapter A of chapter 61. Sec. 6039H requires executors to provide information on property acquired from a decedent. Amendments related to carryover basis include changes to capital gain treatment for inherited art work or similar property. The determination of whether property is a capital asset shall be made without regard to certain exceptions. The definition of executor is also expanded to include individuals in possession of the decedent's property. Effective Date: The amendments regarding carryover basis for property acquired from a decedent apply to estates of decedents who pass away after the enactment of this Act."
