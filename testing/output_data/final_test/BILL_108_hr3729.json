    "content": "The Act titled \"Belated Thank You to the Merchant Mariners of World War II Act of 2004\" provides benefits for World War II Merchant Mariners and survivors, including a monthly benefit under a new subchapter in the United States Code. The Act provides a monthly benefit of $1,000 to eligible persons and surviving spouses of eligible persons under section 11206 of the title. Surviving spouses must have been married to the eligible person for at least 1 year to receive the benefit. If there is no surviving spouse, children of eligible persons may receive benefits. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall pay children of eligible persons under section 11206 a monthly benefit of $1,000, exempt from taxation. Eligibility for benefits is based on qualified service between December 7, 1941, and December 31, 1946. The person must have been a member of the US merchant marine serving on a vessel operated by the War Shipping Administration or the Office of Defense Transportation, in waters outside the US, under contract to the US government, and serving the Armed Forces between December 7, 1941, and December 31, 1946. Sec. 11207 outlines the documentation required for qualified service in the US merchant marine during a specific period. Applicants must submit an application for a service certificate to the Secretary of Transportation or the Secretary of Defense for benefits under section 11205. The Secretary of Defense issues a certificate of honorable service to applicants who engaged in qualified service under specific criteria. The application must be acted upon within 1 year of receipt, applying standards similar to those for honorable discharges under the GI Bill Improvement Act. In this subchapter, the terms 'surviving spouse' and 'child' are defined as in section 101 of title 38, with the term 'veteran' including those who performed qualified service as specified in section 11206(c) of this title. Amendments are made to section 11201 of title 46, United States Code, changing 'chapter' to 'subchapter' in paragraph (1) and (2). The table of sections in chapter 112 of title 46, United States Code, is also amended. The text introduces a new subchapter on monthly benefits for veterans, including eligibility criteria and documentation requirements. Section 11205 of title 46, United States Code, will take effect for payments after the enactment of the Act. Additionally, there is an authorization of appropriation for the Department of Veterans Affairs to carry out the provisions of the Act."
