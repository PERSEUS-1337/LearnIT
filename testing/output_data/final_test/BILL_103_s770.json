    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Airline Predatory Pricing Prevention Act of 1993\". Authority is granted to issue cease and desist orders. The \"Airline Predatory Pricing Prevention Act of 1993\" amends Section 411 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to include a new subsection (c) on predatory pricing in air transportation. The Secretary of Transportation must conduct a preliminary investigation within seven days of receiving a complaint about predatory pricing by an air carrier in a city-pair market and issue a cease and desist order if necessary. If there is a significant likelihood of predatory pricing indicators, the Secretary will order the air carrier to cease such practices until a full investigation is completed. If no significant likelihood is found, the Secretary will explain the reasons for that finding in the Federal Register. The Secretary of Transportation will conduct a full investigation into alleged predatory pricing if a finding is made. Interested parties will have the opportunity to provide important information. If predatory pricing is confirmed, the air carrier will be ordered to cease such practices. In a full investigation, an air carrier is presumed to engage in predatory pricing if specific indicators are present. This presumption can be challenged with clear evidence. Failure to comply with a cease and desist order incurs a $10,000 civil penalty per offense. Indicators of predatory pricing include the pricing set by the air carrier for air travel. The indicators of predatory pricing by an air carrier include pricing below direct operating costs and decreases in pricing during sustained downward airfare trends, leading to widespread losses among carriers. The revenue levels at the time of transportation should be adequate to cover operating expenses, provide net income, support capital outlays, repay debt, raise equity capital, and consider future costs. Direct operating costs for an air carrier refer to costs incurred in preparing and executing a single flight. Direct operating costs for an air carrier include expenses related to the aircraft and passengers, such as flight crew compensation, landing fees, fuel, maintenance costs, and liability insurance. A conforming amendment is made to the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. The Federal Aviation Act of 1958 includes a provision on predatory pricing."
