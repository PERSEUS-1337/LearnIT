    "content": "Foreign intelligence collection is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution as a power of Congress or the President. The Framers likely intended for this authority to fall under foreign affairs and war powers shared by both branches of government. The Steel Seizure Case is often referenced to determine the extent of the President's authority, especially in national security matters. In this case, the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional President Truman's seizure of steel mills during the Korean War. The Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional President Truman's seizure of steel mills during the Korean War, despite his justification based on wartime exigencies and his role as Commander-in-Chief. The Court noted that the President's authority must be found in the Constitution, and that it cannot be implied from his powers under Article II. The Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional President Truman's seizure of steel mills during the Korean War, despite his justification based on wartime exigencies and his role as Commander-in-Chief. The Court noted that the President's authority must be found in the Constitution, and that it cannot be implied from his powers under Article II. The order to seize the steel mills cannot be justified as an exercise of the President's military power as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, as it is a job for the Nation's lawmakers, not for its military authorities. The Court also rejected the argument that past similar assertions of authority by presidents bolstered the executive claims of constitutional power. The Steel Seizure Case ruled President Truman's seizure of steel mills during the Korean War unconstitutional. Justice Robert Jackson's concurring opinion outlined the separation of powers between Congress and the President, stating that the President's authority is at its maximum when acting with congressional authorization. When the President acts with congressional authorization, his authority is at its maximum, supported by strong presumptions and wide judicial latitude. In the absence of clear congressional authority, there is a zone of uncertainty where both the President and Congress may have concurrent authority. Congressional inaction may enable independent presidential actions, with the actual test of power depending on events rather than abstract principles. When the President acts with congressional authorization, his authority is at its maximum. In the absence of clear congressional authority, there is a zone of uncertainty where both the President and Congress may have concurrent authority. Presidential power is at its lowest when measures are taken against Congress's will, requiring scrutiny to maintain the constitutional equilibrium. The court must determine the allocation of power between the President and Congress based on the Constitution. In cases where the President acts with congressional authorization, his authority is strongest. Without clear congressional approval, there is uncertainty where both branches may have authority. Presidential power is weakest when acting against Congress's will, requiring constitutional scrutiny. The court must decide power allocation between the President and Congress based on the Constitution. William Rehnquist refined Justice Jackson's formula in Dames & Moore v. Regan regarding cases falling within a \"zone of twilight\" where the President and Congress may have overlapping authority. In cases where the President acts without clear congressional authorization, the analysis becomes complex as it falls within a \"zone of twilight\" where both branches may have concurrent authority. The validity of the President's action depends on various factors, including congressional views and responses to international crises. This spectrum of authority ranges from explicit congressional authorization to explicit prohibition, making it challenging to determine the extent of presidential power in such situations. In Dames & Moore, petitioners challenged President Carter's executive order to comply with an executive agreement to end the Iran hostage crisis. The orders directed legal recourse to a special tribunal established by the Algiers Accords. President Carter relied on the IEEPA but could not authorize actions affecting claims in U.S. courts. The Hostage Act's broad language was also cited. The Supreme Court considered the President's authority to suspend claims related to the Iran hostage crisis. Justice Rehnquist noted that while Congress did not specifically delegate this authority, it does not imply disapproval. Congress cannot anticipate every action the President may need to take in foreign policy and national security. The Supreme Court found that legislative intent and congressional acquiescence in the President's actions allowed for broad discretion in settling international claims through executive agreement. This longstanding executive practice was considered a gloss on the President's vested Executive Power. The Supreme Court found that the President's power to settle international claims through executive agreement is supported by legislative intent and congressional acquiescence. This practice is considered an extension of the President's Executive Power. The executive branch has broad authority in conducting surveillance for intelligence purposes, with Congress mainly focusing on domestic surveillance. Overseas surveillance is left to executive self-regulation with congressional oversight. Balancing national security interests with privacy and First Amendment rights is a challenge. The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, expanding to cover intangible items like conversations. Technology has advanced for intrusion into private conversations, with government efforts to exploit it for law enforcement and intelligence. The Court and Congress have expanded interpretations and legislation to balance privacy with law enforcement and intelligence needs. The Fourth Amendment extends protections to electronic surveillance of oral communications without physical intrusion. Congress enacted Title III to regulate electronic surveillance for law enforcement purposes, with an exception for national security cases. The original exception in Title III allowed the President to take necessary measures to protect the nation against foreign threats. The Supreme Court later addressed electronic surveillance for domestic intelligence purposes in the Keith case. The Sixth Circuit denied the writ, but the Supreme Court granted certiorari and upheld the decision. The Court emphasized the need for Fourth Amendment protections in electronic surveillance cases. Justice Powell highlighted the issue of presidential power to authorize surveillance without judicial approval in internal security matters. This case marked the first time the issue was brought before the Court. The case brought before the Court highlighted the need for Fourth Amendment protections in domestic security surveillance. The Court emphasized the requirement for prior judicial approval in intelligence gathering involving domestic security surveillance to protect citizens' privacy rights. Congress was invited to establish statutory guidelines for such surveillance. The Court has recognized Congress's role in establishing rules for domestic surveillance related to national security. Court of appeals decisions addressed warrantless electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence gathering. In United States v. Brown, a warrantless wiretap for foreign intelligence purposes was upheld. In United States v. Butenko, warrantless electronic surveillance was deemed lawful if the primary purpose was for intelligence gathering. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the conviction of a defendant for furnishing false information in connection with ammunition acquisition. The court ruled that wiretaps authorized by the Attorney General for foreign intelligence purposes were lawful and did not need to be disclosed. The court found that the requirement and disclosure of wiretaps not involving illegal surveillance was within the trial court's discretion. In a case involving electronic surveillance without a warrant, the District of Columbia Circuit took a different view, authorizing the surveillance as essential for national security. The D.C. Circuit held that a warrant was constitutionally required for wiretaps involving a domestic organization not linked to a foreign power posing a national security threat. Appellants could recover liquidated damages unless appellees establish a good faith defense. The court emphasized the need for warrants in electronic surveillance for national security, as outlined in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA). The legislation aimed to balance national security interests and civil liberties in response to past abuses of electronic surveillance. Concerns over presidential authority to conduct warrantless surveillance led to the need for statutory safeguards. The Church committee found that warrantless electronic surveillance for national security reasons was frequently conducted illegally or improperly since the 1930s, targeting individuals like a Congressman, journalists, and anti-war groups. The Church committee found that warrantless electronic surveillance for national security reasons was frequently conducted illegally or improperly since the 1930s, targeting individuals like a Congressman, journalists, and anti-war groups. The application of vague and elastic standards for wiretapping and bugging has resulted in improper electronic surveillances that infringed Fourth Amendment rights. The Government's intrusive surveillance has generated vast amounts of unrelated information about American citizens, raising concerns about its use for partisan political purposes. The Senate Judiciary Committee also highlighted the chilling effect of warrantless electronic surveillance on First Amendment rights. The \"chilling effect\" of warrantless electronic surveillance on First Amendment rights is a significant concern. It can inhibit the exercise of political freedom by creating a fear of being targeted, even for those not directly under surveillance. This can undermine public confidence in the ability to dissent from official policy while maintaining privacy expectations. Arbitrary use of surveillance can violate this understanding and hinder an uninhibited political life. The Senate Judiciary Committee recognized the need to curb warrantless electronic surveillance by the Executive Branch while allowing legitimate use for obtaining foreign intelligence. Electronic surveillance provides valuable information for intelligence missions. Title III regulates interception of communications, allowing government surveillance for criminal law enforcement under certain circumstances. Government surveillance for foreign intelligence information is governed by FISA and Title III. The legality of NSA surveillance is analyzed in relation to these statutes. If FISA and Title III cover electronic surveillance, the President's authorization may be subject to judicial review. The legality of NSA surveillance is analyzed in relation to FISA and Title III. FISA may be considered an unconstitutional encroachment on presidential authority if it does not allow for NSA surveillance outside its framework. Title III allows for court-authorized wiretaps for investigating certain crimes. Intercepting electronic communications is generally prohibited unless under specific exceptions. The statute prohibits the intentional interception or disclosure of wire, oral, or electronic communications without consent. Exceptions exist for federal employees and those acting under color of law, including for foreign intelligence acquisition. The statute prohibits interception or disclosure of communications without consent, with exceptions for federal employees conducting electronic surveillance under FISA. Congress clarified that certain sections of the law do not affect the acquisition of foreign intelligence information through means other than electronic surveillance. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 is the exclusive means for electronic surveillance and interception of communications. It is unclear whether communications received within U.S. territory but originating outside the country are considered foreign or domestic. \"International communications\" may refer to those involving multiple nations or crossing national boundaries. The definition of \"foreign communications\" and \"domestic communications\" is clarified in relation to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. The phrase \"utilizing a means other than electronic surveillance [under FISA]\" is open to interpretation in terms of its scope. The legislative history does not support exempting any electronic surveillance involving communications covered by FISA from the procedures required therein, as indicated by the insertion of the modifier in 1986 and the context of the last sentence. The legislative history does not support exempting any electronic surveillance involving communications covered by FISA from the procedures required. The methods authorized in FISA and other statutes are to be the exclusive methods for the federal government to intercept electronic communications. The exclusivity language would require an examination of definitions in Title III and FISA. Congress repealed broader exceptions for national security intercepts when enacting FISA. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) established exclusive procedures for authorizing electronic surveillance within the United States, clarifying that Congress does not recognize inherent Presidential power for such surveillance outside of specified procedures. FISA provides a framework for obtaining approval for electronic surveillance and other investigative methods to acquire foreign intelligence information, excluding NSA operations and overseas surveillance targeting U.S. persons. FISA allows the government to conduct electronic surveillance on foreign powers or their agents with probable cause, different from Title III's criminal investigation standards. Post-9/11, FISA was amended to require a \"significant purpose\" of gathering foreign intelligence information, broadening the scope of permitted investigations. FISA allows electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence gathering, even if the primary purpose is to investigate criminal activity. Congress temporarily removed the requirement to show a non-U.S. person's association with a foreign power. The definition of \"electronic surveillance\" under FISA is crucial in determining its applicability. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) allows electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence gathering, even without the need to show a non-U.S. person's association with a foreign power. The definition of \"electronic surveillance\" under FISA is essential in determining its applicability, including the intentional acquisition of wire or radio communications under specific circumstances requiring a warrant for law enforcement purposes. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) requires a warrant for electronic surveillance in the United States when there is a reasonable expectation of privacy. It covers monitoring to acquire information from non-wire or radio communications, even if one party is overseas. The Act does not intend to cover all electronic surveillance by the National Security Agency involving communications overseas. The interception of various types of communications within the United States is covered under different sections of 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801, including wire, radio, and electronic communications. This includes scenarios where consent is not given, parties are located within the U.S., and when there is no reasonable expectation of privacy. The repeal of the \"national security disclaimer\" in former 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(3) and the addition of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(f) in the conforming amendments in S. 1566 clarified that the legislation does not cover international signals intelligence activities by the NSA or electronic surveillance outside the U.S. Congress declared that the statute, not presidential power, controls electronic surveillance methods falling under the definition in the bill. The Senate Judiciary Committee reserved the option to regulate U.S. electronic surveillance operations not covered by the legislation. The Senate Judiciary Committee reserved the option to regulate U.S. electronic surveillance operations that are not covered by the legislation, specifically addressing the activities of the National Security Agency. The committee acknowledged the need for legislative safeguards but deferred the issue to separate legislation, ensuring that certain electronic surveillance activities targeting international communications for foreign intelligence purposes will not be prohibited during the interim period. Charters and legislation for intelligence agencies and international electronic surveillance are lacking. Three provisions of FISA allow electronic surveillance without a court order in specific situations. 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1802 permits the Attorney General to order surveillance for up to one year for foreign intelligence information. The Attorney General can order surveillance for up to one year for foreign intelligence information, with certain restrictions and reporting requirements to congressional committees. The Attorney General can waive requirements for immediate action, notifying committees of minimization procedures and urgency. Emergency authorization allows surveillance before court order if impossible to obtain due diligence. FISA court receives certifications under seal. Surveillance must terminate when information is obtained without judicial order. The surveillance must terminate when the information sought is obtained, denied, or after 72 hours from authorization. No information obtained may be used as evidence without consent, except in cases of threat with Attorney General approval. Attorney General can conduct surveillance without court order for 15 days following a declaration of war by Congress. The Administration believes the President has the constitutional authority, supplemented by the AUMF, to direct NSA activities, including warrantless electronic surveillance. This interpretation allows the President to conduct activities worldwide, including within the US, related to waging war, such as communications intelligence. The President's authority to conduct warrantless electronic surveillance is analyzed in relation to the AUMF and FISA. Congress intended FISA to be the exclusive mechanism for electronic surveillance, limiting any claim of inherent presidential authority. Previous language recognizing the President's inherent authority was deleted from the legislation. The President's inherent authority to conduct warrantless electronic surveillance was removed from the legislation, and FISA was established as the exclusive mechanism for such surveillance. The House amendments emphasized that procedures in the bill and Title III were the exclusive means for electronic surveillance, while the Senate bill did not include the word \"statutory.\" The House Conference Report ultimately accepted the Senate approach. The conferees accepted the Senate approach regarding the establishment of exclusive means for electronic surveillance under FISA. They acknowledged the possibility of the Supreme Court reaching a different conclusion, as outlined in Justice Jackson's opinion in the Steel Seizure case. The passage of FISA reflects Congress's view of its authority in this matter. The passage of FISA and the inclusion of exclusivity language show Congress's authority to limit the President's use of warrantless electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence. The Senate Judiciary Committee believes Congress can regulate the President's use of inherent constitutional power, even if the President claims authority under Article II of the Constitution. The President has constitutional authority to order warrantless foreign intelligence surveillance within the United States, as confirmed by federal appellate courts. The U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review has appellate review over denials of FISA applications. The U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review, established under FISA, has the highest authority over FISA issues. It has only one published case, which could carry weight in interpreting the President's constitutional authority for warrantless foreign intelligence surveillance. The Court of Review's reference to inherent constitutional authority in this case may be significant. The Court of Review considered the primary purpose test in FISA electronic surveillance, rejecting the Truong approach which focused on gathering foreign intelligence information. Truong's case dealt with pre-FISA surveillance based on the President's constitutional responsibility for foreign affairs. The Truong court held that the President has inherent authority to conduct warrantless searches for foreign intelligence. The question now is whether FISA enhances the President's power by providing a warrant-like mechanism. The Court of Review's reliance on pre-FISA cases to support the constitutionality of FISA searches may be limited by Congress's exercise of authority in foreign affairs and electronic surveillance. The Court of Review's reliance on pre-FISA cases for the President's inherent constitutional authority to authorize warrantless electronic surveillance may undermine its argument. The Court also suggests that FISA procedures closely align with Fourth Amendment standards. The Court of Review upheld the constitutionality of FISA, stating that the surveillances authorized are reasonable and meet Fourth Amendment standards. This decision also implied some level of recognition of presidential inherent constitutional authority. The Court of Review upheld the constitutionality of FISA, recognizing presidential inherent authority over electronic surveillance. The decision provided an exclusive structure for such surveillance, aiming to limit presidential authority within FISA's scope. The Court of Review upheld the constitutionality of FISA, recognizing presidential inherent authority over electronic surveillance within FISA's exclusive structure. Congressional intent was to limit the President's exercise of inherent authority in foreign intelligence surveillance. The President's authority to conduct warrantless electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes outside of the FISA framework is a topic of debate, with differing views on the extent of this power. After the 9/11 attacks, Congress authorized the President to use force against those involved. The President used force against nations, organizations, or persons involved in the 9/11 attacks to prevent future terrorism. This included invading Afghanistan to target Al Qaeda and the Taliban. The Administration believes the AUMF authorizes electronic surveillance, citing the Supreme Court's decision in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld. The Court affirmed the President's power to detain a U.S. citizen as an \"enemy combatant\" under the AUMF, clarifying that detainees have some due process rights. The Administration's position relies on the assumption that electronic surveillance is essential for military force. The government argues that the AUMF implies authority for electronic surveillance as a necessary incident to the use of military force, extending to U.S. territory. This interpretation is supported by the Hamdi decision, but there are reasons to limit its application to actual military operations. The Hamdi decision may be limited to authorizing detention during military operations on the battlefield, based on longstanding law-of-war principles. International law prefers capture over killing civilians or soldiers who are hors de combat. The Hamdi decision authorizes detention during military operations on the battlefield, preferring capture over killing civilians or soldiers who are hors de combat. Justice O'Connor stated that individuals captured in Afghanistan as part of the Taliban, known to support al Qaeda, are targeted under the AUMF. Detention of these individuals for the duration of the conflict is considered a necessary and appropriate use of force authorized by Congress. The Hamdi decision allows for detention of combatants on the battlefield, emphasizing capture over killing. While military intelligence is crucial in warfare, it is unclear if it constitutes the use of force. The Administration lacks authority to claim that signals intelligence is a fundamental part of combat, unlike the capture of combatants. The AUMF authorizes deployment of military intelligence assets in conventional conflicts, but extending this to unconventional aspects could challenge the Hamdi decision, especially if actions are taken within the United States. The Hamdi decision allows for detention of combatants captured on the battlefield, emphasizing capture over killing. Justice Thomas agreed that wartime detention is necessary for intelligence purposes. Justice O'Connor supported detention to prevent combatants from returning to the battlefield but disagreed with indefinite detention for interrogation. The boundaries of authority under the AUMF are unclear, especially regarding statutory prohibitions on national security. Presidential assertions of wartime power have faced challenges without express congressional approval, particularly concerning civil liberties. The AUMF's interpretation without express congressional approval raises concerns about civil liberties. A formal declaration of war may impact the application of laws within the United States. The Alien Enemy Act and Trading with the Enemy Act require a declared war for their activation. The President does not have implied authority to capture enemy property in the US during hostilities without a declared war. FISA includes an exception for 15 days after a congressional war declaration, indicating its applicability even during wartime. Congress amending FISA post-9/11 to enhance counterterrorism efforts reinforces its full applicability. Interpreting the AUMF without congressional approval raises civil liberties concerns. The AUMF authorizes the President to conduct electronic surveillance, even against American citizens, with fewer restrictions than during a declared war. The United States is considered part of the battlefield in the war against terrorism, allowing the use of force anywhere in the world, including within the US, against those involved in terrorist activities. The AUMF authorizes the President to conduct electronic surveillance, even against American citizens, with fewer restrictions than during a declared war. The United States is considered part of the battlefield in the war against terrorism, allowing the use of force anywhere in the world, including within the US, against those involved in terrorist activities. The President has the authority to conduct electronic surveillance in the same way the armed forces gather intelligence about enemy forces, even if no actual combat is taking place. Intelligence efforts aim to identify attacks before they occur, but surveillance of those merely suspected of supporting terrorist organizations may be overly broad. The Administration believes the NSA activity meets FISA requirements. The Administration argues that the surveillance activity meets FISA requirements but is exempt from following procedures due to section 109 of FISA, which allows electronic surveillance authorized by statute. Subsection (a) of section 109 imposes criminal sanctions for unauthorized surveillance, while subsection (b) provides a defense for such actions. The defendant can use a defense in a prosecution under subsection (a) if they were a law enforcement officer conducting authorized electronic surveillance. Federal jurisdiction applies if the offense was committed by a U.S. officer or employee. The language of this section was derived from the House and Senate versions of the measure. The House Conference Committee described criminal penalties for individuals engaging in unauthorized electronic surveillance, disclosing information obtained unlawfully, or using such information. The conference substitute in this act establishes criminal penalties for individuals engaging in unauthorized electronic surveillance or disclosing information obtained unlawfully. Defense is provided for law enforcement officers acting within their official duties. The penalties for intelligence agents are aligned with those for law enforcement officers under title 18. The NSA electronic surveillances are argued to be authorized by the Authorization to Use Military Force (AUMF). The FISA bill criminalizes unauthorized electronic surveillance, aligning penalties for intelligence agents with law enforcement officers under title 18. Section 109(a)(1) of the bill makes it a criminal offense for officers to engage in electronic surveillance without authorization. The FISA bill criminalizes unauthorized electronic surveillance, providing an affirmative defense for law enforcement officers conducting certain technical activities for law enforcement purposes. The bill aims to protect intelligence personnel acting in accordance with the statute and court orders from liability. The legislative history suggests that the phrase \"authorized by statute\" in the FISA bill refers specifically to Title III and FISA itself, rather than having a broader meaning. The Administration's interpretation of the AUMF grants broader authority. The wiretap prohibition in Title III has an exception for FISA surveillance, which the Administration points out is broad. The Administration interprets that the FISA exception is broader than the Title III exception for national security wiretaps, citing specific exceptions in Title III. It suggests that electronic surveillance authorized by FISA or any other statute is exempt from the FISA prohibition. The Administration argues that electronic surveillance authorized by FISA or any other statute is exempt from the FISA prohibition, even if the other authorizing statute does not specifically amend the relevant provision. The FISA \"procedures\" described in Title III can include any procedures authorized by any other statute, making the exclusivity provision potentially meaningless. It is questioned if Congress intended for the exception in FISA to override the specific requirements in Title III. The AUMF and FISA must be construed in harmony to avoid conflicts between FISA and the President's authority as Commander in Chief. The AUMF and FISA must be interpreted in a way that aligns with the President's authority as Commander in Chief, resolving any ambiguity in favor of the President's recognized authority. Principles of statutory construction guide the interpretation of conflicting statutes to avoid constitutional violations. The Court typically avoids reading express statutory language out of a statute, unless declaring it unconstitutional. The Administration's argument suggests that FISA may encroach on presidential powers, especially in the context of post-9/11 exigencies. The President determined the need for an early warning detection system post-9/11. FISA was deemed inadequate for the required speed and agility. Legislative changes would have compromised intelligence capabilities. Consideration of alternative provisions like 50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1802 and 1805(f) for flexibility. The President and Attorney General could review internal DOJ procedures under FISA to introduce more streamlined processes. Legislative changes may be needed if FISA's framework is insufficient. Concerns about public disclosure of intelligence limitations could be addressed through executive session oversight and limited access to classified information. The federal legislative process may be limited by statute or procedures, but is inherently public. Legislation could potentially reveal intelligence practices, but the chosen vehicle and language used may mitigate concerns. There is no legal precedent supporting the President's authority to bypass statutory requirements for secrecy. Determining the permissibility of NSA activities under the Fourth Amendment and statutory scheme requires specific facts and understanding of the President's authorization. The President's authorization for NSA operations is classified, but if they fall under FISA's definition of \"electronic surveillance,\" they should comply with FISA procedures. The AUMF may provide statutory authorization to avoid criminal liability under FISA, but it may not satisfy the more specific language in Title III. The President's authorization for NSA operations, if classified as \"electronic surveillance\" under FISA, should comply with FISA procedures. The AUMF may provide statutory authorization to avoid criminal liability under FISA, but it may not satisfy the more specific language in Title III. Congress has not legislated specifically on electronic surveillance outside FISA or Title III, and it's unclear if such surveillance is authorized by the AUMF. The President's role as Commander in Chief in electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence collection within the US should not exclude Congress's role. Congress has actively regulated electronic surveillance within the United States, demonstrating a willingness to make adjustments as needed. The Administration's interpretation of the AUMF and FISA assumes unconstitutional violation of separation-of-powers principles, deserving deference under Youngstown's first category. The Court of Review acknowledged the President's inherent authority for foreign intelligence surveillance, suggesting that FISA cannot limit this power. Lower courts have also discussed this authority, but no ruling has been made on Congress's authority in this matter. Prior to FISA, no court ruled on Congress's authority to regulate foreign intelligence collection. It is unlikely that Congress authorized NSA surveillance discussed, falling under FISA or Title III. If not permitted by these laws, it may be a presidential power exercise, limiting Congress's action. Courts recognize the President's power for domestic electronic surveillance. The President has the power to conduct domestic electronic surveillance within the United States, but it is uncertain if Congress can set limits on that power. The Administration's legal justification for this surveillance may not be as well-grounded as suggested."
