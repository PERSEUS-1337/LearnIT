    "content": "The \"San Francisco Bay Restoration Act\" is a new law that establishes a grant program for restoring the San Francisco Bay. It amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to include this program. The \"San Francisco Bay Restoration Act\" establishes a grant program for restoring the San Francisco Bay. It defines terms like annual priority list, comprehensive plan, and Estuary Partnership. The Administrator compiles an annual priority list of activities and projects. The annual priority list includes activities, projects, and studies for funding under the San Francisco Bay Restoration Act. It prioritizes restoration projects and habitat improvement for fish, waterfowl, and wildlife that align with the approved comprehensive plan. The list also includes information on financial assistance recipients and communities to be served, along with established criteria and methods. The Administrator consults with relevant stakeholders to develop a priority list for activities, projects, and studies under the San Francisco Bay Restoration Act. Funding may be provided through a grant program. The Administrator may provide funding through cooperative agreements, grants, or other means to State and local agencies, special districts, and public or nonprofit agencies for activities, studies, or projects identified on the annual priority list. The maximum amount of grants provided shall not exceed 75 percent of the total cost of eligible activities, with a non-federal share required for the remaining cost. Funding for activities under this section must be at least 25 percent from non-Federal sources. $5,000,000 is authorized annually for fiscal years 2015 through 2019. Up to 5 percent can be used for administrative expenses. The Estuary Partnership remains eligible for additional funding. No funds from this section can be used for other purposes. No funds from subsection (c) can be used for management conference administration under section 320."
