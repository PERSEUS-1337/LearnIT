The \"Taxpayer Protection Lock-box Act of 1999\" mandates the creation of the 'Taxpayer Protection Lock-box Ledger' by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office. This ledger is divided into entries for each subcommittee of the Committees on Appropriations, with balances for the House, Senate, and Joint House-Senate. Amounts credited to the ledger are only positive, following the engrossment of appropriation bills by the House and Senate. The Director of the Congressional Budget Office creates the 'Taxpayer Protection Lock-box Ledger' for subcommittees of the Committees on Appropriations. The ledger includes House, Senate, and Joint House-Senate balances, with amounts credited after the engrossment of appropriation bills. The Senate Committee on Appropriations amendments are considered part of the original text for calculating reductions in new budget authority. The term 'appropriation bill' includes general, special, supplemental, deficiency, or continuing appropriations. A new item is added to the table of contents in the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. SEC. 3. TALLY DURING HOUSE OR SENATE CONSIDERATION: Members in the House and Senate will have access to a running tally of amendments adopted during consideration of appropriations bills. SEC. 4. DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENT OF 602(A) ALLOCATIONS: Allows for adjustments to allocations and suballocations in appropriations bills. Upon the engrossment of House or Senate amendments to any appropriation bill for a fiscal year, allocations to the Committee on Appropriations of each House shall be adjusted downward by amounts credited to the Joint House-Senate Lock-box Balance. Revised budget authority and outlays levels will be submitted to each House by the chairman of the Committee on the Budget. Suballocations in appropriations bills will also be adjusted accordingly. The Act of 1974 is amended to require downward adjustments in budget allocations when adjustments are made under subsection (a)(5). The revised allocations must be submitted to each House by the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations and printed in the Congressional Record. SEC. 5 amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to include periodic reporting of ledger statements. SEC. 6 involves downward adjustment of discretionary spending limits. The discretionary spending limits for new budget authority and outlays for any fiscal year shall be reduced by amounts set forth in the final regular appropriation bill or joint resolution making continuing appropriations. These reductions are based on the Joint House-Senate Lock-box Balances calculated under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The bill or resolution must include a statement of law indicating the adjusted discretionary spending limit for new budget authority shall be reduced. The discretionary spending limit for new budget authority and outlays will be reduced by specified amounts for the budget year and each outyear. Section 306 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 will be waived for this adjustment, which must be reflected in reports under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The effective date for the specified reductions in discretionary spending limits will be implemented. The provisions of this Act apply to all appropriation bills for fiscal year 1999 onwards. For FY99 appropriation bills engrossed after January 28, 1999, relevant parties must fulfill their duties within 10 days of enactment. The duties of the Director of the Congressional Budget Office and the Committees on the Budget and Appropriations of the House and Senate for FY99 allocation are based on revised section 602(a) allocations as of January 28, 1999. The term \"appropriation bill\" includes general or special bills, supplemental, deficiency, or continuing appropriations through the fiscal year's end. SEC. 8. ADJUSTMENT FOR STIMULATIVE EFFECT OF REVENUE REDUCTIONS. The Director of OMB calculates stimulative effect by determining excess revenues compared to projected levels set forth in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.Projected revenues for fiscal years 1999-2003 are specified. The Director of OMB provides estimates for fiscal years 2003-2009, totaling $2,091,000,000,000 to $2,727,000,000,000. The CBO must certify these estimates by October 20. If disagreements arise, revised estimates are submitted. On November 1, if a fiscal dividend excess exists, the President can direct the Treasury to pay off debt, propose tax cuts, or suggest saving social security. An expedited procedure is in place for Congress to consider these proposals promptly. The President can propose fiscal actions on November 1 if there is a surplus. The Majority Leaders of the Senate and House must introduce the proposal as a bill. If not, any House member can introduce it. The bill is referred to specific committees in each house for consideration. The committee must consider and report the first bill introduced, with amendments not reducing revenues below the President's proposal. If the bill is not reported within 15 days, the committee is discharged, and the bill is placed on the House calendar for floor consideration. After being discharged from further consideration, any Member of the respective House can move to proceed to the bill, with all points of order waived. The motion is privileged, not debatable, and not subject to amendment or postponement. The motion to proceed to the consideration of the bill is privileged, not debatable, and not subject to amendment or postponement. If the motion is agreed to, the bill will remain the unfinished business of the respective House until disposed of. Debate on the bill and all debatable motions shall be limited to 20 hours, divided equally between those favoring and opposing the bill. Additional motions to limit debate, postpone, proceed to other business, or recommit the bill are not in order. The motion to proceed to the consideration of the bill is privileged and not debatable. Debate on amendments is limited to 30 minutes. Amendments cannot reduce revenues below the President's proposal. The vote on final passage occurs after the debate. Appeals from the Chair's decisions on procedure can be made. The rules of the Senate or House regarding a bill described in paragraph (1) are decided without debate. If one House receives a bill from the other House, certain procedures apply, including no referral to a committee and maintaining the same procedure in the receiving House.

If tax reductions or social security reforms are not enacted by December 31 of the year of the submission of a legislative proposal, the President shall pay an amount equal to the revenue reduction to deficit reduction. The term \"stimulative economic effect\" refers to laws that stimulate savings, investment, job creation, and economic growth.
