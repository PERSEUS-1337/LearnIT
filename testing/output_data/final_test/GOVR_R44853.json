The Afghanistan War, now approaching 16 years, began in response to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The United States and NATO took over security in Afghanistan by 2006, with troop deployments increasing under Presidents Bush and Obama. Obama announced plans to train Afghan military and police, increase troop numbers, and begin withdrawing forces by 2011. NATO agreed to hand over security control to Afghanistan in 2010. In November 2010, NATO agreed to transfer security control to Afghan forces by the end of 2014. In December 2014, NATO ended its combat mission in Afghanistan and initiated the \"Resolute Support\" mission to train Afghan security forces. President Obama announced in October 2015 that 9,800 U.S. troops would remain in Afghanistan until the end of 2016. At the NATO Warsaw Summit in July 2016, Obama stated that 8,400 U.S. troops would stay in Afghanistan due to security concerns. NATO also decided to maintain troop levels and funding until 2020. In Afghanistan, coalition troops have three main missions: counterterrorism against al Qaeda, combat against Taliban insurgents (ended in 2014), and training/advising Afghan military and police under the Resolute Support Mission (RSM). U.S. advisors in RSM do not engage in direct combat unless in self-defense. The U.S. provides air support to Afghan security forces and is considering deploying additional ground forces as part of the Resolute Support Mission. General John Nicholson stated a need for more troops to break a stalemate with the Taliban-led insurgency. Recently, 300 U.S. Marines were sent to Helmand Province to assist Afghan forces. The Pentagon is considering expanding the U.S. military role in Afghanistan by deploying 3,000 to 5,000 additional troops and granting more authority to military commanders for airstrikes. This is part of a broader effort to bring the Taliban back to the negotiating table. The initial goals for Afghanistan were to eliminate al Qaeda, overthrow the Taliban, and establish a new government in Kabul. However, the focus shifted to assisting the Afghan government in extending its reach across the country, leading to debates on the objectives of U.S. and international engagement. Successive administrations aimed to synchronize counterterrorism and nation-building missions, but sometimes these efforts conflicted. Maintaining an open-ended military presence or stabilizing the country may not be possible simultaneously. The use of a MOAB in Afghanistan against ISIL-K by General Nicholson has sparked tensions regarding the U.S. military presence and stability in the country. Former President Karzai criticized the attack as a \"weapon of mass destruction\" and an \"immense atrocity against the Afghan people.\" The MOAB attack in Afghanistan by General Nicholson has raised concerns about U.S. military presence and stability in the country. Critics, like former President Karzai, view it as a significant harm to the Afghan people. There are doubts about achieving stability in Afghanistan, with territory controlled by the Afghan government decreasing and other actors possibly supporting Taliban fighters. Military efforts are seen as necessary but not enough for lasting stability in the region. The need for a broader strategy to achieve lasting peace with the Taliban, concerns about the U.S. focus on countering terror threats rather than the Taliban, and the importance of addressing Pakistan's activities that undermine progress in Afghanistan are key challenges in resolving the conflict. Additional U.S. forces may not necessarily help in resolving these issues. Despite uncertainties on how additional U.S. forces will address campaign issues, preventing Afghanistan from descending into chaos is crucial for national security. A vacuum could empower terrorist groups like al Qaeda and the Islamic State to launch attacks. General Nicholson highlighted the need for more troops to enhance training, advising Afghan units, and increasing advisory efforts at brigade level. The Pentagon plans to provide additional troops for advisory efforts across Afghan ministries and at brigade level. General Nicholson suggested NATO partners could also contribute troops. The current request would give military officials more flexibility in how U.S. troops are used, potentially in combat roles. Policymakers seek details on the types of troops needed and their roles, including whether they will be involved in combat operations alongside Afghan security forces. The Pentagon plans to provide additional troops for advisory efforts in Afghanistan. General Nicholson suggested NATO partners could also contribute troops for combat roles. The current request aims to give military officials more flexibility in troop usage, potentially requiring changes to Rules of Engagement. The Pentagon plans to provide additional troops for advisory efforts in Afghanistan, with General Nicholson requesting \"a few thousand more troops\" for training activities. NATO is considering the request, but any additional troops would not participate in direct combat missions. The United States could send anywhere from a few hundred to 5,000 troops, potentially needing to assume a greater burden due to caveats placed by other contributing nations. Policymakers may need to examine how non-U.S. forces will be employed and any associated caveats that could affect the use of U.S. forces. The potential commitment of additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan could impact the availability of forces for other contingencies and affect Army readiness. When troops are deployed for Train, Advise and Assist missions, officers and NCOs are taken from existing units, hindering full training for junior officers, NCOs, and enlisted soldiers. The Army plans to establish six Security Force Assistance Brigades (SFABs) to address the lack of senior leadership in units deployed for Train, Advise, and Assist missions. These SFABs will comprise 500 officers and NCOs each and are expected to be fully established by 2022. The potential addition of 3,000 to 5,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan could impact overall force readiness and availability for other contingencies. The lack of senior leadership in units deployed for Train, Advise, and Assist missions poses a risk to U.S. national security. The evolving military campaign in Afghanistan lacks a clear strategy, raising questions about the key objectives for the United States in the region. The potential addition of several thousand troops in Afghanistan could impact overall force readiness and availability for other contingencies. The potential addition of several thousand troops in Afghanistan raises questions about the impact on the military campaign and the ability to break the stalemate with the Taliban for a political settlement. The lack of clear strategy and U.S. goals for the region make it difficult to evaluate the likely outcome of deploying additional forces."
