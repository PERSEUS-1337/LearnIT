The Justice and Development Party (AKP), with Islamist roots, has won elections but not resolved secular-religious tensions. Today, the Turkish political scene is in turmoil with a lawsuit to ban the AKP. The public prosecutor initiated a lawsuit to ban the ruling AKP party for anti-secular activities, leading to arrests of secularists. This highlights a polarized political climate in Turkey with conflicting narratives and a national rift that remains unhealed. The United States is concerned for stability in Turkey as it is a strategic partner. The United States is concerned for stability in Turkey due to its strategic partnership, NATO ally status, and EU membership candidacy. The Bush Administration is worried about the survival of Turkey's democracy, as it is seen as an inspiration for other Muslim countries. During a recent governmental crisis in Ankara, the Administration maintained a stance of neutrality, urging Turks to find a solution based on democracy and rule of law. The crisis began in 2007 when the AKP-controlled parliament tried to elect Abdullah Gul, with roots in Turkey's Islamist movement, as President. During a governmental crisis in Turkey in 2007, secularists opposed the AKP's attempt to elect Abdullah Gul, with ties to Turkey's Islamist movement, as President. They feared that the AKP's control of the prime ministry and parliament would shift political power towards Islamists. The crisis was resolved through early national elections, which the AKP won with 47% of the vote. Gul was elected president on August 28, 2007, but secularist opponents continued to monitor the government for Islamist influences. In December 2007, President Gul appointed an AKP-allied professor to head the Higher Education Board, causing concern among secularists. Prime Minister Erdogan's support for lifting the ban on wearing headscarves in public institutions further fueled tensions. The parliament passed constitutional amendments to lift the ban on university campuses, but this move was criticized for prioritizing headscarf liberalization over other human rights issues. Erdogan derailed the AKP's process to draft a new constitution by focusing on lifting the headscarf ban instead of building national consensus. This move may have hindered Turkey's path to EU membership and generated backlash from opposition parties. The CHP and DSP filed a lawsuit in the Constitutional Court to overturn new amendments. The Chief Public Prosecutor requested a ban on the AKP and its members for anti-secular activities, including lifting the headscarf ban in universities. The AKP defended the action as expanding freedoms in the country. The Constitutional Court ruled 9-2 on June 5 that parliament's action lifting the ban on headscarves in universities was unconstitutional. The outlook for the AKP's survival was bleak as 8 out of 11 judges on the Court were appointed by a staunch secularist. If the Court banned the AKP, Turkey might enter a period of political uncertainty. Observers feared Turkey might face political instability or uncertainty as the AKP, led by Prime Minister Erdogan, faced challenges. Some analysts believed the AKP may have peaked in 2007 and could struggle to increase its support. Erdogan's failure to fulfill promises, such as governing for all Turks and addressing key issues, may have alienated some voters. Despite this, the AKP portrayed itself as a victim of a \"judicial coup,\" gaining sympathy and potential support. The AKP portrayed itself as a victim of a \"judicial coup,\" gaining sympathy and winning a majority in parliament. The AKP benefits from the ineffectiveness of the main opposition parties, CHP and MHP. CHP, under Deniz Baykal's leadership, opposes government proposals without offering alternatives and may have lost its social democratic moorings. MHP leader Devlet Bahceli supported lifting the headscarf ban and opposed banning the AKP. The AKP narrowly escaped a ban by the Constitutional Court, with six judges voting for the ban but falling short of the required super-majority. Despite ten judges finding the party guilty of anti-secular activities, the Court imposed a penalty of forfeiting half of its financial assistance, which is not a significant hardship for the party. No AKP officials were banned from holding political office. The Constitutional Court narrowly avoided banning the AKP, instead imposing a penalty of forfeiting half of its financial assistance. No AKP officials were banned, and the Court's decision was seen as a serious warning to the party. The ruling was based on the constitution, and some analysts believe the Court placed the AKP on probation due to the lack of a viable alternative government. A ban on the AKP could have led to political instability, damaging the economy and Turkey's relations with the EU and other allies. The AKP received a severe warning from the Constitutional Court, with leaders refraining from protests to avoid escalating tensions. Prime Minister Erdogan acknowledged mistakes before the ruling but denied anti-secular activities afterward. AKP officials reaffirmed commitment to reforms and EU membership post-judgement. President Gul emphasized self-criticism and empathy in addressing errors. President Gul rejected 9 out of 21 nominees for university rector posts, reportedly due to their opposition on the head scarf issue. Observers feel he failed to understand the opposition's perspective. Calls for a new democratic constitution are growing among AKP supporters. The government is working on a new democratic constitution and making changes to prevent future bans on political parties. They plan to revise election laws to allow for broader representation in parliament. The AKP is expected to focus on this agenda after the upcoming elections. In June 2007, police seized explosives in Istanbul, leading to the arrest of ultranationalists and secularists in January 2008. In January 2008, arrests were made of prominent ultranationalists and secularists, including retired military officers, politicians, businessmen, and journalists. Two retired four-star generals were also taken into custody in July. The indictment proposed in July 2008 requested charges against 86 individuals for being members of an armed terrorist organization. The indictment in July 2008 charged 86 individuals with various crimes, including being members of an armed terrorist organization, attempting to overthrow the government, inciting armed insurgency, and involvement in specific attacks. The case, related to the Ergenekon organization, is set to begin on October 20, 2008, with additional indictments expected. Arrests of individuals linked to Ergenekon are ongoing. The Ergenekon organization, referred to as a criminal group, is not connected to the armed forces or the National Intelligence Organization in Turkey. The AKP government, known as their \"enemy,\" is believed to be using the Ergenekon prosecutions to intimidate opponents. Media outlets supportive of the AKP have leaked evidence related to Ergenekon, obtained through extensive police wiretapping. The media outlets are accused of engaging in a disinformation campaign to boost the AKP's fortunes by leaking evidence related to Ergenekon. CHP Chairman Deniz Baykal believes the charges are fictitious and a political revenge process. Gen. Tolon denies involvement in Ergenekon and claims to be a scapegoat. Prime Minister Erdogan suggests the closure case against the AKP was a response to their pursuit of Ergenekon. The AKP was a response to the government's pursuit of Ergenekon. The case is seen as a test of Turkey's democracy and rule of law, confronting the \"deep state\" - a network of military, bureaucracy, and elite who oppose modernizing reforms. The network feels threatened by the AKP's rise. The prolonged detention and harsh treatment of those involved in the Ergenekon affair may undermine hopes for reinforcing Turkey's democracy and EU pathway. The Turkish military, historically intervening in politics, remained quiet during the crisis, possibly due to a failed attempt to prevent President Gul's election. This incident led to early national elections and an AKP victory. The military's role in the effort to eliminate the AKP was overshadowed by the party's survival in a judicial test. Military commanders reaffirmed their dedication to secularism during a change of command ceremony, with General Isik Kosaner emphasizing the protection of the republic's fundamental characteristics. General Ilker Basbug also conveyed a similar message, albeit more subtly. Staff General Ilker Basbug confirmed the Turkish Armed Forces' commitment to safeguarding the Republic of Turkey's underlying philosophy, particularly the principle of secularism. He emphasized the importance of addressing concerns about the growing influence of religious ideas on the country's cultural identity for social peace. The General Staff is cooperating with the police in the Ergenekon investigation. The U.S. policy towards Turkey is influenced by the strategic partnership between the two countries. The Bush Administration values Turkey as a strategic partner and NATO ally, as well as a predominantly Muslim secular democracy. They support Turkey's democracy and political stability, hoping for resolution within Turkey's democratic context and secular principles. The Bush Administration emphasizes the importance of resolving political and religious issues within Turkish law and Constitution. Despite the emphasis on democracy in Turkey, the Administration's approach is not well-received by various groups in the country. The AKP's advocates seek a stronger stance against the possible banning of their party, especially after winning a recent election. The EU's threat to suspend membership talks with Turkey if the AKP were banned is seen as a democratic stance by some, while others believe the EU had to take a stronger stand due to Turkey's candidacy. Secularists suspect the Bush Administration supports the AKP as a model for Muslim democracies and are wary of any positive comments from U.S. officials about the party."
