    "content": "The \"Code Talkers Recognition Act\" aims to honor Native American Code Talkers for their crucial communication efforts during World War I and II, which saved lives and helped end the wars sooner. The Sioux Code Talkers used their native languages as code during World War II, providing vital information that saved many American lives. Military commanders credit them with being instrumental to the success of the United States in battles. Congress aims to honor them with the Congressional Gold Medal. The Sioux Code Talkers, including Eddie Eagle Boy and Simon Brokenleg, will be honored with a Congressional Gold Medal. Additionally, the Comanche Code Talkers will also be recognized. The Congress declared war after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The United States military sought a new code after Axis powers deciphered their messages. The Comanche Nation was asked to recruit men for a secret code based on their language. The Comanches, who were second-class citizens, became Code Talkers in the 4th Signal Division. The Comanches of the 4th Signal Division, known as the \"Comanche Code Talkers,\" developed an unbreakable military code using their language during World War II. Their efforts were instrumental in the Allied war effort in Europe and contributed to the victory in the war. The United States Congress should honor the remaining Comanche Code Talker for their valor and service during World War II. Congressional gold medals are a recognition of their unique and successful communication operation that saved lives and helped end the war in Europe. The Speaker of the House and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate will arrange for the presentation of gold medals to the Comanche Code Talkers of World War II in recognition of their contributions. This includes individuals such as Charles Chibitty, Haddon Codynah, and others. During World War I, members of the Choctaw Nation, despite not being recognized as US citizens, enlisted in the Armed Forces and joined the American Expeditionary Force in France in 1917. During World War I, members of the Choctaw Nation were part of a company of Indian enlistees in the 142d Infantry Company of the 36th Division. German forces had deciphered Allied codes, causing significant losses. An American commander utilized Choctaw speakers to communicate secretly, despite the government's discouragement of using native languages. During World War I, Choctaw soldiers were recruited to transmit field telephone communications in a campaign. The Germans couldn't understand the transmissions due to the unique Choctaw language. The soldiers were strategically placed for effective communication, aiding American soldiers in various operations. During World War I, Choctaw soldiers transmitted information in their native language to protect gun emplacements and assist in the assault on German positions. The use of Choctaw language saved men and munitions, with the Germans unable to break the code. This was the first time in modern warfare that a native American language was used to confuse the enemy. The Choctaw Nation's commitment to defending the nation is exemplified by the actions of its members, including the 18 Choctaw Code Talkers honored with a memorial in Durant, Oklahoma. The Congress will present a gold medal to honor the Choctaw Code Talkers. Additionally, there will be medals for other code talkers as well. The Speaker of the House and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate will arrange for the presentation of a gold medal to any Native American Code Talker identified by the Secretary of Defense who has not previously received one. Eligibility for the medal includes any Native American member of the US Armed Forces who served as a Code Talker in a foreign conflict during the 20th Century. Eligibility for a gold medal will be determined by the Secretary of Defense for Native American Code Talkers who served in a foreign conflict during the 20th Century. The Secretary will establish a list of eligible individuals within 120 days of the enactment of the Act. SEC. 402. PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL MEDALS UNDER THIS ACT. Medals authorized by this Act may be awarded posthumously to Native American Code Talkers, with suitable designs emblematic of tribal affiliation determined by the Secretary of the Treasury. The term \"Indian tribe\" is defined as in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. The Secretary of the Treasury can produce and sell bronze duplicates of gold medals under this Act. The medals are considered national medals. Funding for the medals will come from the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund. The House of Representatives passed the Act on June 18, 2002."
