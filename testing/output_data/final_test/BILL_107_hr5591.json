This includes simplifying notices and streamlining requirements to lessen non-instructional time for teachers. The Secretary of Education is mandated to develop simplified model documents for IEPs, procedural safeguards notices, and prior written notice reporting requirements under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Training and technical assistance on these models will be provided to educational agencies and parent training centers. Additionally, a provision for 3-year individualized education programs is included. A State receiving funds under part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act may allow local educational agencies to develop a 3-year IEP for a child with a disability, with goals at natural transition points and tied to general education curriculum standards. The IEP can be reviewed and revised at these transition points instead of annually.

Additionally, parents should be regularly informed of their child's progress towards meeting the goals of the IEP. The IEP Team may develop a 3-year IEP for a child with disabilities, focusing on natural transition points and tied to general education standards. If the child is making sufficient progress towards meeting the goals, a comprehensive annual review may not be required, and instead, a streamlined annual IEP review process can be conducted in intervening years. If the child is not making sufficient progress towards attaining measurable annual goals in the IEP by the end of the school year, an IEP review meeting will be held to consider necessary additions or modifications to special education services. SEC. 5. PAPERWORK REDUCTION DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM. The Secretary can grant waivers of paperwork requirements under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act for up to 4 years to 10 States to reduce paperwork burden and non-instructional time. The Secretary must report on the effectiveness of these waivers in reducing paperwork burden on teachers and non-instructional time spent on compliance.

The text discusses the use of alternative means for participating in IEP Team meetings, the review and revision of IEPs, and clarifies that additional information is not required in a child's IEP beyond what is explicitly stated. The Procedural Safeguards Notice under Section 615(d)(1) of the Act is amended to include requirements for providing notice at specific times: when services are initially provided, upon registration of a complaint, and upon request by a parent.
