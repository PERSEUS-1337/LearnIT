    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Act of 2015\". It includes findings related to hearing detection and intervention. Congress finds that deaf and hard-of-hearing newborns, infants, toddlers, and young children require specialized early intervention programs to support their linguistic and cognitive development. Families benefit from comprehensive early intervention programs that assist in their child's overall development. Best practices for early intervention include areas such as language acquisition, family support, and progress monitoring. Effective hearing screening and early intervention programs are essential for identifying hearing levels in deaf and hard-of-hearing newborns, infants, toddlers, and young children to ensure timely access to appropriate intervention programs. SEC. 3. REAUTHORIZATION OF PROGRAM FOR EARLY DETECTION, DIAGNOSIS, AND TREATMENT REGARDING DEAF AND HARD-OF-HEARING NEWBORNS, INFANTS, AND YOUNG CHILDREN. Section 399M of the Public Health Service Act is amended to focus on early detection, diagnosis, and treatment for deaf and hard-of-hearing newborns, infants, and young children. The Secretary will make awards of grants to develop statewide programs for hearing screening, diagnosis, and intervention for newborns, infants, and young children. This includes monitoring program efficacy and providing appropriate interventions for children confirmed to be deaf or hard-of-hearing. Children confirmed to be deaf or hard-of-hearing receive early intervention services from various organizations, including schools, agencies, pediatric medical homes, and programs mandated by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Parents are provided with accurate and evidence-based information to make important decisions for their child. \"Programs and systems must provide timely decisions on assistive hearing technologies and communication options for children. Mechanisms for family support and efficient models for follow-up care for newborns and young children identified through hearing screening are essential.\" The legislation aims to support pediatric medical homes and establish a technical resource center for early hearing detection and intervention programs. Additionally, grants will be provided for data management and research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The legislation supports the development and maintenance of data tracking systems for newborn, infant, and young childhood hearing screenings, research on services and outcomes, technical assistance, monitoring programs, and coordinating standardized procedures for data management. The legislation aims to provide technical assistance on data collection, study the costs and effectiveness of hearing screening programs, collect data for research and policy development, and identify causes of congenital hearing loss. The legislation aims to study the effectiveness of hearing screening programs, audiologic evaluations, medical evaluations, and intervention programs for children with congenital hearing loss. It also promotes data integration and information exchange between clinical care and public health. The National Institutes of Health will continue a program for early hearing detection and intervention, including research on technologies, screening methods, and intervention efficacy. Collaboration between federal, state, and local agencies is required for program implementation. State and local agencies, consumer groups serving individuals who are deaf and hard-of-hearing, and national medical organizations are involved in programs related to early intervention services for individuals with disabilities. The curr_chunk discusses the involvement of various stakeholders in policy development related to deaf and hard-of-hearing children, including national medical organizations, individuals who are deaf and hard-of-hearing, professional personnel, third-party payers, and commercial industries. This is in line with the broader context of state and local agencies, consumer groups, and national medical organizations being involved in early intervention services for individuals with disabilities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, and other stakeholders collaborate on policy recommendations for newborn and young childhood hearing programs at federal and state levels. The Health Resources and Services Administration assists states in establishing early detection and intervention programs. The section outlines the establishment of hearing screening programs for newborns, infants, and young children, as well as the development of a data collection system. It also clarifies that state laws regarding hearing screening do not preempt religious beliefs. Definitions for audiologic evaluation are provided. The curr_chunk discusses the purpose of audiologic evaluation, which includes assessing the auditory system, determining the type and degree of hearing loss, and identifying treatment options and referrals. This information is essential for addressing communication challenges related to hearing loss. The curr_chunk discusses early intervention for children who are deaf or hard of hearing, including providing appropriate services and comprehensive support for the family. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to medical evaluation and intervention for hearing loss in children. The curr_chunk discusses the authorization of appropriations for statewide newborn, infant, and young childhood hearing screening programs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are authorized to receive $10,800,000 annually from 2016 to 2020 for technical assistance, data management, and research related to newborn hearing screening programs. No additional funds are authorized for this purpose, and existing funds will be used instead."
