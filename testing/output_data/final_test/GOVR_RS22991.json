    "content": "Under House rules, speaking opportunities on the House floor are limited and structured. Legislators must adhere to time limits and focus their comments on the legislation at hand. Decorum and courtesy are expected, with Members addressing each other in the third person and the presiding officer as \"Mr./Madam Speaker\" or \"Mr./Madam Chairman.\" Directly addressing the television audience or galleries is not allowed. Time in the House is carefully managed and distributed. Time in the House is carefully managed and distributed, with speaking opportunities limited and structured. Debate time is either controlled by managers or gained by seeking recognition from the chair, usually limited to five minutes per Member. Most of the time, debate is equally divided and controlled by two managers. The House passes bills through the suspension of the rules procedure, allowing for 40 minutes of debate. Managers control the debate time, yielding portions to Members. Special rules debate is controlled by the Rules Committee chair and ranking member. When the House resolves into the Committee of the Whole, there is a period for general debate. During the Committee of the Whole consideration of a bill, managers control the debate time by yielding portions to Members who wish to speak. The process involves managers yielding time to themselves and others, with each manager holding the floor until their available time expires or they reserve the balance of their time. During the Committee of the Whole consideration of a bill, managers control debate time by yielding portions to Members who wish to speak. Managers designate Members by state and may not take back yielded time. The presiding officer announces when time has expired, and managers can reserve time for other Members to speak. Time is alternately recognized between managers from each side. During the Committee of the Whole consideration of a bill, managers control debate time by yielding portions to Members who wish to speak. Time is kept by clerks at the House dais, and managers often ask how much time remains available. The presiding officer announces the time remaining for majority and minority floor managers. Managers discuss how to distribute remaining time, with the proponent usually having the right to close the debate. Exceptions include controlled debate on an amendment, where the majority floor manager on the bill has the right to close. During the Committee of the Whole consideration of a bill, managers control debate time by yielding portions to Members who wish to speak. The floor manager with the right to close will reserve their time until all other time has been consumed or yielded back. Debate ends when all time has expired or been yielded back. Members contact the floor manager in advance to gain information on when they might be recognized to speak. Members can gain information about when they might be recognized to speak and for how long during the Committee of the Whole consideration of a bill. The floor manager yields time to the Member upon request, and the Presiding Officer formally recognizes the Member to speak. The Member can continue speaking by requesting additional time from the floor manager if needed. When a manager yields time to a Member, the presiding officer recognizes that Member for a specified amount of time. Only managers can yield time to other Members, while any Member recognized in debate can \"yield to\" another Member for a question or comment. The yielding Member retains the floor and any time consumed by the Member yielded to is charged against the original time yielded by the manager. Members ask permission to use another Member's time to avoid interruptions during debate. When a Member yields time to another Member, they can engage in a colloquy or debate. The yielding Member retains the floor and can take back the time yielded. Permission is needed to interrupt and join the discussion between the yielding Member and the Member yielded to. When a Member yields time to another Member, they can engage in a colloquy or debate. The yielding Member retains the floor and can reclaim the time yielded by interrupting with \"Reclaiming my time.\" If another Member asks to yield during the allotted time, the time used is deducted from the original allocation. Representative B can reclaim their time during debates, especially in procedural circumstances where time is not controlled by floor managers. Members can seek recognition directly from the presiding officer to speak. The \"five minute rule\" allows for debating amendments in the Committee of the Whole. Certain special rules like open rules or modified open rules permit amendments under the five-minute rule. Time is also not controlled during the five minutes of debate on a motion to recommit a bill. House Rule XVIII, clause 5(a) outlines the rules for Members speaking during debates. House Rule XVIII, clause 5(a) allows Members to speak for five minutes to explain an amendment, followed by another Member speaking in opposition. Time is not controlled, and any Member can seek recognition to speak for five minutes in the Committee of the Whole. The House Rule XVIII, clause 5(a) allows Members to speak for five minutes to explain an amendment in the Committee of the Whole. Members can seek recognition in order of seniority, alternating from side to side. The 5-minute rule technically allows only 10 minutes of debate for each amendment, but Members can secure additional time through pro forma amendments. These amendments are offered solely to gain recognition to speak for five minutes. Pro forma amendments are offered solely for gaining recognition to speak for five minutes, allowing Members to continue debate on pending substantive amendments. Members can also move to strike the last word or the requisite number of words for discussion on the measure itself. Pro forma amendments are not always in order, especially when a measure is being considered under a special rule that limits or prohibits amendments. Special rules can restrict the total number of pro forma amendments and specify that only floor managers can offer them. Unanimous consent agreements may also limit pro forma amendments. Members cannot yield portions of their time to others but can yield for questions or comments. Members recognized under the five-minute rule cannot yield to offer an amendment. Members can offer amendments by seeking recognition from the presiding officer, even if pro forma amendments are restricted under special rules or unanimous consent agreements."
