    "content": "The ACLU urged the DOJ and BOP to release federal prisoners at risk of COVID-19 and reduce overcrowding by utilizing compassionate release and home confinement. Members of Congress also called for reducing the incarcerated population to prevent exposure. The BOP is taking steps to reduce the incarcerated population and guard against COVID-19 exposure. Legislation has been introduced for prisoner release during national emergencies. BOP data shows widespread COVID-19 cases in federal prisons, with 566 prisoners and 342 staff testing positive. 24 prisoners have died. The COVID-19 action plan focuses on restricting prison access and movement. The Attorney General issued memoranda on DOJ's response to the pandemic. The report discusses DOJ's response to COVID-19 in federal prisons, focusing on releasing prisoners at risk. It outlines BOP's action plan and current authorities for potential prisoner release. The report discusses the Attorney General's directives on DOJ's response to COVID-19, including legislation that may change certain authorities. USMS is responsible for detaining federal arrestees without pre-trial release in BOP or other facilities. The US Marshals Service (USMS) is responsible for detaining federal arrestees in facilities such as Metropolitan Detention Centers, Metropolitan Correctional Centers, or Federal Detention Centers. These facilities are located in metropolitan areas and can hold prisoners of any security designation. USMS relies on state and local jails as well as Bureau of Prisons detention facilities for medical care. Prisoners in USMS custody are subject to the COVID-19 prevention plans implemented by the facility they are housed in. The US Marshals Service (USMS) is responsible for detaining federal arrestees in facilities like Metropolitan Detention Centers, Metropolitan Correctional Centers, or Federal Detention Centers. USMS prisoners are subject to the COVID-19 prevention plans of the facility they are housed in. When a defendant is convicted of a federal offense, USMS transfers the prisoner to the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) for confinement based on factors like security level and program needs. BOP is responsible for the prisoner until the completion of their sentence. The Vera Institute of Justice warns that COVID-19 could easily enter prisons through staff or visitors, posing a significant risk of spread within the closed environment. The prison environment can facilitate the spread of COVID-19 due to close living quarters, shared ventilation systems, and limited access to hygiene products. Concerns also arise about access to medical care if prison staff are affected by the disease. Prisons face challenges in handling potential COVID-19 infections due to limited medical resources and overcrowding. Despite experience in preventing communicable diseases, concerns remain about the capacity to provide care and transport critically ill prisoners. As of April 16, 2020, the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) oversees approximately 172,300 prisoners across various facilities, operating at 12% over capacity in FY2019. In FY2019, the federal prison system operated at 12% over capacity. USMS received around 248,900 prisoners with an average daily population of 61,500. Approximately 6% of prisoners under BOP's jurisdiction were aged 61 or older. The average age of offenders in BOP-managed facilities is 41 years, with 45% having multiple chronic conditions. The BOP's COVID-19 action plan, implemented in March 2020, includes restrictions on prisoner movement between facilities and placing all prisoners on lockdown starting April 1, 2020. Therapeutic interventions may lead to serious complications, but BOP will transfer prisoners if necessary to manage the population. The BOP's action plan, initially set to expire on April 12, 2020, has been extended until May 18, 2020. Measures include suspending social visits and attorney visits, allowing increased telephone time for prisoners, and limiting prisoner movement between facilities except for specific reasons. The BOP has extended its action plan until May 18, 2020, which includes suspending social and attorney visits, increasing telephone time for prisoners, and limiting prisoner movement between facilities. Additionally, BOP is screening prisoners for COVID-19 symptoms before transfers, suspending official staff travel, tours, and staff training. BOP is limiting contractor and volunteer access to prisons, allowing only essential services like medical care and religious services. Advanced health screenings are being implemented for employees in areas with high community transmission of COVID-19. BOP is implementing advanced health screening procedures for individuals granted access to prisons in areas with sustained community transmission of COVID-19. This includes self-reporting possible exposure and temperature checks. New arrivals are screened for COVID-19 risk factors, asymptomatic prisoners with exposure risk factors are quarantined, and symptomatic prisoners are isolated and tested. BOP is also making operational modifications to mitigate the spread of the disease in its facilities. The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is implementing operational modifications to allow for social distancing and limit group gatherings in its facilities. The US Marshals Service (USMS) does not have a specific COVID-19 prevention plan but will cover the cost of transporting prisoners to medical facilities if needed. The Department of Justice (DOJ) lacks the authority to grant early release for the purpose of mitigating disease transmission. Authorities may provide avenues for federal prisoners to be released in response to COVID-19. This includes federal courts reopening pretrial detention hearings, temporary release of prisoners, early release before completing sentences, and placement in the community to serve the final portion of sentences. The President can grant clemency for federal offenses, such as commuting a sentence to time served. 18 U.S.C. Section 3142 governs release of persons charged with federal offenses. The statute 18 U.S.C. Section 3142 governs the circumstances for federal criminal defendants to be released or incarcerated pending trial. It prefers release on personal recognizance or unsecured appearance bond, but detention may be ordered if the judge determines it necessary for ensuring appearance and safety. Despite the preference for release, many federal defendants end up incarcerated. Two provisions of Section 3142 allow for court-ordered release from pretrial detention. A detention hearing can be reopened if new information is found relevant to the defendant's appearance and safety. Temporary release can also be granted for defense preparation or other compelling reasons. Federal courts have addressed requests for release. Multiple federal courts have addressed requests for release under Section 3142 in light of COVID-19 concerns, considering factors like the defendant's pretrial detention grounds, COVID-19 concerns, proposed release plan, and potential risks to others. Responses have been mixed, with one case in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York supporting a defendant's release with home incarceration and electronic monitoring due to the unprecedented nature of the pandemic. The court reconsidered the defendant's detention due to the dangerousness of COVID-19 and new information, leading to a decision for conditional release. The impact of the pandemic on the defendant's defense preparation was seen as a compelling reason for temporary release. Other federal courts have varied responses to COVID-19 related release requests under Section 3142. The court rejected arguments for release under Section 3142 due to COVID-19, citing well-managed medical conditions and facility precautions. Another district court in Maryland acknowledged the health risk but did not grant release under Section 3142. The court ruled that a defendant with a criminal history should be detained despite health conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes, as precautionary measures were in place at the detention center to protect against COVID-19. Despite many federal defendants seeking release under Section 3142, it is a limited avenue due to the individualized nature of the inquiry. Limited avenue for the release of federal prisoners in response to COVID-19 under 18 U.S.C. Section 3582(c)(1)(A) based on extraordinary and compelling reasons or age and sentence criteria. Petition for compassionate release can be filed by BOP or the prisoner after exhausting administrative rights. Under Section 3582(c)(1)(A), sentence reductions must align with U.S. Sentencing Commission policy statements. \"Extraordinary and compelling reasons\" for reduction include terminal illness or serious medical conditions that significantly impair the prisoner's health. A specific life expectancy prognosis is not necessary. The criteria for compassionate release from BOP custody include serious deterioration in physical or mental health due to aging, serving at least 10 years or 75% of the term, caregiver's death or incapacitation, spouse's incapacitation, and other extraordinary reasons. BOP cannot unilaterally release elderly or terminally ill offenders under this authority. The BOP cannot release elderly or terminally ill offenders unilaterally; a federal court must approve a petition for compassionate release based on specific factors. Only prisoners aged 70 or older can be released without compelling circumstances. Those under 70 can be released for health reasons if seriously ill. Prisoners must exhaust administrative rights or wait 30 days before seeking release from a federal court, with some courts debating waiver during the COVID-19 pandemic. The exhaustion requirement for seeking compassionate release during the COVID-19 pandemic is debated among federal courts. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit sees it as unwaivable, while other courts believe they have the discretion to waive it. Even if the exhaustion requirement is not an obstacle, courts may still not consider releasing individuals with underlying medical conditions. Multiple federal courts have rejected requests for release under Section 3582 in light of COVID-19 transmission risk, despite arguments from prisoners with underlying medical conditions such as hypertension, heart disease, lung disease, or diabetes. One prisoner's request for home confinement due to health risks was denied, with the court siding with the government's argument that the Bureau of Prisons had an extensive action plan in place to address the pandemic. The court sided with the government, stating that the prisoner's motion did not meet the requirements for modifying a sentence for extraordinary and compelling reasons related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite changing public health recommendations, the court could not assume that the Bureau of Prisons would be unable to manage an outbreak at the prisoner's facility. Other courts have granted compassionate release for prisoners with compromised immune systems due to the pandemic. The court did not grant compassionate release to a prisoner with a compromised immune system due to COVID-19, despite changing public health recommendations. If granted compassionate release, the prisoner may still be subject to probation or supervised release. There are concerns about the resources of U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services Offices to handle an influx of probationers. Under 34 U.S.C. Section 60541(g), BOP can place eligible elderly and terminally ill prisoners on home confinement. Eligible elderly prisoners must be at least 60 years old, have non-violent convictions, served two-thirds of their sentence, and meet other criteria for release. The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) can place eligible elderly and terminally ill prisoners on home confinement under certain criteria. Terminally ill prisoners eligible for early release must meet similar criteria as elderly prisoners, but can be of any age and have served any portion of their sentences. BOP can place prisoners on home confinement without court approval under this authority. Additionally, BOP can place a prisoner in a Residential Reentry Center for up to 12 months at the end of their sentence, or on home confinement for a period equal to 10% of their sentence or six months, whichever is shorter. The CARES Act grants considerable discretion to the BOP Director in determining placement in an RRC or home confinement. The Act allows for an extension of home confinement during the covered emergency period related to COVID-19. The Attorney General authorized expanded use of home confinement under the CARES Act, allowing for commutation of sentences for federal prisoners through executive clemency. Prisoners can submit petitions for commutations through the DOJ's Office of the Pardon Attorney, with regulations stating they should not do so if other relief options are available unless there are \"exceptional circumstances.\" The Pardon Attorney investigates petitions for clemency, gathering reports from federal agencies like the FBI. The Attorney General then reviews the recommendation and decides whether to grant clemency, considering factors like disparity in sentencing or assistance in government investigations. The President has the authority to grant commutations to federal prisoners without following the DOJ's regulations. Some are calling for commutations for vulnerable populations due to COVID-19. Attorney General William Barr has issued memoranda on DOJ's response to the pandemic. Attorney General William Barr issued memoranda to BOP and all components of DOJ, providing guidance on using home confinement authorities to reduce COVID-19 spread in federal prisons and when to seek pretrial detention for federal defendants. Barr directed BOP to prioritize home confinement for at-risk inmates during the pandemic. The Attorney General directed the Bureau of Prisons to prioritize home confinement for at-risk inmates during the pandemic, considering factors like age, vulnerability to COVID-19, security level of the facility, and conduct in prison. Prisoners being considered for home confinement must have a low risk assessment score, a re-entry plan, and a crime of conviction that does not pose a significant risk to public safety. Sex offenders are ineligible for home confinement, and serious offenses weigh against placement on home confinement. Prisoners considered for home confinement must meet CDC guidelines for severe COVID-19 risk factors and facility risks. BOP must not increase their COVID-19 risk and quarantine them for 14 days before transfer. The Attorney General directs BOP to review high-risk prisoners for possible home confinement under the CARES Act. The memorandum instructs the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to prioritize prisoners at specific facilities affected by COVID-19 for home confinement. BOP is to process suitable candidates immediately, with a 14-day in-prison quarantine before placement. There is also the option for case-by-case home confinement without prior prison quarantine, but with a 14-day home quarantine. The Attorney General cautions against potential spread of COVID-19 and directs BOP to follow outlined criteria for prisoner release decisions. The Attorney General authorizes the Bureau of Prisons to prioritize prisoners at facilities affected by COVID-19 for home confinement, even without electronic monitoring, if deemed appropriate for public safety. Despite resource limitations, BOP is instructed to follow criteria for prisoner release decisions to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The Attorney General directs the Bureau of Prisons to prioritize home confinement for federal prisoners affected by COVID-19, emphasizing the need for individualized determinations. Additionally, guidance has been issued on seeking pretrial detention for defendants under the Bail Reform Act. The Attorney General encourages prosecutors to seek pretrial detention for defendants posing a risk to public safety or flight risk under the Bail Reform Act. Considerations include the defendant's physical and mental condition, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Prosecutors are advised to not seek pretrial detention as extensively as usual, particularly for defendants who have not committed serious crimes. The memorandum directs prosecutors to consider defendants' risk of spreading COVID-19 in the community when litigating motions for pretrial detention. Legislation has been passed in response to the pandemic, modifying release to home confinement under 18 U.S.C. Section 3624(c)(2), with a bill introduced to further facilitate the release of federal prisoners during a national emergency. Legislation introduced (S. 3579 and H.R. 6400) aims to release certain federal prisoners, such as pregnant individuals, those over 50, with medical conditions, or with less than 12 months left to serve, to community supervision during a national emergency related to a communicable disease. Directors of BOP and USMS must prioritize placements that allow for social distancing, with home confinement as an option. S. 3579 and H.R. 6400 would enhance authorities for releasing federal prisoners in response to COVID-19 by allowing some pretrial detainees to be immediately released to community supervision without the need for individual petitions. Those previously detained as flight risks may also qualify for relief under the bills. The bills S. 3579 and H.R. 6400 provide relief for federal prisoners during COVID-19 by allowing release to community confinement. Detainees who do not pose a risk of violence may qualify for release, including those over 50, with health conditions, or close to release unless exceptions apply."
