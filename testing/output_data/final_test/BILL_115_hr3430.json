    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Sharing Automated Vehicle Records with Everyone for Safety Act\" or the \"SHARES Act.\" It establishes the Highly Automated Vehicle Information Sharing Advisory Council. The Act establishes the Highly Automated Vehicle Information Sharing Advisory Council within the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The Council will have diverse members representing various sectors and will serve for a term of three years. The Highly Automated Vehicle Information Sharing Advisory Council, established within the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, will have members appointed by the Secretary of Transportation for a three-year term. Vacancies will be filled in the same manner as the original appointment, and the Council's duties include information gathering, developing technical advice, and presenting best practices to the Secretary regarding sharing relevant information on testing or deployment events of highly automated vehicles. The Highly Automated Vehicle Information Sharing Advisory Council will report recommendations to Congress and operate in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The Secretary of Transportation will provide technical assistance and may detail Department of Transportation personnel to assist the Council upon request. The Highly Automated Vehicle Information Sharing Advisory Council will receive technical assistance from the Department of Transportation personnel without affecting their civil service status. Council members will not receive pay except for travel and per diem expenses for meetings. The Council will terminate six years after the enactment of the Act. Definitions include \"automated driving system\" as hardware and software capable of performing driving tasks and \"dynamic driving task\" as all driving activities. The term \"dynamic driving task\" refers to real-time vehicle operation functions in on-road traffic, including steering, acceleration, monitoring the environment, response execution, and maneuver planning. The term \"highly automated vehicle\" refers to a motor vehicle equipped with an automated driving system, excluding commercial motor vehicles. The \"operational design domain\" defines the specific conditions for a driving automation system to function. When SAE International revises defined terms in Recommended Practice Report J3016, they must notify the Secretary. The Secretary will publish a notice in the Federal Register unless they determine the new definition does not meet motor vehicle safety needs or is inconsistent with chapter 301 of title 49, United States Code. The Secretary must be notified by SAE International of any revised definitions in Recommended Practice Report J3016. If the Secretary does not reject the revised definition, conforming amendments will be made to regulations and standards without the need for section 553 of title 5, United States Code. The Secretary can update definitions in paragraph (1) if circumstances regarding highly automated vehicles change significantly impacting motor vehicle safety."
