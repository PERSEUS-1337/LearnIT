    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"State Criminal Alien Assistance Program II and Local Medical Emergency Reimbursement Act\". It includes the \"State Criminal Alien Assistance Program II Act of 2000\" and outlines findings and purposes. Congress finds that federal policies along the southwest border impact illegal immigration, states and local governments were partially reimbursed for incarcerating criminal aliens, and certain border counties face financial challenges. Border counties near Mexico face a disproportionate impact from criminal illegal aliens, with Santa Cruz County having a high percentage of alien crossings and illegal alien apprehensions. In 1998, the county spent a significant portion of its criminal justice budget on processing these cases. Santa Cruz County spent $1,900,000 (39 percent) processing criminal illegal aliens, with over half not reimbursed by Federal funds. Despite appeals to Federal and State officials, the county has not received relief from this burden. Border counties in Texas bore unreimbursed costs for apprehension, prosecution, and indigent defense of criminal aliens, with over 142,000 days served in county jails. Nonborder counties in Texas also faced similar unreimbursed costs for criminal aliens serving over 1,000,000 days in county jails. The State of Texas incurred substantial unreimbursed costs for law enforcement efforts due to criminal illegal aliens. The Federal Government should reimburse states for related costs, as counties were not fully reimbursed for expenses associated with illegal alien criminal activity. It is estimated to cost over $50,000,000. The State of Texas incurred substantial unreimbursed costs for law enforcement efforts due to criminal illegal aliens, estimated to be over $50,000,000. In California, it costs hospitals in excess of $50,000,000 to treat undocumented individuals in emergency rooms. The California State Auditor reported between $4,900,000 and $8,100,000 of unreimbursed medical expenses incurred by U.S. Border Patrol. One example involved an overturned van with 20 undocumented persons in Imperial County, where the cost of care for a young man with head trauma exceeded $200,000. The purpose of this title is to provide financial assistance to States and local communities for expenditures related to illegal juvenile aliens and to ensure equitable treatment for those affected by Federal policies on illegal immigration and criminal alien activity on the southwest border. SEC. 103. REIMBURSEMENT OF STATES AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS FOR INDIRECT COSTS RELATED TO INCARCERATION OF ILLEGAL ALIENS. Section 501 of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 is amended to include reimbursement for costs incurred by states or political subdivisions for imprisoning illegal aliens convicted of felonies, as well as indirect costs such as court expenses and indigent defense. Amendment includes reimbursement for imprisoning illegal aliens convicted of felonies, court expenses, indigent defense, and probation costs. Authorization of $200,000,000 for fiscal years 2001-2004. SEC. 104. Reimbursement for incarcerating juvenile aliens. Section 501 of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 is amended to include provisions regarding juvenile aliens who have been adjudicated delinquent or committed to a correctional facility by a State or locality. The term 'juvenile alien' is defined as an alien who meets these criteria. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 is amended to include provisions for juvenile aliens committed to State or local correctional facilities. Annual reports must now include the number of illegal juvenile aliens and the type of offense committed by each juvenile. Amendments are made to the Immigration and Nationality Act regarding juvenile aliens. Amendments are made to the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 regarding juvenile aliens, including provisions for those committed to State or local correctional facilities. The amendments specify that a juvenile alien falling under section 501 of the Act is included. SEC. 105 of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 is amended to provide reimbursement to states bordering Mexico or Canada for emergency health services furnished to undocumented aliens. Reimbursements will consider states sharing a border with Mexico or Canada, or those with a high number of undocumented aliens relative to the general population. In fiscal years 2002 through 2005, $200,000,000 is available for allotments to certain States for payments related to undocumented aliens. The Secretary computes allotments for 17 States with the highest number of undocumented aliens based on ratios of the total available amount and the number of undocumented aliens in each State. The amount of allotment to a State for a fiscal year not paid out under subsection (c) is available for payment in the subsequent fiscal year. The number of undocumented aliens in a State is determined based on estimates prepared by the Statistics Division of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The Secretary pays each State from the allotments made under subsection (b) for a fiscal year. The Secretary pays each State amounts from a State plan for emergency health services to undocumented aliens, based on approved payments under the Social Security Act or an alternative proxy for measuring volume. The Secretary allocates funds to States for emergency health services provided to undocumented aliens by local governments, hospitals, and related providers. Special consideration is given to providers in border counties or areas with a high concentration of undocumented aliens. Providers are considered \"related\" to hospitals if they offer emergency health services. The provider offers emergency health services to individuals, and payments under this subsection do not duplicate payments made under title XIX of the Social Security Act. Definitions include \"hospital\" as defined in the Social Security Act, \"provider\" as including physicians and entities providing emergency ambulance services, and \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Authorization of Appropriations: $200,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2001 through 2005 to carry out this section. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and \"State\" refers to the 50 States and the District of Columbia."
