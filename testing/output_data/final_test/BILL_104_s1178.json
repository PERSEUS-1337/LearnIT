    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Cancer Screening and Prevention Act\" and includes provisions for Medicare coverage of colorectal screening. The \"Cancer Screening and Prevention Act\" amends the Social Security Act to include payment limits for screening fecal-occult blood tests for early detection of colon cancer. Payment amounts are capped at $5 for tests performed in 1996 and subsequent years. The \"Cancer Screening and Prevention Act\" sets payment limits for screening fecal-occult blood tests for colon cancer detection. Payments cannot exceed the established limit for tests in the previous year. Additionally, no payment can be made for a screening test if the individual is under 50 years old or if the test is done within 11 months of a previous test. The \"Cancer Screening and Prevention Act\" establishes payment limits for screening flexible sigmoidoscopies for early detection of colon cancer. The payment amount is set by the Secretary under section 1848, and there is a frequency limit on how often the test can be done for individuals. The \"Cancer Screening and Prevention Act\" sets payment limits for screening colonoscopies for early detection of colon cancer in individuals at high risk, as defined by the Secretary. The payment amount for screening colonoscopies for individuals at high risk for colorectal cancer is established without regard to certain subsections. Payment cannot be made for a screening colonoscopy within 23 months after a previous one. An individual at high risk is defined as someone with a family history, prior cancer experience, or chronic digestive issues. Individuals with neoplastic polyps, a history of chronic digestive diseases, gene markers for colorectal cancer, or other predisposing factors are at high risk for colorectal cancer. The Secretary may periodically review and reduce the payment limit for screening fecal-occult blood tests. The Secretary may periodically review and revise the frequency for screening fecal-occult blood tests, flexible sigmoidoscopies, and colonoscopies based on age and other relevant factors to ensure quality testing availability. The Secretary may revise the frequency of tests and procedures paid for under this subsection, but any revision will not apply to tests performed before January 1, 1999. Nonparticipating physicians' charges for screening sigmoidoscopies and colonoscopies for early detection of colon cancer are limited. Under this part, nonparticipating physicians cannot charge individuals more than the limiting charge. Sanctions may be applied for willful violations. Conforming amendments are made to sections related to physician charges. The text chunk discusses amendments to various sections of the Act related to physician charges, including restrictions on charges for certain services like screening flexible sigmoidoscopies and colonoscopies. The text chunk introduces new provisions for screening fecal-occult blood tests, flexible sigmoidoscopies, and colonoscopies for early detection of colon cancer, performed more frequently than covered under section 1834(d). It also amends paragraph (7) by including subparagraphs (B), (F), or (G) of paragraph (1) for physician charges. The amendments made by section 2 will apply to screening fecal-occult blood tests, flexible sigmoidoscopies, and colonoscopies performed on or after January 1, 1996."
