    "content": "Congressional district boundaries must comply with Section 2 of the VRA, which prohibits discriminatory voting practices like minority vote dilution. It forbids any voting qualification or practice that denies the right to vote based on race, color, or language minority membership. A violation is established if political processes are not equally open to minority groups. The creation of \"majority-minority\" districts may be necessary in congressional redistricting to ensure fair representation for racial or language minority groups. These districts prevent vote dilution by allowing minority voters to elect candidates of their choice. The Supreme Court's three-prong test in Thornburg v. Gingles requires plaintiffs to prove the minority group is large and geographically compact enough to constitute a majority in a single-member district. The Supreme Court's three-prong test in Thornburg v. Gingles requires minority groups to prove they are large and geographically compact enough to constitute a majority in a single-member district. Additionally, the minority group must show political cohesion and that the white majority votes as a bloc to usually defeat the minority's preferred candidate. The Court also considers the \"totality of the circumstances\" under Section 2 to determine if there is a violation, listing factors from the legislative history to assess equal opportunity in political processes. The legislative history accompanying the enactment of Section 2 considers factors such as official discrimination, racial polarization in voting, use of discriminatory voting practices, denial of access to candidate slating process, and effects of discrimination on minority groups in areas like education, employment, and health. The Supreme Court ruled in Bartlett v. Strickland that the first prong of the Gingles three-prong test requires the minority group to constitute more than 50% of the voting population in a district to satisfy geographical compactness. This decision clarified the requirement for drawing district lines to allow minority voters to elect their preferred candidate, even if the minority group comprises less than 50% of the population in a given district. The Supreme Court clarified in Bartlett v. Strickland that the first prong of the Gingles test requires the minority group to constitute more than 50% of the voting population in a district for geographical compactness. Section 2 does not grant special protection to minority groups needing political coalitions to elect preferred candidates. Congressional redistricting plans must adhere to equal protection standards under the 14th Amendment. If race is the predominant factor in drawing district lines, it may conflict with traditional considerations. In cases where race is the primary factor in redistricting, a \"strict scrutiny\" standard is applied, requiring a compelling governmental interest in creating majority-minority districts. The tension between VRA compliance and equal protection standards is evident in court decisions like Easley v. Cromartie II, where the constitutionality of a 47% black district was upheld against claims of racial gerrymandering. The Supreme Court overturned a lower court ruling in the case of North Carolina and African American voters, stating that the district boundaries were not drawn predominantly because of race. The Court clarified that the burden of proof lies with the party attacking the legislature's plan to show that racial considerations were dominant. This decision contrasts with cases like Easley v. Cromartie II, where a 47% black district was upheld against claims of racial gerrymandering. In Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, the Supreme Court clarified that race predominance in redistricting must be analyzed district by district, not as a whole state. The Court emphasized that traditional race-neutral redistricting principles should not be subordinated to racial considerations. The equal population rule is not a traditional principle and should not be weighed against the use of race in determining predominance. The focus should be on whether the legislature relied on race instead of other traditional factors when moving voters to achieve equal population. In Shelby County v. Holder, the U.S. Supreme Court invalidated Section 4(b) of the VRA, which determined which states needed federal approval for voting law changes. This decision removed the preclearance requirement for nine states and jurisdictions within six states previously covered under the formula. The covered states included Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia, while the six states with covered jurisdictions were California, Florida, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, and South Dakota. The U.S. Supreme Court invalidated Section 4(b) of the VRA in Shelby County v. Holder, removing the preclearance requirement for certain states and jurisdictions. The decision did not affect Section 3(c) of the act, known as the \"bail in\" provision. This provision allows jurisdictions to be ordered to obtain preclearance of voting laws if violations of the 14th or 15th Amendment have occurred. The formula in 4(b) required states with certain voting conditions to meet preclearance requirements. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 included requirements for literacy, educational achievement, moral character, or proof of qualifications by registered voters as prerequisites for voting. In 1972, the definition of \"test or device\" was expanded to include providing election information only in English in areas with a single language minority constituting over 5% of voting-age citizens. Section 4(a) allowed covered states to seek release from preclearance requirements by demonstrating compliance with the law over the previous 10 years. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 prohibited the use of tests or devices to deny voting rights based on race or color. It also required states to comply with preclearance requirements under section 5 of the Act. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 required states to comply with preclearance requirements under section 5, ensuring that voting procedures hindering equal access are eliminated. Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 required preclearance for any proposed changes to voting qualifications, practices, or procedures in covered jurisdictions to prevent future denials or abridgements of the right to vote. This provision aimed to eliminate intimidation and harassment of voters and promote expanded opportunities for voter registration and minority representation in elections. Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 required covered jurisdictions to obtain preclearance approval for any voting changes to ensure no denial or abridgement of voting rights based on race or color. Covered jurisdictions could seek preclearance from the U.S. Attorney General or the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The burden was on the jurisdiction to prove the proposed change did not discriminate. The preclearance requirements of the Voting Rights Act were enacted to protect citizens' ability to elect their preferred candidates. These requirements have expiration dates and were scheduled to expire in 2031 after the 2006 amendments. The Supreme Court ruled that a redistricting plan would be denied preclearance if it led to retrogression in minority voting strength. In Beer v. U.S., the Court found that increasing African American city council majority districts enhanced minority voting strength and could not dilute voting rights. The Supreme Court clarified the retrogression standard for Section 5 preclearance under the Voting Rights Act. In City of Lockhart v. U.S., the Court approved an electoral change that did not diminish minority voting strength. The Court emphasized that a new redistricting plan must not diminish African American voting strength to be entitled to preclearance under Section 5. Additionally, in Reno v. Bossier Parish School Board, the Court affirmed the retrogression standard for Section 5 preclearance, rejecting a standard of racial vote dilution. The Supreme Court clarified the retrogression standard for Section 5 preclearance under the Voting Rights Act, emphasizing that a new redistricting plan must not diminish minority voting strength. In 2006, Congress amended Section 5 to protect the ability of citizens to elect their preferred candidates of choice, addressing a 2003 Supreme Court decision in Georgia v. Ashcroft. The amendment aimed to prevent the replacement of majority-minority districts with \"influence districts\" where minorities could impact but not decisively influence elections. The Senate report indicated that the intent of the amendment to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act was to restore it to a \"workable\" standard as established in Beer v. United States. The Court clarified in Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama that the non-retrogression standard does not require a specific numerical percentage of minority voters, but rather ensures their ability to elect preferred candidates. The Court did not address whether continued compliance with Section 5 is still a compelling governmental interest after the 2013 ruling invalidating the VRA's coverage formula. Congress amended Section 5 in 2006 to expand its protections. Congress amended Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act in 2006 to include any discriminatory purpose within the definition of \"purpose.\" This change was made in response to the Supreme Court's decision in Bossier Parish II, which allowed preclearance of redistricting plans with discriminatory purposes as long as they did not worsen unconstitutional circumstances. The Supreme Court's decision in Bossier Parish II created a loophole where the Justice Department or federal court could approve an unconstitutional voting practice. The federal government should not endorse practices that violate the Constitution. In Shelby County v. Holder, the Court ruled that Congress's reauthorization of the Section 5 preclearance requirement in 2006 was unconstitutional due to the coverage formula's unequal application among states. The Supreme Court's decision in Shelby County v. Holder declared the coverage formula for the Section 5 preclearance requirement unconstitutional due to its outdated basis. This ruling contrasted with previous cases where the Court upheld the constitutionality of Section 5, such as in South Carolina v. Katzenbach and City of Rome v. United States. The Supreme Court reaffirmed the constitutionality of Section 5 in Katzenbach and Lopez v. Monterey County. However, concerns arose after the 2006 reauthorization, leading to a challenge in Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District Number One v. Holder regarding Congress's enforcement power under the Fifteenth Amendment. The Court did not directly address Section 5's constitutionality in this case. The Supreme Court did not directly address the constitutionality of Section 5 in NAMUDNO v. Holder, but raised serious constitutional questions about the VRA's preclearance requirement and coverage formula. The Court noted improvements since previous cases but emphasized the need for current justifications for the law. The Court avoided the constitutional question by allowing a utility district to be released from coverage. In June 2013, the Supreme Court ruled in Shelby County v. Holder that the coverage formula in Section 4(b) of the VRA was unconstitutional. Chief Justice Roberts emphasized the need for current justifications for the preclearance requirement, contrasting voting conditions in 1966 with the present day. The Court stated that the coverage formula was tailored to address extensive racial discrimination in voting at the time. The Supreme Court ruled in Shelby County v. Holder that the coverage formula in Section 4(b) of the VRA was unconstitutional due to outdated data and eradicated practices not reflecting current conditions. The Supreme Court in Shelby County v. Holder found the coverage formula in Section 4(b) of the VRA unconstitutional due to outdated data. Registration and turnout statistics in covered jurisdictions now approach parity with non-covered ones, leading the Court to require a new basis for dividing states for preclearance. Justice Ginsburg dissented, arguing that the current formula still identifies jurisdictions with voting discrimination, including second-generation barriers like racial gerrymandering. The Supreme Court invalidated the coverage formula in Section 4(b) of the VRA in Shelby County v. Holder, citing outdated data. This decision rendered the Section 5 preclearance requirement inoperable. Justice Ginsburg dissented, arguing that the formula still identifies jurisdictions with voting discrimination. The Supreme Court invalidated the coverage formula in Section 4(b) of the VRA in Shelby County v. Holder, citing outdated data. Justice Ginsburg dissented, arguing that the formula still identifies jurisdictions with voting discrimination. In a current case, the Court is evaluating whether redistricting commissions can draw congressional districts instead of state legislatures. The Supreme Court is evaluating whether redistricting commissions can draw congressional districts instead of state legislatures. Legislation such as H.R. 75 and H.R. 219/H.R. 1347 aim to establish requirements for congressional redistricting. The \"Redistricting and Voter Protection Act of 2015\" and the \"Redistricting Transparency Act of 2015\" aim to ensure transparency and public participation in the congressional redistricting process. These bills would require states to use independent commissions for redistricting and provide public access to proposed plans online. H.R. 223, H.R. 278, H.R. 337, and H.R. 2490 are bills aimed at reforming the congressional redistricting process. They propose limiting the number of redistricting cycles, requiring redistricting through independent commissions, ensuring public access to proposed plans online, and prohibiting mid-decade redistricting. The \"Redistricting and Voter Protection Act of 2013\" proposed restrictions on states conducting multiple congressional redistricting cycles, requiring preclearance under the VRA for subsequent plans. The \"Redistricting Reform Act of 2013\" also aimed to limit redistricting cycles and enforce compliance with the Constitution and VRA. H.R. 2928, the \"Fair and Independent Redistricting (FAIR) Act,\" and H.R. 2978, the \"Let the People Draw the Lines Act of 2013,\" proposed requiring states to conduct redistricting through independent commissions. The \"Fixing America's Inconsistent Redistricting (FAIR) Act\" and the \"Fairness and Independence in Redistricting Act\" proposed requiring states to conduct congressional redistricting through nonpartisan agencies, with specific criteria and limitations on the number of redistricting processes after a census. The \"Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2015\" would modify the \"bail in\" provision in Section 3(c) of the Voting Rights Act, allowing courts to retain jurisdiction over states with violations of the 14th or 15th Amendment. The \"Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2015\" would expand the types of violations that qualify for \"bail in\" and establish a new coverage formula for Section 5 preclearance, covering states with past violations of voting rights laws. The \"Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2015\" would cover states and political subdivisions with voting rights violations in the past 15 years, updating the list annually. Voting rights violations include denials or abridgments based on race, color, or language membership. The Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2015 addresses voting rights violations based on race, color, or language membership, including denials or abridgments of the right to vote. It requires public notice of voting changes within 180 days of an election. The legislation requires states to provide public notice within 48 hours of any changes to voting prerequisites or procedures affecting federal elections, including polling place resources and demographic changes. It also grants authority to assign observers to enforce voting rights laws. The legislation amends the VRA to allow observers to be assigned if there are complaints of potential violations of bilingual election requirements. It also expands the ability for injunctive relief to be granted for violations of various voting rights laws. The legislation expands the ability for injunctive relief to be granted for violations of voting rights laws, including those related to discrimination based on race, color, or membership in a language minority group. The court must consider various factors before granting relief, such as the impact on both the plaintiff and defendant. The Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2014 prohibits changes to voting laws based on race, color, or language minority group membership within 180 days of an election without adequate notice."
