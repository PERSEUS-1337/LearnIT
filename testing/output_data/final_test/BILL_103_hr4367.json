CLARIFICATION OF CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF REMEDIES RELATING TO MATTERS TREATED IN DOMESTIC RELATIONS ORDERS ENTERED BEFORE 1985. In cases where a prior domestic relations order before January 1, 1985 did not divide pension benefits between spouses or one spouse waived their rights without consent, or if the division of benefits was unequal, further court action may be necessary. Further court action may be necessary regarding domestic relations orders entered before January 1, 1985, as the Retirement Equity Act of 1984 does not require treating post-enactment orders differently solely based on their timing. Definitions in this section align with those in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The term \"pro rata share\" of a spouse in a pension plan is 50% of the accrued benefit multiplied by a fraction representing the period of creditable service during the marriage. All pension plans where a person is a participant are considered as one plan for that person.
