    "content": "The Act titled \"Dry-Redwater Regional Water Authority System Act of 2009\" is established for the purpose of creating a regional water authority system. Congress finds that there are insufficient supplies of safe water to meet health and safety standards in certain counties of North Dakota, impacted by the Fort Peck Dam construction, managed for flood control, hydroelectric power, irrigation, and public water supply. The purpose of this Act is to ensure a safe and adequate municipal, rural, and industrial water supply for the citizens of specific counties in North Dakota. This includes the maintenance of a public water supply, conservation of fish and wildlife, recreation, and improvement of water quality. The Act aims to guarantee a secure water supply for citizens in certain North Dakota counties, covering public water supply, wildlife conservation, recreation, and water quality improvement. The Act defines key terms such as Administrator, Authority, Pick-Sloan program, Secretary, State, and Water System. The Water System refers to the Dry-Redwater Regional Water Authority System for specific counties in Montana and North Dakota. The Non-federal distribution system is the local electric service provider, and the Integrated system is the transmission system owned by Western Area Power Administration, Basin Electric Power Cooperative, and Heartland Consumers Power District. SEC. 4. DRY-REDWATER REGIONAL WATER AUTHORITY SYSTEM. The Secretary will enter a cooperative agreement with the Authority for Federal assistance in planning, designing, and constructing the Water System, outlining responsibilities for final engineering report, environmental study, design, construction, and water conservation measures. The cooperative agreement with the Authority outlines responsibilities for planning, design, construction, water conservation measures, administration of contracts, procedures, requirements, approval, acceptance, and rights, responsibilities, and liabilities of each party. Federal funds cover costs for planning, design, and construction. Federal funds for the Water System must not exceed 75% of the total cost and cannot be reimbursed under reclamation laws. Funds must be used in compliance with a cooperative agreement. Components eligible for funding include water intake, pumping, treatment, and storage facilities. The Water System eligible for federal funding includes water treatment, storage, transmission pipelines, pumping stations, appurtenant buildings, maintenance equipment, access roads, interconnection facilities, distribution, pumping, and storage facilities for public water systems, and electrical power transmission and distribution facilities. The Water System eligible for federal funding includes facilities for operation and maintenance, rural water distribution system development, and property rights for construction. The service area includes specific counties in Montana and North Dakota. The Water System in North Dakota must comply with environmental regulations and have an approved engineering report before construction funds can be obligated. Additionally, a water conservation plan with prudent, reasonable, and feasible measures must be developed. Federal funds for the Water System are limited. The Water System in North Dakota must comply with environmental regulations and have an approved engineering report before construction funds can be obligated. A water conservation plan with prudent measures must be developed. Federal funds for the Water System are limited, and any costs for operation, maintenance, or replacement must be paid by the Water System. Title to the Water System shall be held by the Authority. SEC. 5. USE OF POWER FROM PICK-SLOAN PROGRAM. Congress finds that McCone and Garfield Counties were designated as impact counties during the construction of the Fort Peck Dam and were to receive impact mitigation benefits through the Pick-Sloan program. The Administrator is required to provide up to one and a half megawatts of power to the Water System from May 1 to October 31 each year for pumping and operational needs. The Water System is eligible to receive power from the Administrator if it operates on a not-for-profit basis and is constructed under a cooperative agreement. The power is provided at a firm rate, and additional power may be available if needed. The Water System can purchase additional power at the best available rate to meet pumping requirements, with costs reimbursed by the Dry-Redwater Regional Water Authority. The Authority is responsible for power charges and non-Federal delivery costs, while the Water System is responsible for transmission and distribution system arrangements and funding any necessary upgrades. The Water System is responsible for transmission and distribution system arrangements and funding any necessary upgrades to the Integrated System for power delivery. The Authority must develop a water conservation plan with objectives, measures, and a schedule to meet conservation goals. The plan should ensure users use efficient technology and techniques. Public participation is required for activities under this Act. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations totaling $115,116,000 for the planning, design, and construction of the Water System from 2011 to 2021 is allowed. The amount can be adjusted based on development cost fluctuations after January 1, 2008, using engineering cost indices."
