    "content": "The Selective Service agency receives $23 million annually from Congress to maintain its operations. Despite not using conscription for over four decades, young men are still required to register for the draft. Failure to register can result in penalties such as lost benefits and criminal action. There are debates about the necessity and fairness of the registration requirements. This report aims to inform Congress about the evolution of the Military Selective Service Act, the Selective Service System, and the impact of registration requirements on constituents. The report provides background on the Military Selective Service Act, registration requirements, organization of the Selective Service System, and policy options for Congress. It does not address the all-volunteer force or other military manpower resourcing options. The report does not discuss the history of the draft or evaluate the current structure of the Selective Service System. These topics will be reviewed by the National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service established by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017. The United States has used federal conscription at various times since the Civil War era, primarily during times of war. The United States has a history of conscription for military service, with the draft being used before, during, and after WWII. The draft was reinstated in 1948 and remained in force until 1973 when the all-volunteer force was adopted. A standby draft mechanism still exists for major military contingencies. If the draft were reinstated, draftees would fill various military positions. During the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln signed the 1863 Enrollment Act, which allowed for compulsory federal service through conscription of male citizens between 20 and 45. Exemptions were granted for dependency and official employment. The act established a national Provost Marshal Bureau to enforce the draft, with provost marshals appointed to each district under the Secretary of War. The Enrollment Act of 1863 established the Provost Marshal Bureau to enforce the draft, with district boards processing enrollments and conducting lotteries. Critics noted that the act favored the wealthy, allowing for substitutes or fees up to $300. Fraud and desertions were common, leading to rioting and violence, notably in New York City in July 1863. During the Civil War, the draft in New York City on July 13, 1863, led to riots and violence, causing the suspension of the draft until August 19, 1863. A total of 255,373 men were drafted, with many avoiding service through commutation or providing substitutes. The bounty system likely influenced volunteerism during the war, and conscription was not used again by the federal government until World War I. During World War I, the Selective Service Act of 1917 allowed for the draft of male citizens aged 21-31, later extended to include males aged 18-45. The Act also permitted the President to call up the National Guard and outlined provisions for release from service upon a presidential proclamation of peace. The Selective Service Act of 1917 expanded the eligible draft age to include males aged 18-45 for overseas service during World War I. Unlike the Civil War, concerns about the impact on the domestic economy drove the selective aspects of the draft law. Senator William M. Calder highlighted the importance of preventing men from leaving industries under a volunteer system. The Act did not allow for substitutes or bounties for enlistment. The Selective Service Act of 1917 decentralized administration through local draft boards, overseen by the provost marshal general. The first draft lottery was held in July 1917, with 2.8 million out of 24.2 million registrants eventually inducted. The law did not allow substitutes or bounties for enlistment, leading to the discontinuation of volunteer enlistees by December 1917. In 1919, the provost marshal general was relieved from his duties, registration activities were terminated, and boards were closed. In 1936, the Joint Army-Navy Selective Service Committee was created to manage emergency mobilization planning. Between WWI and WWII, the Armed Forces decreased in size due to treaty commitments and public attitudes. Different movements emerged regarding conscription and military service provisions. In 1940, amidst Europe's war, President Roosevelt proposed universal compulsory government service for American youth. A conscription bill was introduced in Congress, supported by senior Army leaders concerned about recruiting enough personnel. The Selective Training and Service Act, signed into law by Franklin D. Roosevelt on September 16, 1940, introduced peacetime conscription in the United States. Men aged 21 through 35 were required to register with local draft boards for a 12-month training period. Some in Congress opposed the bill, arguing against regimentation of American life and the ideals of patriotic Americans. The Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 introduced peacetime conscription in the United States, requiring men aged 21-35 to register for a 12-month training period. The act also established criminal penalties for non-compliance and gave the President authority to establish a Selective Service System. Dr. Clarence Dykstra was initially appointed as Director of the Selective Service but never took up the position due to poor health. In July 1941, the JANSSC became the new Selective Service headquarters. The Selective Service headquarters was established in the interwar period, with Colonel Lewis B. Hershey appointed as Director until 1970. The implementation of the Selective Service System focused on an equitable lottery system administered by local draft boards, following the principles of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940. The district boards assigned numbers to registrants for the lottery. The first draft lottery was held on October 29, 1940, assigning numbers to registrants for draft inductions into the Army. The lottery system was used for three groups of registrants before being abandoned in 1942. Draftees were inducted based on quotas, classification, age, and order of precedence. Despite some complaints, a Gallup poll in 1941 found that 93% of people thought the draft was fair. Approximately 10 million of the 16 million WWII servicemembers were draftees. During WWII, 10 million of the 16 million servicemembers were draftees. General Marshall supported Selective Service as a necessity for maintaining military force and democracy. After the war, there were discussions about continuing compulsory military training or postwar conscription. During WWII, 10 million of the 16 million servicemembers were draftees. General Marshall supported Selective Service as a necessity for maintaining military force and democracy. After the war, discussions were held on compulsory military training. Those in favor argued it would deter future threats and build character, while opponents saw it as undemocratic and inefficient. Congress extended the Selective Training and Service Act in 1945 and 1946, but repealed it in 1947, transferring responsibilities to the Office of Selective Service Records. This restructuring put the Selective Service System on standby mode by 1948, with the military size reduced to less than 1.5 million. In 1948, the draft was reinstated through the Selective Service Act, signed into law by President Truman. It required males aged 19 to 26 to register and allowed the President to appoint state directors. The act also authorized calling National Guard and Reserve personnel into active duty. The Selective Service Act of 1948 authorized the call-up of National Guard and Reserve personnel. In 1950, the Act was extended due to the outbreak of the Korean War, becoming the Universal Military Training and Service Act of 1951, which required eligible males to perform 12 months of military service and training. The Universal Military Training and Service Act of 1951 mandated 12 months of military service for eligible males. Approximately 1.5 million men were inducted into the military to support the Korean conflict. The draft process did not involve a lottery; instead, the Department of Defense issued draft calls and quotas to local boards based on classification. Public concerns focused on the fair implementation of the draft. Between 1950 and 1964, the Universal Military Training and Service Act was extended by Congress in four-year periods with minor amendments. Volunteers made up about two-thirds of the military force, while the rest were supplemented through inductions. Criticisms of the draft system included concerns about equitable implementation and potential disruptions to citizens' lives. In 1964, conscription was used to mobilize manpower for the Vietnam War. In the late 1960s, public acceptance of the draft began to erode due to opposition to the Vietnam War, discipline issues among draftees, belief in the unfair imposition of military service on young men, and demographic changes increasing the eligible population for military service. There were estimations that an all-volunteer force could be fielded within acceptable budget levels. Estimations suggested an all-volunteer force could be established within budget constraints. President Lyndon B. Johnson created the National Advisory Commission on Selective Service in response to concerns, tasked with examining various options for national service. The commission's final report, \"In Pursuit of Equity: Who Serves When not all Serve?\", considered factors like fairness, military requirements, and budgetary considerations. The National Advisory Commission on Selective Service recommended changes to the Selective Service System to ensure equal treatment for all in like circumstances. This included adopting an impartial selection process, consolidating local boards, and ensuring board composition was representative. The House Armed Services Committee also recommended against shifting to an all-volunteer force. The Clark panel recommended against an all-volunteer force and disagreed on a draft lottery. In 1967, Congress extended the Selective Service System through the Military Selective Service Act of 1967. President Nixon called for the draft lottery system, which Congress approved by amending the law and repealing the prohibition on the President's authority. Nixon then signed Executive Order 11497 establishing the draft lottery for men aged 19 through 25. In 1971, the induction authority under the MSSA was extended through 1973. The bill requested proportional representation on local boards and included a pay raise for military members as a step towards an all-volunteer force. President Nixon launched the Gates Commission, which recommended an all-volunteer force in 1970. The Gates Commission recommended an all-volunteer force supported by an effective standby draft. The Selective Service System would maintain a register of potential conscripts for national security. The last draft calls were in December 1972, with the authority to induct expiring in June 1973. Secretary of Defense Laird announced the end of conscription on January 27, 1973. The last man to be drafted entered the Army in June 1973. Table 1 shows the number of inductees for major conflicts. President Gerald Ford suspended the draft registration requirement in April 1975, putting the Selective Service System into standby mode with 98 staff members. In the late 1970s, concerns arose about the Selective Service System's ability to mobilize quickly in emergencies. President Carter announced the resumption of draft registration in 1980, supported by 76% of the public. Congress allocated $13.3 million for the system, and President Carter reestablished the registration requirement in July 1980. Carter signed Proclamation 4771 on July 2, 1980, reinstating the requirement for 18- to 25-year-old males to register for the Selective Service. Penalties for not registering were set at a fine of up to $10,000 and/or a prison term of up to five years. The new standby SSS had key components including a reliable registration process, automated data processing system, orders for induction, claims process, and field structure support. Supporters of reinstating the registration requirement for men argued it would show readiness to defend US interests and reduce mobilization time in emergencies. Some suggested peacetime conscription, universal military training, or national service. Opponents claimed registration forms were illegal for requiring Social Security numbers and that exempting women from the draft was unconstitutional. Carter proposed giving the President authority to register women, citing the need for preparedness. The President proposed registering women for the draft, stating that women are now contributing to all professions, including the military. Congress rejected the proposal, citing concerns about the role of women in combat. The committee reaffirms the policy excluding women from combat and registration for Selective Service, citing the Supreme Court's decision in Rostker v. Goldberg. Justice Rehnquist stated that the exclusion of women from combat justified Congress' decision to exempt them from registration. In 1980, the first national registration after the reinstatement of the draft requirement saw a high registration rate of 87% within two weeks and 95% by the fourth month. The Government Accountability Office estimated a final accuracy level of 98% for registrations. Despite initial success, there was a push to maintain public awareness and high compliance rates. In 1982, President Ronald Reagan authorized a grace period for selective service registration until February 28. The Department of Justice began prosecuting men who refused to register, with 341 referrals for investigation and 2 convictions. Congress considered tying federal benefits to registration, amending the National Defense Authorization bills to prohibit federal student assistance for young male adults. The Senate passed an amendment to prohibit young male adults from receiving federal student assistance if they cannot certify registration with Selective Service. Representative Jerry Solom introduced a similar amendment in the House. The provision was signed into law as part of the FY1983 National Defense Authorization Act. Representative Solomon also added similar language to the Job Training Partnership Act of 1982. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 replaced the Job Training and Partnership Act, maintaining the MSSA enforcement. In 1985, Congress added a provision to the National Defense Authorization Act, making non-registrants ineligible for federal civil service appointments. The peacetime registration program was seen as a national security contribution. President Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act in 1986, requiring males aged 18-26 to register with Selective Service. The Immigration Reform and Control Act required males aged 18-26 applying for legalization to register with the Selective Service. Proposed legislative changes to the MSSA included options like repealing the MSSA, terminating the registration requirement, reinstating draft induction authority, defunding the Selective Service System, and requiring women to register for the draft. Other proposed changes aimed to modify SSS record management or registration processes. In the FY2017 NDAA (P.L. 114-328), Congress established a National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service to review the military selective service process and propose methods to increase participation in military and public service. The commission's scope includes assessing the need for a draft mechanism, promoting a service ethos among youth, and exploring modifications to the selective service process. The FY2017 NDAA established a National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service to review and propose modifications to the military selective service process, including obtaining individuals with critical skills and potential Federal benefits. The National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service is tasked with analyzing the benefits of the Military Selective Service System, including its impact on military recruiting, national security deterrence, and the potential inclusion of women in registration. Additionally, the Commission will assess the functions currently performed by the Selective Service System that would be taken over by the Department of Defense, as well as the resources needed for physical mobilization of inductees without the Selective Service System. Furthermore, the feasibility and effectiveness of shifting focus from mass mobilization of combat troops to a more comprehensive mobilization strategy will be evaluated. The Department of Defense is considering a shift from mass mobilization of combat troops to mobilization of all military occupational specialties. An analysis of personnel needs in case of emergency, including timelines for inductees to report for service and critical skills required, is required. The report will also include assumptions used in the analysis. The Department of Defense submitted a report in July 2017 stating they have no current plans for conscription but have systems in place as a precaution. The Government Accountability Office's report in January 2018 highlighted that DOD's mobilization requirements have not been updated since 1994, despite changes in force structure and national security needs. The Department of Defense has no current plans for conscription but has systems in place as a precaution. The first inductees would report to a Military Entrance Processing Station in 193 days, with the first 100,000 inductees reporting for service in 210 days. DOD's all-volunteer force is deemed adequate to meet personnel needs, with no operational plans requiring a draft. Personnel requirements and timelines from 1994 are still considered realistic, with no updates made for mass mobilization emergencies. The GAO's 2012 recommendation for periodic reevaluation of DOD's requirements for the Selective Service System remains valid. The National Commission on Military, National and Public Service released an interim report on their research findings on January 23, 2019, summarizing preliminary findings regarding the Selective Service System (SSS). The commission is considering options to potentially expand the registration requirement to include women, identify individuals with critical skills, call for volunteers during emergencies, and make changes to protect objectors to military service. Currently, all males in the U.S. aged 18 to 26, including documented and undocumented immigrants, are required to register with the Selective Service. Individuals aged 18 to 26 must register with the Selective Service within 30 days of turning 18, with exemptions listed in Table 2. Men born from March 29, 1957, to December 31, 1959, were not required to register. Women are currently exempt from registration. Registrations are mostly done electronically, but can also be completed at U.S. Post Offices or through paper submissions. In FY2017, 42% of all Selective Service registrations were done electronically through driver's license legislation, representing nearly 1 million young men. The SSS also has interagency agreements for registration with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for immigrant men ages 18 through 25 accepted for permanent U.S. residence. Men applying for an immigrant visa through the Department of State are also registered. The federal student aid application includes a \"register me\" checkbox for those not yet registered. The federal student aid application includes a \"register me\" checkbox for those who have not registered for the Selective Service, allowing automatic registration. The Selective Service reports that 25% of electronic registrants come from the Department of Education. Compliance rates for registration vary by age group, with penalties for knowingly failing to register including imprisonment and fines. Failing to register for the Selective Service can result in imprisonment for up to five years and/or a fine of up to $10,000. Consequences include ineligibility for federal student aid, executive agency positions, job training benefits, and potential citizenship issues for certain immigrants. Failure to comply is considered a felony, with names of violators forwarded to the Department of Justice. Since January 1986, there have been no criminal prosecutions for failing to register for the Selective Service. The consequences include denial of federal and state financial aid and job training benefits. The Military Selective Service Act establishes a statute of limitations of five years for criminal prosecutions for evading registration. Individuals may not be denied federal benefits if the registration requirement no longer applies to them. The Selective Service System is an independent federal agency with headquarters in Arlington, VA. It maintains a registration and classification structure for national emergencies. Failure to register may result in denial of federal benefits, but individuals can request reconsideration if they unknowingly failed to register. The Selective Service System is responsible for holding a national draft lottery, contacting selected registrants, arranging transportation to Military Entrance Processing Stations, and activating a classification structure for individuals inducted during a national emergency. Local boards evaluate claims for exemption, postponement, or deferments, with conscientious objectors serving in noncombatant roles. The Selective Service System (SSS) is responsible for holding a national draft lottery, arranging transportation to Military Entrance Processing Stations, and activating a classification structure for inducted individuals during a national emergency. Those permitted to serve in a nonmilitary capacity are placed as \"alternative service workers\" with alternate employers for 24 months of required service. The agency's workforce includes full-time career employees, part-time military and civilian personnel, and around 11,000 part-time civilian volunteers. In FY2017, the agency had 124 full-time equivalent civilian positions for administration and operations. The Selective Service System has positions for part-time Reserve Forces Officers representing all branches of the Armed Forces. Congress appropriates funds for the SSS through the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act. The budget request for FY2019 was $26.4 million, an increase of $3.5 million over the FY2018 appropriation. Funding decreased by 10% from FY2012 to FY2013. Funding for the Selective Service System decreased by 10% from FY2012 to FY2013, reaching $22 million. Since then, funding has remained stable in current dollars but decreased in inflation-adjusted dollars. The agency's budget includes personnel compensation, Reserve Force Officer training pay, government and commercial contracts, postage services, and software expenses. The Selective Service System maintains data for registrants until their 85th birthday at the Data Management Center in Palatine, IL. The database contains approximately 78 million records and grows by 2 million to 2.5 million records annually. Information includes registrants' personal details and a \"Suspected Violator Inventory System\" is used to remind nonregistrants of their obligation to register. Registration and data-sharing processes are mostly automated. The Selective Service System maintains data for registrants until their 85th birthday at the Data Management Center in Palatine, IL. Registration and data-sharing processes are mostly automated. The SSS provides and receives data from various government agencies, including the Department of Labor, Education, State, USCIS, Defense, and Alaska Permanent Fund. Information received is matched with existing data, and new records are created if needed. The SSS shares new registrant information with JAMRS monthly and provides data to the Census Bureau yearly for recruiting and intercensus estimate purposes. The Selective Service System (SSS) sends data to the U.S. Census Bureau for its intercensus estimate program and updates the Department of Justice on individuals who fail to register. Men must update their information with the SSS within 10 days of changing their address until they turn 26. The SSS uses information from other agencies and self-reported data to update addresses in its database. Despite amendments, the main tenets of the MSSA include maintaining a peacetime selective service agency and registration. The future of the Selective Service System is a concern for many in Congress, with some advocating for its preservation for national security and emergency preparedness, while others suggest repealing or amending the MSSA. Selective service legislation has been in effect since 1940, and repealing it would dismantle the SSS agency infrastructure and remove the registration requirement and associated penalties. Efforts to repeal the Selective Service Act have been popular among advocacy groups and defense scholars, questioning the necessity of the agency in modern times. The return to the draft is unpopular with the American public, and the Department of Defense has been able to maintain a professional volunteer force without conscription, even during conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The nature of warfare has changed, reducing the likelihood of needing high mobilization rates. Some doubt the capacity of the Armed Forces to absorb large numbers of untrained personnel quickly if needed. The Department of Defense has the capacity to process a large number of registrants per day for a potential draft. Some analysts argue that a draft would be inefficient and result in a lower-quality force compared to the all-volunteer force. Civil rights groups see conscription as an invasion of civil liberty. Advocates for suspending SSS activities argue that the infrastructure could be rebuilt if needed. Additional manpower could come from DEP participants and inactive reserves. Reauthorizing the draft may boost volunteerism. Maintaining the SSS is seen as a low-cost insurance policy against future threats. The potential consequences of disbanding the Selective Service System (SSS) include weakening the all-volunteer force, emboldening adversaries, and increasing costs during times of conflict. Options for amending the Military Selective Service Act (MSSA) include repealing the registration requirement and transferring certain functions to another federal agency. The Selective Service System (SSS) could potentially have its functions transferred to another federal agency, removing penalties for failure to register and requiring women to register. If the registration requirement is repealed, the SSS would mainly focus on historical record preservation and maintaining standby plans. Data sharing for registrant information could be done through existing federal or state databases. The existing statutes and agency agreements enable data sharing for draft-eligible youth, but repealing them could require reconstitution efforts. Concerns about fairness and equity arise from using government or commercial databases for drafting lists. In a national emergency, Congress could enact new draft registration requirements and reconstitute the Selective Service System (SSS). Challenges in enforcing a new registration requirement during a crisis include insufficient infrastructure and compliance rates. The probability of implementing a draft is low, but reintroducing a draft remains a possibility. The Selective Service System's compliance rates were high in 1980 after reinstating the registration requirement. Congress could potentially transfer the SSS's functions to another federal agency, considering its unique data center and necessary staff for a draft. The Selective Service System's staffing could be transferred to an existing federal agency like the Department of Defense or Department of Homeland Security. Some propose transferring administrative responsibilities to DOD while the draft is inactive, with the option to transfer back if draft authority is reinstated. This would maintain public perception of a fair draft process. The Selective Service System's functions could be transferred to the Department of Homeland Security for potential synergies during national emergencies. Suspending or transferring SSS operations could save federal budget costs, with estimated savings of $5 million in the first year and $6.6 million annually. Transferring SSS functions to an existing agency may have initial implementation costs but could result in long-term savings. Some argue that Congress should amend the MSSA and associated statute to remove penalties for failing to register, especially since only men are affected. They suggest that ineligibility for federal benefits disproportionately impacts those with fewer financial resources. However, weakening penalties could impact registration compliance rates. Alternatively, Congress could amend penalties to limit the time one is ineligible for federal benefits after failing to register. For example, the statute of limitations for criminal penalties could be set at five years following the individual's 26th birthday or fraudulent registration. The MSSA could be amended to sunset ineligibility after a certain time period or reinstate eligibility for federal benefits through public service. Recent DOD policy changes have raised questions about the Selective Service exemption for women. Some military leaders argue that excluding women from draft eligibility would be unwise in a national emergency. In 2019, a U.S. District Court decision declared the male-only registration requirement unconstitutional. The U.S. District Court in Texas declared the male-only registration requirement unconstitutional but did not block the current policy. The National Coalition for Men and two men argue that the policy is discriminatory. Some women advocate for female registration for equal participation in national security. Equal access to combat jobs should require women to register for Selective Service and potential combat roles in case of a draft. Exemptions for women could raise fairness concerns for men. Some argue that women should enroll in Selective Service but not be forced into combat roles. Opponents believe it is unfair for women to be placed in the same roles as men due to physical differences. Some argue that physical standards for combat roles won't be lowered during a draft, ensuring only qualified individuals are assigned. Opponents of drafting women highlight inefficiency in drafting unqualified individuals. Future wars may require skills not based on gender. The requirement for young women to register for the Selective Service System may benefit the Department of Defense in military recruiting. Address data collected and shared with DOD enhances recruiters' ability to identify potential enlistees. DOD estimates that marketing materials generate male recruiting prospects annually, and similar databases are purchased for enlistment-eligible women. Some believe registering would make young women more aware of their citizenship duties, potentially increasing the percentage of qualified women considering a military career. Including women in the Selective Service registration process may increase public opposition to reinstating the draft and affect public support for engaging in conflicts. This could require additional budget resources for administrative processing and public awareness. Currently, there are about 11 million eligible women ages 18-26. In January 2016, the SSS reported needing $8.5 million more for the first year of registering women. Suggestions include expanding the registration system to collect data on specialized skills and extending it beyond the 18-26 age range, similar to Norway's conscription system. The armed forces require individuals to fill out an online questionnaire to assess skills and interest in military service. Around 22,000 people are called in for physical and psychological tests to determine fitness for service. Selection boards then choose individuals for a 12-month service obligation based on the armed forces' needs. The Health Care Professional Delivery System (HCPDS) is a potential model for a registration/draft system by specialty, requiring registration of health care workers aged 20-45. DOD's 2017 report considered a \"mobilization by military occupational specialty (MOS)\" and the benefits of an enhanced registration system for rapid deployment. Establishing an enhanced registration system for rapid acquisition of personnel with necessary expertise through a targeted draft could support efficient recruiting and training processes. However, challenges include increased administration costs and potential opposition due to privacy or civil liberty concerns."
