    "content": "The Agriculture appropriations bill funds the USDA, FDA, and CFTC. It includes mandatory and discretionary spending, with most decisions focusing on discretionary spending. Jurisdiction lies with the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. The report focuses on the FY2014 Agriculture and Related Agencies appropriation, which was part of the FY2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act. This omnibus bill included all 12 appropriations subcommittee bills and was signed into law in January 2014. The final FY2014 appropriation was made possible by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, which set a total government-wide discretionary spending amount of $1.012 trillion. The Agriculture Subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee marked up its FY2014 appropriations bill by voice vote on June 5, 2013. The full House Appropriations Committee reported the bill (H.R. 2410) by voice vote on June 13, 2013, and officially reported the bill on June 18. The Agriculture Subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee approved its FY2014 bill on June 18, 2013. No appropriations were enacted for the Agriculture bill or other subcommittee bills until a continuing resolution (P.L. 113-46) was passed after a government shutdown from October 1 through October 16, 2013. A continuing resolution (P.L. 113-46) funded the government through January 15, 2014 after a 16-day government shutdown. A second resolution (P.L. 113-73) was needed to complete the full-year omnibus appropriation (P.L. 113-76) for FY2013 Agriculture and Related Agencies. The bill was signed by the President on March 26, 2013. In FY2013, the Senate and House committees reported bills for Agriculture appropriations, but no further action was taken. FY2013 began under a continuing resolution (P.L. 112-175) until March 27, 2013. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-67) set government-wide discretionary total for FY2014 appropriations. The FY2014 appropriations set a government-wide discretionary total of $1.012 trillion without budget sequestration. The Agriculture subcommittees were allocated $20.880 billion for discretionary appropriations, $1.165 billion more than FY2013. Mandatory spending of $124.6 billion is included in the bill, with a total Agriculture appropriation of $145.5 billion. Figure 1 shows the distribution of spending, and Table 3 summarizes the amounts in the appropriations bill. The House-reported bill for FY2014 proposed reducing discretionary Agriculture appropriations to $19.45 billion, $265 million lower than FY2013 levels. The Senate-reported bill, on the other hand, aimed to increase discretionary Agriculture appropriations to $20.916 billion, a $1.4 billion increase from FY2013. The Senate bill allocated about $1.7 billion more than the House bill, with differences in handling budget sequestration requirements leading to varying totals. The House and Senate had differing approaches to setting spending levels for FY2013, resulting in large differences in bill totals. The omnibus agreement leaned towards the Senate proposal, which assumed replacing sequestration with other spending reductions. The budget authority available to agencies for FY2013 was unclear due to a continuing resolution and budget sequestration reducing authority by 5%. The FY2013 Agriculture appropriation bill (P.L. 113-6, Division A) enacted on March 26, 2013, included across-the-board rescissions and budget sequestration, resulting in reductions of over 7.5% from the initial appropriated amount. Official documents were incomplete and inconsistent in providing information on available agency funds due to these adjustments. The House Appropriations Committee report for FY2014 included details on the first across-the-board rescission. The FY2013 Agriculture appropriation bill (P.L. 113-6, Division A) included rescissions and sequestration, resulting in significant reductions in agency funds. Official documents were inconsistent in providing details on the adjustments. The Senate Appropriations Committee report for FY2014 included additional rescissions but not sequestration. USDA published an Operating Plan for FY2013 that outlined all rescissions and sequestration at the agency level. Post-sequestration details at the program level were also provided in an unpublished USDA document. These are the only published amounts post-rescission and post-sequestration for Agriculture appropriations in FY2013. The FY2014 Agriculture appropriation bill included nearly $1 billion in limitations on mandatory farm bill programs and recessions from other accounts. These reductions in Title VII help score budgetary savings and offset spending in the bill. Appropriators have placed limits on mandatory spending authorized in the farm bill for over a decade. Limits on mandatory spending authorized in the farm bill, also known as CHIMPS, are set by appropriators through appropriations language. These limits do not change the authorizing law but restrict the use of funds for specific programs. Appropriators have been placing limits on mandatory spending in the farm bill for over a decade, usually appearing in Title VII of the Agriculture appropriations bill. The division over funding agriculture programs between appropriators and authorizers dates back to the 1930s. Mandatory funding through the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) was created to address unpredictable budgeting issues. Tension arose after the 1996 farm bill when mandatory funds were used for discretionary programs, leading to debates over who should fund certain activities. Some question the use of CCC funds for non-variable programs like conservation and rural development. The CHIMPS programs affect conservation, rural development, bioenergy, and some smaller nutrition assistance programs, but not farm commodity programs or primary nutrition assistance programs like SNAP. The FY2014 appropriation includes $593 million of CHIMPS, similar to FY2013 but less than half of FY2012. Rescissions permanently cancel funds from previous appropriations laws to achieve budgetary savings, often related to unobligated balances for specific purposes appropriated a year or more ago. Rescissions in the FY2014 appropriation total $394 million, which is $51 million more than in FY2013. Rescissions are one-time or recurring savings from cancelling budget authority, preventing reallocation by future appropriations. They allow appropriators to limit authorized activities and reallocate resources. The historical perspective shows a decrease in rescission levels compared to previous years. The enacted FY2014 appropriation in P.L. 113-76 serves as the basis for comparison in this section on Agriculture appropriations. Discretionary funding peaked in FY2010, while mandatory nutrition spending has continued to increase. Inflation-adjusted data shows a small rise in mandatory spending and total appropriation since FY2012. Over the past 10 years, total Agriculture appropriations have grown at an average annualized rate of +5.3% per year. The total agriculture appropriation has grown at an average annual rate of +5.3% over the past 10 years. Mandatory spending has increased by +6.0% annually, while discretionary spending has increased by +2.2% annually. In FY2014, 19% of the appropriation was for discretionary spending, which decreased to 14% due to the faster rise in mandatory spending. Domestic nutrition programs, including child nutrition and SNAP, are mandatory, while WIC is discretionary. In FY2014, 75% of the total agriculture appropriation is for domestic nutrition programs, with most of the budget being mandatory spending in SNAP and child nutrition programs. Mandatory spending in domestic nutrition programs has increased at a +9.1% average annual rate over 10 years. The bill for non-nutrition rest has decreased at a -0.6% average annual rate over 10 years (-2.8% per year on an inflation-adjusted basis). Total discretionary Agriculture appropriations grew at +2.2% per year over the past 10 years, with the domestic nutrition portion showing a +3.9% average annual increase over 10 years (+1.6% per year on an inflation-adjusted basis). The Agriculture bill's discretionary portion has seen fluctuations in annual changes over the years, with a decline in its share relative to the entire federal budget from FY1995 to FY2009, before rising again post-recession. Nutrition programs' share also experienced fluctuations, declining from FY1995 to FY2008 but rising again by FY2014. The rest of the bill's share has steadily declined from FY2001 to FY2014. The mandatory share for nutrition in the federal budget has risen to about 2.7%, while the discretionary share remains steady at 0.2%. The rest of the bill, including crop insurance and conservation, has a mandatory share of about 0.6% and a declining discretionary share of about 0.4%. Farm bill spending on agricultural programs has been variable but generally declining since 2000. Agriculture appropriations as a percentage of GDP have risen to about 0.86% in FY2014 due to increased demand for nutrition programs. On a per capita basis, total Agriculture appropriations have increased from $250 in 1998 to $450 in FY2014. Nutrition programs have also risen steadily on a per capita basis. The Agriculture appropriations bill covers USDA, excluding the Forest Service, and accounts for nearly 95% of USDA's total appropriation. The bill includes various accounts for USDA's general administration. See tables for specific agency funding details. The FY2014 appropriation for USDA's general administration is $526 million, with most accounts increasing by roughly 7% from FY2013. The decrease in overall funding is mainly due to buildings and facilities rental and maintenance payments, offset by increases in other areas like the Office of Inspector General and Chief Information Officer. The House Appropriations Committee had proposed moving buildings and facilities rental payments into individual agency budgets. The Senate bill and final agreement did not move buildings and facilities rental payments into individual agency budgets as proposed. Appropriators noted that in FY2013, the department did not meet reporting expectations, including computer upgrades. USDA's research, education, and economics (REE) mission is carried out by four agencies: The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) conducts research on food and agriculture issues, the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) distributes funds to colleges of agriculture, the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) collects agricultural statistics. The USDA's research, education, and economics (REE) mission is carried out by four agencies: The Agricultural Research Service (ARS), the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), and the Economic Research Service (ERS). The FY2014 budget for the USDA REE mission area was $2.639 billion, with increases for ARS, ERS, and NIFA, but a decrease for NASS due to fewer activities for the agricultural census. The House-reported bill proposed $126 million less than the enacted amount, while the Senate-reported bill would have provided more funding. The FY2014 funding levels for USDA's research, education, and economics (REE) mission area saw increases for ARS, ERS, and NIFA, but a decrease for NASS. The House-reported bill proposed $126 million less than the enacted amount, while the Senate-reported bill would have provided more funding. None of the annual appropriations since FY2010 have included earmarks for REE-related activities. Appropriations to the REE mission area declined nearly 16% from FY2010 to FY2013, with concerns expressed by agricultural research stakeholders for long-term funding. The enacted FY2014 appropriation partially restores previous reductions, bringing funding levels back to FY2012 levels when adjusted for inflation. The enacted FY2014 appropriation provides $1.122 billion for USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS), a $106 million increase from FY2013. The amount is allocated to salaries and expenses only, with no resources for ARS buildings. The House and Senate proposed different amounts, but the final amount remained close to the enacted one. The appropriation also provided NIFA with $1.277 billion, a $135 million increase from FY2013. In FY2014, the enacted appropriation for NIFA was $1.277 billion, $135 million more than FY2013. Research and Education activities received $773 million, an $89 million increase (+13%) from FY2013. Extension Activities were appropriated $469 million, about $30 million more (+7%) than FY2013. Integrated Activities received 78% more (+$15 million) in FY2014 than FY2013. In FY2014, NASS received $161 million, $5.4 million less than FY2013 post-sequestration. $44.5 million is for the Census of Agriculture, $13 million less than FY2013. Other NASS activities received an $8 million increase. ERS received $78.1 million, nearly $7 million more than FY2013 post-sequestration. The funding for USDA's marketing and regulatory programs remains consistent with the Administration's request and Senate-reported bill, with slight variations in the House-reported bill. Three agencies, including APHIS, AMS, and GIPSA, carry out USDA's mission. APHIS is responsible for protecting agriculture from pests and diseases, responding to health issues, and facilitating trade through science-based standards. Key concerns include avian influenza, mad cow disease, bovine tuberculosis, and invasive plant pests. APHIS is responsible for protecting agriculture from plant pests and administering animal welfare programs. The FY2014 budget provides $821.7 million for APHIS salaries and expenses, with additional funding for buildings and facilities. The budget also authorizes APHIS to collect fees to cover costs for technical assistance and services. The FY2012 appropriations process reorganized and consolidated APHIS programs. Budget categories include plant health, animal health, wildlife services, regulatory services, safe trade, animal welfare, safeguarding, and agency management. $151.5 million is directed to Specialty Crop Pests, with funds allocated for field crop, rangeland ecosystem pests, and tree and wood pests. The enacted bill provides $20 million for citrus greening disease research and efforts to protect the citrus industry. It also includes $26.9 million for agriculture quarantine inspections and funding for the National Clean Plant Network and invasive honey bee pests. The enacted bill allocates $12.7 million for addressing cotton pests and implicitly approves language from House and Senate committee reports regarding pests like the Brown Marmorated Stink Bug, Potato Cyst Nematode, and Sudden Oak Death. The conferees do not support funding two separate accounts for Equine and Cervid Health and Sheep and Goat Health, directing APHIS to spend no less than $3 million. The enacted law allocates funding for various animal health activities, including $35.3 million for Animal Health Technical Services, $52.3 million for avian health, and $3 million for cervid health. Additionally, there is funding for the National Veterinary Stockpile, screwworm program, scrapie program, and wildlife damage management. The agreement also addresses feral swine management and supports increased funding for this issue. The agreement provides funding for feral swine management and encourages the development of non-hormonal contraceptives. It also supports the implementation of a new animal traceability system and requires quarterly reports to Congress on its progress. Additionally, the House report emphasizes support for USDA's National Poultry Improvement Plan and expects $50 million to be allocated for early plant pest and disease detection. The House and Senate committee reports express support for APHIS's wildlife damage management efforts. The Senate report also supports managing geese degradation on crops and assisting aquaculture producers. The House report allocates $27.6 million for the animal welfare program and encourages APHIS to consider new classifications for facility inspections. The enacted bill provides $4.3 million for information technology infrastructure and requires matching state funds for brucellosis eradication efforts. The House and Senate committee reports recommend matching state funds of at least 40% for brucellosis eradication programs and set limitations on aircraft operations and maintenance. They also urge APHIS to work with Homeland Security for cargo release at import facilities. Appropriators expect USDA to transfer funds for pest and disease eradication activities. OMB and appropriators have debated APHIS funding for years. The House and Senate committee reports recommend state funds matching of at least 40% for brucellosis eradication programs and set limitations on aircraft operations and maintenance. They urge APHIS to collaborate with Homeland Security for cargo release at import facilities. Appropriators expect USDA to transfer funds for pest and disease eradication activities. OMB and appropriators have long debated APHIS funding sources. Congressional appropriators have discussed whether APHIS should access USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation account for emergency plant and animal health funds or rely on annual USDA appropriations, as OMB suggests. The enacted agreement allocates $0.47 million for a contingency fund to control outbreaks of insects, plant diseases, animal diseases, and pest animals and birds during emergencies. The Agricultural Marketing Service administers programs to promote U.S. agricultural products in domestic and international markets. The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) receives appropriations in two ways: mandatory under Section 32 authority and discretionary. In FY2012, 82% of agency funding came from appropriations, while user fees and reimbursements accounted for 18%. These fees cover activities like product quality verification, commodity grading, and licensing under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act. Discretionary funds support various programs such as marketing news dissemination, pesticide residue data collection, and organic program implementation. The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) receives appropriations for various programs such as organic program implementation, surveillance for egg safety, country of origin labeling, and interstate shipment regulations. The FY2014 appropriation for AMS is $81.3 million, a 7.4% increase from FY2013 post-sequestration levels. This funding restores cuts made in FY2013 and is $3 million less than the Administration's request. Both the House and Senate agreed to eliminate $1.8 million in funding for the pesticide recordkeeping program. The conferees disapproved of AMS's implementation of the meat country of origin labeling rule due to high costs and potential retaliation by Canada and Mexico. They recommended delaying enforcement until the WTO case is completed. Conferees also directed AMS to explore ways to allow canned tuna in school nutrition programs. AMS's mandatory appropriation comes from the Section 32 account, which funded 70% of agency funding in FY2012. The Section 32 account, funded by a permanent appropriation of 30% of customs receipts, is used by AMS for various programs like child nutrition and surplus farm commodity purchases. The 2008 farm bill set a maximum annual amount of $1.266 billion for Section 32 funds in FY2014, with a mandate for funding the fresh fruit and vegetable program in schools. Additional purchases from Section 32 funds are required for fruit, vegetables, and nuts for domestic food assistance programs. The FY2014 appropriation provides $1.107 billion of Section 32 funds for AMS, the same as the House- and Senate-passed bills, compared to $1.05 billion in FY2013. These funds are used for commodity purchases, school lunch programs, disaster assistance, and farm price support. Rescissions of Section 32 carryover funds are used for budgetary savings, with a rescission of $189 million in prior year budget authority in FY2014. The FY2014 appropriations include $1.107 billion of Section 32 funds for AMS, with a rescission of $189 million from prior year budget authority. The appropriations act prohibits the use of Section 32 funds for direct payment to farmers and restricts USDA employees from carrying out certain activities. GIPSA oversees the marketing of various commodities and establishes standards for inspection and grading. The Grain Inspection Service sets standards for inspecting, weighing, and grading grain, rice, and other commodities. The Packers and Stockyards Program monitors livestock and poultry markets for fair competition. The FY2014 appropriation provides $40.3 million for GIPSA, $3.0 million more than FY2013. GIPSA can collect up to $50 million in user fees. Section 744 of the appropriation restricts GIPSA's rule on livestock and poultry marketing practices. The USDA is restricted from using funds to implement certain sections of a proposed rule on livestock and poultry marketing practices. These sections include definitions related to tournament systems, competitive injury, and likelihood of injury. Other provisions cover regulations on violations of the Packers and Stockyards Act, unfair practices, preferences, contracts, and the tournament system. The House-reported FY2014 agriculture appropriations bill (H.R. 2410) included language to restrict GIPSA's ability to finalize or implement the proposed rule on livestock and poultry contracts. The proposed GIPSA rule addresses competitive injury, unfair practices, and arbitration provisions for contract growers. Supporters believe it would bring fairness to marketing transactions, while opponents fear market disruption and increased litigation. The USDA's \"GIPSA Rule\" on Livestock and Poultry Marketing Practices has been a topic of debate, with supporters believing it would bring fairness to transactions, while opponents fear market disruption and increased litigation. Federal responsibility for food safety primarily lies with the FDA and USDA, with FDA overseeing the safety of most food products and USDA's FSIS regulating meat, poultry, and processed egg products. Funding and staffing levels for FDA and FSIS have historically been disproportionate to their food safety responsibilities. Funding and staffing levels for FDA and FSIS have historically been disproportionate to their food safety responsibilities. FSIS is responsible for 10%-20% of the U.S. food supply but receives 60% of the food safety budget, while FDA is responsible for 80%-90% of the food supply but receives only 40% of the budget. In FY2010, FSIS received $1.018 billion in funds plus $150 million in user fees, while FDA's budget was $783 million. Staffing levels also vary, with FSIS having around 9,400 FTEs compared to FDA's 3,400 FTEs for food-related activities. Funding for food safety has shifted between FDA and USDA, with increased appropriations for FDA food activities. The FDA's operating budget in FY2013 was $796.6 million, with additional funding from the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) and industry-paid user fees. FSMA authorized more appropriations and staff for FDA's future food safety activities. FSMA, the largest expansion of FDA's food safety authorities since the 1930s, increases inspection frequency at food facilities, tightens record-keeping requirements, extends oversight to certain farms, mandates product recalls, and requires food facilities to conduct safety plans. Despite Congress authorizing appropriations for FSMA, full funding for FDA activities was not provided. After FSMA was signed into law in January 2011, concerns were raised about funding for overhauling the U.S. food safety system. The Congressional Budget Office estimated implementing FSMA could increase federal spending by $1.4 billion over five years. New user fees authorized under FSMA include an annual fee for the voluntary qualified importer program and three fees for reinspection, recall, and export certification activities. No new facility registration fees were imposed. Prior to enactment, CBO estimated about $240 million in new fees would be collected. The FDA estimated that implementing new requirements under FSMA would cost $1.1 billion over five years, with an additional $400 million per year needed for full implementation. The FDA's Foods Program budget received $882.8 million in FY2014, $86 million more than the post-sequestration budget. FDA's staff was authorized to increase to 5,000 by FY2014. The enacted FY2014 budget for FDA's Foods Program is $882.8 million, which is $86 million more than the post-sequestration budget for FY2013. The budget assumes an additional $17 million in user fees under the foods program, including food recall fees, reinspection fees, export certification fees, and importer program fees. This amount is over $200 million less than the Administration's request, which projected a total need of $1.107 billion for FY2014, including proposed new fees justified by FSMA. The enacted FY2014 budget for FDA's Foods Program is $882.8 million, with additional user fees for food recall, reinspection, export certification, and importer program. The Administration's proposed new user fees were not included in the final agreement. The conferees also addressed provisions regarding FSMA and FDA's rules affecting farmers. The House committee expresses concern about FDA's estimation of implementation costs for the \"Preventive Controls for Human Food\" rule. They direct FDA to implement a comprehensive training program on regulations and address missed statutory deadlines under FSMA. Both House and Senate reports emphasize the need for funding research to monitor and protect against intentional adulteration of the food supply. The House report also urges FDA to maintain appropriate funding levels for FSMA activities and Food Safety Centers of Excellence. The FDA is directed to create a science-based food traceability initiative and establish a pilot project for importers with strong safety records. The Senate committee provides $53.5 million for FSMA implementation and requires FDA to publish a final seafood advisory. Additionally, FDA is directed to work with states and the Department of Commerce to combat fraud in the seafood industry. The House and Senate reports direct FDA to combat fraud in the seafood industry by revising standards for canned tuna and proper labeling of honey products. They also address antibiotic use in meat-producing animals through the National Antimicrobial Response Monitoring System. The House urges additional funding for the program and collaboration between FDA and USDA. The Senate directs FDA to enhance its annual summary of data reported under the Animal Drug User Fee Act. The final law addresses requirements regarding dietary supplements. The House report directs FDA to develop a final guidance on New Dietary Ingredients for Dietary Supplements. The Senate report encourages FDA to develop industry guidance for manufacturing botanical dietary supplements. The House committee expresses concern about the unpredictable pace of FDA's guidance and directs FDA to improve communication with stakeholders on future actions. The USDA's FSIS appropriations for FY2014 are $1.010 billion, $33 million more than FY2013. Laws governing FSIS include the FMIA, PPIA, and EPIA. Appropriations are allocated federal $893.7 million, state $62.7 million, international $15.9 million, Codex Alimentarius $3.8 million. The final agreement for USDA's FSIS appropriations for FY2014 includes funding allocations for federal, state, international, Codex Alimentarius, and Public Health Data Communications Infrastructure System. It does not approve user fees proposed by the Administration to recover increased costs. The agreement also mandates the implementation of a grading and inspection program for catfish and the maintenance of at least 148 FTEs for enforcing the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act. Additionally, it prohibits horse inspection under FMIA and the 1996 farm bill. The final law for FY2014 prohibits horse inspection under FMIA and the 1996 farm bill, as well as related implementation or enforcement of regulations. Inspectors hired for Humane Methods of Slaughter Act enforcement will oversee compliance with humane handling rules for live animals. FSIS is directed to provide annual reports on objective scoring methods under the Act. The House urges FSIS to work with tribes on voluntary slaughter programs for buffalo and bison, and to implement the HAACP-Based Inspection Models Project. The final law for FY2014 prohibits horse inspection under FMIA and the 1996 farm bill, as well as related implementation or enforcement of regulations. It also urges FSIS to implement the HAACP-Based Inspection Models Project (HIMP) proposed in 2012, shifting inspection responsibilities to poultry company employees. The law does not approve additional funding for the Cooperative Interstate Shipment program and limits building alteration costs to 10% of the current value. USDA's Farm Service Agency administers farm subsidy and disaster assistance programs, farm loan programs, conservation programs, and international food assistance and export support. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) administers various programs including farm subsidy, disaster assistance, conservation, and international food assistance. FSA receives funds for salaries, expenses, and administrative support from different sources within USDA. Administrative funds are consolidated into one account for FSA programs, with transfers received from other USDA agencies for specific programs like farm loan programs and export credit guarantees. Amounts transferred from the Foreign Agricultural Service for administrative support are not included in FSA totals. The enacted FY2014 appropriation provides $1.493 billion for FSA salaries and expenses, with a $89 million increase from FY2013. The joint explanatory statement directs USDA to seek outside funding to enhance the National Agriculture Imagery Program. USDA Farm Service Agency serves as a lender of last resort for family farmers. The FSA loans, funded by an annual appropriation, support farmers with real estate, operating expenses, and disaster recovery. Some loans have subsidized interest rates. The FY2014 appropriation includes $90 million for loan subsidies, supporting $5.527 billion in direct and guaranteed loans. Loan subsidy is tied to interest rate subsidies and projected losses from non-repayment. Total farm loan authority increased by $952 million from FY2013. Total farm loan authority for FY2014 is $952 million higher (+21%) than FY2013. Guaranteed loans see the most significant increase, with $500 million more for farm ownership loans and $115 million more for farm operating loans compared to FY2013. Direct loan authority also rises, with $226 million more for direct farm operating loans and $136 million more for direct farm ownership loans. Emergency loan authority increases to $35 million, up $13 million from FY2013. Boll weevil eradication loan authority is set at $60 million for FY2014, a reduction from previous years. In FY2014, Congress reduced FSA farm loan authority from $100 million, despite Administration requests for a lower level. Demand for FSA farm loans increased after the 2008 financial crisis, leading to rising loan authority. From FY2009-FY2013, loan authority decreased due to federal budget pressures and stabilized demand. However, high farm loan demand in certain programs sometimes exhausted the loan authority. The FY2014 loan authority restores funding levels closer to FY2009 and FY2010. The Commodity Credit Corporation funds mandatory subsidy payments for farmers. The 2014 farm bill authorizes spending for crop years 2014-2018. The CCC can borrow up to $30 billion from the U.S. Treasury to finance programs. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) borrows funds from the Treasury to finance various agricultural programs, including farm commodity subsidies, conservation, trade, food aid, and rural development. It also provides emergency supplemental spending for farm disaster payments, market loss payments, and disease eradication efforts. The CCC must eventually repay the borrowed funds and replenish its borrowing authority through congressional appropriations to avoid reaching its $30 billion debt limit. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) borrows funds from the Treasury to finance agricultural programs. The CCC must repay the borrowed funds and replenish its borrowing authority through congressional appropriations to avoid reaching its debt limit. The CCC has a \"current indefinite appropriation\" providing \"such sums as necessary\" during the fiscal year, making funding needs difficult to estimate. The appropriation may not always restore the line of credit to the previous year's level. The House and Senate bills request an indefinite appropriation of $12.5 billion for the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) for FY2014. The appropriation includes provisions limiting USDA's ability to provide marketing assistance loans for mohair and prohibiting the use of CCC funds for direct payments to farmers under certain conditions. The federal crop insurance program, administered by USDA's Risk Management Agency, offers free catastrophic insurance to producers of insurable crops. Producers can purchase additional coverage at a subsidized rate. Policies are sold through private insurance companies with losses reinsured by USDA. Annual Agriculture appropriations bills provide separate funding for the program. The federal crop insurance program, administered by USDA's Risk Management Agency, receives appropriations for salaries, expenses, and the Federal Crop Insurance Fund. The FY2014 appropriation includes $71.5 million for RMA expenses and $9.5 billion for the Fund, reflecting increased funding requirements due to losses from adverse weather events. The USDA administers agricultural conservation programs to assist landowners with natural resource concerns, including working land, retirement, and easement programs. The NRCS and FSA are the lead agencies, with funding from the CCC and omnibus farm bills. Additional discretionary funding for technical assistance comes from annual appropriations. The FY2014 appropriation for agricultural conservation programs increased discretionary NRCS funding by $45 million, accepting some proposed reductions and providing more than the Administration's request. Mandatory conservation program spending was reduced by $425 million, with several programs facing expiration. The Administration proposed a reduction of $511 million for agricultural conservation programs in FY2014, which is less than the House-passed bill but more than the Senate-passed bill. The FY2014 appropriation was enacted before the passage of the 2014 farm bill, resulting in changes to mandatory conservation program funding. Discretionary conservation programs are administered by NRCS, with most of the increase in funding going to Conservation Operations (CO). The enacted FY2014 appropriation provides $812.9 million for FY2014, $46.1 million more than FY2013. The conference report for FY2014 appropriation provides funding for various sub-programs under CO, including the Snow Survey, Plant Material Centers, Soil Survey, and Conservation Technical Assistance. It also includes funding for ongoing watershed projects and the Watershed Rehabilitation program. The program received $12 million, despite the Administration's proposal to terminate it. Additionally, $4 million was allocated to a previously-dormant Water program. The FY2014 appropriation includes $4 million for the Water Bank Program (WBP), which was reactivated after being dormant since FY1995. The WBP involves non-renewable 10-year contracts with landowners to maintain wetlands instead of using the land for agriculture. Funding for the program was reinstated in FY2012 with a focus on flood reduction in Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota. The FY2014 appropriation included $4 million for the Water Bank Program (WBP), which focused on flood reduction in Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota. The enacted FY2014 appropriation permanently cancels any remaining funds for the Resource Conservation and Development (RC&D) program, which was terminated in FY2011. Mandatory conservation programs are administered by NRCS and FSA, with about $5 billion in FY2014 coming from the CCC. The FY2014 appropriation reduces funding for mandatory conservation programs, including the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and the Watershed Rehabilitation Program. Congress has been cutting these programs annually since FY2003, with the enacted appropriations reducing them by $425 million. The savings from these reductions are not necessarily redirected to other conservation activities. The FY2014 appropriation reduced funding for mandatory conservation programs, including EQIP and the Watershed Rehabilitation Program. Reductions to conservation programs peaked in FY2012 with total CHIMPS of $929 million. Previous appropriations extended program authority without affecting baseline funding, but FY2014 appropriation not only extended the program by one fiscal year but also reduced final year funding. The FY2014 appropriation extended the program by one fiscal year and reduced final year funding, which did not result in savings immediately but could have impacted the overall farm bill baseline. The 2014 farm bill, enacted shortly after the appropriation, amended conservation programs, leading to different funding levels than initially reported. The FY2014 appropriation limited EQIP spending to $1.35 billion, resulting in savings of $272 million compared to the authorized $1.75 billion. The FY2014 appropriation resulted in savings of $272 million by reducing funding for EQIP to $1.35 billion. The Watershed Rehabilitation Program also saw savings of $153 million due to restrictions on mandatory funding. An additional $250 million was authorized for the program in FY2014, not subject to the appropriations limit. For FY2014, P.L. 113-76 provides $2.57 billion in discretionary budget authority for USDA's rural development programs, with potential reductions to meet sequestration requirements.

The FY2014 budget allocates $1.2 million more than FY2013 for the rural broadband program, with $4.5 million for direct loan subsidies and $10.4 million for grants. The subsidy level is lower than recommended by the House and Senate measures. Loan subsidies would support $34.5 million in broadband loans, which is less than requested by the Administration. Funding for domestic food assistance represents over two-thirds of USDA's budget, largely for open-ended mandatory programs like SNAP. The FY2014 budget allocates $108.6 billion for domestic food assistance programs, including SNAP, WIC, CSFP, and federal nutrition program administration. This amount is approximately $2 billion more than requested by the Administration and represents a 4.3% increase from FY2013.

The funding includes $79 billion for SNAP and related grants, $1.9 billion for other territories, $269 million for TEFAP commodities, $5 million for Community Food Projects, and $104 million for FDPIR. The FY2014 appropriation included $79 million for SNAP employment and training funds, with a subsequent increase to $90 million per year. The Joint Explanatory Statement addressed concerns about SNAP outreach activities and emphasized restrictions on the purchase of hot, prepared foods. Additionally, it highlighted the requirement for USDA reports as mandated by the House or Senate bills. Committee report language does not carry the same legal weight as the legislation itself. Appropriations under the child nutrition account fund various programs like the National School Lunch Program, School Breakfast Program, and Summer Food Service program. These funds also support food safety education initiatives and technical assistance for providers. The joint statement language does not have the force of law like the legislation itself. The enacted appropriation for FY2014 provides $19.3 billion for child nutrition programs, with funding allocated to programs like the National School Lunch Program, School Breakfast Program, CACFP, procurement of commodities, Summer Food Service program, and SAE. The Joint Explanatory Statement includes directives on Child Nutrition programs, implementing regulations from the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. USDA-FNS has issued regulations and guidance since the 2010 reauthorization, including nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods. Critics have raised concerns about the impact of these regulations. The Joint Explanatory Statement addresses concerns about new regulations for school lunch and breakfast programs. It allows states to grant waivers to school districts facing increased costs, providing technical assistance for implementation in future years. The Joint Explanatory Statement directs USDA to ensure compliance with eligibility guidelines for CACFP sites providing at-risk after-school snacks and suppers. It also aims to reduce error rates in the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program. The FY2014 appropriation includes $6.72 billion for WIC, with funding allocated for breast-feeding peer counselors, infrastructure, and management information systems. The WIC program is a discretionary program funded by Congress, with appropriations typically sufficient to serve all eligible individuals. Efforts to update WIC food packages have been ongoing for about 10 years. A recent directive in the appropriations law could impact the eligibility of white potatoes for purchase with WIC benefits. Efforts to update the WIC food packages have been ongoing for about 10 years. The current packages are based on federal requirements with different packages for pregnant women, post-partum women, infants, and children. The Institute of Medicine recommended including fresh fruits and vegetables in the packages, except for white potatoes, due to their widespread consumption. The controversy surrounding the restriction on white potatoes in the WIC program has led to discussions and legislative actions. While the enacted appropriations law does not specifically mention potatoes and WIC, there is a directive for the USDA to include all varieties of fresh vegetables in the food packages. The Joint Explanatory Statement allows USDA discretion in including vegetables with added sugars, fats, oils to meet special nutrition needs. USDA must report if not complying. Final WIC Food Packages rule excludes white potatoes despite opposition. The final rule excludes white potatoes from WIC Food Packages despite opposition, based on data showing starchy vegetable consumption meets recommended amounts. The Joint Explanatory Statement provides flexibility for states on authorizing new stores to accept WIC benefits. The Statement allows flexibility for states to authorize new stores for WIC benefits due to a backlog of applications.

The Act of 2009 provided pre-appropriated funding for an increase in SNAP benefits, which did not require an appropriation. The Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) administers overseas market promotion and export credit guarantee programs to enhance U.S. agriculture's competitiveness globally. FAS shares responsibility with USAID for international food aid programs. Annual agricultural appropriations provide most of FAS's financial resources, while other agricultural export and food aid programs have mandatory funding from the Commodity Credit Corporation. For FY2014, P.L. 113-76 appropriates $1.839 billion for FAS/USAID programs funded on a discretionary basis. For FY2014, the Administration requested $373 million for foreign agriculture-related activities, but congressional appropriators only provided $1.839 billion for FAS/USAID programs, which is $132.6 million higher than FY2013 levels. The Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) received $177.9 million for salaries and expenses, a 9% increase from FY2013. This funding supports FAS efforts in trade policy, trade promotion, and institutional capacity building.

Authorized by the 2014 farm bill, this program guarantees repayment of commercial loans in case of default. No budgetary outlays unless default occurs. Conferees accepted House report language directing submission of a report on outcome-based measures and resource allocation for promotion. FAS is changing resource allocation to promote U.S. agricultural goods. Senate report recommends funding for training programs for international scientists and policymakers. Food for Peace Title II Program is administered by USAID for international food aid. The Food for Peace Title II Program provides U.S. commodities for humanitarian and development needs abroad. In FY2014, $1.469 billion was appropriated for humanitarian food aid, an increase of $107 million from FY2013. Congress rejected the Administration's request to shift funding for food aid. No new funding has been requested for Title I or Title III activities since 2002. Funding allocations for Title II are influenced by a provision in the 2014 farm bill. The Food for Peace program received $1.469 billion in FY2014 for humanitarian food aid, with a provision limiting funds for reimbursement and requiring monitoring to ensure aid reaches intended beneficiaries. The 2008 farm bill authorized $60 million of CCC funds for nonemergency food aid. The 2008 farm bill authorized $60 million of CCC funds for a pilot project on local and regional food aid purchases for emergency relief, which expired in FY2012.

Additionally, the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program received $185.1 million in FY2014 for school feeding and maternal and child nutrition projects in developing countries. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) budget for FY2014 was $209.3 million, in line with the President's request and Senate-reported level. FDA's jurisdiction falls under the Subcommittee on Agriculture, reflecting its origins in the Department of Agriculture. FDA regulates food safety, cosmetics, drugs, biologics, medical devices, and tobacco products. The FDA's budget for FY2014 includes direct appropriations and user fees totaling $4.387 billion, with a $356 million increase from FY2013. The direct appropriation is $2.561 billion, a $175 million increase from FY2013, while user fees account for $1.827 billion. The FDA's FY2014 budget includes user fees totaling $181 million more than FY2013. The President's request also included $269 million for new fees, bringing the total user fee request to $2.1 billion and the total program level request to $4.654 billion. House and Senate Committees on Appropriations expressed concerns with specific FDA activities in their respective reports. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations expressed concerns with specific FDA activities in their reports. The reports included 34 statements directing and 39 statements encouraging specific actions, with most directed to the FDA. The directions and encouragements covered various FDA programs, with a focus on foods and agency-wide topics. While not legally binding, the committee reports convey the concerns of the committees to the agency. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees raised concerns about specific FDA activities in their reports, conveying the broad range of responsibilities Congress has given FDA. One key topic discussed was the treatment of user fee collections in sequester calculations under the Budget Control Act of 2011, potentially resulting in a loss of $83 million for the FDA. The FDA Commissioner estimated a potential loss of $83 million in user fees in FY2013 due to sequestration. Efforts were made to exempt fees from sequestration in FY2014, with committees working together to find a solution. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 addressed this issue in section 747. In FY2013, funds under the Department of Health and Human Services\u2014Food and Drug Administration were sequestered. The Administration was encouraged to reconsider including FDA user fees in sequester calculations. Table 19 shows budget authority and program levels for FDA from FY2010 to FY2014. The final column in Table 19 displays the percentage change from FY2013 to FY2014 for FDA program areas. Funding is allocated to specific FDA centers and user fee revenue is distributed according to the Administration's request. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) oversees regulatory activities independently. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is an independent regulatory agency overseeing derivatives markets, including futures exchanges and swaps markets. It was established in 1974 to regulate commodities futures and options markets, and the Dodd-Frank Act expanded its jurisdiction to include previously unregulated over-the-counter swaps markets. The CFTC's functions include preventing fraud, price manipulation, and ensuring investor protection. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) expanded its jurisdiction to include financial variables like interest rates and stock indexes through the Commodity Exchange Act. Following the 2008 financial crisis, reforms in the Dodd-Frank Act led to CFTC oversight of the swaps markets with an estimated notional value of $240 trillion in the US. This is in addition to the CFTC's existing jurisdiction over futures and options markets with an estimated $34 trillion notional value. Former CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler argued that the agency is understaffed and needs more funds to oversee the larger market, especially in reviewing swaps trades and monitoring newly-registered swap dealers. He emphasized the necessity of technology upgrades for market surveillance and customer fund protection programs. In FY2013, the CFTC's post-sequestration appropriation was $194 million. The CFTC's FY2014 appropriation is $215 million, up 10.8% from FY2013. USDA's budget is divided into mission areas, with food and nutrition programs comprising the largest area. The USDA's budget is divided into mission areas, with farm and foreign agricultural services being the second-largest area. This includes farm commodity price support, crop insurance, conservation programs, farm loans, and foreign food aid. Comparing USDA's organization and budget data to the Agriculture appropriations bill can be challenging as the mission areas may not always align with the bill's categories. Foreign agricultural assistance is a separate title in the appropriations bill but is included in USDA's \"farm and foreign agriculture\" mission area. The USDA's budget is divided into mission areas, with farm and foreign agricultural services being the second-largest area. Title I in the appropriations bill covers agricultural research, marketing and regulatory programs, food safety, and farm support. The Forest Service is funded separately in the Interior appropriations bill. Conservation programs in the appropriations bill are discretionary, while mandatory funding for conservation is included in Title I. The non-Forest Service part of USDA's natural resources mission area includes both discretionary and mandatory conservation programs. The Agriculture appropriations subcommittees have jurisdiction over appropriations for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The combined share of FDA and CFTC funding in the Agriculture and Related Agencies appropriations bill is about 2%. Jurisdiction over CFTC appropriations is assigned differently in the House and Senate, alternating each year. In even-numbered fiscal years, CFTC is in the Agriculture appropriations act, while in odd-numbered fiscal years, it is in the Financial Services appropriations act. These agencies have historical ties to agricultural markets, but non-agricultural issues have become more prominent. Some argue they no longer belong in the Agriculture appropriations bill, but others believe agriculture and food issues are still important. Recent focus includes food safety responsibilities at FDA and volatility in agricultural commodity markets at CFTC. In agricultural commodity markets, discretionary vs. mandatory spending is a key focus at CFTC and in Congress. Discretionary spending is controlled annually through appropriations acts, while mandatory programs are advanced based on action by authorizing committees in the farm bill. Eligibility for mandatory programs is written into authorizing laws, with about 14% of the Agriculture appropriations bill for discretionary programs and the remaining 86% classified as mandatory in FY2014. The USDA's budget consists of discretionary and mandatory funds, with most agency operations funded by discretionary funds. Major discretionary programs include conservation, rural development, nutrition programs like WIC and SNAP, food aid, and regulatory programs. Mandatory spending is primarily for food and nutrition programs like SNAP and child nutrition, farm commodity support, crop insurance, and agricultural conservation and trade programs. The federal crop insurance program, agricultural conservation, and trade programs are funded through mandatory spending. The 2014 farm bill sets policies for these programs. Mandatory spending decisions are made outside the appropriations debate but are included in the annual Agriculture appropriations act. Budget enforcement for mandatory programs is governed by the Congressional Budget Office baseline. SNAP and child nutrition programs are funded based on projected spending needs. SNAP is an \"appropriated entitlement\" that requires annual appropriation, while the Commodity Credit Corporation operates on a line of credit with the Treasury. Budget authority, obligations, outlays, and program levels are important terms in federal spending discussions. Budget authority is the money Congress allows agencies to spend, obligations are the funds committed by agencies, and outlays represent actual spending. Budget authority is the money Congress allows agencies to spend. Obligations are the funds committed by agencies, and outlays represent actual spending. Program level is the sum of activities supported by an agency, which may exceed budget authority due to various factors like user fees and loans. In the past 20 years, Agriculture appropriations bills were enacted as stand-alone measures nine times and omnibus appropriations were used nine times. Year-long continuing resolutions were used twice. Subcommittee drafts are passed every year in both the House and Senate. House subcommittee passage usually occurs in May or June, while Senate subcommittee action often follows in June. The Agriculture appropriations bill process typically starts with subcommittee action in May or June in the House, followed by the Senate in June or July. The House Appropriations committee reports a bill almost every year, while the Senate does so consistently. Floor action in both chambers is less predictable, with some years seeing no action. The last stand-alone Agriculture appropriation bill was in FY2010, and the last significant bill was in FY2012. The Agriculture appropriations bill process typically starts with subcommittee action in May or June in the House, followed by the Senate in June or July. The last stand-alone Agriculture appropriation bill was in FY2010, and the last significant bill was in FY2012. Key Policy Staff listed the public laws and dates of action for various steps in each year's appropriations process."
