    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Water Desalination Act of 1994\". It declares the policy regarding water desalination. The United States aims to conduct research to develop low-cost alternatives for desalination and water reuse to meet water needs and environmental goals. The United States aims to develop low-cost alternatives for desalination and water reuse to conserve and increase water resources on a large scale. The United States aims to develop low-cost alternatives for desalination and water reuse to conserve and increase water resources on a large scale. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms related to desalination and water treatment, including desalination techniques, saline water sources, the United States' definition, and usable water quality standards. The Act defines key terms related to desalination and water treatment, including techniques, sources, quality standards, and the term \"Secretary\" referring to the Secretary of the Interior. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF RESEARCH AND STUDIES. The Secretary is authorized to award grants and contracts for research on converting saline or contaminated water into usable water. Research topics include investigating desalination processes, cost analysis, and optimal design for different conditions. The Secretary is authorized to award grants and contracts for research on converting saline or contaminated water into usable water, including determining the best designs for different conditions, increasing economic efficiency through dual-purpose facilities, conducting technical work for desalting processes, and studying methods for byproduct recovery. Recommendations and reports to Congress on desalination projects are required within three years of the Act's enactment. The Secretary is authorized to recommend desalination projects to Congress for further evaluation and implementation. The Secretary may engage personnel, firms, laboratories, and educational institutions for research and studies. A desalination conference must be held within 12 months of the Act's enactment. The Secretary, along with the United States Agency for International Development, will organize a desalination conference involving experts from various sectors to explore affordable desalination technologies and propose a research agenda for future development activities. SEC. 5. DESALINATION DEMONSTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT. The Secretary shall administer a program for water desalination and related activities, including designing desalination plants, studying byproducts, and conducting economic surveys on water production costs. The program administers water desalination activities, including cost studies for producing water through desalination compared to other methods. Federal participation can be through cooperative agreements with non-Federal entities to develop recommendations for utilizing desalting technologies. SEC. 6. Participation by agencies and interested persons includes coordination with various federal agencies, states, and private entities. Information from studies funded under this Act is public. SEC. 7. Technical and administrative assistance is provided. SEC. 7. The Secretary can accept technical and administrative assistance from States and agencies for desalting water projects, and may share costs through contracts or agreements. SEC. 8. COST SHARING. The Federal share of the cost of research, study, or demonstration projects under this Act shall not exceed 50 percent. The Secretary will implement appropriate procedures. Costs of operation and maintenance will be non-Federal responsibilities. SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations for sections 4 and 5 of the Act includes $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1995 and $10,000,000 annually from 1996 to 1999 for section 4, with up to $1,000,000 for research grants to higher education institutions. For section 5, $50,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 1996 through 1999. Additionally, drought relief is provided for Madera-Chowchilla Power Authority hydroelectric projects. Section 103 of the Reclamation States Emergency Drought Relief Act of 1991 is amended to authorize loans for the Madera-Chowchilla Power Authority to assist with hydroelectric facilities impacted by drought. Loans for this purpose will be under terms deemed appropriate by the Secretary. Title XVI of the Reclamation Projects Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992 is amended to include a new section, SEC. 1618, regarding the Orange County Regional Water Reclamation Project. The Secretary is authorized to participate in the Orange County Regional Water Reclamation Project to treat wastewater effluent, reduce demand for imported water, and reduce sewage discharge into the ocean. The Secretary's cost share will not exceed 25% of the total project cost, and funds will not be provided for operation or maintenance. Up to $250,000 is authorized for project design. The House of Representatives passed the bill on October 3, 1994."
