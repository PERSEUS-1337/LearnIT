Wahhabism, a puritanical Sunni sect, has played a significant role in the resurgence of Islam in Asia. Sufism, a more mystical variant, is present in parts of South Asia. The decline of Islamic power led to two key schools of thought within Islam. The decline of Islamic power led to two key schools of thought within Islam. The traditionalist school blamed moral laxity for the decline and called for an Islamic revival, while reformers believed modernization was necessary. The struggle over values includes how to balance cultural heritage with modernization without Westernization. Analysts suggest that the West should align with moderate elements in the Islamic world against extremists without being perceived as a threat. The United States is seen as a threat to the Islamic world due to its association with globalization and a globalizing culture. Muslim elites in Asia are disconnected from their populations, leading to a decrease in the popularity of US foreign policy. The perception of the US-led war against terror as a war against Islam limits cooperation with Muslim states. Widespread Muslim opposition to US policy on the Arab-Israeli conflict exacerbates the problem. The Islamic revival is reshaping the region. The Islamic revival in Asia is changing political Islam, with a distinction between revivalists and Islamists seeking to transform the state. Some Southeast Asians are adopting a more radical form of Islam influenced by the Middle East, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. The Islamic revival in Asia is leading to a new, militant form of Islam that is anti-American or anti-Western. There are violent extremists among returned Southeast and South Asians who were involved in the war in Afghanistan. These individuals have spread extremist ideology and connected with local Muslim extremist groups. Policies should aim to contain extremism while supporting the social and economic aspirations of the Muslim majority in Asia. Islamic extremism and terrorist organizations in South Asia have extensive connections compared to Southeast Asia. The presence of Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan has strengthened connections with terrorist organizations in South Asia, including Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad. Extremist groups like the Taliban have provided sanctuary to Al Qaeda, leading to Sunni-Shiite conflicts in Pakistan. Islamist political parties control a significant portion of Pakistan's legislature and operate militant anti-Western madrassas. In South Asia, Islamist groups have connections to terrorist organizations. In Pakistan, Al Qaeda fighters escaped to Bangladesh after the fall of Afghanistan. In India, inter-communal strife exists between Hindus and Muslims, with Pakistani-based groups operating in Kashmir. In Southeast Asia, groups like MILF and Abu Sayyaf in the Philippines show linkages to international terrorist networks. Jemaah Islamiya in the region seeks to establish a terrorist organization. In Southeast Asia, terrorist organizations like Jemaah Islamiya (JI) with ties to Al Qaeda seek to establish Islamic law. Lashkar Jihad and Lashkar Jundullah incited inter-communal strife in Indonesia, while Kampulan Mujahidin Malaysia (KMM) was established by Afghan war veterans. Separatists in Thailand's Muslim provinces and China's Uighur Muslims are also notable in the region. The Uighur minority in Xinjiang Province, China, numbering 17.5 to 36 million Muslims, seeks autonomy amidst Han-Chinese in-migration. The debate on the Islamic revival in Asia questions if increased religious fervor will lead to extremism or political power. Karen Armstrong suggests a better understanding of Islam to combat extremism. The debate on the Islamic revival in Asia questions if increased religious fervor will lead to extremism or political power. Recent developments in Malaysia and Indonesia show that radical Islamist parties have not gained broad appeal among voters despite a resurgence of Islamic belief. In the 2004 elections, secular parties in Malaysia faced setbacks to the Barisan National Coalition led by Prime Minister Badawi, an Islamic scholar. Islamist parties in Indonesia, like the Prosperous Justice Party, gained support for their anti-corruption policies. While Islam remains important, voters in both countries prefer secular and nationalist parties. Some fundamentalists in Southeast Asia seek to implement strict Islamic law without violence, focusing on regional rather than international goals. Alienation and humiliation are key factors driving the Islamic resurgence in Asia. Some analysts believe frustration from economic malaise, lack of political participation, and humiliation are core reasons for radicalization among Asian Muslims. U.S. policies may assist by promoting a model of tolerant and modernist Islam. Some believe U.S. policies can help by supporting moderate elements in Asia to address economic and political issues, education, governance, and civil peace to prevent radicalization among Asian Muslims. This approach aims to reduce support for extremists and terrorists by addressing the root causes of alienation."
