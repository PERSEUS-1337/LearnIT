    "content": "Oil is a dominant source of energy in the United States, accounting for approximately 37% of total energy consumption in 2016. It is widely used in transportation, industrial, and residential sectors, with vast quantities continuously moving throughout the country. This report provides information on oil spills, including prevention, response, liability, and compensation. Oil spills can come from various sources, with some releasing small amounts regularly and others releasing large volumes in rare incidents. Major oil well blowouts, like the IXTOC I in 1979, have caused some of the largest unintentional spills in history. The Atlantic Empress spill in 1979 off the coast of Tobago was one of the largest oil tanker spills. These incidents have different environmental impacts and challenges for responders and policymakers. Two major U.S. oil spills with lasting repercussions: 1. 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill released over 100 million gallons of oil in the Gulf of Mexico. 2. 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill released approximately 11 million gallons in Prince William Sound, Alaska. Cleanup efforts lasted for six months. Cleanup efforts for the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill lasted for six months until the U.S. Coast Guard suspended operations due to weather conditions. Efforts resumed in 1990 and 1991. The spill had far-reaching consequences, leading to changes in public perception of the oil industry. Data collection on oil spills is fragmented, making it challenging to draw lessons from the information available. The assessment of oil spill volume and frequency requires data collection from various sources, including the U.S. Coast Guard and PHMSA. Combining data from these sources may be problematic due to overlapping incidents and varying collection processes. The Coast Guard maintains an Oil Spill Compendium with spill data within its jurisdiction. The number of oil spill incidents and spill volume between 2002 and 2016 from data provided by the Coast Guard is illustrated in Figure 1. The data include incidents from vessels, facilities, and pipelines, with a notable exclusion of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill due to its massive volume. The figure shows a decrease in incidents over time, with relatively consistent oil spill volumes except for a few large incidents. The volume of oil spills has remained consistent over the years, with significant incidents such as the Deepwater Horizon in 2010 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 led to a decline in annual oil spill volumes, particularly from tankers and barges, due to increased federal response authority and spill liability. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 led to a decline in annual oil spill volumes, particularly from tankers and barges, due to increased federal response authority and spill liability. PHMSA collects oil spill data for pipelines and rail transportation, showing fluctuations in incidents and spill volumes between 2002 and 2016. Pipeline incidents increased between 2011 and 2014 but have since decreased, with spill volumes varying depending on the number and size of major spills in specific years. The increase in rail incidents, including large spills between 2010 and 2014, raised concerns among policymakers, with some linking it to the debate over the Keystone XL pipeline. Notable spikes in rail spill volumes were seen in 2013 and 2015 due to major incidents, but overall incidents decreased in 2015 and 2016 as crude oil transportation by rail decreased. The comparison between pipeline and rail transportation in terms of crude oil spill frequency and volume is illustrated in two figures. Rail incidents exceeded pipeline incidents in most years, with many involving small volumes of spilled oil. The volume of oil spilled per volume of oil transported was higher for rail in four of the last seven years. The comparison between pipeline and rail transportation shows that in four of the last seven years, the volume of oil spilled per gallon transported was higher for rail than pipeline. The impacts of an oil spill depend on various factors and can cause harm to organisms and populations over different time scales. Oil spills can have acute (short-term) and chronic (long-term) effects. Oil spills can have acute effects on various organisms, including reduced reproduction, altered development, impaired feeding mechanisms, and decreased defense from disease. Birds, marine mammals, bottom-dwelling and intertidal species, and organisms in their developmental stages are particularly vulnerable. Additionally, oil spills can disrupt the structure and function of ecosystems, especially in habitats like coral reefs, mangrove swamps, and salt marshes. Chronic exposure to oil contaminants can significantly impact the survival and reproductive success of marine birds and mammals. Determining the precise effects on species and ecosystems due to chronic oil exposure is challenging for scientists due to various factors. Exposure to oil contaminants can impact survival and reproduction of marine birds and mammals. Chronic effects studies face debate and controversy over ecosystem recovery definitions. NOAA regulations define recovery as returning injured resources to baseline, not necessarily pre-spill conditions. Restoration considers trends like species decline due to changing water temperatures. Restoration allows for site-specific interpretation. The economic costs of an oil spill can be categorized into cleanup expenses, natural resource damages, and economic losses to the affected community. Cleanup costs vary based on location characteristics, oil type, and volume. Areas with less water movement may cost more to clean up, while some locations have natural oil-degrading micro-organisms. Sensitive habitats like coral reefs may require more stringent cleanup efforts. Destinations or sensitive habitats, such as coral reefs, may require stricter cleanup standards, increasing costs. Political and social culture at the spill site also play a role, with high-profile areas receiving special attention and extensive media coverage. Authorities in these locations may impose extensive oil spill response requirements, influencing cleanup costs. Cleanup costs in the United States are notably higher than in other parts of the world, with persistent and viscous oil types being more expensive to clean up. Gasoline and lighter refined products may require minimal cleanup action. Cleanup costs for oil spills are influenced by various factors such as spill volume, location, and environmental impacts. While larger spills may require a larger cleanup effort, smaller spills can be more costly to clean up on a per-gallon basis. The responsible party is liable for any loss of natural resources and services caused by the spill. Natural resource trustees assess damages to resources and services after a spill. Trustees include officials from federal, state, tribal, and foreign governments. A lead administrative trustee coordinates activities and can request funding from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 determines the measure of natural resource damages. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 determines natural resource damages, including costs for restoring, rehabilitating, or acquiring equivalent resources. NOAA developed regulations for damage assessments in 1996, covering direct and passive use values. Damages are compensatory, not punitive, and must be used to restore lost resources. NOAA's regulations focus on the costs of primary and compensatory restoration after an oil spill. The spill can disrupt local businesses, such as fishing and tourism, and impact regional industries. Local infrastructure and services, like port operations and power plants, can also be affected. The Salem Nuclear Plant had to halt operations due to a large oil spill in the Delaware River in 2004. The Exxon Valdez spill in 1989 led to the creation of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 to address oil pollution in the United States. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) consolidated federal oil spill laws, expanded liability provisions, and clarified the federal government's role in oil spill response and cleanup. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 amended the Clean Water Act to give the President authority to immediately perform cleanup using federal resources for oil spills. The federal government, through the On-Scene Coordinator, determines the level of cleanup required, with the final decision to end cleanup resting with the federal government. States may require further cleanup but without federal funding support. The National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP) was established in 1968 after the Torrey Canyon oil spill. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 expanded the NCP's role and established a multi-layered planning and response system for oil spills in marine environments. The act also required the President to establish procedures for worst-case oil spill scenarios. For more details on the NCP, refer to CRS Report R43251, Oil and Chemical Spills: Federal Emergency Response Framework. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 amended the Clean Water Act to require oil spill response plans for U.S. tank vessels and facilities. These plans must outline how to respond to a worst-case spill scenario, with vessels able to call upon necessary equipment and personnel through contracts. Non-tank vessels were also required to comply with this regulation in 2004. The 2004 amendment required non-tank vessels over 400 gross tons to prepare and submit a vessel response plan, aligning U.S. law with international standards for oil spill prevention. The debate over double hulls as a safety measure was a significant issue prior to the Oil Pollution Act, with proponents arguing for extra protection and opponents raising concerns about potential stability problems. The Oil Pollution Act (OPA) required new vessels carrying oil in U.S. waters to have double hulls, with exceptions based on vessel size and use. Older vessels had a retrofitting schedule based on age and size. Single-hull vessels (with some exceptions) were banned from operating in U.S. waters as of January 2010. OPA unified liability provisions for oil spills, holding responsible parties liable for any discharge from a vessel. The Oil Pollution Act (OPA) expanded liability for oil spills, making responsible parties liable for any discharge of oil from a vessel or facility to navigable waters, adjoining shorelines, or the exclusive economic zone of the United States. OPA broadened the scope of damages for which an oil spiller would be liable, including cleanup costs, injury to natural resources, loss of personal property, loss of subsistence use of natural resources, and lost revenues. The Oil Pollution Act (OPA) expanded liability for oil spills, making responsible parties liable for any discharge of oil from a vessel or facility to navigable waters, adjoining shorelines, or the exclusive economic zone of the United States. OPA broadened the scope of damages for which an oil spiller would be liable, including cleanup costs, injury to natural resources, loss of personal property, loss of subsistence use of natural resources, and lost revenues. OPA provided limited defenses from liability such as act of God, act of war, and act or omission of certain third parties. Liability limits for cleanup costs and other damages were set, with regulations to adjust the limits every three years to account for inflation using the consumer price index (CPI). The Oil Pollution Act (OPA) expanded liability for oil spills, making responsible parties liable for any discharge of oil from a vessel or facility to navigable waters, adjoining shorelines, or the exclusive economic zone of the United States. OPA broadened the scope of damages for which an oil spiller would be liable, including cleanup costs, injury to natural resources, loss of personal property, loss of subsistence use of natural resources, and lost revenues. Liability limits were adjusted in 2006 through the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act, with different categories and scopes of liability based on vessel size measured in gross tonnage. The liability limits for oil spill damages vary based on vessel size and facility type. Removal costs are not limited for offshore facilities, while onshore facilities and deepwater ports have limits for both removal costs and damages. The Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006 adjusted liability limits for vessels. Prior to the Oil Pollution Act (OPA), federal funding for oil spill response was insufficient, making damages recovery challenging for private parties. The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund (OSLTF) was created by Congress to supplement the expanded range of covered damages under the Oil Pollution Act (OPA). The National Pollution Funds Center (NPFC) was established by the Coast Guard to manage the trust fund in 1991. The fund can be used for various purposes, including prompt payment of costs for responding to oil spills, payment for assessing injuries to natural resources, compensating parties for removal costs and damages, and covering government revenue losses and increased public services. The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund (OSLTF) was established by Congress in 1986 but was not funded until after the Exxon Valdez incident. The fund is used for various purposes, including responding to oil spills, assessing natural resource injuries, compensating for removal costs and damages, and covering government revenue losses. Funding for the OSLTF comes from a 5-cent-per-barrel tax on the oil industry, which was temporarily suspended in 1994 but resumed in 2006. The tax rate was increased to 8 cents in 2008 and to 9 cents in 2017. The tax rate for the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund (OSLTF) increased to 8 cents in 2008 and to 9 cents in 2017. The fund is projected to have a balance of $5.4 billion at the end of FY2017. Vessels and offshore facilities must maintain evidence of financial responsibility for oil spill cleanup and damages. Liability limits differ by potential source, with the Coast Guard and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management implementing these requirements. The liability limits for vessels and offshore facilities differ based on potential sources of oil spills. Vessels must demonstrate maximum liability under OPA Section 1004, while offshore facilities in federal waters must show $35 million financial responsibility, with a possible increase to $150 million. Federal regulations in 30 C.F.R. Part 254 govern these provisions. The federal regulations in 30 C.F.R. Part 254 determine the financial responsibility amount for facilities based on worst-case discharge volume, ranging from $35 million to $150 million. Other federal laws, such as the Clean Water Act, also have provisions related to oil spills. These laws were in place before the Oil Pollution Act (OPA) and continue to apply. The Clean Water Act (CWA) prohibits the discharge of oil or hazardous substances into U.S. navigable waters and includes penalty provisions for noncompliance. The EPA established spill prevention control and countermeasure (SPCC) plans in 1973 to prevent oil discharges from non-transportation, onshore facilities with certain oil storage capacities. SPCC plans focus on prevention rather than response activities. SPCC plans prioritize prevention by requiring secondary containment for oil-storage equipment. Regulatory amendments were proposed after the 1973 rulemaking, with significant changes made in July 2002. Compliance deadlines were extended multiple times, with farms given until May 10, 2013, to comply. The 2002 final rule and subsequent revisions maintained the requirement for facility owners to implement SPCC plans. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) of 1953 governs oil development in federal waters, with regulations implemented by BOEM and BSEE. The U.S. pipeline network includes over 160,000 miles of hazardous liquid pipelines. Owners of facilities, including farms, must maintain SPCC plans in compliance with regulations. The Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Act of 1979 and the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2006 regulate oil pipelines in the United States, with the Department of Transportation overseeing spill response planning and safety practices. Federal laws address oil pollution from vessels as well. Several federal laws address oil pollution from vessels, including laws on navigation, vessel design standards, and specific construction and equipment requirements for oil tankers. These laws were enacted to align with international initiatives, with many written to implement international conventions. Coastal states share jurisdiction over coastal waters with the United States, as established by the 1953 Submerged Lands Act. The 1953 Submerged Lands Act gave coastal states jurisdiction over submerged lands and natural resources within 3 nautical miles off the coastline. Federal government regulates commerce, navigation, defense, power production, and international affairs within state waters. Oil spill legal framework involves multiple federal agencies responsible for response, cleanup, prevention, and preparedness. National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan outlines federal requirements for oil spill response. The National Contingency Plan (NCP) outlines federal requirements for responding to oil spills and hazardous substance releases. It was first developed in 1968 and has been amended by subsequent laws such as the Clean Water Act, CERCLA, and the Oil Pollution Act. The NCP establishes the National Response System (NRS) for coordinating national response strategies, with key components including the National Response Team (NRT). The National Response Team (NRT) is composed of federal representatives for oil spill response. Regional Response Teams (RRTs) include regional members and local governments. Area Committees (ACs) prepare Area Contingency Plans. The On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) directs response efforts. Coast Guard handles coastal spills, EPA covers inland spills. OSC has ultimate authority in oil spill response. The On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) has the ultimate authority to ensure effective oil spill removal and prevention of further discharge. The OSC directs and coordinates response activities of federal, state, local, and private entities, consulting with designated trustees and the governor. Other agencies like the EPA may provide support during response activities. During the Deepwater Horizon spill response, EPA and NOAA conducted air and water sampling, provided environmental monitoring support, and scientific analysis. NOAA experts collected data to assess natural resource damages. Prevention and preparedness duties are determined by potential sources of oil spills, with various agencies responsible for implementing regulations. Prevention and preparedness responsibilities for oil spills involve assessing equipment, developing contingency plans, and conducting personnel training. Agencies like NOAA and the Coast Guard play key roles in ensuring readiness and response capabilities. International and domestic laws also influence spill response efforts. The relationship between international and domestic law in responding to oil spills can be complex. International agreements may require implementing legislation for domestic legal effect. Federal laws on oil spills implement obligations from international agreements, with the International Maritime Organization playing a key role in setting standards for oil-carrying vessels. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) sets global maritime safety and pollution standards, with the Coast Guard representing the US at IMO meetings. Two key conventions related to oil pollution in coastal waters are the 1973 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL 73/78) and its Annex I on oil pollution control. MARPOL applies to vessels from signatory nations, regardless of where they sail, with member nations responsible for enforcing its requirements. The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) Annex I, enforced through the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS), requires vessels to have equipment like oil-water separators and shipboard oil pollution emergency plans (SOPEPs) to control oil discharges at sea. SOPEPs provide guidance for onboard emergency procedures during oil spills, while the United States Coast Guard enforces APPS regulations for all U.S.-flagged and foreign-flagged vessels in U.S. waters or ports. The Coast Guard inspection program is crucial for oil spill prevention efforts. The 1967 Torrey Canyon spill prompted international debate on response protocols for spills from foreign vessels. The Intervention on the High Seas Act of 1974 was passed to address these concerns. The Coast Guard can take action to prevent pollution of the sea by convention oil if there is a grave danger to the coastline. Before the passage of OPA in 1990, states had their own oil spill liability laws. The debate over preempting state laws was a major obstacle to enacting unified oil spill legislation. Proponents argued for preemption to avoid conflicting state laws, while opponents believed states should set their own standards. In the aftermath of the Exxon Valdez spill, the OPA Section 1018 \"savings clause\" allows states to impose additional liability for oil spills. Some states have unlimited liability laws. Concerns were raised about states regulating federal matters like oil tanker construction, but a 1978 Supreme Court decision clarified federal and state authority in regulating the shipping industry. The Court found that a Washington State law regulating oil tanker design and movement in Puget Sound was preempted. Federal and state jurisdiction boundaries continue to be tested, with recent cases ruling against state laws affecting tanker design and personnel qualifications. The primary federal authorities in effect during the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989 included the Clean Water Act. The Clean Water Act established requirements for oil spill reporting, response, and liability, creating the 311 Fund for cleanup and restoration. The Deepwater Port Act addressed oil spills at deepwater ports, setting up the Deepwater Port Fund for cleanup and damages. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act covered spills from the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, creating a trust fund for response and damages. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments (1978) established an oil spill liability structure and created the Offshore Pollution Fund. The National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP) outlines federal procedures for responding to oil spills and hazardous substance releases. Critics argue that these laws are ineffective and have perceived shortcomings. Prior to the Exxon Valdez incident, Congress attempted to enact a unified oil pollution law for over 15 years, facing deadlocks due to contentious issues like state preemption and liability questions. Debate also arose over whether oil-carrying vessels should be required to have double hulls. The shipping industry raised concerns about implementing a mandate for double hulls to prevent oil spills, fearing disruptions to oil transportation and the national economy. There were also concerns about the interaction between domestic and international legislation regarding liability limits in the 1980s. Joining international agreements was seen as crucial for the United States due to the global nature of oil transportation and pollution."
