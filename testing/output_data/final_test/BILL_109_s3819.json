    "content": "The Act titled \"Strengthening the Safety Net Act of 2006\" allows for the redistribution and extended availability of unexpended Medicaid DSH allotments. The Social Security Act is amended to allow for the redistribution and extended availability of unexpended Medicaid DSH allotments starting from fiscal year 2007. Starting from fiscal year 2007, there will be a redistribution pool of $150,000,000 from unexpended State DSH allotments for fiscal year 2004. This amount increases to $250,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 and $400,000,000 for fiscal year 2009 and beyond. The text discusses the reduction of unexpended State DSH allotments if a State claims Federal financial participation for a payment adjustment. The Secretary will reduce amounts available for redistribution pool and grants if unexpended State DSH allotments are insufficient for fiscal year requirements. The Secretary will allot the redistribution pool among eligible States annually, giving priority to certain eligible States. Expenditures under the State plan for disproportionate share hospital adjustments for fiscal year 2000 is greater than 0. The redistribution pool will be allotted among eligible States annually, with priority given to certain eligible States. The redistribution pool established for a fiscal year will not be included in the State's DSH allotment calculation. The funds will remain available for expenditure by the State for up to two fiscal years. The funds can only be used for payment adjustments to disproportionate share hospitals as required. The term 'eligible State' refers to a state that has spent at least 90% of its State DSH allotment for a fiscal year by the following fiscal year. The 'State DSH allotment per medicaid enrollee and uninsured individual' is the amount allocated for a fiscal year. The State DSH allotment for a fiscal year is divided by the total number of individuals who received medical assistance and the number of State residents with no health insurance coverage for that fiscal year, as determined by the Census Bureau. The national average DSH allotment per Medicaid enrollee and uninsured individual is calculated by dividing the total State DSH allotments by the sum of the total number of individuals. The State DSH allotment for a fiscal year is determined by the total number of individuals who received medical assistance and the number of State residents without health insurance coverage, as determined by the Census Bureau. SEC. 3. HEALTH SERVICES FOR THE UNINSURED. Demonstration grants will be awarded to health access networks by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to improve access, quality, and continuity of care for uninsured individuals through better coordination of care. The number of grants awarded will be limited to ensure that grantees can provide patient care services to a specified number of uninsured individuals. Health access networks are defined as collections of safety net providers organized to improve care for the uninsured and underinsured. They offer various levels of care within a community or across a service region. This definition includes networks and plans that meet certain criteria. The term \"health access network\" encompasses networks and plans that meet specific funding requirements. It also includes integrated health care systems, which are organized to provide coordinated care and ensure access to a full range of services for uninsured and under-insured individuals. The health access network must submit a plan detailing how they will manage costs, improve access to healthcare services, enhance quality and coordination of care, and improve the health status of uninsured and under-insured individuals. The health access network must submit a plan with measurable goals to improve the health status and reduce disparities in uninsured and underinsured individuals. Payment of grant funds for patient care services will be contingent upon achieving these targets. The health access network receiving funds must allocate at least 90% for patient care services and up to 10% for operational and development purposes to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. The term \"direct patient care services\" for health access networks refers to specialty medical care and diagnostic services not readily available through network providers. Networks should prioritize purchasing these services from safety net providers for uninsured and underinsured individuals. Funds granted to health access networks should supplement, not replace, other federal or state payments supporting healthcare for low-income or uninsured patients. As of fiscal year 2007, unexpended State DSH allotments are transferred for grants under this section. The amounts available for grants each year are determined by redistribution pool amounts under the Social Security Act."
