    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"International and Foreign Language Studies Act of 2005\". Congress finds that the increasing foreign language needs in the Federal Government are due to security threats, globalization, and the emergence of new nation states. American businesses also require employees with international and multicultural experience to compete globally. In 2005, 34,000 Federal employees across 70 agencies needed foreign language skills. Translator and interpreter shortages have impacted agency operations and the U.S. military. The United States Army faced translator shortages in critical languages like Arabic, Korean, Mandarin Chinese, Persian-Farsi, and Russian. In 2003, there was a 30% decrease in Foreign Language and Area Studies Fellowships compared to 1967. The number of foreign language degrees conferred in the 2000-2001 school year was minimal compared to other undergraduate, masters, and doctoral degrees. In the 2004 National Survey of Student Engagement, about 1/3 of undergraduates took foreign language coursework, while only 11 percent studied abroad. According to the American Council on Education, half of all students had taken at least 1 international course in 2000-2001, but foreign language enrollment remained static. In 2002, 79 percent of Americans believed students should have a study-abroad experience in college. Over 40 percent of Americans were more likely to support increased State-level funding for foreign language education post-9/11. SEC. 3. REFERENCES.
