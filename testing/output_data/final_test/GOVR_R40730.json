    "content": "President Obama submitted his FY2010 budget to Congress, requesting $163.8 billion for Labor, Health, and Education programs. The House passed a bill with $165.6 billion in funds, while the Senate recommended $165.4 billion. The President signed a law providing temporary funding at FY2009 levels. The President signed a law providing temporary funding at FY2009 levels for government agencies until December 18, 2009. This was an extension of the previous temporary funding measure. A conference report was filed for a consolidated FY2010 appropriations act, covering six of the seven regular appropriations measures. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 included $165.8 billion in discretionary funding for FY2010 L-HHS-ED appropriations. The conference report was adopted by the House and Senate in December 2009 and signed by the President as P.L. 111-117. Data on FY2009 and FY2010 appropriations are based on the House Committee on Appropriations table from December 9, 2009. The Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) allocated funding for certain HHS programs in FY2009 and FY2010. The data for FY2010 includes the President's budget request, House passage of H.R. 3293, Senate committee recommendations, and enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010. Funding details are subject to budgetary scorekeeping and only pertain to programs under L-HHS-ED appropriations. This report highlights President Obama's proposals for FY2010 appropriations for L-HHS-ED programs, excluding funding from other appropriations bills and entitlements. It focuses on discretionary programs and does not cover mandatory programs like Medicare or Social Security. The L-HHS-ED bill is known for its controversial nature due to its funding size and program scope. This bill provides discretionary and mandatory funds to three federal departments and 13 related agencies, including the Social Security Administration (SSA). Discretionary funding represents less than one-quarter of the total in the bill, making it the largest single source of discretionary funds for domestic federal programs. The L-HHS-ED appropriations for FY2009 and FY2010 are detailed in Table 2, including discretionary and mandatory allocations. The appropriations cover various measures such as program level discretionary funding, current year appropriations, and advance funding for future years. Unless specified otherwise, the amounts mentioned in the report refer to program level allocations. The annual congressional appropriations process includes current year discretionary appropriations measured against allocation ceilings. Advance appropriations are funds that become available after the fiscal year they are enacted for. The annual congressional appropriations process includes current year discretionary appropriations measured against allocation ceilings. Advance appropriations are funds that become available after the fiscal year they are enacted for. Scorekeeping adjustments are made to account for special funding situations, as monitored by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Program level funding equals current year plus advances for future years minus advances from prior years and scorekeeping adjustments. Current year funding is derived by taking the program level total, subtracting advances for future years, adding advances from prior years, and applying scorekeeping adjustments. The L-HHS-ED appropriations bills include discretionary and mandatory funds, with discretionary funds controlled by the Appropriations Committees. Mandatory funding levels are modified through authorizing legislation, not annual appropriations bills. Discretionary budget authority for L-HHS-ED grew from $127.2 billion in FY2002 to $165.8 billion in FY2010, an increase of $38.6 billion or 30.3%. The L-HHS-ED appropriations act typically includes five titles providing appropriations and program direction for the Department of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, funding for related agencies, and general provisions with broader policy application. Occasionally, there may be additional titles with legislative language. The FY2008 L-HHS-ED appropriations act included a Title VI for a National Commission on Children and Disasters, while the FY2009 act included the Afghan Allies Protection Act of 2009. The FY2010 act had only five titles. Table 4 summarizes program level discretionary spending for FY2009 and FY2010 and compares it with current year totals. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 determines maximum budget authority for annual appropriations acts through a two-stage process. Congress establishes 302(a) allocations for House and Senate committees, determining spending totals for authorizations and appropriations. These allocations set discretionary budget authority for annual appropriations. Agreement on the FY2010 budget resolution was reached in April 2009. The FY2010 budget resolution was agreed upon in April 2009, setting 302(a) discretionary budget allocations for the House and Senate. The Budget Committees later increased these allocations, with subsequent adjustments made. The original allocation for FY2009 was $1,011.7 billion. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations establish 302(b) allocations for each subcommittee, ensuring they do not exceed the 302(a) total. Any bill exceeding the ceiling faces a point of order. Adjustments to 302(b) allocations can occur throughout the year. Disputes often arise over both 302(a) and 302(b) allocations. Advance appropriations occur when funds enacted in one fiscal year are not available for obligation until a subsequent fiscal year. For example, P.L. 110-161 enacted FY2008 L-HHS-ED appropriations, providing $420 million for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) for use in FY2010. They allow for long-term budget planning and avoid current year allocation ceilings, but must be counted in the year they become available for obligation. In FY2002, President George W. Bush's budget proposed eliminating advance appropriations for federal discretionary programs, including L-HHS-ED programs, but Congress rejected the idea. For FY2009, Department of Labor discretionary appropriations were $12,411 million, increasing to $13,280 million in FY2010. H.R. 3293 included $13,256 million in discretionary funding, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $13,268 million. In FY2010, the Department of Labor received $13,534 million in discretionary appropriations, an increase of $1,123 million (9.0%) over FY2009. Mandatory programs were funded at $2.7 billion and included various benefits and allowances.

The House and Senate Appropriations Committee recommended varying amounts, but the final conference agreement allocated $125 million for the Career Pathways Innovation Fund. Additionally, ARRA provided an extra $4.8 billion in discretionary funding for FY2009, with some funds to be used in FY2010. DOL developed plans for spending the money, specifying obligations for FY2009. The Department of Labor (DOL) developed plans for spending money allocated in FY2009 and FY2010.

Annual appropriations regularly contain restrictions on federal funds for abortions. The Hyde Amendments restrict federal funds for abortions, with changes over the years allowing funding in cases of rape, incest, or life endangerment. The FY1998 and FY1999 L-HHS-ED appropriations extended these provisions to prohibit federal funds for managed care packages with abortion coverage, except in specific circumstances. The FY1998 Hyde Amendments were continued with added provisions in P.L. 105-277, ensuring restrictions apply to all trust fund programs and prohibiting Medicare Advantage plans from requiring abortion services. The FY2005 L-HHS-ED appropriations added the \"Weldon Amendment\" to prevent discrimination against healthcare entities that do not provide abortion services. The FY2006 through FY2010 appropriations retained the Weldon amendment and Hyde restrictions. These provisions can be found in P.L. 111-117, Division D. President Barack Obama reversed the Bush Administration's restriction on federal funding for human embryonic stem cell research in March 2009. This decision raised ethical concerns as embryos are destroyed to obtain stem cells. The NIH issued new guidelines for this research, with final guidelines released in July 2009. By February 2010, 43 stem cell lines were listed in the new registry for federal funding, compared to 21 under the Bush Administration. Under the Bush Administration, only 21 cell lines were available for federally funded research. Congress prohibited NIH from creating human embryos for research or where embryos are destroyed.
