    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Keep Our Promise to America's Military Retirees Act\". Congress finds that prior to 1956, no health care program existed for retired members of the uniformed services who served a minimum of 20 years. In 1956, statutes were enacted to provide medical and dental care to those who entered service after December 7, 1956. Recruiters and officers misled members about their healthcare benefits. Access to healthcare for military retirees has been limited despite promises of fully paid lifetime health care upon retirement. Base closures and drawdowns of military medical facilities have made it difficult for many retirees to access care. Provisions in the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 extended coverage under TRICARE. The Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act extended TRICARE coverage to medicare eligible military retirees age 65 and older, but did not address the healthcare needs of military retirees under 65. The US should fulfill promises of high-quality healthcare for all retired uniformed service members. SEC. 3. COVERAGE OF MILITARY RETIREES UNDER THE FEDERAL EMPLOYEES HEALTH BENEFITS PROGRAM. Section 1108 of title 10, United States Code, is amended to provide health care coverage through the Federal Employees Health Benefits program for eligible beneficiaries, including members or former members of the uniformed services and unremarried former spouses. Eligible beneficiaries, including dependents of deceased or living members of the uniformed services, may enroll in a Federal Employees Health Benefit plan under chapter 89 of title 5. Eligible beneficiaries, including dependents of deceased or living members of the uniformed services, may enroll in a Federal Employees Health Benefit plan under chapter 89 of title 5. This section allows for self-only or self and family coverage, with no additional eligibility criteria required for enrollment. Family members of a member or former member are included in the coverage. An eligible beneficiary enrolled in the Federal Employees Health Benefits program can receive care in a military medical treatment facility and be reimbursed by the program. They can also change health benefits plans like any other beneficiary. The Government contributes to the health benefits plan for eligible beneficiaries. The Government contribution for eligible beneficiaries in the Federal Employees Health Benefits program is capped at the amount payable for an employee in the same plan. Health benefits plans must maintain separate risk pools, and the Secretary of Defense will reimburse eligible beneficiaries for health care expenses under TRICARE Standard. Chapter 89 of Title 5 is amended to allow reimbursement for health care costs not covered by the health benefits plan but would have been paid by the Department of Defense under TRICARE Standard. SEC. 4. REIMBURSEMENT FOR TRICARE PHARMACY BENEFITS AT TRICARE NETWORK PHARMACY LEVELS TO CERTAIN MILITARY RETIREES AND DEPENDENTS IN HARDSHIP CASES. Effective Date: October 1, 2010. The Secretary will reimburse eligible individuals for pharmacy benefits from non-TRICARE network pharmacies if certified by a physician due to physical or medical constraints. Eligible individuals are described in section 1108(b) of title 10, United States Code, and have another insurance plan or program. Eligible individuals described in section 1108(b) of title 10, United States Code, must have another insurance plan providing primary coverage for health benefits."
