    "content": "Congress has shown ongoing interest in various aspects of the civil war in Syria, with a focus on the humanitarian situation. Legislation has been proposed and enacted, and hearings have been held on the U.S. and international response to the conflict. The use of chemical weapons in Syria in 2013 sparked a debate on possible U.S. military intervention. Humanitarian organizations in Syria face constraints due to the conflict and restrictions imposed by the government. Humanitarian assistance has been a key form of support for Syrian civilians. The United States is the largest humanitarian donor for Syrian civilians, providing roughly 27% of funding in 2014. Their policy focuses on access and protection within Syria, refugee flows, and the escalating humanitarian emergency. Assistance includes medical care, food, water, and shelter. Since the conflict began in Syria in March 2011, an unknown number of civilians have been wounded and tens of thousands of lives lost. Estimates of the death toll range from 100,000 to 150,000, with some suggesting it could be much higher. The United Nations stopped updating the death toll figures in January 2014 due to verification issues. It is estimated that over 2% of the pre-conflict Syrian population has been killed, maimed, or wounded. The conflict in Syria has led to serious human rights violations and international humanitarian law violations on all sides. Hundreds of detainees and political prisoners have died under torture. The International Committee of the Red Cross has urged all parties to comply with international humanitarian law, but currently has no access to detainees. The United States and other countries have recognized the human rights crisis, raising concerns about crimes against humanity and war crimes by armed groups. The conflict in Syria has led to serious human rights violations and international humanitarian law violations, including the use of chemical weapons that killed as many as 1,400 civilians on August 21, 2013. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights condemned the obstruction of food and medical deliveries to civilians in the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp. Reports of mass executions of detainees and killing of civilians have also generated condemnation. Gender-based crimes, including rape and sexual violence, have been observed in refugee camps. The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic was established on August 22, 2011. The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic was established on August 22, 2011, by the Human Rights Council to investigate violations of international human rights law in Syria since March 2011. Recently, Pillay called for Syria to be referred to the International Criminal Court, but China and Russia blocked the resolution. The outlook for resolving the conflict in Syria is not positive. The United States and other third parties face difficult policy choices with limited potential to shape the outcome of the Syrian crisis. A massive humanitarian operation continues in Syria and neighboring countries, with the U.N. Security Council urging Syrian authorities to facilitate humanitarian relief operations. Over 3.5 million people are estimated to be living in hard-to-reach areas of Syria. The United States and other third parties face difficult policy choices with limited potential to shape the outcome of the Syrian crisis. A massive humanitarian operation continues in Syria and neighboring countries, with over 3.5 million people estimated to be living in hard-to-reach areas, including at least 242,000 people in areas besieged by either the Government of Syria or opposition forces. Reports of intentional policies of starvation, attacks against civilians, and weak health infrastructure illustrate the dire conditions under which civilians are trying to survive. Valerie Amos, U.N. Under Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs, has called for all parties to end violence, allow access for aid organizations, and respect international human rights and humanitarian law. Valerie Amos condemned attacks on civilians in Aleppo and criticized the government's use of heavy weapons. She highlighted the urgent needs of civilians in besieged areas and expressed concerns about lack of access and violations of international law. The \"Geneva II\" talks involving Syrian opposition members and government representatives began on January 22, 2014, with hopes for humanitarian pauses to aid civilians. On February 6, 2014, a U.N. representative welcomed reports on progress in Syrian peace talks. In 2014, the U.N. Secretary-General welcomed a humanitarian pause in Old Homs City for aid delivery and civilian evacuations. Despite little progress in the Geneva II talks, an agenda was set for a third round. Lakhdar Brahimi resigned as the Joint UN-League of Arab States Special Representative on the crisis after two years of no peaceful resolution progress. The Joint United Nations-League of Arab States Special Representative on the crisis resigned effective May 31, 2014. The U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 2139 (2014) on February 22, 2014, demanding increased humanitarian access in Syria. The resolution addressed the impact on civilians, violations of human rights, and called for an end to violence and attacks against civilians. The U.N. Security Council resolution called for an end to violence, attacks against civilians, and indiscriminate weapon use in Syria. It urged parties to lift sieges, allow food and medicine delivery, and facilitate humanitarian relief efforts. The resolution also emphasized medical neutrality, protection of civilians, and condemned terrorist attacks. The U.N. Security Council resolution called for an end to violence, attacks against civilians, and indiscriminate weapon use in Syria. The Council requested regular reports on the resolution's implementation and expressed intent for further action in case of non-compliance. The U.N. General Assembly held a briefing on the humanitarian situation in Syria, with the Secretary-General and other officials speaking. U.N. Under-Secretary-General Valerie Amos briefed the Security Council on the lack of progress in implementing the resolution, with plans for further briefings on humanitarian access. The Security Council is considering a resolution to authorize cross-border aid deliveries into Syria without the Syrian Government's approval. The humanitarian situation in Syria is dire, with nearly 50% of the population in need of assistance. 6.5 million people are displaced within Syria, while 2.8 million are refugees in neighboring countries. Intense fighting, violence, and lack of basic services drive the crisis, with many civilians trapped without access to aid. The conflict in Syria has led to social, political, and sectarian tensions among Syrians, affecting housing, infrastructure, and the economy. Critical humanitarian needs include food, water, sanitation, medical assistance, and shelter, especially in areas with intense fighting. The outbreak of polio has highlighted health challenges faced by the vulnerable population. The number of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) is estimated at 6.5 million, with many experiencing repeat displacements to escape violence. Many IDPs in Syria, including women, children, and the elderly, reside in unofficial shelters and camps. Access and security challenges hinder humanitarian response efforts, especially for NGOs. Palestinian refugees in Syria, with approximately 530,000 individuals, face significant humanitarian needs, with 420,000 requiring assistance and 235,000 internally displaced. Some Palestinian refugees have sought aid from UNRWA in Lebanon and Jordan. Many Palestinian refugees in Syria are vulnerable, living in areas of intense fighting with limited external flight options. Yarmouk refugee camp near Damascus, once home to 160,000 people, now houses around 18,000 Palestinians under siege with little humanitarian access. UNRWA distributed food parcels in January 2014, the first major aid distribution since July 2013. In July 2013, UNRWA distributed food parcels in Syria, the first major aid distribution since then. Approximately 68,000 registered refugees in Syria come from Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, and Sudan. There are also vulnerable populations like third country nationals and migrants. The total number of displaced refugees and vulnerable populations is unknown. Syria also hosted over 1 million Iraqis between 2003 and 2006, with around 500,000 remaining, of which 10% are registered with UNHCR. The fragile security and political environment in Syria poses challenges for neighboring countries hosting refugees. As of mid-June 2014, around 2.8 million Syrians have fled violence and conflict, with 97% seeking refuge in neighboring countries like Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq, and Egypt. The number of registered refugees continues to rise, with Lebanon hosting over 1 million Syrian refugees, making it the country with the highest per-capita concentration of refugees worldwide. Many displaced Syrians have not registered out of fear and are living among the local population in rented accommodations and makeshift shelters. Experts predict a further increase in the number of displaced persons. The economic, energy, and natural resource pressures of large Syrian refugee populations weigh heavily on neighboring countries like Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey. Palestinian refugees from Syria also complicate the political dynamics of Lebanon and Jordan. Governments hosting refugees are concerned about potential political implications of allowing displaced populations to remain. Shelter is a major challenge, with varying assistance and shelter options available. Refugee camps in Turkey, Jordan, and Iraq provide assistance from host governments and the international community. The majority of Syrian refugees live outside camps in urban settings, causing strain on host communities with overcrowded schools, limited resources, and high living expenses. Urban refugees face challenges such as high rental rates, overcrowding, and lack of work opportunities. Urgent priorities include protecting vulnerable refugees and meeting their basic needs, especially during seasonal changes. Urban refugees are often invisible and difficult to assist. The United States and the international community support countries hosting Syrian refugees like Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey. Efforts are made to keep borders open for those fleeing conflict in Syria, but some restrictions have caused refugees to be stranded inside border areas. The Obama Administration provides humanitarian assistance to all civilians affected by the conflict and collaborates with neighboring countries, governments, the United Nations, and humanitarian partners in response to the crisis. The United States collaborates with international partners to provide humanitarian assistance in response to the crisis in Syria, focusing on supporting vulnerable populations, developing a strong multilateral response, and building capacity for immediate assistance. Key agencies involved include USAID and DCHA. The United States collaborates with international partners, including USAID and PRM, to provide humanitarian assistance in response to the crisis in Syria. USAID focuses on IDPs while PRM supports refugees and other persons of concern. 75% of U.S. government funding for Syria goes to multilateral initiatives, with 25% supporting NGOs directly. PRM does not fund NGO partners working inside Syria. The USAID funding for the humanitarian response in Syria is split between multilateral and NGO programs to address the crisis affecting 9.3 million people in need of assistance. USAID works with 28 partners, including NGOs and U.N. entities, to determine priority sectors for aid delivery based on on-the-ground assessments, assistance gaps, and responder capacity and expertise. Staff safety and security are also key considerations in providing humanitarian assistance. The U.S. government funds humanitarian organizations in Syria, prioritizing staff safety and security. Over $2 billion has been allocated for humanitarian activities in Syria and neighboring countries since FY2012. Internal controls are in place to manage risks in insecure environments. Selected implementing partners receiving U.S. funding in FY2014 are listed in Table A-1. The United States provides humanitarian assistance in Syria through various partners, including U.N. entities, NGOs, and the Syrian Opposition Coalition's Assistance Coordination Unit. Assistance is distributed based on need across all 14 governorates of Syria. The Obama Administration has not specified how it will address future Syria-related needs for the rest of FY2014, but options include drawing down global humanitarian accounts or requesting a supplemental appropriation. The Administration's FY2015 budget request seeks $1.1 billion in humanitarian assistance for Syria and the region, with options including reprogramming funds from the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) account. Congress may consider future funding requests, including a potential supplemental request, if the situation worsens or persists. The U.S. government is trying to balance the visibility of American humanitarian aid in Syria with security concerns for aid recipients and partners. Leveraging political objectives without politicizing aid remains a challenge. There is debate over whether the U.S. is receiving adequate political support. There is debate over the visibility and branding of American humanitarian aid in Syria, with concerns about politicizing aid and compromising neutrality. Some argue for more aggressive branding to show solidarity with Syrians, while others warn of potential risks to broader humanitarian efforts if U.S. affiliation is targeted. The Administration is exploring ways to brand U.S. aid in Syria without compromising safety. International humanitarian agencies and governments are providing assistance to civilian populations in Syria and neighboring countries. UNOCHA leads the humanitarian effort within Syria, while UNHCR assists Syrian refugees. UNHCR leads efforts to provide assistance to Syrian refugees in neighboring countries, including non-food items such as shelter, clothing, fuel, cash assistance, and other essential items. Access remains severely constrained by violence, insecurity, restrictions imposed by the Syrian government, and lack of transportation and fuel availability. The Syrian regime restricts humanitarian organizations through bureaucratic obstacles and visa restrictions. The Syrian government allows some aid deliveries across conflict lines, but numerous checkpoints create obstacles. Independent aid agencies use official channels in Damascus or cross-border mechanisms through Jordan and Turkey. Providing aid within Syria may reduce the number of refugees seeking assistance across borders. The London 11 Core Group plans to increase efforts for delivering humanitarian aid across borders. Friends of Syria are planning to increase humanitarian aid delivery across borders without the regime's consent. The United Nations and partners have identified key relief sectors in Syria, including food security, health, water, and shelter. Access and aid delivery in the country are complex and constantly changing, with international NGOs facing challenges in operating safely. The Syrian Arab Red Crescent is a significant local organization involved in aid efforts. The Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) is a key implementing partner with over 10,000 volunteers, working with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and other organizations in the humanitarian response in Syria. This includes 18 international NGOs, 11 U.N. agencies, and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) authorized by the government, along with national NGOs and ministries providing assistance. U.N. agencies have established hubs in various locations in the country for aid delivery. The U.N. entities have established hubs in different locations in Syria to provide aid, with varying levels of access compared to NGOs. They have the capacity and expertise for large-scale operations like vaccination campaigns and food delivery. UNRWA is also assisting Palestinian refugees affected by the conflict in Syria and those who have fled to Jordan and Lebanon. Donor funding is typically provided in response to crises. Donor funding for humanitarian crises is usually provided through the Consolidated Appeal Process (now called the Strategic Response Plan) administered by UNOCHA. Funding for the Syria crisis is through the Syrian Humanitarian Assistance Response Plan (SHARP) and the Regional Refugee Response Plan (RRP), with contributions also made outside of the U.N. appeals process. The appeals have been revised multiple times to address evolving needs, with the fourth revision covering January to June 2013. The SHARP and RRP appeals for the Syria crisis, totaling $6.5 billion, were launched in 2013. By mid-June 2014, the appeals were 29% funded. The SHARP seeks $2.3 billion for projects inside Syria in 2014 to address the needs of those affected by conflict. The latest revision of the Regional Refugee Response Plan (RRP) seeks over $4.2 billion to assist up to 3.4 million Syrian refugees in the region. The plan focuses on protection, life-saving assistance, access to basic services, durable solutions, and community outreach. UNHCR leads the coordinated efforts of international and national organizations in the response. Some analysts criticize the lack of transparency in humanitarian funding, making it hard to track where aid goes and if it's distributed fairly. UNOCHA uses the Emergency Response Fund (ERF) to support the Syria crisis, providing aid to conflict areas and neighboring countries like Jordan, Lebanon, and Iraq. The Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) was established in 2006 as part of the U.N. reform process to enhance the U.N.'s ability to respond efficiently to natural disasters and humanitarian emergencies. Managed by the Emergency Relief Coordinator, CERF provided funds to agencies in Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria in CY2012-2013 and continues to do so in CY2014. Donors pledged $1.5 billion in humanitarian aid at the International Humanitarian Pledging Conference for Syria in January 2013, with some funds supporting the humanitarian response in Syria. Donors have made pledges to fund humanitarian response in Syria and neighboring countries, but concerns remain about the slow pace of funding. Sweden and Kuwait hosted donor conferences in 2013 and 2014, where donors pledged over $2 billion in humanitarian aid. Some pledges have not been converted to commitments as of mid-June 2014. As of mid-June 2014, challenges in addressing the humanitarian situation in Syria include impeded international response due to insecurity, funding shortfalls for U.N. appeals, and the willingness of neighboring countries like Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey to host refugees. The United States and the international community have recognized the contribution of neighboring countries like Lebanon and Turkey in hosting Syrian refugees. However, the increasing numbers of refugees are straining the infrastructure and capacity of these countries, leading to concerns about limited ongoing international support. Experts fear that the international response capacity could be overwhelmed if the conflict and displacement continue at the current pace. Congress may need to consider balancing humanitarian needs with the capacity to address the crisis. Congress may need to balance priorities and find resources to sustain U.S. aid pledges amidst domestic budget constraints. Depleting global humanitarian accounts for immediate relief in Syria may hinder future crisis response if not replenished. Encouraging other countries to provide assistance for Syria is important, but turning pledges into actual commitments can be challenging. The challenges of ensuring actual contributions from donor conferences, the complexity of sharing costs among international donors, and the difficulty in comparing U.S. assistance with international aid due to different forms of assistance. Political considerations also influence humanitarian assistance, which serves as a flexible policy tool in crises. Humanitarian assistance can be used as a strategic tool in crises, with its effectiveness depending on the situation and U.S. interests in the region. Questions arise about the implications of reducing support to Syria on U.S. standing among allies and future involvement in reconstruction and political solutions. The level and sources of U.S. humanitarian assistance in Syria will impact the relief operation and broader foreign policy goals. Appendices provide details on funding distribution, projects, partners, and donors involved in the crisis. Relevant links for further information are also included. The Department of State Syria country page, Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM), Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) The World Factbook on Syria, United Nations sources including UN News Center, United Nations Inter-Agency Information Sharing Portal, and Relief Web link provide valuable information on Syria."
