    "content": "The Act is known as the \"Interstate Drug Monitoring Efficiency and Data Sharing Act of 2012\" or the \"ID MEDS Act\". It establishes national interoperability standards. The Attorney General will establish national interoperability standards within a year of the Act's enactment to facilitate prescription information exchange across State lines for States receiving grant funds under specific programs. The standards must implement freely available open standards. The national interoperability standards established by the Attorney General must implement open standards without cost or restriction, utilize exchange intermediaries for interstate communication, ensure secure transmissions using encryption, and employ access control methods to comply with State laws and regulations. The State recipient requirements are outlined in Section 3. The Harold Rogers Prescription Drug Monitoring Program recipient must ensure state databases comply with national interoperability standards within 1 year of their establishment. Enhancement grant funds can be used for this purpose. Agencies can use enhancement grant funds to standardize technology architecture to comply with national interoperability standards. States must ensure that the Controlled Substance Monitoring Program database complies with these standards within one year of their establishment. The report is required to ensure compliance with national interoperability standards for technology architecture funded by enhancement grants. The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, must submit a report to Congress within a year on improving the interoperability of State prescription monitoring programs with other technologies to combat prescription drug fraud and abuse. The report will discuss the feasibility of integrating State prescription monitoring programs with electronic prescribing systems, DEA databases, and electronic health records. The report to Congress will include an assessment of challenges impacting interoperability, ways State prescription monitoring programs can enhance reporting through technology, and recommendations to reduce fraud and abuse of prescription drugs."
