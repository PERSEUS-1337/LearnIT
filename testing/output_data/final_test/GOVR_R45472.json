    "content": "Human activities, like fossil fuel combustion and industrial operations, have increased carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas levels by 40% in the past 150 years. Climate scientists agree that these emissions are causing a warmer climate and will lead to future climate change. There are various actions at different levels to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but federal policymakers and stakeholders have differing views on how to address future climate change. Congressional interest in legislation to control greenhouse gas emissions has varied over the last 15 years, with proposals focusing on market-based approaches like cap-and-trade or emissions taxes. This report compares legislative proposals from the 108th through the 116th Congresses aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions through market-based approaches like cap-and-trade or carbon tax/fee programs. Members introduced energy-related bills promoting renewable energy and carbon capture and sequestration, but these are not discussed in this report. Additionally, resolutions expressing views on greenhouse gas emissions have been introduced in the House and Senate since the 112th Congress. In the 115th Congress, resolutions were introduced in the House and Senate expressing opposition to a carbon tax. Most bills introduced between the 112th and 115th Congresses focused on establishing carbon tax or emissions fee programs. In the 111th Congress, multiple proposals were made, leading to the House passing an economy-wide cap-and-trade bill. In subsequent Congresses, GHG emission control legislation was proposed but saw minimal legislative activity. The EPA used Clean Air Act authorities to establish GHG emission standards for key sectors. EPA rulemakings, such as the 2015 Clean Power Plan and the 2018 Affordable Clean Energy proposed rule, sparked debate in Congress. Proposals in the 116th Congress varied in scope, covering CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion to multiple GHG emissions from various sources. The proposals also differed in how fee revenues or allowances would be utilized. The proposals for GHG emission reduction legislation in Congress differ in how fee revenues or allowance value would be applied. Economic analyses suggest that distributing the revenue would have greater economic impacts than the direct effects of the carbon price. Both cap-and-trade and carbon tax programs aim to reduce emissions by placing a price on GHG emissions or their inputs. Market-based policies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions can take the form of either a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system. The choice between the two depends on whether policymakers prefer to control emission levels or emission prices. These policies may include hybrid designs to increase certainty in pricing or emissions reduction targets. Cap-and-trade sets a limit on emissions from specific sources, while a carbon tax places a price on emissions or fossil fuels. Legislation can include mechanisms to adjust the carbon tax or cap-and-trade system if targeted emission reductions are not met. Cap-and-trade programs set a limit on greenhouse gas emissions from certain sources by dividing the emissions cap into emission allowances. These allowances represent the authority to emit one metric ton of carbon dioxide-equivalent. Policymakers can choose to distribute the allowances for free, sell them through auctions, or use a combination of both strategies, sparking significant debate due to their monetary value. During the development of cap-and-trade programs, emission allowances with monetary value are submitted by covered sources at the end of each compliance period. Sources failing to provide enough allowances face penalties. Covered sources have incentives to make extra reductions by selling/trading unused allowances, reducing purchases, or banking them for future use. Emission offsets as a compliance option were debated, representing measurable GHG emission reductions from uncovered sources. In cap-and-trade programs, emission offsets from sources not covered can reduce costs but raise concerns about fraudulent offsets. Other mechanisms like allowance banking can increase program flexibility and lower costs. In a carbon tax program, policymakers assign a price to GHG emissions. A carbon tax/fee on emissions or emissions inputs, such as fossil fuels, would increase the price of carbon-intensive energy sources, leading to innovation in less carbon-intensive technologies and behavior changes to reduce emissions. Economic modeling suggests that this approach could achieve emission reductions, depending on the program's scope and stringency. Applying a tax/fee to fossil fuels at around 3,000 entities could address 76% of total U.S. GHG emissions and generate new revenue streams. A carbon tax/fee system could generate significant revenue based on the scope and rate of the tax. A $25/ton carbon tax could yield around $100 billion in the first year. Policymakers face challenges in deciding how to allocate these revenues, balancing objectives such as minimizing costs, supporting specific groups, and achieving emission reductions. A primary argument against a carbon tax/fee system is the concern about economy-wide costs it could impose, with potential impacts on low-income households, displaced workers, and coal resource owners. Opposition may stem from general aversion to federal taxes or fears of increased federal spending. Comparing GHG emission reduction legislation from the 108th to the 116th Congress reveals differences in proposed bills. The tables compare bills from different Congresses based on their framework, scope, stringency, and design elements related to emissions control. Categories include program structure, covered entities, emissions targets, distribution of revenue, and treatment of offsets and international allowances. The curr_chunk discusses the use of offsets and international allowances for compliance, addressing concerns about carbon-intensive imports in a U.S. GHG reduction program, and proposing additional GHG reduction measures. Policymakers could use border adjustments, tax rebates, or emission allowances to mitigate potential impacts on domestic businesses."
