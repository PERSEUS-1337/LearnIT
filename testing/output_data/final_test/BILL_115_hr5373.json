    "content": "The \"Algae Agriculture Act of 2018\" includes provisions for national conservation practice standards for algae-based nutrient management systems, rural electrification assistance programs, agriculture and food research initiatives priorities, foundation for food and agriculture research purposes, studies, center of excellence, energy programs, and assistance for algae production. Section 1244 of the Food Security Act of 1985 is amended to establish a national conservation practice standard for algae-based nutrient management systems. The Rural Electrification Act of 1936 is amended to include emissions reduction measures such as carbon capture and use in generating plants and related facilities. This includes adding emissions reduction language in various sections of the Act. The Rural Electrification Act of 1936 is amended to include emissions reduction measures like carbon capture and use in generating plants and related facilities, adding language in various sections of the Act to cover renewable energy facilities and carbon capture and use. SEC. 4. AGRICULTURE AND FOOD RESEARCH INITIATIVES PRIORITIES. The Competitive, Special, and Facilities Research Grant Act is amended to include algae systems and pests, expanding the scope of agricultural research initiatives. The Competitive, Special, and Facilities Research Grant Act is amended to include development and testing of alternative feeds, animal health products, and new food ingredients to meet global demand for proteins and nutritional oils. The Competitive, Special, and Facilities Research Grant Act is amended to include economic opportunities from new feedstocks or food products that expand agricultural opportunity in the United States through production on marginal or unproductive land, industrial systems, or coastal or open seawater, or that significantly increase the yield of food, feed, or other products from existing agricultural land. SEC. 5. Foundation for food and agriculture research purposes amended to include algae. SEC. 6. Studies. The Secretary of Agriculture will conduct a study on algae protein production potential, including reviewing protein needs in the US for the next 20 years, assessing the feasibility of growing algae to meet those needs, and comparing the nutritional benefits of algae with other protein sources. The study on algae protein production potential will determine public and private activities needed to scale up production in the US, estimate job creation, and project the value of algae protein exports by 2025, 2030, and 2035. The study team will include labs from the Department of Agriculture and Department of Energy, industry associations, and academics. A report is due within 1 year. The Secretary of Agriculture will conduct a study on the benefits of on-field application of algae biomass for soil health, including microbial diversity and restoration of soil organic carbon. Funding is authorized for this study, with a report due to Congress within 1 year. The Secretary of Agriculture will conduct a study on the benefits of on-field application of algae biomass for soil health. The study includes developing a research protocol, conducting field trials, preparing progress reports, and assessing opportunities for commercial deployment. A final report will be submitted to Congress within 4 years, with funding authorized for this purpose. The Secretary of Agriculture will establish an Algae Protein Center of Excellence to promote the development of the algae industry in the United States for food, animal feed, and aquaculture feed markets. Additionally, there will be a study on the benefits of on-field application of algae biomass for soil health, with a final report to be submitted to Congress within 4 years. Amendments to the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 include defining fuel derived from biological processing of carbon captured from industrial sources or air capture. Additionally, food or feed from algae or biological capture and reuse of carbon are exempted from certain regulations. Amendments to the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 include defining fuel derived from biological processing of carbon captured from industrial sources or air capture. This exempts food or feed from algae or biological capture and reuse of carbon from certain regulations. The Biobased Markets Program under the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 is amended to establish biobased content methodology for products from biologically recycled carbon, giving full credit for carbon content from industrial sources or air capture. The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 is amended to include provisions for biorefinery, renewable chemical, and biobased product manufacturing assistance, as well as changes to the Biomass Crop Assistance Program. SEC. 9. ASSISTANCE FOR ALGAE PRODUCTION. SEC. 9. Assistance for algae production. Amends eligibility for noninsured crop disaster assistance program to include algae. Amends research and development priorities to include algae insurance policies. Research and development for algae insurance policies will evaluate risk management tools based on market prices and yields. The policy aims to provide protection for production or revenue losses based on market prices and yields, as well as other factors determined by the Secretary."
