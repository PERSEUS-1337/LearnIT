    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Russian Fissile Materials Disposition Loan Guarantee Act of 2001\". Congress finds that the proliferation of nuclear weapons poses a national security risk to the United States. Countries seeking nuclear capabilities need technical expertise and materials, which the former Soviet Union's nuclear complex possesses. Current programs address the potential loss of expertise and materials. Progress on agreements like the Highly Enriched Uranium Agreement and Plutonium Disposition Agreement will enhance US security against nuclear proliferation. Additional progress in securing and disposing of nuclear materials is needed for further enhancement of US security. A program is proposed to place Russian Federation's nuclear weapons materials under permanent safeguards in exchange for loans for nonproliferation programs. This could benefit the Russian economy and enhance global security by securing materials not currently under international safeguards. The proposed program aims to secure Russian Federation's nuclear weapons materials through loan guarantees for nonproliferation programs. The Secretary of Energy, with the President's approval, may guarantee loans to the Government of the Russian Federation for specified purposes. The total guaranteed loan principal at any time cannot exceed $1 billion. The guarantee covers both principal and interest, except for interest exceeding 3 percent per year. Eligible loans are those from private lenders to the Russian government for designated purposes. The Government of the Russian Federation can utilize guaranteed loans for purposes like retiring sovereign debt, supporting nuclear nonproliferation programs, and developing energy infrastructure. Loans cannot be used for activities under the Plutonium Disposition Agreement. Loan terms include the principal being in specific increments. The loan terms specify that the principal must be in $20,000,000 increments, with a minimum term of 15 years. Payments of principal and interest follow an amortization schedule, starting with interest upon disbursement and no payments required for at least 5 years. The loan terms require payments on a semi-annual basis, with all interest and principal due upon completion of the loan term. The loan proceeds are disbursed to the Russian Federation, and in case of default, the lender can exercise certain options. As security, the Russian Federation must place 1.00 metric tons of a specified asset for each $20,000,000 loan increment. The loan terms require semi-annual payments, with all interest and principal due at the end of the term. To secure the loan, Russia must place 1.00 metric tons of weapons-usable plutonium and 1.00 metric tons of highly enriched uranium under IAEA safeguards. In case of default, the lender has certain options. The lender may use materials under safeguards as security for the loan repayment, following IAEA guidelines. These materials are separate from the plutonium designated for the Plutonium Disposition Agreement. The guarantee of any loan under this section is not considered a contribution to the Russian government under the Plutonium Disposition Agreement. The Secretary is prohibited from imposing or collecting any fees related to the loan guarantees. SEC. 4. SUPPORT OF INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY MATERIALS SAFEGUARDS. $15,000,000 annually for International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards on materials securing loans guaranteed under section 3. Authorization of appropriations for loan guarantees and administration costs under the Act for fiscal years 2002 through 2005. $10,000,000 authorized for Secretary of Energy for activities in 2002, excluding loan costs. Appropriated amounts remain available until expended. Definitions are provided in Section 6. The Act defines terms such as Highly Enriched Uranium Agreement, Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and Plutonium Disposition Agreement. The United States signed the Plutonium Disposition Agreement on September 1, 2000, designating Plutonium as no longer required for defense purposes. The Secretary of Energy's authority to guarantee loans under this Act will end on December 31, 2004, but guarantees made before that date will remain valid."
