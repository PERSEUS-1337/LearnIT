    "content": "The Act titled \"Superfund Emergency Response Act of 2012\" addresses disaster response at sites on the National Priorities List. The \"Superfund Emergency Response Act of 2012\" allows the EPA Administrator to conduct necessary activities at sites on the National Priorities List affected by a declared disaster. $10,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2013 to 2018 for this purpose. SEC. 129 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 allows for site assessments after a major disaster. The Governor or Senator of a State can request an assessment and report on the impacts of a major disaster on a site proposed for listing on the National Priorities List. The Administrator must decide within 15 days whether to conduct the assessment. If the Administrator decides to conduct an assessment after a major disaster, it will evaluate any contaminants released that threaten public health and the environment. It will also assess actions needed to mitigate toxic releases, repair damage, and provide monitoring in response to the disaster. After a major disaster, the Administrator will assess the damage and cost to take necessary actions. This includes listing actions taken to prevent or mitigate damage, as well as alerting the public to any health or environmental threats from contaminant releases. Public notice must be given within 30 days. The Administrator must complete and publish the results of an assessment within 30 days of determining to carry it out. The assessment can be amended or updated within a year. SEC. 313 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 mandates a study on sites listed on the National Priorities List and their vulnerability to extreme weather. The term 'extreme weather event' includes severe weather, heavy precipitation, hurricanes, storm surges, tornadoes, extreme heat and cold, and other events qualifying as a 'major disaster'. The Administrator must conduct a study within 2 years to assess property vulnerability due to extreme weather events for listing or removal from the National Priorities List. The Administrator must evaluate properties on the National Priorities List in flood-prone areas after extreme weather events. This includes estimating remediation costs and recommending emergency response protocols to prevent contaminant releases. The Administrator evaluates properties on the National Priorities List in flood-prone areas after extreme weather events to estimate remediation costs and recommend emergency response protocols. Coordination with regional, state, and local officials, as well as community advisory groups, is essential for improving resiliency and implementing necessary policies to enhance property resiliency on the National Priorities List due to extreme weather events."
