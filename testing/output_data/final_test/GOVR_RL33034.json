    "content": "A statutory framework for U.S. communications policy was established in the Communications Act of 1934, creating the FCC to regulate interstate telephone monopolies and spectrum licensing. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 aimed to promote competition by removing regulatory barriers. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 aimed to foster competition among providers using similar network technologies, resulting in different regulatory regimes for voice telephone and cable television services. Digital broadband technologies have blurred these distinctions, leading to competition between regulated traditional services and unregulated information services that transcend national and state boundaries. The current statutory framework is deemed ineffective in the market environment where digital broadband technologies blur traditional service distinctions. Congress debates modifying the 1996 Act within the Communications Act of 1934 to promote investment, innovation, and competition while addressing various non-economic objectives of U.S. telecommunications policy. The debate focuses on fostering broadband network development and applications while considering universal service, homeland security, public safety, diversity of voices, localism, and consumer protection. The high fixed costs of broadband networks limit the number of networks that can be supported. In the evolving market environment, competition in broadband networks is categorized into intermodal, intramodal, and competition with applications service providers. The key question is whether a third broadband network will enter the market. The FCC currently follows ex ante non-discrimination rules and ex post adjudication for regulating broadband network providers. Various regulatory proposals incorporating different approaches are discussed in the report. Universal service mechanisms and intercarrier compensation mechanisms are considered fundamental for U.S. telecommunications policy. The current telecommunications infrastructure in the U.S. is evolving towards Internet Protocol networks, allowing for the convergence of various media markets. There is a need to modify universal service and intercarrier compensation mechanisms to adapt to these changes, but there is no consensus on the necessary modifications. The current statutory and regulatory framework for telecommunications is considered inadequate for the evolving market environment. Disagreement exists on the necessary modifications, given the shift towards Internet Protocol networks and convergence of media markets. The 1996 Telecommunications Act did not anticipate the current landscape of digital communication, with services provided over competing broadband networks and uncertainty about future technological advancements. The 1996 Telecommunications Act created separate regulatory \"silos\" for specific services and network technologies. It distinguishes between telecommunications services and information services, with the latter not subject to specific regulatory regimes in the Act. FCC's jurisdiction over information services is limited to its ancillary authority under Title I of the 1934 Act. The FCC's distinction between telecommunications services and information services, established by the 1996 Telecommunications Act, aimed to foster the development of enhanced services. However, technological advancements and market convergence have blurred the lines between these categories, creating challenges in classification and competition. Since 1996, the distinction between telecommunications and information services has become increasingly blurred due to market convergence. Providers offering VoIP and IP video services are competing with traditional services, leading to debates over regulatory oversight. The FCC has struggled to determine if certain information services should be subject to light regulation or more rigorous common carrier regulation. In 2002, the FCC ruled that cable modem service is a pure information service, not subject to telecommunications regulations. This decision was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2005. In June 2005, the FCC granted DSL Internet access providers the same regulatory classification as cable modem providers, ending the requirement for local telephone companies to unbundle and separately tariff the transmission component of DSL services. The FCC classifies service offerings as information or telecommunications services based on network architectures. The current regulatory framework struggles to keep up with market convergence, leading to different treatment of competing providers. This can create incentives for providers to tailor investments to regulatory distinctions rather than customer needs. The current regulatory framework struggles to keep up with market convergence, leading to different treatment of competing providers. This can create incentives for providers to tailor investments to regulatory distinctions rather than customer needs. The debate about reforming the statutory and regulatory framework for telecommunications revolves around fostering investment and innovation in the broadband network and applications riding over it. Physical network providers argue that costly build-outs and upgrades may be discouraged in the new environment. Physical network providers may be discouraged from costly and risky broadband network build-outs and upgrades if subject to open access and non-discrimination requirements. Independent applications providers argue for unfettered open access to compete with network providers. End users advocate for unrestricted usage of broadband networks. The big-picture issue of broadband network access raises questions about nondiscriminatory access, harm to consumers, and justifiable access restrictions to maintain network integrity and efficiency. Should access regulation take the form of open access requirements, non-discrimination rules, or adjudication of market power abuses? The debate over broadband network access regulation revolves around whether open access requirements, non-discrimination rules, or case-by-case adjudication of market power abuses are necessary. The number of competing broadband networks needed to prevent access restrictions and protect consumers is also a key consideration. Federal spectrum policy and infrastructure programs may play a role in promoting multiple competitive broadband networks, potentially reducing the need for access rules. Access networks will increase competitive options for end users but may not benefit independent applications providers who must connect to all access networks. In rural or high-cost areas, government intervention may be necessary for broadband network deployment. Congress may need to consider universal access to broadband networks at affordable rates and how to implement support mechanisms for universal service. The discussion revolves around how universal service support mechanisms can efficiently provide broadband without harming other policy goals like competitive neutrality. Questions include the extent of broadband coverage needed, whether subsidies should support network access or specific services, and how economic regulation changes could impact the universal service program. When the FCC re-classified DSL service as an information service, it reduced the universal service assessment base and limited federal funding to only support telecommunications services. Reform of economic regulation must align with universal service programs to ensure support for high-cost carriers. The challenge lies in developing a regulatory framework that can adapt to rapid technological changes in the market. The rapid technological change includes the development of decentralized peer-to-peer networks for interactive services, leading to discussions about a more secure Internet. A new regulatory framework must be flexible to accommodate this shift as the transition to a digital, broadband environment will not happen instantly. The current regulatory framework allows the FCC to preempt state laws restricting competition, but limits its authority to interstate and international services. As technology transcends state and national borders, there is a need to reevaluate which regulations can be effectively managed at the state or local level. Telecom reform aims to centralize certain regulatory elements while preserving effective state or local regulation. The report provides an overview of market and technological developments that have made the current regulatory framework ineffective. It discusses different approaches to regulating access to broadband networks, including open access, non-discrimination rules, adjudication of market power abuses, and self-regulation. It also addresses how to modify the statutory framework to deal with competition between telephone companies and cable operators, and how public policy can promote additional network deployment. Public policy considerations for broadband networks include fostering deployment, ensuring competitive neutrality in intercarrier compensation, determining universal service subsidy recipients and contributors, evaluating federal grant and loan programs, and adapting policies for voice over Internet protocol and access to emergency services. In 1996, Congress passed the Telecommunications Act to open up markets to competition by removing regulatory barriers. One key provision allowed the FCC to preempt enforcement of state or local laws hindering telecommunications service entry. The 1996 Telecommunications Act aimed to promote competition by requiring incumbent carriers and new entrants to interconnect their networks, ensuring that all carriers' networks were interconnected for the benefit of consumers. This provision prevented incumbents from restricting competitive entry by denying interconnection or setting unfavorable terms. Competitive provision of service allowed calls to originate on one carrier's network but end up on another carrier's network. The 1996 Telecommunications Act established intercarrier compensation, where the calling party's carrier pays the called party's carrier for completing calls. This system aims to recover costs and promote competition in the telecommunications market. The 1996 Act allowed Regional Bell Operating Companies to offer long distance service after proving local market competition. Incumbent carriers had to provide network access to new entrants at wholesale rates. Universal service funding was previously supported by implicit subsidies in above-cost rates. The 1996 Act required explicit universal service support to replace implicit subsidies in above-cost rates for certain services, but full implementation has not been achieved. The regulatory framework aimed to promote competition among companies using the same technology. The 1996 Act aimed to promote competition among companies using the same technology in markets. However, it did not anticipate intermodal competition that has since developed, leading to potential inconsistencies in the current regulatory framework. The current regulatory framework may be inadequate in addressing competition in the telecommunications market, especially with regards to intermodal competition. There are concerns about different regulatory rules for service providers, the impact of economic regulations on intermodal competition, and the effectiveness of addressing interconnection and access issues in an IP architecture. It is suggested that intramodal competition will continue to be the primary source of competition for large business customers in the telecommunications market. In the telecommunications market, competition for large business customers is likely to be intramodal rather than intermodal. Cable networks are mainly focused on residential areas and may not be widely available in business districts. It may take years for wireless carriers to meet the bandwidth and security needs of large corporations. Intramodal competition for enterprise customers may also be decreasing. Long-distance carriers like AT&T and MCI were major providers to enterprise customers, along with competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs). The RBOCs, AT&T, and MCI were major competitors in the enterprise market. However, acquisitions have eliminated RBOCs as competitors. Remaining CLECs have not captured enough traffic to justify building a widespread transport network and rely on larger companies for transport facilities. Conditions were set to maintain competitive options after the mergers. The Department of Justice and the FCC imposed conditions to preserve competition in the telecommunications sector, including divestiture of key transport facilities and ensuring access for CLECs and ISPs at set rates. Despite these efforts, concerns remain about reduced options for retail services and transport facilities. The industry has transitioned from monopoly to limited intramodal competition to intermodal competition over broadband platforms. The transition to multiple-service broadband platforms is bringing new applications into homes, but most customers still use legacy narrowband networks. Market convergence will lead to a limited number of broadband networks due to high fixed costs. This applies to both wireline and wireless networks. Market convergence enables firms to offer multiple services over a single platform, reducing entry costs for network providers. For example, DSL equipment can be deployed on existing copper networks to offer data and video services. Public policy can promote competition by removing barriers to expanding single-use networks. Policy can promote competition by removing barriers to single-use networks expanding into other markets. Policymakers should ensure that network providers do not hinder independent application providers from competing. Three categories of competition and innovation issues include intermodal competition among broadband network providers, intramodal competition among wireline providers serving business customers, and competition between broadband network providers and independent service providers. The competition in the telecommunications sector focuses on the number of broadband networks and how it impacts competition among network providers and independent applications providers. Access to the physical transmission layer and competition among a small number of network providers remain key issues despite technological advancements. Integrated network providers and independent applications providers come from different traditions. Network providers, such as local exchange carriers and cable companies, operate with a vertically integrated business model, offering network connections and specific services. Their network architecture is driven by the services they provide, allowing them control over network intelligence and innovation. The curr_chunk discusses the contrast between network providers' control over network architecture and independent applications providers advocating for network neutrality. It highlights how the Internet tradition values equal access for all applications, despite not always adhering to pure network neutrality due to technical limitations. The assumptions underlying the Internet tradition emphasize a competitive innovation process and the unpredictability of the most promising path of innovation. The curr_chunk emphasizes the importance of a \"neutral\" network and \"end-to-end\" design in the context of network providers and independent applications providers. It discusses the need for sufficient capital to build physical networks and highlights the shared goals between the two parties in the Internet environment characterized by \"indirect network externalities.\" The curr_chunk discusses how investments in physical networks benefit software providers by creating opportunities for new applications and increasing end-user demand for broadband connections. It also mentions the incentive for network providers to not restrict access to their networks to maintain demand, but vertically integrated providers may have a counter-incentive to limit access to competing applications. The vertically integrated companies may develop applications that compete with independent providers, aiming to exploit \"first-in\" advantages. They may deploy a network architecture aligned with their own plans, potentially conflicting with the needs of independent application providers and end users. Critics suggest that RBOCs delayed deploying DSL technology to protect revenues from their T-1 service. The RBOCs delayed deploying DSL technology to protect profits from their T-1 service, only adopting it when facing competition from cable modems. In a market with economic interdependence, a closer vertical relationship between platform and applications providers may be more efficient. Academic economists use the concept of internalizing complementary efficiencies to explain these vertical competitive effects. The ICE theorem suggests that a monopolist broadband network provider may choose to provide access to independent applications providers on its platform when efficient, but economic theory warns that platform providers may not always make optimal choices. Economic theory also cautions against blanket requirements for access or deregulation in markets with high fixed costs and low variable costs. Price discrimination based on bandwidth usage can help firms recover high fixed costs in broadband networks. Segmentation of customers by demand intensity allows for charging higher prices to those with greater bandwidth needs. This type of price discrimination does not violate network neutrality as long as it is based on bandwidth usage rather than specific applications. In 2002, Professor Tim Wu conducted a survey on broadband usage restrictions by cable and DSL operators. The survey revealed that cable operators imposed more restrictions than DSL operators, with most cable operators and a third of DSL operators prohibiting end users from operating servers or providing public content. This restriction significantly impacted the use of peer-to-peer applications and home networking. The survey conducted by Professor Tim Wu in 2002 found that cable operators imposed more restrictions than DSL operators on broadband usage. These restrictions included prohibiting end users from operating servers or providing public content, which affected peer-to-peer applications and home networking. In 2002, some cable operators limited home network deployment by restricting the number of connected computers. DSL operators allowed multiple connections but sometimes only through a single account and IP address. Cable operators also banned Wi-Fi equipment connections. Asymmetric networks with more downstream bandwidth limited certain applications. Enforcement of these restrictions by network providers was unclear. In 2002, cable operators limited home network deployment by restricting connected computers, while DSL operators allowed multiple connections through a single account and IP address. Cable also banned Wi-Fi equipment connections. It is unclear how actively network providers enforced these restrictions, but there is anecdotal evidence of some enforcement. Usage restrictions may decrease with wireless technology competition. Cable networks imposed more restrictions than DSL, possibly due to greater bandwidth and the need to manage shared bandwidth. Cable operators have not restricted streaming video despite the need to manage bandwidth. Vendors are marketing equipment for network control, such as peer-to-peer traffic management. Network providers are deploying this equipment for access and usage restrictions to protect network integrity and efficiency. The network provider may choose overly restrictive solutions that hinder application innovation and competition. Price discrimination through bandwidth management is more efficient than outright bans on bandwidth-intensive applications. Operators often pursue legitimate goals like price discrimination and bandwidth management, but their methods, such as application bans, may distort the market and hinder future development. Verizon allegedly restricted access to its broadband network for ISPs after the FCC's decision in August 2005. Prior to the decision, Verizon offered access at the Layer 2 level, allowing ISPs to offer their own services with guaranteed quality. However, after the decision, access was limited to the Layer 3 level, restricting ISPs to reselling a complete package. Verizon restricted access to its broadband network for ISPs after the FCC's decision in August 2005. Access was limited to the Layer 3 level, which only allowed ISPs to resell a complete package without offering additional services. The RBOCs announced plans to charge providers of applications for guaranteed quality of service, such as for voice or video services. Verizon restricted broadband network access for ISPs post-FCC decision in 2005. RBOCs planned to charge application providers for guaranteed quality of service like voice or video services. Independent providers criticized potential high charges and unequal treatment by RBOCs. The regulation of broadband network providers vis-a-vis independent applications providers is a key concern. Four general approaches include structural regulation, non-discrimination rules, adjudication of market power abuses, and reliance on antitrust laws for self-regulation. Various proposals have been made, incorporating multiple elements. Ex ante rules and ex post adjudication focus on anti-competitive discrimination in different ways. Ex ante rules create affirmative legal duties to prevent future discrimination, while ex post adjudication punishes discrimination after the fact. Positive schemes impose upfront costs by restricting behaviors that may benefit consumers. The ultimate cost depends on the impact of allowing discrimination to occur before adjudicating. Open access refers to preventing broadband network providers from bundling services with their own Internet access and requiring them to make their transmission capability available to independent ISPs. Proponents argue that bundling could stifle competition among Internet applications. ISPs expanding services through bundling may limit competition for independent ISPs. Open access advocates argue that restricting independent ISPs' access could reduce competition, allow legacy networks to influence the Internet's structure, and deter innovation. Open access has been criticized for potentially discouraging innovators from investing in markets dominated by strategic players, making government intervention to control speech easier. Critics argue that broadband network providers lack incentive to restrict access to independent application providers, as other competitors would likely still provide access to customers. This could potentially retard the deployment of broadband networks. The deployment of broadband networks may be hindered by open access regulations, as it could reduce network providers' ability to benefit from vertical integration efficiencies and generate revenue from applications. Vertical integration between network and applications providers is seen as crucial for optimal joint development. Professor James Speta suggests that in the initial stages of deployment, broadband access providers may need to vertically integrate to ensure a supply of complementary information services. If operators limit architectural cooperation with independent ISPs for QOS-dependent applications, it may harm network neutrality by favoring data applications. Critics argue that open access could lead to minimal restrictions on customer usage but also claim restricted access is necessary for network providers to recoup their investment. The principle of network non-discrimination aims to give users the right to use non-harmful applications. The network non-discrimination regime aims to give users and application providers the right to use and supply non-harmful attachments or applications. It allows for efficient vertical integration while ensuring users' rights are not compromised, especially in digital broadband networks where discrimination is easier due to the ability to distinguish among packets. Some universities are using application-specific screening on high-speed networks to detect illegal copying of entertainment materials. This approach could also be used to restrict or prohibit certain applications. Proponents of network neutrality argue that non-discrimination rules promote investment and innovation in broadband technology by providing incentives for independent application providers and ensuring fair competition. They believe that a neutral network fosters a competitive environment where the best applications can thrive. Proponents of network neutrality argue that a neutral network with non-discrimination rules promotes investment and innovation in broadband technology by providing predictability and fairness for all applications. They believe that recent restrictions by cable operators on virtual private networks show the tendency of some network providers to limit new and innovative applications, harming small developers and hindering the Internet's potential for development. The proponents of network neutrality argue that a regulatory framework requiring network providers to justify deviations from neutrality would prevent distortions of the market for new applications. Restrictions imposed by some network providers on home networking, online gaming, and VPNs harm consumers and applications providers, as well as have a chilling effect on innovators and venture capitalists. The proponents of network neutrality argue that regulations ensuring neutrality would prevent market distortions for new applications. Two proposals for ex ante rules are discussed, one being a \"pure\" ex ante regime and the other a hybrid regime. Professor Wu's proposal suggests a neutrality regime with ex ante non-discrimination access rules for the \"inter-network\" portion of broadband providers' networks. The broadband network provider is a member of two networks: the local network and the inter-network. Local network restrictions only affect the provider's local network for good network management. Restrictions at the inter-network layer can cause externality problems. The ex ante neutrality regime prohibits discrimination at the inter-network level based on elements like IP. The ex ante neutrality regime prohibits discrimination at the inter-network level based on elements like IP addresses, domain names, and cookie information. Broadband network providers should not discriminate in how they treat traffic on their network based on inter-network criteria unless there is evidence of harm to the local network or other users' interests. This means providers cannot block traffic from certain sites based on application information or IP addresses, but they can invest in managing bandwidth usage. Under the ex ante neutrality regime, discriminatory behavior at the inter-network level is prohibited. This includes blocking ports used for VoIP applications by companies like Madison River Communications. Professor Wu's approach allows cable operators and ILECs to tie broadband access to specific services, but prohibits discrimination in access to the inter-network. Cable operators cannot restrict customers from using their cable modem with another ISP, ensuring fair access to ISP services. Professor Wu's proposal aims to prevent discriminatory behavior at the inter-network level, allowing customers to use their cable modem with another ISP and prohibiting ILECs from restricting DSL service for voice service from another provider. Critics argue that non-discrimination rules may hinder broadband network providers' business plans, but Wu's proposal focuses on minimizing these effects by only applying the prohibition to the inter-network portion. This allows network providers to benefit from economies of scope and vertical integration advantages. Some concerns have been raised about the advantages of building one's own physical network, such as potential distortions in applications markets by broadband network providers. Critics argue that non-discrimination rules could lead to delays and regulatory costs due to the complexity of communications networks. Some critics argue that implementing non-discrimination rules could lead to delays and regulatory costs in the communications industry. Professor Wu suggests minimizing these costs by identifying two network layers and restricting the rules to the inter-network portion. Another criticism is that such rules could give an advantage to independent applications providers in negotiations with broadband network providers. The EU has adopted a legislative framework in response to these concerns. The EU has adopted a legislative framework for electronic communications to regulate providers with significant market power in markets lacking effective competition. The framework aims to reduce sector-specific rules as competition develops, with service-specific obligations determined by market competition levels. Periodic reviews are required, but no specific time frame is specified. The EU has established a framework to regulate providers with significant market power in markets lacking effective competition. The Framework Directive equates \"significant market power\" with \"dominance\" and outlines criteria for determining this power. The Commission has prepared guidelines and recommendations to measure effective competition and identify markets where regulation may be necessary. The EU has identified 18 product and service markets where regulation may be needed due to a lack of effective competition. National Regulatory Agencies in each member state must conduct market analysis to determine significant market power and create specific regulations. However, few member states have implemented these regulations, leading to a lack of empirical evidence on the impact of this regulatory framework. The EU Framework aims to regulate markets with significant market power, focusing on market shares above 40%. Critics argue that the rules lack certainty for network and application providers, hindering innovation. Telecommunications regulation should align with antitrust principles according to proponents. The EU Framework aims to regulate markets with significant market power, focusing on market shares above 40%. Critics argue that the rules lack certainty for network and application providers, hindering innovation. Telecommunications problems share consistent features found in some antitrust cases, such as high fixed costs, positive externalities, and rapid technological change. Constructing general rules could provide certainty for network providers and independent applications providers. The Regulatory Framework Working Group proposes a new statute, the Digital Age Communications Act, to replace current regulations and adjudicate alleged abuses of market power on a case-by-case basis. This new approach aims to provide certainty for network providers and independent applications providers. The proposal gives the FCC authority to adjudicate unfair practices in electronic communications networks and services, including interconnection-related issues. The Commission could require damages for violations found, with limited authority to prescribe rules. The proposal limits the FCC's authority to prescribe rules, which would automatically expire after five years. The FCC's approval for license transfers would only ensure compliance with existing rules. The PFF Working Group argues that the burden of proof should be on regulators to show the necessity of regulation, as market inefficiencies can be addressed without regulatory intervention. The PFF Working Group proposes ex post regulation and a five-year sunset provision to address market inefficiencies. They advocate for a new statute replacing vague standards with the \"unfair competition\" standard of the FTC to minimize the FCC's regulatory authority. Critics argue that the proposal assumes consumer welfare loss from bad regulation is always greater than from poorly performing markets. The PFF Working Group suggests ex post regulation and a five-year sunset provision to tackle market inefficiencies. Critics argue that assuming consumer welfare loss from bad regulation is always greater than from poorly performing markets may not hold true in markets characterized by networks where cooperation between platform and applications providers is necessary for consumer welfare. There is no consensus in the literature on whether under-regulation poses less risk than over-regulation in these unique markets. The PFF Working Group proposal suggests ex post regulation with FCC rulemaking authority to address market inefficiencies. Critics argue that this regulation may drive innovative independent applications providers out of the market, forcing them to accept unfavorable access terms to avoid being denied network access. Some critics oppose the PFF Working Group proposal to eliminate the public interest standard in telecommunications policy, arguing that it overlooks non-economic objectives like localism and diversity of voices. Broadband network providers argue against access regulation, citing market incentives and network efficiencies that reward keeping networks open. They claim that regulation would harm their ability to vertically integrate and ensure quality of service. Broadband network providers argue against access regulation, claiming it would hinder their ability to vertically integrate and ensure quality of service. Critics point to usage restrictions harming consumers, such as denying access to virtual private networks for telecommuting. Broadband network providers argue against access regulation, claiming it would hinder their ability to vertically integrate and ensure quality of service. Critics argue that prohibitions are overly restrictive and imposed for strategic purposes, not network efficiency. Former FCC chairman Michael Powell suggests industry self-regulation based on \"Internet Freedom\" principles to promote competition and prevent constraints on innovation and consumer empowerment. Mr. Powell, referencing research by Professors Weiser, Farrell, and Wu, acknowledged concerns about restrictions in broadband service plans but opposed government regulations. He proposed industry self-regulation through the \"four Internet Freedoms\": access to content, use of applications, attachment of personal devices, and choice of legal content. Mr. Powell presented the \"four Internet Freedoms\" which include access to content, use of applications, attachment of personal devices, and choice of legal content for consumers. Broadband network providers should have reasonable limits on service contracts but should allow consumers to run applications and attach devices unless they exceed service plan limitations or harm the provider's network. In August 2005, the FCC implemented Mr. Powell's proposal, ruling that DBS service and cable modem service are information services not subject to Title II access requirements. They also adopted a policy statement on consumer rights regarding Internet content, applications, device connection, and competition among providers. Critics have challenged this proposal and the FCC's actions. Critics have challenged Mr. Powell's proposal and the FCC's August 5, 2005, order on grounds of usage restrictions on end users, the importance of network neutrality for innovation, and the risks of allowing broadband network providers to control access. They argue that non-mandatory principles endorsed by network providers are insufficient to prevent harm. Critics argue that antitrust laws are not effective in addressing competition and innovation issues in communication markets, as barriers to entry are easier to establish in network markets. They also oppose removing the public interest standard. Currently, in most areas, only the incumbent local exchange carrier and local cable company serve as broadband network providers for the mass market. Broadband network providers, including carriers, cable overbuilders, and power companies, may offer a third broadband connection in the future. However, in the near term, competition between telephone and cable providers is focused on \"triple play\" offerings of voice, data, and video services. Some telephone companies are bundling satellite video services with their voice and DSL services to compete with cable companies. Larger ILECs and rural carriers are upgrading their networks to offer video services themselves. Broadband network providers aim to differentiate themselves by offering premium services like video on demand, wireless bundles, and advanced electronic games. Success will depend on providing sufficient bandwidth, security, and service quality over their local networks. The broadband networks consist of a last-mile local network and an inter-network operated by multiple Internet backbone providers. Currently, broadband networks provide various services like video, data, and voice over unique network architectures. Cable companies have upgraded their networks to offer video on demand and hundreds of channels, but connection speeds may decrease as more customers share bandwidth. The two largest ILECs, AT&T and Verizon, are also major players in the broadband network industry. Verizon is investing $6 billion to bring optical fiber directly to 16 million homes, replacing copper wires with fiber for high-capacity bandwidth. This allows for broadcasting multiple video channels and offering video on demand through their \"FiOS TV\" network. Verizon will use a remote control to choose channels on their fiber network, similar to cable services. Premium channels will be broadcast in coded form, and QAM will be used as a transport mechanism. AT&T is investing in optical fiber for TV services using IPTV technology, storing programs for on-demand viewing. AT&T's IPTV technology stores programs on a central server for on-demand viewing. They will upgrade DSL equipment to ensure sufficient bandwidth for sending signals to access channels or videos. A single customer line can support up to four active television sets or two HDTV channels at a time. Verizon and AT&T have different broadband network architectures with their own advantages and disadvantages. Verizon and AT&T have different broadband network architectures. AT&T's IP approach offers greater two-way capability but less bandwidth into the household compared to Verizon. AT&T may face customer resistance due to potential delays in channel changing and issues with home networking using DSL technology. AT&T's plan requires 20-25 megabits of bandwidth into the home, deploying optical fiber to the neighborhood node and using copper thereafter. Verizon's choice of deploying optical fiber all the way to the home may be constrained by cost and customer resistance, despite the potential for high bandwidth. Unlike AT&T's architecture, which uses a combination of optical fiber and copper, Verizon's approach requires a significant investment in infrastructure and may face financial challenges in the long run. Verizon's fiber to the home technology may face challenges during power outages as it lacks line powering, requiring backup batteries that may only last 8 to 16 hours. On the other hand, AT&T's DSL modem systems need active electric power at the customer premise, which may not be available during emergencies. Customers may have to rely on wireless telephone service in case of power loss, highlighting the importance of network strengths and weaknesses in determining user preferences. Competing broadband networks offer platform diversity to independent applications providers, fostering applications innovation. AT&T's use of IP technology for video service may exempt it from cable television regulation, including franchising requirements. The curr_chunk discusses the designation of channel capacity for public, educational, or governmental use, requiring franchisees to support PEG access and prohibiting redlining of low-income neighborhoods. It highlights the potential competitive advantage AT&T would have if exempt from franchise fees and requirements, potentially harming competing broadband network providers. Verizon argues for a streamlined franchising process to avoid delays in entering the video market and upgrading its broadband network. This raises questions about the need to review current regulations in Title VI of the Communications Act to potentially streamline the franchising process at the state or federal level. The current regulations for cable service at the federal and state level may impede entry into the video market. There is a need to review and potentially modify or eliminate these regulations to benefit consumers. Questions arise about the competition from new telephone company-based video providers and the need for economic regulations for incumbent cable companies. Additionally, there is a discussion on regulations ensuring cable systems are responsive to the local community's needs and interests. The discussion revolves around the impact of regulations on cable service providers and the competition from new video providers. It questions whether market forces or centralized regulation can better address local community needs and interests. Additionally, it considers the benefits of requiring new entrants to provide ubiquitous broadband service in municipalities. The discussion focuses on the impact of regulations on cable service providers and competition from new video providers. It questions whether market forces or centralized regulation can better address local community needs and interests, including the benefits of requiring new entrants to provide ubiquitous broadband service in municipalities. The current paragraph discusses maintaining public interest objectives without disadvantaging incumbent cable companies and the media ownership rules related to diversity of voices. The discussion focuses on regulations for cable service providers and new video providers, including the application of statutory provisions to telephone company-based video providers. Some argue for fairness in the marketplace by subjecting new entrants to the same requirements as incumbent cable operators, such as buildout requirements. Economists have explained the costs involved in such regulations. Economists have pointed out that regulatory requirements like buildout costs can differ significantly for incumbent cable operators and new entrants. For incumbents, these costs may have been incurred when they had exclusive franchises, while for new entrants, they represent entry costs into a competitive market. This difference can create barriers to entry and strengthen the advantage of incumbents. The FCC imposed rules on local franchising authorities to restrict barriers to entry for new cable service providers, based on its authority under the Communications Act of 1934. The FCC imposed rules to limit local franchising authorities' barriers to entry for new cable service providers, setting strict time limits and restrictions on requirements. It also asserted authority to preempt local laws that hinder competition and broadband deployment. The FCC order imposed restrictions on local franchising authorities to limit barriers to entry for new cable service providers, including setting time limits and preempting local laws that hinder competition and broadband deployment. A coalition of local government organizations filed appeals challenging the FCC's authority to impose these rules. The Commission's findings may delay or discourage competitive entry, raising concerns about unreasonable refusal to award a competitive franchise. The new franchising process imposed by the FCC's rules could lead to denials of franchise applications and potential court actions, causing delays compared to the current process. The Commission did not explore more efficient ways to address these delays. The FCC established a fast-track complaint process for competitive franchise applicants in negotiations with LFAs. The rules apply to cable franchise applicants in areas served by cable operators, with a further notice for existing operators. The rules only apply to county or municipal franchising authorities, not state-level decisions. The Video Franchise Working Group of NARUC reported that 17 states had state-level video franchising authority oversight by the end of 2006, with 3 states limiting municipal franchising authority. At least 19 more states could consider statewide video franchising reform in 2007. Key states with state-level oversight include California, Texas, and New York. The rise of IP video also presents new regulatory challenges. An independent applications provider could offer specialty video programming like independent films or local sports using IP technology, potentially posing a threat to large cable and telephone companies. This could lead to network providers restricting access to these services, raising non-discrimination issues. Providers may restrict IP video or other challenging applications, raising non-discrimination concerns. The debate on broadband network regulation includes structural requirements, non-discrimination rules, adjudication of abuses, and reliance on antitrust law. More broadband network choices for end users could reduce the need for regulation. Currently, most markets have duopoly broadband network services with competition among independent applications providers. The dynamics in the network and applications market would change with three or more broadband network options available. Network providers have conflicting incentives regarding access for independent applications providers. A third network provider entering the market could impact the competition and market dynamics. A third network provider entering the market could differentiate its services by offering nomadic, portable, or mobile access not available from existing providers. This could strengthen market forces for nondiscriminatory network access and reduce the need for regulatory intervention. However, due to high upfront costs, the new entrant may struggle to provide strong price competition. If successful in gaining customers, it could also support independent applications. Entry by a third network provider offering nomadic, portable, or mobile access could impact competition in the applications market by potentially reducing the need for regulation. However, the new entrant may face challenges in providing strong price competition and could threaten the profits of incumbent providers. The entry of a third broadband network provider could impact competition and potentially reduce the need for regulation. Incumbent providers argue that regulation introduces inefficiencies and unnecessary costs. Regulatory relief induced by competitive entry could benefit the incumbents. The FCC recognizes that a third ubiquitous broadband network option is likely to be provided using terrestrial wireless technology. The FCC created a Wireless Broadband Access Task Force in 2005 to promote deployment of wireless broadband networks. Terrestrial wireless technology offers mobility, portability, and cost-effective solutions for less densely populated areas. It can provide competition to existing wireline and cable technologies, creating a competitive broadband marketplace with lower prices and better services. The objective of U.S. telecommunications policy is to foster the deployment of wireless broadband networks without favoring any specific technology. Wireless broadband can be provided through various technologies like Wi-Fi, WiMAX, and mobile technologies. Wireless technologies like Wi-Fi, WiMAX, and 3G provide Internet access for various devices. They operate on different frequencies and may face challenges due to limited spectrum availability. The goal is to expand their capabilities and ensure they can coexist in the market. Wireless technologies like Wi-Fi and WiMAX operate on different frequency bands to provide Internet access. Efforts are being made to foster Wi-Fi usage by managing spectrum and promoting voluntary frequency coordination. WiMAX is a broadband wireless technology developed by an industry coalition to provide fixed and portable wireless services over long distances. It faces challenges with interoperability due to the use of multiple frequencies worldwide. In the United States, the spectrum available for WiMAX is primarily licensed to Sprint Nextel and Clearwire. The recent auction for Advanced Wireless Service Spectrum is likely to be used for mobile wireless services instead of WiMAX. The 700 MHz band spectrum, including 60 MHz to be auctioned in 2008, is highly sought after for mobile wireless services like WiMAX. Current mobile networks offer limited services, with 3G technology improving communication speeds. Fourth generation networks are on the horizon. Fourth generation networks are expected to deliver wireless connectivity up to 20 times faster than 3G. Future developments in wireless technology will support various services for business and consumer markets, including enhanced Internet links, digital television and radio broadcast reception, high-quality streaming video, and mobile commerce. The reallocation of spectrum aims to promote efficient use for innovative services, sparking a debate on spectrum management to maximize consumer welfare. The debate on spectrum management revolves around maximizing consumer welfare by exploring alternative approaches such as market-based mechanisms and open access to unlicensed spectrum. The goal is to efficiently allocate spectrum for innovative services while considering advances in technology. Some suggest that a third network provider sharing ownership with an incumbent network may not provide strong competition. For example, if a new wireless network had ties to major companies, it might hesitate to disrupt the market. This raises questions about spectrum allocation for 3G or 4G services. In spectrum auctions for 3G or 4G services, there is a suggestion to give preference to independent bidders or set aside spectrum for them. However, there are strong incentives for any broadband wireless network provider to be competitive, even if owned by a telephone or cable company. Wireless service is growing faster than wireline, and wireless networks may extend beyond the reach of affiliated networks, reducing direct competition. The 1996 Act aimed to promote competition in the telecommunications industry by allowing new entrants access to incumbent local exchange carriers' networks. Multiple broadband mobile wireless networks exist at both national and regional levels, creating competitive pressure on pricing and service access. The Act's provisions were criticized for facilitating the transition from monopoly to competition, particularly in intramodal competition. The 1996 Act aimed to promote competition in the telecommunications industry by allowing new entrants access to incumbent local exchange carriers' networks. Ten years later, intramodal entrants have not been able to build ubiquitous networks like the incumbent monopolies. Competitive local exchange carriers' networks mainly consist of fiber rings in business areas connecting to major customers' locations. Replicating the RBOCs' transport networks has also proven unviable for CLECs. The CLECs, including AT&T and MCI, were unable to create ubiquitous transport networks and relied on RBOCs for transport facilities. Cable networks primarily served residential customers and were not widely deployed in business districts. Wireless carriers may take years to meet the bandwidth and security needs of large corporations. The acquisitions of AT&T by SBC, MCI by Verizon, and BellSouth by the new AT&T have reduced competition in the enterprise and Internet backbone markets. Despite conditions set by the Department of Justice and FCC to maintain competitive options, concerns remain about limited choices for retail services and transport facilities. Replacing intramodal competition with intermodal competition may not be the best solution. The 1996 Act includes provisions for intermodal competition, but intramodal competition remains important, especially for large business markets. Facilities-based CLECs struggle to achieve economies of scale, warranting the maintenance of current statutory provisions. An \"antitrust savings clause\" in the Act ensures the applicability of antitrust laws. In a 2004 case involving Verizon, disciplined for breaching network sharing duties, the importance of competition regulations was highlighted. The Supreme Court ruled in a 2004 case involving Verizon that breaches of network sharing duties did not constitute antitrust violations. The Court found that existing antitrust standards applied and that the plaintiff, a customer of a competitive provider, did not have standing to bring the case. Congressional reaction to the decision was mixed, with some expressing concerns about potential anticompetitive behavior by telecommunications companies. House Judiciary Committee ranking minority member Conyers called for legislation to address the \"Supreme Court's horrible blunder.\" Representative Tauzin approved the Court's decision, emphasizing that regulation of the telecommunications industry should be left to the FCC and state public utility commissions. Congress may have misunderstood the \"antitrust savings\" clause in the 1996 Act, as shown by this case. The clause may have little effect when traditional antitrust principles are not involved. Three congressional options could broaden private action: clarify the savings clause, amend enforcement provisions, or address violations of competitive obligations. The 1996 Act set obligations for incumbent carriers and new entrants to interconnect their networks with one another, ensuring nondiscriminatory terms and conditions to facilitate market entry. The 1996 Act focused on ensuring nondiscriminatory interconnection between carriers to facilitate market entry, but did not address intercarrier compensation rates extensively. The 1996 Act focused on ensuring nondiscriminatory interconnection between carriers to facilitate market entry, but left existing intercarrier compensation rates in place. These rates vary depending on the type of carrier and service provided, despite similar transport and switching functions. The Intercarrier Compensation Forum (ICF) chart shows a wide range of intercarrier compensation rates, from 0.1 cents to 35.9 cents per minute. These charges can be a significant cost for providing services, sometimes exceeding the retail price. The FCC is reviewing and reforming its rules due to the varied compensation rules applied to carriers and technologies. The FCC initiated a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in February 2005 to review and reform its intercarrier compensation rules. Various proposals and principles were considered, including the \"Missoula Plan\" submitted by NARUC after industry negotiations. Intercarrier compensation reform is needed due to the current regime distorting investment decisions and competition. NARUC has not taken a position on the plan, which has support and opposition from industry parties. The plan aims to address issues such as artificial advantages/disadvantages in intercarrier compensation rules. The current intercarrier compensation regime creates uncertainty for innovators, as it allows different carriers to charge above-cost access charges for terminating calls. This lack of clarity affects services like VoIP, which straddle the line between information services and traditional voice calls. The FCC is making decisions on the classification of VoIP services for intercarrier compensation purposes, impacting the business plans of providers. The current regime encourages uneconomic arbitrage, leading to providers targeting ISPs as customers due to traffic patterns and rule anomalies. Some CLECs target ISPs by offering below-cost rates to recoup losses from carriers of ISPs' subscribers. Regulators exploit uneconomic arbitrage, like limiting rural local calling areas to increase revenues from toll charges. This can shift cost recovery from rural to urban customers. The current access charge regime imposes artificially high usage-based costs on interexchange carriers, discouraging them from offering large baskets of minutes or unlimited calling at a fixed price. This cost structure is inconsistent with actual cost causation in networks and shifts cost recovery from rural to urban customers. The current access charge regime imposes high usage-based costs on carriers, hindering them from offering unlimited calling packages. This system requires carriers to invest in costly systems to classify traffic and leads to wasteful litigation. It also undermines the stability of universal service subsidy funds. The stability of universal service subsidy funds is at risk due to declining access charges revenue as carriers with more favorable intercarrier compensation gain market share. Resistance to comprehensive intercarrier compensation reform exists, fearing harm to carriers and consumers. Consumer groups oppose line charges, arguing they unfairly burden low usage and low-income customers. Access charges for rural carriers are higher due to higher underlying costs. Rural carriers face higher access charges compared to urban carriers due to factors like population density, scale economies, and regulatory efforts to keep local rates low. Their local calling areas are limited, resulting in more toll calls and higher access charges from long distance carriers. This reliance on access charges for revenue puts a greater burden on rural carriers than urban carriers if access charges were reformed to align with costs. To alleviate the revenue burden on rural LECs, a new universal service funding mechanism is needed to replace implicit funding in access charges. Rural carriers prefer a mix of revenue sources including line charges, universal service funds, and above-cost access charges, rather than solely relying on explicit universal service funding. Rural carriers prefer to recover costs from long distance carriers rather than end-user customers. They are concerned about relying too heavily on universal service funds and state regulators setting above-cost access charges for rural carriers. Some question the FCC's authority to modify. The FCC faces challenges in modifying intrastate access charges without state involvement, particularly concerning rural telephone companies unable to identify originating carriers for compensation due to \"phantom traffic.\" This issue has grown in recent years as traffic is passed through multiple carriers before reaching rural carriers. The issue of \"phantom traffic\" arises when transiting carriers do not pay rural carriers for terminating calls, leading to difficulties in identifying originating carriers for compensation. This problem is more common with long distance or wireless carriers trying to avoid higher access charges by transiting calls through local exchange carriers. Intercarrier compensation reform could help equalize termination rates and reduce this issue. Recently, a new issue called \"traffic-pumping\" has emerged in intercarrier compensation. In this scheme, a small rural carrier partners with a service provider to generate high access charges by directing traffic to a local number advertised online. The carrier then bills a long-distance provider for millions in access charges, with AT&T using call blocking to prevent such practices. The issue of \"traffic-pumping\" in intercarrier compensation involves rural carriers partnering with service providers to generate high access charges. AT&T has been accused of call blocking to prevent this practice. Qwest filed a complaint against a local carrier in Iowa for engaging in illegal traffic schemes, leading to a coalition urging action against AT&T for allegedly blocking numbers. The FCC clarified that carriers are not allowed to block calls, highlighting the conflicting views and impact on competition and universal service. The Communications Act reform discussions in Congress may provide the FCC with guidance on intercarrier compensation reform efforts. Universal service subsidy system ensures affordable rates for basic telecommunications services, benefiting low-income households, high-cost areas, schools, libraries, rural health care providers, and small businesses. The policy goal of universal service funding is to support affordable rates for basic telecommunications services, ensuring competitiveness in the market. It is crucial that the subsidy is transparent and available to all competitors on an equal basis to prevent market distortions. The 1996 Act aimed to reconcile universal service with competitive markets by requiring explicit and sufficient support. However, this goal has not been fully achieved yet. Competitive market forces have lowered some rates towards cost, especially for business services, and a Federal Universal Service Fund has been established to provide funding. Despite the creation of the Federal Universal Service Fund to provide subsidies, many rates are still set above cost to include hidden subsidies. The 1996 Act emphasizes the importance of providing access to advanced telecommunications and information services in all regions, but does not specify how this should be achieved. Advanced services have not been explicitly included in the definition of universal service subsidies by the FCC and the Federal-State Joint Board. The Joint Board and the FCC have not included advanced services in the definition of universal service. There is a national discussion on the role of broadband networks in economic development, with some Members of Congress considering the inclusion of broadband access in universal service. Market demand may support broadband deployment in urban areas without government intervention, but rural or high-cost areas may require government intervention for network deployment. Congress must address various issues if they want to expand universal service to include affordable broadband access. The discussion revolves around the definition of broadband for universal service and the challenges in justifying subsidies for video services. The 1996 Act emphasizes access to telecommunications services for all consumers, including advanced information services. The discussion focuses on defining broadband for universal service and the difficulties in justifying subsidies for video services in rural areas due to high costs and low demand. A universal service subsidy program aims to support a single broadband network without creating incentives for multiple networks. Historically, subsidies have been given to providers rather than end users, but there is potential for wireline, wireless, and cable companies to qualify for funds in high-cost areas as eligible telecommunications carriers. Competing carriers only receive funds for customers they serve. Competing carriers can receive universal service funding for serving customers who use both fixed and mobile telephone services, leading to an increase in the total size of the fund. Data from the 2005 and 2006 annual reports of the Universal Service Administrative Corporation support this. The Universal Service Administrative Corporation (USAC) administers the federal universal service fund, distributing high-cost funds to incumbent and competitive ETCs. The potential growth in the fund could increase if universal service is expanded to include advanced services or broadband network access. One way to limit subsidy requirements is to include broadband connection in the definition of universal service, while requiring customers in high-cost areas to choose a provider eligible for support. The proposal suggests requiring customers in high-cost areas to choose a single broadband provider eligible for subsidy, which could limit the size of the universal service fund. However, this approach may reduce subsidy flow to rural areas and distort the market by incentivizing consumers to choose broadband services they may not need. Network providers are likely to offer bundled packages to maximize returns on their investments, rather than separate charges for network access and individual services. The current discussion revolves around the potential challenges of offering individual services versus bundled packages in the telecommunications industry. There are concerns about the impact on universal service funds if the definition is expanded to cover broadband access. This could lead to issues with discriminatory pricing schemes and the distribution of revenues among service providers. The Federal Universal Service Fund subsidy is currently given directly to carriers that qualify as ETCs, with payments subject to complex accounting rules. This limits funding to wireline providers, as only they are eligible for certain pools of money. Payments to all carriers are based on the costs of the wireline company, which could impact the ability to offer basic service packages without tying them to value-added services. The Federal Universal Service Fund subsidy is currently given directly to carriers that qualify as ETCs, with payments subject to complex accounting rules. The payments to all carriers are based on the costs of the wireline company. Some new entrants, like wireless carriers, argue for lower subsidies based on their lower costs, while others advocate for equal subsidies to promote competitive neutrality. Economists suggest that subsidizing high-cost providers may be inefficient and favor lower cost providers to offer affordable service without the need for subsidies in the long run. The Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service has recommended imposing an interim statewide cap on high-cost support for competitive eligible telecommunications carriers to prevent uncontrolled growth of the fund until overall fund reform is implemented. The Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service is considering using reverse auctions to determine high-cost universal service support, seeking comments on implementation issues such as specific services, separate auctions for different services, and carrier of last resort requirements for winning bidders. The FCC proposed a 9.7% assessment on telecommunications service revenues for universal service funding. Some states have their own universal service funds financed by assessments on certain telecommunications revenues. Additionally, some rural carriers may set charges above cost to contribute to universal service. Most states maintain intrastate rates, including access charges by rural carriers, above cost to support universal service. There is industry consensus that relying solely on interstate and international telecommunications revenues for funding would jeopardize the stability of the Federal Universal Service Fund. Total end-user interstate and international telecommunications service revenues peaked at $81.7 billion in 2000, dropping to an estimated $76.7 billion in 2004, with a yearly decline of about 1%. The decrease in traditional long distance carriers' revenues has been partially offset by an increase in wireless and incumbent local exchange carriers' revenues. The downward trend in total end-user interstate and international telecommunications revenues is expected to continue due to factors such as falling rates for calls, growth of VoIP services, and substitution of e-mail for long distance service. The FCC has extended universal service obligations to providers of interconnected VoIP services to address this trend. The FCC has addressed the downward pressure on interstate and international rates caused by VoIP services by raising the \"safe harbor\" percentage for wireless carriers' total end-user revenues subject to FUSF contribution assessment. It is challenging to identify and audit individual companies' revenues due to bundled service packages that include telecommunications services, leading to potential understatement of revenue proportions. The FCC has increased the safe harbor percentage for wireless carriers' revenues subject to FUSF contribution assessment to better reflect end users' usage patterns. This change aims to address market shifts and revenue uncertainties, complicating business decisions. Alternative funding options for universal service include assessing all telecommunications service revenues, requiring congressional action for implementation. The FCC is considering expanding the assessment base for universal service fund contributions to include interstate, international, and intrastate service revenues. Congressional action would be needed to include intrastate revenues. Classification issues arise with services like interconnected VoIP services. The FCC is considering expanding the assessment base for universal service fund contributions to include interstate, international, and intrastate service revenues. This would lead to inconsistent treatment of services that compete with one another. The assessment would apply to all telecommunications and information service revenues, potentially imposing burdens on information services contrary to congressional and FCC policies. The FCC is considering expanding the assessment base for universal service fund contributions to include revenues from services and equipment benefiting from subsidies. This may be challenging due to the wide range of applications covered by information services. It would require modifications to the Communications Act and could potentially impose burdens on information services contrary to congressional and FCC policies. Expanding the assessment base for universal service fund contributions to include revenues from services and equipment benefiting from subsidies may be challenging. One option is to assess all connections to the public switched network based on bandwidth, which could widen the assessment base in a competitively neutral way. However, there are concerns about how to assign different assessment weights to connections of various capacity. Consumer groups have opposed this approach. Consumer groups oppose assessing all connections to the public switched network based on bandwidth, arguing it harms low network usage end users, including low-income households. Proponents believe a per connection charge is appropriate for universal service subsidy, noting that many low-income households are heavy telecommunications users eligible for subsidized telephone service. There are differing opinions on whether the Communications Act would need modification for the FCC to implement this approach. Consumer groups and proponents have differing opinions on assessing connections to the public switched network based on bandwidth for universal service subsidy. There is debate on whether the Communications Act would need modification for the FCC to use telephone numbers as the assessment base. Potential future technological changes could lead to the use of a different customer identifier. Some argue that universal service should be funded from general tax revenues to avoid market distortions, but this may put funding at risk during budget deficits. Another option is to allow rural carriers to set above-cost intercarrier compensation rates to maintain lower local rates, although some carriers are concerned about relying solely on external funding sources. Some rural LECs are concerned about relying on external sources for universal service funding. They propose maintaining above-cost rates for certain call traffic to ensure internal funding, but this could distort the market and face legal challenges. The FCC's 2005 order on DSL classification created a 270-day transition period to avoid market disruptions. The FCC's 2005 order on DSL classification created a 270-day transition period to avoid market disruptions. Rural telephone companies were given the option to continue treating DSL as a common carrier service to maintain universal service funding. According to the latest FCC data, high-speed Internet is widely available in zip codes with high population density, but less so in areas with low population density. The FCC is mandated to ensure broadband access for all Americans and take action to promote competition in the telecommunications market if necessary. The FCC concludes that the overall goal of section 706 is being met, with advanced telecommunications capability deployed to all Americans. Some commissioners dissent, arguing that the definition of broadband is outdated and zip code data does not accurately represent broadband availability. Rural telephone companies are already deploying broadband networks, with some offering IP video services. By the end of 2003, 100 independent telephone companies were offering digital video content services, with another 60 expected to do so by the end of 2004. Between 500 and 800 additional companies were projected to offer these services in the next four to five years. Farmers Telephone Cooperative and Progressive Rural Telephone are upgrading their networks with IPTV technology to offer video, voice, and data services before SBC and Verizon. Farmers will send three video streams to households, while Progressive will deliver IPTV and music content across its access lines. Progressive will provide IPTV and music content through its access lines, offering 141 television networks, six local channels, and 35 music channels. Rural Telecommunications notes Dakota Central Telecommunications using IPTV for voice, data, and video services to 5,000 customers in Carrington, ND, and 16,000 customers in Jamestown. Smaller rural telephone companies may face challenges in capital and cable network rates but could compete with local cable systems lacking cutting-edge technology. Universal service subsidies and rural development programs may support broadband deployment. Loan programs for rural development can support broadband network deployment, with some rural areas served by small telephone companies deploying faster than larger incumbents. Federal programs aim to foster broadband deployment in rural areas, as Congress addresses the lag in deployment. Verizon and SBC (now AT&T) have not committed to deploying broadband in their rural service areas. In 2001 and 2002, Congress and the Administration initiated pilot broadband loan and grant programs within the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to address the lagging deployment of broadband in rural areas. The Rural Electrification Act of 1936 was amended to authorize a loan and loan guarantee program for broadband service in eligible rural communities. Currently, RUS/USDA houses the only federal assistance programs dedicated to financing broadband deployment. The Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program, established in 2001, had an initial funding of $10.75 million in 2007 with a lending authority of $500 million. The Community Connect Broadband Grants program received $9 million in appropriations in FY2007. Criticisms of the program include issues with loan approval, eligibility criteria, and serving communities with existing providers. The program's authorization expires on September 30, 2007, and the 110th Congress is considering reauthorization and modifications as part of the farm bill. Key issues include applicant eligibility restrictions and defining \"rural\" communities. The Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program, established in 2001, had an initial funding of $10.75 million in 2007 with a lending authority of $500 million. The Community Connect Broadband Grants program received $9 million in appropriations in FY2007. Key issues include applicant eligibility restrictions, defining \"rural\" communities, addressing assistance to areas with pre-existing broadband service, technological neutrality, funding levels, and federal assistance appropriateness. Modifications to the RUS broadband program may result in winners and losers in terms of eligible companies, communities, regions, and technologies. Various government agencies have programs that could provide assistance. The Appalachian Regional Commission and the Denali Commission offer programs to fund broadband network infrastructure. Rural telephone companies like Dakota Central Communications have used the RUS broadband program to deploy IPTV architecture for triple play services. Municipalities are also utilizing these programs for broadband expansion. A growing number of municipalities are deploying broadband networks in rural and urban areas to provide access in underserved locations. Some use Wi-Fi hotspots as a marketing strategy, while others use technologies like optical fiber. However, 15 states have laws restricting municipal networks despite arguments for their benefits. Critics argue that municipal broadband networks may disadvantage some locations by only serving profitable areas, leading to a lack of economic development. They claim government intervention is necessary, while critics believe it is premature to assume the marketplace won't serve all areas. Concerns include municipal networks having cost advantages, unrealistic financial assumptions, and potential lack of upgrades compared to private networks. With the development of WiMAX technology, there are concerns that municipalities with small Wi-Fi networks may upgrade to compete with private networks. RBOCs and cable companies are pushing to prohibit municipal broadband networks. FCC chairman Kevin Martin emphasizes the importance of connecting rural areas to technology advancements, stating there may be a role for local governments in deploying their own equipment. The curr_chunk discusses the need for a balance between private sector deployment and government-sponsored players in providing services to communities where private companies are not willing to deploy. It highlights the importance of ensuring citizens have access to services while also mentioning the regulations in Title II of the Communications Act that govern traditional circuit-switched networks. The FCC has classified VoIP services as either telecommunications services or information services, causing uncertainty about regulatory requirements. One type of VoIP service, provided to customers with separate broadband Internet access, is not classified as \"telecommunications.\" The FCC has ruled that software is an \"information service\" and not subject to Title II regulation, except for voice services using IP technology without enhanced functionality. The FCC has ruled that interconnected VoIP services are not classified as telecommunications services or information services, but providers are still required to provide enhanced 911 service, accommodate wiretaps under CALEA, and contribute to the Federal Universal Service Fund. Competing voice services are subject to different regulatory regimes based on FCC classification. The Commission is working on classifying IP-enabled services. The FCC is working on classifying IP-enabled services, but is constrained by current statute in providing regulatory parity to competing voice services. There is ambiguity in the classification of certain voice services, suggesting a review of Title II telecommunications requirements may be timely. This review could determine applicable requirements for all voice services, regardless of technology and network. The FCC is reviewing Title II telecommunications requirements to determine applicable regulations for all voice services, regardless of technology and network. This includes ensuring interconnected VoIP providers can provide access to 911 and E911 services, requiring cooperation between VoIP providers and ILECs. The FCC has mandated interconnected VoIP providers to deliver all 911 calls to local emergency operators, provide call back number and location information (E911), and inform customers about E911 capabilities. ILECs are required to provide access to their E911 networks to any requesting telecommunications carrier. The FCC mandated interconnected VoIP providers to deliver 911 calls to local emergency operators and provide E911 capabilities. Government intervention was justified for public safety concerns, ensuring all voice providers have access to the E911 network. Some argue VoIP providers have an advantage due to lack of state taxes supporting E911 call centers. In 1994, Congress enacted CALEA to ensure law enforcement can conduct electronic surveillance despite new technologies. Telecommunications carriers must comply with authorized surveillance actions. FCC's order in 2005 stated CALEA applies to broadband Internet access providers and VoIP providers offering calls to the public switched network. The FCC adopted a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking more information about exempting certain broadband Internet access providers from CALEA. A second order clarified the compliance deadline for facilities-based broadband Internet access and interconnected VoIP services as May 14, 2007. The FCC does not plan to intervene in the standards-setting process for CALEA compliance. Telecom carriers have the option of using CALEA-compliant solutions. The FCC clarified compliance deadlines for broadband Internet access and VoIP services under CALEA, allowing carriers to use Trusted Third Parties for assistance. Compliance extensions are limited to pre-October 25, 1998 deployments, with carriers responsible for post-January 1, 1995 costs. The FCC has enforcement authority for non-compliance and declined a national surcharge for CALEA costs. The law enforcement goals of CALEA may conflict with competition and innovation objectives, with some technologies better suited for compliance than others. The CALEA requirements may impose upfront costs on new technologies, slowing innovation. There could be tension if network technologies move towards peer-to-peer networks, which may not align with law enforcement concerns. U.S. media policy goals of localism, competition, and diversity need to be considered in telecommunications policy due to market convergence. Section 601 of Title VI of the Communication Act emphasizes the local purpose of regulating cable television to ensure cable systems are responsive to the needs of the local community. It allows franchise authorities to require channels for public, educational, or governmental use, set aside channels for commercial use, and impose restrictions on cable system construction. New entrants offering multi-channel video services that do not meet the definition of cable service may face regulatory challenges. Policy makers may need to consider whether new service offerings that do not meet the definition of cable service should be subject to regulatory requirements to promote localism. They should also evaluate the impact on diversity of voices when broadband providers offering their own video services restrict access to independent applications. Television broadcast licensees are transitioning to digital television and will need to return spectrum by February 17, 2009. Television broadcasters transitioning to digital technology by February 17, 2009 may use their spectrum for multicasting. Cable operators are required to carry the primary signals of local broadcast stations. The FCC ruled that cable systems must carry the primary signal of a broadcaster multicasting video signals, but have no obligation to carry additional signals due to concerns about infringing on first amendment rights and duplicative content. The FCC may consider requiring cable operators to carry multiple programming streams from local broadcasters to promote localism, especially in cases where a broadcaster's serving area crosses state borders. This would allow broadcasters to address the needs and interests of viewers in different geographic areas. The FCC may consider requiring cable operators to carry multiple programming streams from local broadcasters to promote localism, especially in cases where a broadcaster's serving area crosses state borders. This approach would address the needs and interests of viewers in different geographic areas, without artificially encouraging or discouraging broadcasters from choosing multicasting over other digital technology applications. Congress might direct the FCC to study and recommend rules for mandatory carriage of multiple broadcast signals to better serve viewers in different governmental jurisdictions."
