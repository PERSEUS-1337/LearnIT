    "content": "The federal government allowed private development of nuclear power for peaceful purposes in 1954. The nuclear industry faced challenges like political barriers, high construction costs, and safety concerns after accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl. However, in recent years, there has been a resurgence in commercial nuclear power due to a more favorable regulatory environment and economic incentives. The resurgence of commercial nuclear power in the United States is driven by economic incentives, increasing energy demand, and concerns about climate change and energy security. Presidential and congressional support has led to the expansion of nuclear power, with new reactor license applications submitted since 2007. However, safety concerns following the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant disaster in Japan have the potential to slow this growth period. The resurgence of commercial nuclear power in the United States is driven by economic incentives, increasing energy demand, and concerns about climate change and energy security. However, heightened nuclear safety concerns have emerged, including issues with nuclear waste disposal, tritium leaks, wildfires threatening nuclear facilities, and controversy surrounding the NRC's role in licensing the Yucca Mountain facility. This has led to increased concerns over the safety of nuclear power as operating licenses for 18 reactors are set to expire by 2020. 18 reactors are set to expire by 2020 if not renewed. States like Vermont are taking action to ensure safe operation of power plants within their borders. Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant's continued operation is in dispute, raising questions about state control over nuclear power. Federal law limits states' ability to regulate nuclear power, with the Supreme Court emphasizing federal preemption in this area. The Atomic Energy Act (AEA) prevents states from regulating nuclear power for radiological safety due to federal preemption. The scope of AEA's preemptive effects is disputed, with the Supreme Court interpreting federal preemption. Preemption is based on the principle that federal law supersedes state law. The report will analyze preemption principles in the Vermont Yankee licensing dispute. The Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution establishes federal laws, statutes, regulations, and treaties as supreme over state laws. Federal law prevails over state law even if not completely incompatible, especially when Congress intends to have exclusive authority in a specific area. This can lead to preemption of state laws by federal laws, especially when Congress legislates comprehensively in a particular field. Courts aim to prevent conflicts between state and federal laws when determining preemption. The doctrine of preemption aims to prevent conflicting regulations between state and federal laws. It serves to enforce federal supremacy and reduce compliance burdens with multiple regulatory regimes. The Supreme Court has established three classes of preemption: express, conflict, and field preemption, all based on determining congressional intent. Express preemption occurs when federal statutes explicitly state the extent to which state laws are superseded. The federal statute supersedes related state laws, expressing Congress's clear intent to preempt state legislation. Even without explicit language, preemption can be implied if Congress intended to replace state authority. Preemption is generally implied in two situations: conflict preemption, where compliance with both federal and state laws is impossible, and when state laws obstruct federal goals. Federal preemption occurs when state law directly frustrates the purpose of a federal law or when a scheme of federal regulation is so pervasive that there is no room for states to supplement it. Congress can displace state law through statute or delegation to an agency, especially in heavily regulated fields like nuclear power. The debate on federal preemption of state regulation of nuclear power focuses on field preemption, which can be complex to apply. Courts consider various factors to determine if Congress intended to exclusively regulate a certain field. Prior to 1954, federal law did not preempt state regulation. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 shifted nuclear technology ownership from federal to private entities under strict federal regulation by the Atomic Energy Commission. This allowed private development of nuclear power while ensuring national security and public safety. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 transferred control of nuclear materials to private entities under federal regulation by the Atomic Energy Commission. In 1959, Congress amended the Act to give states more authority in regulating nuclear materials and power, clarifying responsibilities between states and the federal government. The amendments allowed the AEC to make agreements with states to discontinue AEC authority over certain nuclear materials. The 1959 amendments to the Atomic Energy Act gave states limited regulatory authority over nuclear materials, while affirming the AEC's control over nuclear power plant construction, operation, and material disposal. The amendments aimed to balance state and federal roles in power generation regulation. The 1959 amendments to the Atomic Energy Act affirmed the AEC's exclusive authority over radiological safety, while giving states limited regulatory authority over nuclear materials. The AEC was deemed more qualified than states to determine safety standards for nuclear facilities. The amendments aimed to clearly delineate the roles of state and federal agencies in regulating power generation. The 1959 amendments to the Atomic Energy Act aimed to clarify the roles of state and federal government in regulating nuclear power. However, the actual impact of the amendments was to create confusion over regulatory authority. The Supreme Court addressed the AEA's preemptive scope in 1983 in Pacific Gas & Electric v. State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission. In 1983, the Supreme Court upheld a California law that prohibited new nuclear power plant construction until a disposal solution for high-level nuclear waste was approved. The law aimed to prevent economic consequences from waste build-up, not radiological safety concerns, and was deemed outside the preemptive scope of the Atomic Energy Act. The Supreme Court upheld a California law in 1983 that prohibited new nuclear power plant construction until a disposal solution for high-level nuclear waste was approved. The Court affirmed the state's authority in regulating electrical utilities and stated that Congress intended for dual regulation of nuclear-powered electricity generation, with states retaining the power to determine the need for nuclear power. The Supreme Court upheld a California law in 1983 that prohibited new nuclear power plant construction until a disposal solution for high-level nuclear waste was approved. The Court affirmed the state's authority in regulating electrical utilities and stated that Congress intended for dual regulation of nuclear-powered electricity generation, with states retaining the power to determine the need for nuclear power. The Court determined that state laws regulating the construction and operation of nuclear power plants would be preempted by federal law, specifically by the NRC's exclusive authority. The Supreme Court ruled in 1983 that state regulations motivated by radiological safety concerns are broadly preempted by the Atomic Energy Act (AEA). State attempts to regulate nuclear power based on safety concerns are invalid as Congress has delegated authority over nuclear safety to the NRC. However, if a non-safety rationale can be established, the state law may avoid preemption. The California law prohibiting new nuclear power plant construction was upheld as it was based on economic consequences rather than safety issues. The Court rejected further investigation into the legislature's motivations. The Supreme Court in 1983 ruled that state regulations motivated by radiological safety concerns are preempted by the Atomic Energy Act. California's law prohibiting new nuclear power plant construction was upheld based on economic concerns, not safety issues. The Court refused to investigate the state's true motive and stated that NRC's regulation does not conflict with the state statute. The California law prohibits the construction of new nuclear power plants until the state is satisfied that nuclear waste disposal will not hinder power generation. The Supreme Court upheld the law, stating that federal government regulates nuclear waste storage exclusively. The Court rejected the argument that the law obstructs Congress' objectives, emphasizing that promoting nuclear power should not come at any cost. The Supreme Court upheld a California law that prohibits new nuclear power plant construction until waste disposal is ensured. Congress allows states to slow or stop nuclear power development for economic reasons. The AEA aims to encourage, not mandate, nuclear power development. States have authority over the need for nuclear power, and economic decisions can restrict development. The Pacific Gas case sets the precedent for federal-state authority division in nuclear power development. The Supreme Court decision in Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee clarified that states can award punitive damages for radiological leaks from nuclear facilities, despite federal regulations under the AEA. This ruling narrowed the federal government's authority in the nuclear power field. The Supreme Court clarified in Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee that states can award damages for radiation injuries without conflicting with federal regulations. In a recent case, the Court also ruled that a state claim for emotional distress by a nuclear power plant employee did not fall under federal preemption. The Supreme Court clarified in English v. Pacific Gas that state laws related to nuclear safety complaints are not preempted by federal regulations. The Court expanded its field preemption standards, stating that safety motivation is not necessary for a state law to fall within the preempted field. The Supreme Court in English v. Pacific Gas clarified that state laws affecting nuclear safety must be analyzed based on both their purpose and effect. Laws motivated by radiological safety concerns or with a significant impact on nuclear plant safety are preempted by federal regulations. However, the Court found that a tort law in question did not meet these criteria for preemption. The Supreme Court has not revisited preemption under the AEA since the English case in 1990. In Skull Valley Band of Goshute Indians v. Nielson, the Tenth Circuit Court held that Utah statutes regulating nuclear waste storage were preempted by the AEA due to safety concerns for citizens. The Tenth Circuit Court ruled that Utah statutes on nuclear waste storage were preempted by the AEA for safety reasons. In U.S. v. Manning, the Ninth Circuit struck down Washington State's Cleanup Priority Act related to mixed waste contamination at Hanford Nuclear Reservation. The Ninth Circuit ruled that Washington State's Cleanup Priority Act was preempted by the Atomic Energy Act due to its regulation of radioactive materials to protect health and safety. The Act directly impacted decisions on radiological safety and disposal of nuclear waste. The court found that the Cleanup Priority Act would impact the DOE's decisions on nuclear waste management. While the AEA limits state regulation of nuclear reactors for safety, states still have authority over areas like generating capacity and electric power transmission. States asserting authority over nuclear power focus on areas outside radiological safety and plant operation laws. Many states have laws regulating the construction and operation of nuclear power plants, focusing on factors like economic feasibility and disposal of nuclear waste. Some states prohibit new plants altogether, while others require specific findings or approval processes before allowing new plants to be established. These laws aim to prevent the establishment of new nuclear power plants without asserting control over existing ones. Vermont's laws require a certificate of public good for new power plants, with the General Assembly having authority over Vermont Yankee's operation beyond 2012. Vermont may stop the nuclear plant by blocking the necessary approval from the Public Service Board. The Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant's licensing background is complex. Entergy Nuclear bought the plant in 2002 with NRC authorization to operate until March 21, 2012. Approval from the Vermont Public Service Board was required for the sale. Entergy agreed to the PSB's authority to decide on the plant's operation beyond 2012 in exchange for support from the Vermont Department of Public Service. Vermont law prohibited new facility construction. The Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant, owned by Entergy, required approval from the Vermont General Assembly for additional waste storage beyond March 21, 2012. Act 160 prohibited the plant's operation beyond this date without approval from the Public Service Board. The Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant, owned by Entergy, needed legislative approval to operate and store nuclear waste beyond March 21, 2012. The NRC renewed the plant's operating license until March 21, 2032, after a thorough review. The Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant, owned by Entergy, had its operating license renewed by the NRC until March 21, 2032. However, the Governor of Vermont indicated that approval for the plant's operation beyond 2012 would not be granted. Entergy challenged the state's authority in court, seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent the plant from being shut down before purchasing $60 million in nuclear fuel. The district court recently denied Entergy's request. The Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant, owned by Entergy, faced a legal battle with the state of Vermont over its operation. Entergy sought a preliminary injunction to prevent the plant from being shut down before purchasing $60 million in nuclear fuel. The district court denied the request, raising novel legal issues regarding states' abilities to determine the fate of existing nuclear power plants. The legal battle between Entergy and Vermont over the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant could impact states' authority to regulate nuclear plants. Entergy argues that Vermont's statutes infringe on federal authority and preempt the shutdown of the plant. The court will determine if Vermont's laws address radiological safety concerns. The court will determine if Vermont's laws addressing radiological safety concerns fall within federal authority, potentially impacting states' regulation of nuclear plants. The court will consider the purpose of the laws based on statutory language, legislative history, and intent, with a focus on safety as a determining factor for preemption. The district court will assess whether Vermont's statutes regarding nuclear safety are motivated by safety concerns. Act 189's impact on Acts 75 and 160 will be scrutinized, with little explicit evidence of radiological safety as the primary motive. Act 74 emphasizes the state's need for diverse, reliable, and environmentally sustainable power supply, rather than solely focusing on safety concerns. Act 74 and Act 160 in Vermont mandate financial assurance and compliance with federal standards for nuclear waste storage at Vermont Yankee. The legislation also considers the state's power needs, environmental impacts, and economic factors when evaluating the operation of the facility. Act 160 directs the Department of Public Service to conduct studies on long-term environmental, economic, and public health issues. The Public Service Board must consider these factors when deciding on the continued operation of a nuclear power plant like Vermont Yankee. The statutes focus on state concerns such as power generation diversity, waste storage costs, power needs, and economic considerations. The recently enacted statute in Vermont suggests that the General Assembly may base its decision on whether to approve the continued operation of Vermont Yankee on safety concerns. Act 189 called for an independent reliability assessment of the power plant, including investigations on radiological safety systems. This included assessments of core cooling, containment, heat removal systems, and safety system separation. The statute also required a physical examination of the plant, which raised concerns about regulatory jurisdiction. Additionally, a public oversight panel was established. The General Assembly in Vermont may base its decision on whether to approve the continued operation of Vermont Yankee on safety concerns. Act 189 required an independent reliability assessment of the power plant, including investigations on radiological safety systems. A public oversight panel was created to report findings to the General Assembly for consideration. This could be interpreted as primarily focused on the plant's operational safety. Vermont could argue that any decision to prohibit the continued operation of Vermont Yankee would be based on reliability rather than safety concerns, focusing on safety-related shutdowns and the adequacy of the plant's safety systems. The court will likely consider how the three statutes interrelate, the role of the \"reliability assessment,\" and whether Vermont's reliability concerns can be distinguished from safety concerns. The court may also look at evidence of legislative intent outside the text of the statutes to determine if the Vermont statutes are grounded in safety concerns. Entergy has argued that the legislative history and public comments support safety concerns, despite limited evidence in the plain text of the statutes. The court may consider evidence of legislative intent outside the text of the statutes to determine if the Vermont statutes are grounded in safety concerns. The burden of proving legislative intent is also a key question, with lower courts willing to investigate deeper into this issue. The Tenth Circuit suggests that the burden is on the state to prove its non-safety rationale for enacting statutes. Vermont may have to prove the basis of their non-safety rationale, facing challenges due to the differences between California's regulated market and Vermont Yankee's deregulated status. In California, a new nuclear power plant would have economic consequences directly felt by the state or customers, unlike Vermont Yankee. The Tenth Circuit suggests that Vermont may need to prove the basis of their non-safety rationale for shutting down Vermont Yankee, facing challenges due to the differences between California's regulated market and Vermont Yankee's deregulated status. If the court finds that Vermont's statutes are based on radiological safety concerns, they would be preempted by the NRC. The state may still be able to justify a shutdown based on alternative economic concerns. The court will look to the text of Vermont statutes to discern their purpose, considering legislative intent and how the statutes interrelate. A finding that the laws were not based on safety concerns does not necessarily mean they avoid NRC preemption. State laws grounded in nuclear safety concerns are not required to be within the preempted field. The court clarified that state laws regulating nuclear power plant construction must have a direct and substantial effect on safety to be preempted by the NRC. In Pacific Gas, the court ruled that California's moratorium on new nuclear plants did not seek to regulate plant construction. States can determine non-safety reasons for regulating nuclear power plants. The Vermont statutes, like the California law in Pacific Gas, focus on whether a plant operates rather than how it operates. Entergy argues that Vermont laws differ as they claim authority to prohibit existing plant operation, unlike California's law which only prohibited new plant construction. Entergy argues that Vermont laws claim authority to prohibit existing plant operation, unlike California's law which only prohibited new plant construction. The courts have maintained a distinction between new and existing nuclear power plants, limiting states' authority to the decision of whether a plant shall be built. Vermont contends that states retain final authority on whether a plant may operate, citing NRC recognition. The Court has affirmed states' power to slow or stop nuclear power development for economic reasons. The Court has established that states may preclude the construction or operation of a nuclear power plant, even if approved by the NRC, for economic reasons. It remains unclear if these principles apply to the operation context as well. The Court has established that states have the authority to regulate nuclear plants based on power needs, including the ability to shut down existing plants if deemed excessive. This could potentially bind states to their initial decisions on nuclear power plant construction. The Court has established that states have the authority to regulate nuclear plants based on power needs, including the ability to shut down existing plants if deemed excessive. However, Entergy's interpretation of the AEA's preemptive effects may prevent states from ceasing operation of a nuclear plant as long as the NRC renews the plant's license. Vermont argues that the final decision on whether to continue operating a federally licensed plant lies with the utility, state, and federal decision-makers, despite NRC regulations governing license renewal. The NRC's understanding that states retain the ultimate decision on operating nuclear power plants is not supported by any binding authority. Congressional intent, not NRC's position, determines authority under the AEA. The outcome of the Vermont Yankee case will impact state authority to regulate and terminate nuclear plants. Court's decision on whether Vermont laws were enacted for safety reasons will be crucial. The Vermont Yankee case will determine the extent of state regulatory authority over nuclear power plants. Preemption is based on congressional intent, and Congress has the power to define the scope of preemption. If Congress disagrees with a court's interpretation, it can amend the statute to clarify preemptive effects. Congress also has the authority to restrict or expand state regulation in certain areas. Ultimately, it is up to Congress to decide if a state has misused its regulatory authority. Courts have struggled to define the preemptive field from the NRC's authority over nuclear power plant safety. The AEA has conflicting interpretations, leading to conflicting case law. Congress can adjust preemptive boundaries by amending the AEA. The Supreme Court invited Congress to clarify the division of regulatory authority between states and the federal government in cases like the California moratorium. The Supreme Court emphasized that Congress has the authority to adjust the preemptive field of the Atomic Energy Act (AEA) to address concerns about state regulation of nuclear power. Congress is encouraged to clarify the division of regulatory authority between states and the federal government in order to mitigate uncertainty surrounding field preemption under the AEA."
