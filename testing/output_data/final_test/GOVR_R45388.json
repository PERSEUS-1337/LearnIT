    "content": "Since the 1962 civil war and military coup in Burma, the Tatmadaw and associated security forces have been accused of human rights violations against ethnic minorities. Congress imposed sanctions on Burma from 1990 to 2008 due to these abuses. Allegations of abuses resurfaced in 2017 with the displacement of Rohingya and renewed offensives against ethnic groups. The Trump Administration labeled the Tatmadaw's actions as \"ethnic cleansing\" and imposed sanctions on five officers. The House of Representatives passed H.Res. 1091 (116 th Congress) condemning the atrocities committed against the Rohingya by the Burmese military as crimes against humanity and genocide. Various organizations have investigated allegations of human rights violations by Burmese security forces in ethnic states since the transfer of power to the Tatmadaw. Various organizations have released reports documenting evidence of human rights violations in Burma's ethnic states since the transfer of power to a mixed civilian/military government in 2011. The reports implicate specific Burmese security personnel and units for intentional, premeditated, and systemic abuses, with some suggesting genocide or war crimes. Certain officers and units are identified across multiple reports as responsible for violations in different ethnic states and times. This report compiles a list of Burmese security personnel and units responsible for human rights violations as documented in various reports by organizations like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. The curr_chunk provides a list of reports documenting human rights violations by the Burmese Army, including crimes against humanity, ongoing offensives, attacks against civilians, and militarization in Southeast Myanmar. The reports highlight issues such as sexual violence, war crimes, and the Rohingya massacre in Myanmar. The curr_chunk lists various reports documenting human rights violations by the Burmese Army, including crimes against humanity, sexual violence, war crimes, and the Rohingya massacre in Myanmar. The UNFFM report recommends referring human rights abuse allegations in Burma to the ICC for investigation and possible prosecution, specifically identifying six Burmese military leaders for investigation. The UNFFM report recommends referring human rights abuse allegations in Burma to the ICC for investigation and prosecution, identifying six Burmese military leaders. The report also calls for the creation of an independent mechanism to collect evidence and recommends targeted sanctions and an arms embargo on Burma. The Department of State conducted a preliminary investigation into alleged human rights abuses in Rakhine State, with disagreements on categorizing the Tatmadaw's attacks on the Rohingya. On August 28, 2018, then-U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley presented details of the State Department's report on Rohingya atrocities to the U.N Security Council. The investigation involved interviews with 1,024 Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, revealing that Burmese military and security forces were the main perpetrators of crimes. The State Department later released a 20-page publication documenting atrocities in Northern Rakhine State. The State Department's report on Rohingya atrocities revealed extreme violence and destruction of homes in Northern Rakhine State. The recent violence was described as large-scale and geared towards terrorizing the population. It remains unclear if the atrocities are considered genocide, crimes against humanity, or war crimes. President Win Myint appointed a team to assist with humanitarian efforts. President Win Myint appointed U.N. Kenzo Oshima, Aung Tun Thet, and Mya Thein to head the Independent Commission of Enquiry (ICOE) to investigate human rights violations in Rakhine following terrorist attacks by ARSA. The military is ready to cooperate with the commission, which visited Rakhine State on December 21, 2018. The ICOE is gathering evidence and has set a deadline of January 31, 2019, for evidence submission. ICOE set a deadline of January 31, 2019, for evidence submission regarding human rights abuses in Rakhine State. Despite denials by Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing, sanctions have been imposed by the US, Australia, Canada, and the EU on Burmese military officials for human rights violations. On October 5, 2018, Australia imposed financial sanctions on five Burmese security officers, including three individuals sanctioned by the EU and Canada. Two officers were sanctioned by Australia, Canada, and the EU, but not the United States. The tables list the names of Burmese security force officers and units responsible for human rights violations in Burma since 2011. The curr_chunk discusses human rights abuses in Burma, including arbitrary arrests, attacks on civilians, and extrajudicial killings. It highlights the actions of the Commission, Cover-up, and civilians involved in these violations. The curr_chunk discusses human rights abuses in Burma, including extrajudicial killing, forced labor, sexual violence, and torture. It mentions that military personnel and units listed in the tables may need further investigation for their potential involvement in these abuses. The tables suggest patterns of human rights abuse allegations in Burma, showing pervasive and systemic abuse by Tatmadaw across various military units and ethnic minority states. Troubled units like Infantry Division 33 and Infantry Division 99 are repeatedly implicated in alleged abuses in different states. The tables show patterns of human rights abuses in Burma, with various military units like Infantry Battalions 324, 502, 503, and 567 implicated in alleged abuses in Kachin, Rakhine, and Shan states. Calls for accountability mechanisms, including referral to the International Criminal Court, have been reinforced by reports of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes committed by Burma's security forces. The Rome Statute established procedures for cases to be referred to the ICC's Prosecutor for investigation and prosecution. The Security Council can refer cases to the ICC under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. Only one case, the situation in Darfur, Sudan, has been referred by the Security Council to the ICC. Nonprocedural decisions of the UNSC, including referrals to the ICC, require an affirmative vote of nine members, including the permanent members. The current members of the UN Security Council are China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, along with 10 nonpermanent members. China and possibly Russia are expected to veto any referral to the ICC. The UK is considering various options, while France has not made a public statement. The Trump Administration's stance is uncertain, with Ambassador Haley emphasizing the need to hold those responsible for violence accountable. In September 2018, National Security Advisor John Bolton stated the US policy of non-cooperation with the ICC. ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda requested jurisdiction over the forced deportation of Rohingya from Burma into Bangladesh, arguing it was a crime against humanity. Bolton did not mention the Burma situation in his speech. The ICC Prosecutor has initiated a preliminary investigation into the Rohingya crisis in Bangladesh, including alleged crimes such as killings, sexual violence, and property destruction. A team from the ICC is set to visit Bangladesh in March 2019 for further examination. Bangladesh's Prime Minister has expressed willingness to cooperate with the investigation. Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has agreed to cooperate with the ICC team investigating the Rohingya crisis. Burma has rejected the ICC's decision and will not assist in the investigation. An alternative to the ICC could be the creation of an ad hoc International Criminal Tribunal (ICT) to prosecute human rights abuses in Burma, similar to tribunals established for Yugoslavia and Rwanda. The UNSC has established Special Courts in various countries to adjudicate cases of human rights violations. On September 28, 2018, the UNHRC approved a resolution for an independent mechanism to collect and analyze evidence of international humanitarian law violations in Rwanda and neighbouring states in 1994. The UNHRC approved a resolution for an independent mechanism to collect, preserve, and analyze evidence of serious international crimes in Myanmar since 2011. The mechanism will prepare files for fair criminal proceedings and have access to information collected by the UNFFM. The UNHRC approved a resolution for an independent mechanism to collect, preserve, and analyze evidence of serious international crimes in Myanmar since 2011. The mechanism will prepare files for fair criminal proceedings and have access to information collected by the UNFFM. The resolution requested the prompt appointment of staff and allocation of resources for the new mechanism, extending the mandate of the UNFFM until it is operational. The new mechanism aims to document and verify evidence of violations of international humanitarian law and human rights abuses for potential criminal proceedings. The UN General Assembly approved funding for an \"independent, impartial mechanism\" to prosecute serious crimes in Syria since 2011. The US supports the International, Impartial, and Independent Mechanism (IIIM) for crimes in Syria, but has not indicated its position on a similar mechanism for Rakhine State. The US supports the IIIM for holding the Assad regime accountable for atrocities, including chemical weapons use. In FY2018, nearly $350,000 was provided for the IIIM. The 116th Congress allocated funds for investigating human rights violations in Burma, including ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya people in Rakhine state. The House committee report allocated funds for investigating and documenting human rights violations in Burma, specifically focusing on the Rohingya people in Rakhine state. Funds will support civil society organizations in Bangladesh and Burma for this purpose.

Funds will support civil society organizations in Bangladesh and Burma. The UNFFM and human rights organizations recommend UNSC sanctions on Burma, including a global arms embargo, travel bans, asset freezes for senior officials, and trade/investment prohibitions with military-controlled businesses. The UNSC has imposed sanctions on countries like the Central African Republic, Haiti, Rwanda, South Africa, South Sudan, Sudan, and the former Yugoslavia for human rights violations. The United States has restrictions on relations with Burma, including visa and economic restrictions on military officers and units. Additional sanctions could be imposed by the Trump Administration. The Trump Administration has the authority to sanction individuals and units responsible for human rights violations under the Global Magnitsky Act. If genocide is determined in Burma, offenders could face prosecution under the Human Rights Enforcement Act of 2009, with penalties including death sentence or life in prison. The United States can exercise jurisdiction over the case if the offender is present in the country, as a party to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The United States, Bangladesh, and Burma are parties to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. They pledge to enact necessary legislation and grant extradition in cases of genocide. The US had maintained restrictions on relations with Burma before the events in Rakhine State. The US has imposed restrictions on economic assistance and military equipment sales to Burma due to human rights violations, including against Rohingya and other minority groups. These restrictions are in line with the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019. Other limitations on relations with Burma are currently being waived under presidential authority. The US has imposed various restrictions on Burma, including bans on imports of jadeite and rubies, freezing assets of certain nationals, and limitations on investments and assistance. President Trump could reinstate past restrictions without Congress. Congress has introduced legislation and resolutions to address alleged human rights violations in Burma, shaping U.S. policy through appropriation legislation and hearings. Congressional delegations have traveled to investigate and express concerns to Burma's leaders. In response to alleged human rights violations in Burma, Congress has introduced legislation and resolutions, shaping U.S. policy. The actions taken by Congress will be influenced by bilateral relations and regional concerns, such as China's influence in Southeast Asia. Some view Burma's transition as fragile, while others see human rights abuses as evidence that the military leaders are not committed to democracy. In the 115th Congress, two bills were introduced regarding U.S. policy in Burma. Two bills introduced in the 115th Congress aimed to address alleged human rights violations in Burma. The Burma Unified through Rigorous Military Accountability (BURMA) Act of 2018 (H.R. 5819) and the Burma Human Rights and Freedom Act of 2018 (S. 2060) proposed measures such as imposing a visa ban on senior military officers involved in abuses, restricting security assistance, and opposing international financial institution loans to Burma linked to the military. S. 2060 also called for a review of Burma's eligibility for the Generalized System of Preferences program. In the 115th Congress, bills were introduced to address human rights violations in Burma, including the BURMA Act of 2018 and the Burma Human Rights and Freedom Act of 2018. The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations reported S. 2060 favorably out of committee with an amendment, but the bill did not receive floor action. In the 116th Congress, a resolution condemning violence against Rohingya and ethnic minorities in Burma was introduced. The 116th Congress included provisions in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 placing restrictions on assistance to Burma. Congress has held hearings on Burma since September 2017, including discussions on the Rohingya crisis. The 116th Congress included provisions in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 placing restrictions on assistance to Burma. Hearings since September 2017 have focused on the Rohingya crisis, with Members of Congress viewing Burma's security forces' actions as genocide or crimes against humanity. Many criticize the Trump Administration's response as inadequate. Congress may send delegations to investigate human rights violations in Bangladesh and Burma. Congress may send delegations to investigate human rights violations in Bangladesh and Burma, including alleged genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. The delegations could meet with Burmese government officials and military leaders to express opinions on accountability measures."
