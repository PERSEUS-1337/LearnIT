    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 3104 of the Elections Code is amended to streamline the process for military or overseas voters to apply for and receive ballots. Applications must be received and ballots canvassed in the same manner as vote by mail ballots. Section 3105 specifies that applications received before the 60th day before the election will be processed accordingly. The elections official must send the ballot 60-45 days before the election, including a list of candidates and measures. Military or overseas voters can use a federal write-in absentee ballot. The elections official must process ballots for military or overseas voters according to specific procedures, including counting write-in candidate names if they have qualified for the office. Military or overseas voters who also apply for a vote by mail ballot will have their application and ballot processed according to election regulations. A military or overseas voter can register and apply for a ballot by facsimile transmission. The elections official will send the ballot by mail, facsimile, or electronic transmission upon request. Section 3106.2 is added to the Elections Code. A military or overseas voter can return their vote by mail ballot via electronic mail, following specific guidelines. The ballot must be received by the elections official before the polls close on election day, accompanied by necessary documentation. To submit a ballot by electronic mail, scanned copies of the ballot, identification envelope, and oath of voter declaration must be sent as attachments. Procedures to protect ballot secrecy must be in place. The elections official will verify the voter's eligibility by comparing signatures and duplicate the ballot if necessary. Uniform regulations for electronic mail ballot submission will be adopted by the Secretary of State. Section 3106.5 of the Elections Code allows military or overseas voters to cast their vote on the Internet by securely transmitting their electronically marked ballot to the elections official. The Secretary of State will establish uniform regulations for this process, contingent upon addressing all security issues. Section 1.5 (commencing with Section 3050) is added to Division 3 of the Elections Code, introducing Electronic Ballot Transmission. Electronic Ballot Transmission allows elections officials to securely send ballots electronically within the county."
