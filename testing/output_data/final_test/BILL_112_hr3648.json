    "content": "The \"Harbor Fairness Act of 2011\" may be cited as such. It includes an assessment of dredging needs. The Water Resources Development Act of 1986 is amended to require the Secretary to assess the operation and maintenance needs of various harbors every two years, including those used for commercial navigation, fishing, subsistence, ceremonial purposes by Indian tribes, as harbors of refuge, and for transportation of persons. The Secretary is required to assess harbor operation and maintenance needs every two years for various purposes including commercial navigation, fishing, Indian tribes, harbors of refuge, transportation of persons, domestic energy production, recreation, and other authorized purposes. Additionally, a report to Congress is to be submitted biennially along with the President's budget for fiscal year 2013 and thereafter. The Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate submitted a report detailing the operation and maintenance costs, funding requests, unmet needs, and identified harbors for commercial navigation projects. The President will allocate funding for operation and maintenance activities in identified harbors over the next 5 fiscal years on a project-by-project basis. SEC. 3. ALLOCATION AND EXPENDITURES FOR LOCAL HARBOR PROJECTS. Section 210 of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 is amended to require equitable allocation of funds from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund for operation and maintenance costs of harbors, regardless of size or tonnage throughput. The Secretary must consider assessment information and national/regional criteria for fund distribution. The Secretary must allocate funds from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund based on national and regional significance, not solely on tonnage. A minimum of 40% of expenditures for moderate and low use harbors must be allocated for operation and maintenance costs in fiscal years 2013 and 2014. Emergency expenditures for specific harbors are allowed. The Secretary can transfer funds for operation and maintenance costs of a harbor if necessary due to restricted navigation from an unforeseen event, with advance notice to relevant committees."
