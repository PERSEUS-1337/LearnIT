International participation has been sought to support combat operations, stabilization efforts, training Iraqi security forces, and providing financial support for reconstruction. UN Security Council Resolutions 1511 and 1546 authorized a multinational force under U.S. command to assist Iraqis in securing their country and training their security forces. Resolution 1546 of June 8, 2004 reaffirmed the U.N. mandate for the U.S.-led multinational force in Iraq to maintain security and stability. This mandate has been extended by Resolutions 1637, 1723, and 1790. A \"Declaration of Principles\" signed by Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and President Bush in 2007 aimed to replace the U.N. mandate with a long-term bilateral agreement. Training Iraqi security forces is a key topic in the negotiations for the strategic framework agreement. The U.S.-Iraqi negotiations will determine the size and focus of the military presence in Iraq, impacting foreign contributions to stabilization and training efforts. The report analyzes foreign contributions in terms of personnel, resources, financial aid, troop contributions to MNF-I, and training efforts for Iraqi security forces. The report analyzes foreign contributions to the Iraqi security forces training effort, including financial and personnel contributions. In October 2003, the estimated cost of Iraqi reconstruction needs was $55 billion over a four-year period. This included a joint assessment by the World Bank/UNDG of $36 billion and a $19.4 billion projection by the Coalition Provisional Authority for security, oil, and other sectors. Since mid-2003, significant costs have arisen due to instability and security disruptions in Iraq. Following UN Security Council Resolution 1511, an international donors' conference in Madrid pledged $16.4 billion for Iraq's reconstruction, with $10.8 billion in loans and $5.6 billion in grants. Iraq has accepted $2.2 billion in loans and received $4.8 billion in grants, with $1.766 billion channeled through the World Bank Iraq Trust. Iraq has received $1.766 billion in pledged assistance through the World Bank Iraq Trust Fund and UNDG Iraq Trust Fund. The United States Congress has allocated nearly $43 billion for Iraq's reconstruction programs. Security issues and Iraqi government capacity challenges have slowed the disbursement of international aid. Iraq's Ministry of Planning has a Donor Assistance Database to track donor activities and project implementation. Iraq is also seeking debt relief through negotiations with the Paris Club and the International Compact with Iraq. At a summit in Sharm al-Sheikh, Egypt in May 2007, Iraq's government owed $89 billion to international creditors. $28.9 billion in loan forgiveness was pledged in 2007. The U.S., U.K., Australia, and Poland were directly involved in combat operations in Iraq. The Multinational Force-Iraq (MNF-I) led by Gen. David Petraeus oversaw military operations. Coalition troop numbers have declined with some countries withdrawing their contingents. The United States remains the largest contributor of forces to MNF-I, with 161,783 troops as of December 1, 2007. The drawdown of \"surge\" forces began in December 2007, with the redeployment of the 3rd Brigade Combat Team of the 1st Cavalry Division from Diyala province. U.S. troop levels in Iraq have varied over time, peaking at about 250,000 during major combat operations and around 168,000 post-major combat in October 2007. Other major contributors to MNF-I include the United Kingdom, Georgia, Australia, South Korea, and Poland, with their deployments currently in flux. Deployments are currently in flux for various countries involved in MNF-I. The United Kingdom is reducing its forces from 5,500 to 2,500 by spring 2008. Georgia increased its forces in Iraq from 850 to 2,000. Australia's new Prime Minister plans to withdraw their combat force from Iraq by mid-2008, but other personnel may remain for training and logistics. In late October 2007, South Korean President Roh Moo Hyun announced a decision to extend the deployment mandate for another year but to reduce the force from 1,200 to 600 in Iraq. In November 2007, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk stated his goal to withdraw Poland's contingent from Iraq by the end of 2008. Foreign government decisions to send or redeploy forces to Iraq depend on factors like security, domestic politics, legal restrictions, economic opportunities, and bilateral arrangements. Public discussions about the coalition force presence in Iraq have been marked by confusion due to fluctuating troop numbers and deployments to different organizations like MNF-I, NTM-I, and UNAMI. Troop-contributing countries may change contingent sizes for various reasons, such as unit rotations or individual situations like injury. Some countries, like Japan and Singapore, deploy troops that directly support MNF-I. Some countries, like Japan and Singapore, deploy troops that directly support MNF-I but are based outside Iraq. The U.S. Department of Defense maintains troop levels in Iraq in classified format due to some countries not wanting to be publicly identified. Public information about troop levels in Iraq mostly comes from the respective troop-contributing countries. The Department of Defense provides the total number of coalition troops and an unclassified list of troop-contributing countries to the Department of State for inclusion in publicly available reports. Since the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime, coalition forces in Iraq have contributed to training and equipping Iraqi security forces. As of December 13, 2007, 26 countries, excluding the United States, have a total of about 11,586 troops in MNF-I. There have been 307 coalition fatalities reported, with the United Kingdom having the highest number at 174. Other countries with fatalities include Italy, Poland, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Spain, Denmark, El Salvador, Slovakia, Latvia, Romania, Thailand, Australia, Netherlands, Estonia, South Korea, Czech Republic, Kazakhstan, Hungary, and Georgia. Since the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime, coalition forces in Iraq have trained and equipped Iraqi security forces. The Coalition Provisional Authority dissolved all Iraqi military services, leading to the development of new Iraqi police and military forces. The Iraqi Civil Defense Corps was formed as a temporary security and emergency service agency. National Security Presidential Directive 36 assigned the mission of organizing, training, and equipping Iraq's security forces to U.S. Central Command, which created the Multi-National Security Transition Command-Iraq (MNSTC-I) under U.S. Lieutenant General James Dubik's leadership. MNSTC-I continues to train and mentor Iraqi security forces. The Multi-National Security Transition Command-Iraq (MNSTC-I), led by U.S. Lieutenant General James Dubik, trains and mentors Iraqi military and police services, as well as the Ministries of Interior and Defense. Training initiatives involve coalition partners and international police instructors from various countries. The MNSTC-I, led by U.S. Lieutenant General James Dubik, collaborates with coalition partners and international police instructors to train and mentor Iraqi military and police services, as well as the Ministries of Interior and Defense. NATO member countries approved the creation of a security force training mission in Iraq in June 2004, with the first personnel arriving in Baghdad in August 2004 to identify training opportunities and develop an action plan for NATO-supported training. The NATO Training Mission-Iraq (NTM-I) was established to train and mentor Iraqi security forces. Initially, a small number of Iraqi military officers underwent training at a NATO facility in Norway. The mission expanded from 60 to 300 personnel, focusing on advising and mentoring Iraqi counterparts. The current initiative involves helping the Iraqi armed forces develop Non-Commissioned Officers. The NATO Training Mission-Iraq (NTM-I) is assisting the Iraqi armed forces in developing a Non-Commissioned Officer corps. NTM-I's Training Equipment and Synchronization Cell (TESC) evaluates equipment and training requirements with the Iraqi Ministry of Defense, coordinating efforts with donor nations. Over 1,000 Iraqi personnel have received training in NATO countries. NTM-I collaborates with the Iraqi Training and Doctrine Command, overseeing tactical and classroom education through Iraq's National Defense University and various colleges. This includes the National Defense College, Defense Language Institute, and Joint Staff College at Ar Rustamiyah. At a NATO meeting on February 22, 2005, all 26 NATO member countries agreed to contribute troops, financing, or equipment to support NTM-I. As of October 2007, 16 countries including the United States had personnel assigned to NTM-I, with some NATO members providing material or training support outside of Iraq. Other countries like Germany, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Jordan also offered support. Other countries such as Germany, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Jordan have provided funding, personnel, and facilities for training Iraqi security forces. Jordan has hosted a significant training program for Iraqi police officers, with over 50,000 police trained in various skills. Germany, Japan, and the United Arab Emirates have collaborated to train Iraqi police officers in crime scene exploitation and police methodology. Since late 2003, Iraqi police officers have been trained in crime scene exploitation and police methodology by officials from Japan, the Emirates, and Germany's Bundeskriminalamt. The training program is based in the UAE. In December 2004, German officials announced an expansion of a program in the UAE that trained Iraqi military drivers and mechanics to use and service surplus German military trucks. Additionally, in late 2004, an Iraqi infantry company participated in a joint training program with the Egyptian army at the Mubarak Military City in northern Egypt. Egypt is willing to expand their training program for Iraqi military officers."
