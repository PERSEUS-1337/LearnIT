    "content": "Subsection 224(a) of the USA PATRIOT Act sets a termination date of March 10, 2006 for certain sections in Title II, with exceptions for foreign intelligence investigations and criminal cases. Questions arise about the impact of expiring sections, exceptions, and ongoing provisions as the sunset date approaches. The 9/11 Commission acknowledged the impending expiration and its implications. The expiring sections of the USA PATRIOT Act deal with federal authorities' power to conduct searches and seizures related to communications. These sections allow authorities to act more quickly, with fewer layers of approval, targeting a wider range of subjects. This facilitates coordination and increases the likelihood of preventing terrorism and crime, catching and punishing offenders. However, these measures also ease or remove safeguards. The debate over the sunset provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act revolves around the balance between government authority and individual privacy. Some sections curtail governmental authority while others bolster safeguards against abuse. The expiration date of the Act was extended to allow for further consideration. The expiration date of the USA PATRIOT Act has been extended twice, first until February 3, 2006, and more recently until March 10, 2006. The sections of the act that expire on March 10, 2006, will cease to exist along with any subsequent amendments. Pre-existing provisions of law will be revived unless repealed or amended by intervening legislation. Subsection 224(b) provides standards for foreign intelligence investigations. The USA PATRIOT Act's expiration date has been extended twice, with provisions expiring on March 10, 2006. Subsection 224(b) sets standards for foreign intelligence investigations, including those initiated before sunset. Questions arise regarding the definition of a \"potential offense\" in post-sunset investigations. Congress is presumed to use ordinary words with their commonly understood meanings. The term \"potential offense\" in post-sunset investigations refers to incomplete, unfulfilled, or undeveloped possibilities. Congress added this term in subsection 224(b) to apply to offenses that began or occurred before sunset, not after. This term was included as a precaution to avoid extending the exception to investigations of conduct with known criminality beforehand. The expiring law enforcement sections of Title II of the USA PATRIOT Act involve wiretapping, stored electronic communications, and pen registers. Federal law prohibits interception of communications, with exceptions for judicially supervised law enforcement interceptions. Authorities can apply for court orders for wiretapping in serious federal crime investigations. The expiring law enforcement sections of Title II of the USA PATRIOT Act involve wiretapping, stored electronic communications, and pen registers for serious federal crime investigations. Court orders are required for wiretapping based on probable cause, with notification to those intercepted when orders expire. Access to stored communications and provider records also requires legal authorization. Pen registers and trap and trace devices capture communication details with less stringent court order requirements. The curr_chunk discusses the authorization of wiretapping for law enforcement purposes in connection with specific federal crimes, including computer fraud, crimes of violence against Americans overseas, weapons of mass destruction, and terrorism. The Administration's request for legislation following the attacks added additional crimes to the predicate offense list. The Administration's request for legislation after September 11, 2001 did not include sections 201 and 202, which were later added to S. 1510. These sections allow law enforcement to seek wiretap orders for specific federal crimes, including terrorism. Sections 201 and 202 expire on March 10, 2006. Law enforcement officials can seek a wiretap order for offenses added to the predicate offense list by sections 201 or 202 before March 10, 2006. Section 201 adds criminal violations related to chemical weapons and terrorism to the wiretap predicate offense list. P.L. 107-197 amends Section 2516(1)(q) in relation to the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings. The amendments made by P.L. 107-197 to Section 2516(1)(q) in relation to the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings may expire with the rest of the section, but there is a possibility that Congress intended to permanently add new crimes, such as bombing public buildings and financing terrorism, to the wiretap predicate offense list. The House Judiciary Committee report acknowledges the addition of these new crimes. The House Judiciary Committee report notes the addition of new crimes to various lists, including the wiretap predicate list and Federal crimes of terrorism list. Congress did not intend to insert the new crimes temporarily on the wiretap list but permanently on other lists to implement treaty obligations related to terrorism offenses. The treaty deals with terrorism offenses, and the crimes added are similar to those already on the list. Congress intended to permanently add new crimes to implement treaty obligations related to terrorism offenses. The Justice Department mentioned recent wiretap orders based on the expanded list of terrorism offenses, including cases involving suspected domestic terrorists and individuals with ties to Colombian terrorists. The U.S. Department of Justice used authority under sections 201 and 202 of the USA PATRIOT Act in cases involving a Ku Klux Klan member buying grenades for bombing clinics and a computer fraud investigation linked to drug trafficking. Critics question the necessity of these sections, as federal law already provides sufficient wiretap authority for such cases. The Department of Justice utilized wiretap authority under the USA PATRIOT Act in cases involving drug offenses and terrorism. Critics argue that existing wiretap predicates and FISA may be more appropriate for cases involving suspected ties to terrorists. Statistics show that the authority under sections 201 and 202 is rarely used and may not be necessary for terrorism offenses. Court-authorized interceptions are granted for various categories, with low numbers for offenses like narcotics, racketeering, and bribery. Critics question the effectiveness of wiretapping in catching terrorists and criminals, highlighting instances where it led to dead ends or innocent individuals being monitored. The use of wiretapping authority in cases involving terrorism offenses and felony computer fraud is permitted under sections 201 and 202. The extent of the \"potential offense\" sunset exception is unclear. Section 201 authority has been used in cases involving bomb threats and suspected links to Colombian terrorists. Section 202 authority was used in a drug trafficking case. Evidence obtained through court-ordered wiretaps can be disclosed under limited circumstances. Prior to the act, there was no explicit authorization for disclosure to intelligence officials. Subsection 203(b) amends federal wiretap law to permit law enforcement officials to disclose wiretap evidence to various federal officials when it involves foreign intelligence, counterintelligence, or foreign intelligence information. Subsection 203(d) authorizes law enforcement officers to share foreign intelligence, counterintelligence, and foreign intelligence information with the same set of federal officials notwithstanding any other legal restriction. The curr_chunk discusses information related to the United States' ability to protect against attacks or hostile acts by foreign powers, sabotage, terrorism, and intelligence activities. It also defines \"foreign intelligence\" as information about foreign governments, organizations, or individuals, and \"counterintelligence\" as gathered information. The curr_chunk discusses the expansion of wiretap information sharing with law enforcement officers under federal law. It proposes including all federal officers and employees as \"law enforcement officers\" to assist in criminal investigations. This aims to enhance the protection against espionage, sabotage, and international terrorist activities. The curr_chunk proposes modifying wiretap statutes to allow disclosure of Title III-generated information to non-law enforcement officers for intelligence investigations, aligning with FISA standards. This change is justified by the stringent requirements for Title III surveillance orders and similar privacy protections under existing laws. The curr_chunk discusses the proposal to share foreign intelligence information with various federal personnel, including law enforcement, intelligence, and military, despite limitations on sharing grand jury and wiretap information. The House Judiciary Committee modified the proposal to include specific personnel for the purpose of sharing foreign intelligence information. The House Judiciary Committee modified the proposal to include specific personnel for sharing foreign intelligence information, splitting off grand jury components and permitting sharing only with court approval. The Senate merged Administration sections into a single four-part section, addressing sharing of grand jury information, wiretap produced foreign intelligence information, and a general grant of authority for disclosure to federal entities. Subsection 203(d) of the act allows for the disclosure of foreign intelligence information to federal officials during a criminal investigation, clearing legal barriers. The authority for disclosure under this subsection sunsets on March 10, 2006, unless exceptions are claimed. The authority for disclosure of foreign intelligence information to federal officials during a criminal investigation under subsection 203(d) of the act expires on March 10, 2006, unless exceptions are claimed. The extended authority may only apply to disclosures related to criminal or foreign intelligence investigations. The Homeland Security Act allows for the disclosure of wiretap information to a wide range of officials, particularly in serious foreign intelligence situations. The act's treatment of general law enforcement disclosure to intelligence authorities is slightly different. The Homeland Security Act allows for the disclosure of wiretap information to various officials, including in serious foreign intelligence situations. Section 203(d) embeds an amendment similar to the wiretap context of subsection 203(b), suggesting it terminates with the rest of subsection 203(d). This has enabled criminal law enforcement and foreign intelligence investigators to share information effectively, especially in terrorism cases. Federal intelligence officials were advised on the funneling of money to Iraq and support for a foreign terrorist organization. Allowing section 203(b) of the USA PATRIOT Act to expire would hinder information sharing with foreign officials, potentially limiting collaboration with agencies like MI-5 and the CIA. The concern is that without this provision, law enforcement may bypass legal safeguards by relying on foreign intelligence powers. The expiration of section 203(b) of the USA PATRIOT Act could lead to law enforcement bypassing legal safeguards by using foreign intelligence powers. This may result in the misuse of criminal law enforcement authority for intelligence purposes. Concerns also arise regarding the impact on information sharing with foreign agencies like MI-5 and the CIA. The Justice Department has objected to language allowing disclosure of wiretap foreign intelligence information to intelligence officials, citing it as unnecessary in serious cases. Instances of sharing information with foreign intelligence officials under section 203(d) include details about a violent jihad training camp and a plot to bomb soft targets abroad, as well as travel and money channels for a criminal conspiracy in Portland. Members of a criminal conspiracy in Portland traveled from the United States to fight alongside the Taliban. Information was obtained about the terrorist group's logistical support network and details regarding the application forms for attending a terrorist training camp overseas. Additionally, information was gathered about the practices, logistical support, and targeting information of an Al-Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan. The purpose of section 203(d) in sharing wiretap-generated foreign intelligence information is not entirely clear, but it may supplement other provisions for sharing information with federal law enforcement, intelligence, protective, immigration, and military personnel. Section 204 allows for sharing information on domestic and international terrorism with various officials. Subsection (d) permits disclosure of foreign intelligence information in federal criminal investigations. It is unclear if any legal impediments exist. Section 204 of the USA PATRIOT Act clarifies that foreign intelligence gathering activities are not restricted by criminal procedural statutes, allowing for the collection of foreign intelligence information. This provision allows for sharing terrorism information and ends on March 10, 2006. The USA PATRIOT Act section 204 allows for the collection of foreign intelligence information, with authority ending on March 10, 2006. The general trap and trace device and pen register prohibitions do not prevent the use of FISA authority for gathering foreign intelligence information. Section 209 of the USA PATRIOT Act allows for the seizure of voice mail messages with a search warrant, treating voice mail like e-mail. This amendment removes the need for a wiretap order to obtain unopened voice mail messages held by a service provider. The USA PATRIOT Act amends 18 U.S.C. \u00a72703 to allow the government to use a search warrant to compel the production of unopened voice mail messages. This harmonizes the rules for stored voice and non-voice communications. The authority under section 209 ends on March 10, 2006, except for investigations relating to offenses begun before then. The Justice Department cites the ease and speed of obtaining a warrant as a key benefit of section 209. The USA PATRIOT Act, specifically Section 209, allows investigators to quickly access suspects' voice-mail using a search warrant instead of a burdensome wiretap order. This change has been crucial in obtaining key evidence in criminal cases, such as messages related to a large-scale ecstasy smuggling ring. Stored voice-mail is often deleted by service providers, making the speed of seizure and search critical to investigations. The USA PATRIOT Act's Section 209 allows investigators to access suspects' voice-mail quickly with a search warrant, providing crucial evidence in criminal cases. Critics argue for consistency in protecting ongoing conversations under Title III, regardless of the communication method. Critics raise concerns about the general and skeletal information on the new authority to access voice mail under the USA PATRIOT Act's Section 209. They question if the enhancement of government authority will lead to a loss of personal privacy. The use of a search warrant to seize unopened voice mail is seen as a faster and less burdensome alternative to previous wiretap orders. Critics question the utility of expanding wiretap orders to cover unopened e-mail and the limited scope of Title III orders. Prior law restricted service providers from disclosing customer records without a warrant, court order, or customer consent. Section 212 allowed providers to disclose information in emergency situations. The content provision allowing providers to disclose information in emergency situations has been repealed and replaced, while the records provision remains. The Homeland Security Act repealed the provision governing content disclosure in emergencies and recast it as a separate provision. The authority to disclose customer records in emergency situations was not addressed in the Act. The authority to disclose customer records in emergency situations disappears on March 10, 2006, but the freestanding emergency content disclosure provision remains in effect. Third parties like telecommunications companies can assist law enforcement by providing information in emergencies, which was not expressly allowed by previous federal law. Section 212 of the USA PATRIOT Act allows telecommunications companies to disclose customer records in emergencies involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury. This provision has been utilized in cases such as bomb threats against schools, where it proved to be useful in assisting law enforcement. Section 212 of the USA PATRIOT Act has been instrumental in quickly resolving emergencies, such as bomb threats and cyber-terrorist threats. It has helped in identifying individuals responsible for threats, apprehending suspects, and rescuing abducted or missing children. The provision allows for the voluntary release of information in emergencies, leading to timely actions to prevent harm. Section 212 of the USA PATRIOT Act has been crucial in swiftly rescuing a 13-year-old girl from Western Pennsylvania who was being held captive by a 38-year-old man she met online. The provision allows service providers to disclose customer communications record information and stored customer communications in emergency situations. The USA PATRIOT Act's record disclosure authority has been useful in life-threatening situations, but there have been no reported instances of its use for protecting critical infrastructure. Federal wiretap law prohibits interception of communications without consent or a warrant. Section 217 allows providers to consent to law enforcement interception of communications from electronic trespassers within their systems. Section 217 of the USA PATRIOT Act allows providers to consent to law enforcement interception of communications from electronic trespassers within their systems. It excludes those with contractual access to the system from being considered \"computer trespassers\" and limits interceptions to communications within the invaded computer system. The exceptions in Section 217 originated from different versions passed by the Senate and the House. The Administration proposed amendments to the wiretap statute to allow victims of computer attacks to authorize monitoring of trespassers on their systems in certain cases to protect national security. The authority under section 217 of the USA PATRIOT Act expires on March 10, 2006. The USA PATRIOT Act's section 217, set to expire on March 10, 2006, has not been amended since its passage. The exception allows for ongoing intelligence investigations or investigations of earlier crimes, but is limited in application. The House Judiciary Committee recommended expanding the good faith defense for computer system operators utilizing section 217. The USA PATRIOT Act's section 217, initially recommended for expansion by the House Judiciary Committee, allows victims of cyber-attacks to seek law enforcement assistance in monitoring trespassers on their computer systems. This provision, added as a permanent amendment to 18 U.S.C. 2520(d)(3) by the Homeland Security Act, empowers internet service providers to combat hackers by enlisting the help of law enforcement. The USA PATRIOT Act's section 217 allows hacking victims to seek law-enforcement assistance to combat hackers, similar to how burglary victims can invite police officers into their homes to catch burglars. This provision, made technology-neutral by the Homeland Security Act, empowers victims to expel cyber-intruders from their systems with the help of law enforcement. Section 217 of the USA PATRIOT Act allows hacking victims to seek law-enforcement assistance to combat hackers without involving law enforcement if they detect trespassers on their systems. This provision preserves the privacy of law-abiding computer users and has been crucial in terrorist investigations, national-security cases, and serious crime investigations. It is particularly helpful in cases of massive denial of service attacks. The definition of computer trespasser does not include individuals with a contractual relationship with the service provider. Section 217 of the USA PATRIOT Act allows hacking victims to seek law-enforcement assistance to combat hackers without involving law enforcement if they detect trespassers on their systems. However, critics are concerned that this provision might be used to circumvent safeguards and oversight that attend Title III wiretaps. The Department has indicated that the authority under this section has been used comparatively rarely, with an example given in an identity theft investigation. Section 217 of the USA PATRIOT Act allows federal authorities to intercept an intruder's communications within an invaded computer system with consent of the system operator and a law enforcement investigation. The authority has been used \"comparatively rarely\" and focuses on eavesdropping on intruders' communications rather than preventing or punishing trespassers. Section 220 of the USA PATRIOT Act addresses the inconvenience federal authorities faced when conducting criminal investigations in one district while the communications provider was located in another. It authorizes courts in the district where the crime occurred to issue search warrants or orders to be served anywhere in the country for access to electronic communications content and customer record information. Section 220 of the USA PATRIOT Act allows courts in the district where a crime occurred to issue search warrants for access to electronic communications content and customer records, addressing the inconvenience of investigations spanning multiple districts. The amendment passed through the legislative process without changes, aiming to streamline the process for obtaining unopened email content from providers. The USA PATRIOT Act allows courts in the Northern District of California to compel evidence directly for investigations involving electronic communications information related to terrorism or cyber-incidents. This authority terminates on March 10, 2006, except for earlier crimes or potential crimes. Section 219 of the USA PATRIOT Act allows for nation-wide and possibly world-wide service of federal search and arrest warrants in cases of international or domestic terrorism. It is not subject to expiration like section 220, which has been beneficial in criminal cases, including terrorism-related charges. Section 220 allows courts to order the release of stored communications through a search warrant valid in another specified judicial district, aiding in terrorism investigations such as the Virginia Jihad and \"shoebomber\" cases. Congress significantly improved the Justice Department's ability to conduct large-scale child pornography investigations by including section 220 in the USA PATRIOT Act. This provision allows for obtaining search warrants in the jurisdiction of a child pornography investigation rather than the Internet service provider's jurisdiction, reducing administrative burdens in judicial districts with large ISPs. The Attorney General emphasizes the importance of renewing section 220 to prevent delays in investigations. \"It is crucial to renew section 220 of the USA PATRIOT Act to avoid delays in time-sensitive investigations. Critics argue that the provision makes it costly and inconvenient for service providers to contest orders from district courts. Some believe that the Justice Department could engage in forum shopping with this section. However, expiration may not significantly impact terrorism cases due to the existence of section 219.\" Section 220 of the USA PATRIOT Act allows for nation-wide execution of search warrants and court orders for customer communications records, making it more difficult for large communications service providers to contest burdensome disclosure orders. The Justice Department asserts that this authority has proven useful in serious terrorism and other criminal cases. The USA PATRIOT Act permits nation-wide service of search warrants in terrorism cases. Federal law imposes criminal and civil liability for illegal wiretapping, unlawful access to communications, and misuse of surveillance devices. The federal wiretap statute prohibits the use or disclosure of unlawfully intercepted communications, with exceptions under court orders. Section 223 of the USA PATRIOT Act confirms agency heads' authority to discipline federal officers for violations of wiretap and stored communications laws. It also imposes civil liability for unauthorized use or disclosure of information. Additionally, it creates a cause of action against the United States for victims of willful violations of federal wiretap laws, stored communications proscriptions, or FISA requirements related to surveillance. The USA PATRIOT Act Section 223 confirms agency heads' authority to discipline federal officers for violations of wiretap and stored communications laws, imposes civil liability for unauthorized information disclosure, and creates a cause of action for victims of willful violations of surveillance laws. The amendment in H.R. 2975 allows individuals to sue if surveilled information is inappropriately leaked. The USA PATRIOT Act Section 223 allows agency heads to discipline federal officers for violations of wiretap and stored communications laws, imposes civil liability for unauthorized information disclosure, and creates a cause of action for victims of willful violations of surveillance laws. The amendment in H.R. 2975 enables individuals to sue if surveilled information is inappropriately leaked. The application of the sunset provision to the cause of action in Section 223 is uncertain, with potential implications for pending and future suits. The USA PATRIOT Act Section 223 allows agency heads to discipline federal officers for violations of wiretap and stored communications laws, imposes civil liability for unauthorized information disclosure, and creates a cause of action for victims of willful violations of surveillance laws. Longstanding Supreme Court precedent holds that the demise of a cause of action may affect subject matter jurisdiction. Section 223 may continue to apply to investigations initiated before March 10, 2006, or offenses occurring before that date, regardless of when the conduct giving rise to the cause of action occurred. Subsection 224(b) may only apply to investigations not covered by this exception. The USA PATRIOT Act Section 223 allows agency heads to discipline federal officers for violations of wiretap and stored communications laws, imposes civil liability for unauthorized information disclosure, and creates a cause of action for victims of willful violations of surveillance laws. The exceptions in subsection 224(b) may extend investigative powers and avoid cutting off investigations pending as of March 10, 2006. The Justice Department reports no disciplinary proceedings or civil actions initiated under section 223 for unauthorized disclosure of intercepts. Critics argue that disciplinary action could deter information sharing, while the Attorney General urges Congress to make this section permanent. Section 223 of the USA PATRIOT Act creates a cause of action against the United States for official violations of surveillance laws and amends civil liability provisions. The Attorney General has urged Congress to make this section permanent, but there have been no disciplinary proceedings or civil actions initiated under it. This section may serve as a disincentive to information sharing. In the post-9/11 universe, there are similarities and differences between the statutory procedures governing wiretap and investigative tools in criminal law enforcement (Title III) and foreign intelligence (FISA). While there is rough comparability in certain authorities, such as physical search and trap and trace orders, significant differences exist in the focus and requirements of each. FISA focuses on foreign powers and agents, authorizing assistance for multi-point wiretaps. Section 206 allows general commands for assistance in surveillance. The provision in question expands obligations for third parties to assist the government under FISA when the target of surveillance tries to evade identification by rapidly changing accommodations, phones, or internet accounts. This would allow common carriers, landlords, and others to provide assistance in such cases. The proposed amendment aims to enhance the FBI's ability to monitor international terrorists and intelligence officers who evade surveillance by quickly changing accommodations, phones, or internet accounts. It would allow common carriers, landlords, and others to assist in electronic surveillance without the need for a new court order for each new entity involved. The FBI proposed an amendment to streamline FISA coverage by allowing generic orders to be presented to carriers, landlords, and others for surveillance. The amendment passed through legislation unchanged and remains in effect for foreign intelligence investigations initiated before March 10, 2006. There have been no amendments to this section since its enactment. The USA PATRIOT Act, specifically section 206, allows officers in international terrorism investigations to obtain court orders that apply to suspects rather than specific phones or phone companies. This new authority helps investigators avoid cat-and-mouse games with terrorists who try to evade surveillance. The USA PATRIOT Act section 206 allows investigators to use multiple-point wiretaps to thwart surveillance in terrorism cases. This authority helps in situations where suspects change phone numbers to evade monitoring, allowing for immediate surveillance on new numbers. Section 206 of the USA PATRIOT Act allows roving FISA surveillance orders, permitting immediate monitoring of new phone numbers in terrorism cases. Critics argue that this provision is too broad and may raise constitutional concerns. The amendment also allows roving surveillance by requiring a FISA order to identify the location and facilities subject to surveillance only if known. Section 207 of the USA PATRIOT Act amends the time lines for FISA wiretap and physical search orders. Wiretap orders targeting agents of foreign powers can now last up to 120 days and be extended annually, while physical search orders can be authorized for 90 days or up to 120 days if targeting a foreign power. The USA PATRIOT Act amended FISA to allow wiretap orders targeting foreign agents to last up to 120 days, with annual extensions. The proposed change in the Administration's statement aims to enable the FISC to authorize search and surveillance of foreign powers and international terrorist groups in the U.S. for up to a year, aligning with the authorization period for searches of foreign establishments. The USA PATRIOT Act amended FISA to allow wiretap orders targeting foreign agents to last up to 120 days, with annual extensions. The proposed change in the Administration's statement aims to enable the FISC to authorize search and surveillance of foreign powers and international terrorist groups in the U.S. for up to a year, aligning with the authorization period for searches of foreign establishments. The Senate scaled back the Administration's request to extend the duration of orders and extensions relating to foreign agents from one year to 120 days, but with extensions for up to one year in the case of agents who are foreign nationals. The provisions of section 207 have not been amended and would appear to remain available for use with respect to any foreign intelligence investigation predating March 10, 2006, but otherwise to expire on that date. The USA PATRIOT Act amended FISA to allow longer surveillance periods for certain agents of foreign powers, including U.S. persons, up to 90 days. This change aimed to improve administrative efficiency and effectiveness in conducting physical searches and electronic surveillance. The USA PATRIOT Act amended FISA to allow longer surveillance periods for certain agents of foreign powers, including U.S. persons, up to 90 days. The FISC has authorized 90-day and year-long surveillance of foreign powers and their agents pursuant to section 207 of the USA PATRIOT Act, helping focus efforts on significant terrorism-related cases. Section 207 of the USA PATRIOT Act amended FISA to extend the duration of wiretap orders for agents of foreign powers to 120 days, with possible yearly extensions. Physical search orders for foreign power agents can now last up to 120 days with extensions for up to one year, focusing on the regularity of judicial supervision. Section 207 of the USA PATRIOT Act extends the duration of FISA surveillance and physical search orders, aiming to save time and resources. Critics argue for more judicial supervision given the FISA court's criticism of presentation accuracy. Section 214 makes adjustments to FISA pen register/trap and trace device procedures. Section 214 of the USA PATRIOT Act makes adjustments to the FISA pen register/trap and trace device procedures, allowing for monitoring of both wire and electronic communications for foreign intelligence or international terrorism investigations. The USA PATRIOT Act amends FISA pen register/trap and trace device procedures to allow monitoring of wire and electronic communications for foreign intelligence or international terrorism investigations. It removes the requirement that communications be related to international terrorists or spies and adds limitations on investigating U.S. persons based solely on activities protected by the first amendment. It also seeks to align FISA pen register/trap and trace procedures with criminal pen/trap authority. The FISA pen/trap authority under the USA PATRIOT Act requires a factual showing of contact with an \"agent of a foreign power\" engaged in terrorism or intelligence activities, making it difficult to obtain. The amendment eliminates this requirement, aligning FISA authority more closely with criminal authority. The USA PATRIOT Act amended the FISA pen/trap authority to align more closely with criminal authority, removing the requirement of contact with an \"agent of a foreign power\" engaged in terrorism or intelligence activities. The streamlined authority has been used in investigations of suspected al Qaeda agents in the country. The USA PATRIOT Act amended FISA pen/trap authority to align with criminal standards, allowing for use in international terrorism investigations without the need for contact with an \"agent of a foreign power.\" Section 214 now permits pen/trap orders for obtaining foreign intelligence information or relevant to investigations against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities. The government has utilized this authority in several international terrorism investigations, including those involving suspected al Qaeda operatives. The streamlined pen/trap authority under the USA PATRIOT Act has facilitated terrorism investigations, including those involving suspected al Qaeda operatives in the United States. Critics argue that streamlining the FISA pen register/trap and trace device procedure lacks judicial supervision and notification requirements for targets after the order expires. Unlike criminal orders, FISA orders do not require a subsequent report to the court or judicial re-examination every 90 days. The expanded authority under the USA PATRIOT Act allows monitoring of Internet use in addition to telephone conversations. Critics are concerned about the constitutional implications of this change, as it applies to electronic communications as well. The FISA pen register/trap & trace order procedures have been updated to include electronic communications, similar to the enlargement for law enforcement under section 216. The expanded authority under the USA PATRIOT Act allows monitoring of Internet use in addition to telephone conversations. Critics argue that the FISA expansion lacks safeguards and that existing law enforcement authority should be sufficient in terrorism cases. FISA originally authorized FBI access to business records in terrorism investigations or gathering foreign intelligence. Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act expands the authority to obtain any tangible item for foreign intelligence or terrorism investigations, not limited to business records. This authority was originally requested to replace a more restrictive FISA procedure, making it more accessible for investigative purposes. The USA PATRIOT Act's Section 215 allows for the acquisition of various items for foreign intelligence or terrorism investigations, including business records. However, the process of obtaining such records is often time-consuming and challenging, leading to limited use of this authority. A proposed amendment would replace this provision with a more general administrative subpoena authority, similar to that used by drug investigators, allowing the Attorney General to compel the production of relevant records. This change aims to balance the need for investigative powers with judicial oversight. Section 215 is set to expire in 2006, except for ongoing foreign intelligence operations. Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act allows for the acquisition of business records for foreign intelligence or terrorism investigations. It is set to expire on March 10, 2006, but certain provisions in other laws allow the FBI to access business records for investigations related to international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities. The impact of expiration may be mitigated by changes in the law governing \"national security letters.\" Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act allows the FBI access to business records for terrorism investigations, including records from banks, credit card companies, car dealers, and more. Critics, including librarians, argue against this provision, but the Justice Department defends it as a necessary tool for national security. Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act authorizes the FBI to obtain business records for national security investigations. It includes safeguards to protect civil liberties, requires court orders for FBI agents, and has a narrow scope that excludes ordinary crimes or domestic terrorism. Section 215 also upholds First Amendment rights and allows for congressional oversight. Despite myths surrounding its use, only 35 orders have been issued under Section 215 authority, none of which involved library, bookstore, medical, or gun sale records. Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act allows the FBI to access business records for national security purposes, with safeguards in place to protect civil liberties. Critics question its expansion beyond foreign power agents and its secrecy provisions, raising concerns about its constitutionality. The section provides access to tangible items under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, authorizing FISA court orders in cases of foreign intelligence, international terrorism, and clandestine intelligence. Other legislation has expanded the definition of financial institutions for national security letter purposes. P.L. 108-177, 117 Stat. 2628 (2003)(12 U.S.C. 3414) allows grand juries to subpoena material with fewer restrictions than FISA orders. It is used in serious national security cases and has been used 35 times as of March 30, 2005. However, it eliminates safeguards and can lead to abuse through its use of a secret court and gag orders. Section 218 of FISA was created to promote cooperation between criminal and foreign intelligence investigators by removing the \"wall\" that separated them. It allows for FISA wiretap or physical search order applications even if foreign intelligence information is just a \"significant\" reason for the application. The FISA review court concluded that the standard for FISA applications permits collection of intelligence information as a reason for the application, passing constitutional muster. The Supreme Court has held that national security powers do not excuse non-compliance with Fourth Amendment warrant requirements in investigations of domestic terrorists. The Court did not address issues related to activities of foreign powers or their agents, nor did it require standards similar to Title III to be duplicated in such cases. Following the Keith case, lower federal courts upheld the President's power to conduct warrantless electronic surveillance for gathering foreign intelligence. After the enactment of FISA, courts used the \"primary purpose\" language to address challenges from criminal defendants who argued that FISA was used to bypass Title III requirements in criminal investigations. Title III requirements in a criminal investigation were changed post-9/11 to allow for FISA requests where foreign intelligence gathering is 'a' purpose, instead of the sole or primary purpose. This adjustment aimed to streamline the process and enhance information sharing between law enforcement and foreign intelligence authorities for anti-terrorism efforts. Both House and Senate bills included the language \"a significant purpose\" in the final legislation. The House Judiciary Committee characterized the change as \"a compromise between current law and what the Administration has proposed,\" and the FISA review court concluded that the change \"imposed a requirement that the government have a measurable foreign intelligence purpose, other than just criminal prosecution of even foreign intelligence crimes.\" Section 218 sunsets on March 10, 2006 except with respect to foreign intelligence investigations initiated before that date. Section 504 of the USA PATRIOT Act adds language to the FISA wiretap and physical search schemes, emphasizing continued cooperation and stating that cooperation does not hinder certification in a FISA application for intelligence-gathering purposes. The expiration of section 218 may not require reconstruction of the separation wall, but applications for FISA orders would need to certify that foreign intelligence gathering is the primary purpose. The Justice Department strongly defends section 218 as a fundamental change accomplished by the expiring sections of the act. The USA PATRIOT Act allows government agencies to share intelligence to better understand and prevent terrorist attacks. It removed barriers between law enforcement and intelligence agencies, enhancing information sharing to combat terrorism effectively. The USA PATRIOT Act has improved information sharing for terrorism investigations, leading to disruptions of plots and arrests. An example is the case of the \"Lackawanna Six\" who trained at an al Qaeda camp in Afghanistan. The FBI initiated investigations based on a tip received in 2001. The USA PATRIOT Act removed the \"wall\" between separate investigations for drug crimes and terrorist threats, allowing for the sharing of case-sensitive information. This led to the discovery that an individual mentioned in an anonymous letter was an agent of al Qaeda, expediting the investigation. Intelligence and law enforcement personnel expedited the investigation of the Lackawanna Six, resulting in charges being filed against them for providing support to al Qaeda. Five pleaded guilty to material support, while the sixth pleaded guilty to unlawful transactions. They were sentenced to prison terms ranging from seven to ten years. Before the USA PATRIOT Act, FISA applications required certification that surveillance was for foreign intelligence purposes. The prevailing interpretation of the primary purpose standard limited coordination between intelligence and law enforcement personnel. Patrick Fitzgerald testified about the \"wall\" between the two groups in practice during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. The criminal investigation of Usama Bin Laden in 1996 involved prosecutors and FBI agents accessing various sources, including citizens, police officers, government agencies, and even al Qaeda members. However, they were not allowed to communicate with FBI agents conducting a parallel intelligence investigation due to the \"wall\" between intelligence and law enforcement. The USA PATRIOT Act eliminated the \"wall\" separating intelligence officers from law enforcement agents, leading to increased coordination and information sharing. This change enabled the Department to open criminal investigations, disrupt terrorist plots, and convict individuals in terrorism cases. The removal of the \"wall\" played a critical role in dismantling a Portland, Oregon terror cell. The Department successfully dismantled a Portland, Oregon terror cell known as the \"Portland Seven\" who attempted to join Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan. One member, Battle, considered attacking Jewish schools. Investigators suspected others but lacked evidence to arrest them before the USA PATRIOT Act. The FBI agents could conduct FISA surveillance of Battle to detect any orders from an international terrorist group regarding a potential domestic attack on Jewish targets. This allowed prosecutors to gather evidence on other cell members without arresting Battle prematurely. Ultimately, seven defendants were charged and convicted, receiving prison sentences ranging from three years. The FBI used FISA surveillance to gather evidence on a terrorist cell, leading to the conviction of seven defendants with prison sentences ranging from three to eighteen years. The USA PATRIOT Act enabled prosecutors to consider all evidence against the defendants, including intelligence obtained through FISA. Prosecutors utilized intelligence and law enforcement information, including sections 218 and 504, to build a strong case in the \"Virginia Jihad\" case. This information sharing helped in investigating individuals charged with supporting terrorist organizations like al Qaeda and HAMAS. Sections 218 and 504 also aided in gaining intelligence for the indictment of Enaam Arnaout, who later pleaded guilty to racketeering charges. Enaam Arnaout pleaded guilty to diverting funds from the Benevolence International Foundation to support Islamic military groups in Bosnia and Chechnya, resulting in over 11 years in prison. Sections 218 and 504 facilitated the prosecution of individuals involved in an al Qaeda drugs-for-weapons plot in San Diego, leading to guilty pleas. The defendants planned to distribute drugs and acquire anti-aircraft missiles to sell to the Taliban. These sections were crucial in convicting Khaled Abdel Latif Dumeisi. The successful prosecution of Khaled Abdel Latif Dumeisi, convicted of acting as an agent of the former government of Iraq, was aided by intelligence officers sharing information with law enforcement. This collaboration led to the discovery of an incriminating phone conversation between Dumeisi and a co-conspirator, providing crucial evidence at his trial. The absence of barriers between law enforcement and intelligence agencies raised concerns about potential coordination misuse. The FISA appellate court found no Fourth Amendment issues with section 218, stating that the procedures and government showings required under FISA are close to meeting Fourth Amendment standards. Critics have differing opinions on the court's Fourth Amendment analysis. The FISA appellate court found no Fourth Amendment issues with section 218, stating that procedures and government showings required under FISA are close to meeting Fourth Amendment standards. Section 218 allows surveillance or physical search applications to certify that foreign intelligence gathering is a \"significant\" purpose, not \"the\" purpose. The court suggests that the \"wall\" between FBI criminal and intelligence investigators is unnecessary, and law enforcement cooperation does not preclude purpose certification. In re Sealed Case (2002) indicates that the wall was not constitutionally or statutorily required even before the USA PATRIOT Act. The use of FISA has increased dramatically over the years, while Title III is seldom used in terrorism cases. The wall between law enforcement and intelligence officers prevented effective communication in terrorism cases, but its removal has been beneficial. Section 223, federal wiretap law, and FISA provide immunity for those assisting in interception orders. Section 225 grants immunity to anyone involved in the process. Section 225 of the FISA Act grants immunity to individuals who comply with FISA surveillance orders, specifically related to wiretaps. This immunity provision was added late in the legislative process and is not found in the Administration request or the Senate bill. Section 225 of the FISA Act provides immunity from civil liability for entities that comply with FISA wiretap orders. This immunity provision was added late in the legislative process and is set to expire on March 10, 2006. The immunity provision in Section 225 of the FISA Act encourages cooperation from communication providers and third parties in executing FISA orders, but it also removes the incentive for these parties to challenge or modify the orders. Justice Department officials emphasize the importance of provider assistance in timely order execution. Critics question the necessity of FISA wiretap orders when law enforcement wiretap orders with immunity for providers are available for espionage investigations. Section 225 of the FISA Act establishes immunity for assistance in executing FISA surveillance orders, encouraging cooperation and discouraging court challenges. The FISA Act, 108-458 , 118 Stat. 3742 (2004), amends the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" for FISA purposes to include foreign nationals involved in international terrorism. FISA targets agents of a foreign power for surveillance and physical search orders. Section 6001 exempts the need to show illicit activity is at the behest of a foreign power if the target is not a U.S. person. The Senate report explains the rationale for the section as it appeared in S. 113, which aims to permit surveillance of \"lone wolf\" foreign terrorists under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) without requiring affiliation with a foreign power. Similar legislative proposals were considered during the 107th Congress. S. 113 aims to allow surveillance of \"lone wolf\" foreign terrorists under FISA without the need for affiliation with a foreign power. This amendment continues to apply after March 10, 2006, for ongoing foreign intelligence investigations. Section 6001 of S. 113 amends the FISA definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" to include foreign nationals involved in international terrorism, potentially raising concerns about the fourth amendment's application in terrorism cases. Some members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have suggested that the rationale behind this amendment may need reinforcement for reauthorization. The Justice Department believes that the definition of an agent of a foreign power in the FISA section may raise constitutional questions. Subsection 224(a) lists sections and subsections of Title II that are not subject to sunset declaration, including the authority to share grand jury information involving foreign intelligence. The curr_chunk discusses various sections of laws related to grand jury matters, disclosures of information, employment of translators by the FBI, designation of judges in the FISA court, and scope of subpoenas for records of electronic communications. The curr_chunk discusses the expansion of authority for subpoenas directing communication service providers to disclose customer information, clarification of law enforcement access procedures for cable companies providing communications services, and authorization for delaying notice of warrant execution. The curr_chunk discusses modifications to authorities relating to the use of pen registers and trap and trace devices for electronic communications, allowing execution of orders anywhere in the United States. The curr_chunk discusses amendments to Rules of Criminal Procedure allowing magistrates in terrorism cases to issue search and arrest warrants outside their district. It also clarifies trade sanctions and reimbursement for assisting law enforcement with trap and trace devices."
