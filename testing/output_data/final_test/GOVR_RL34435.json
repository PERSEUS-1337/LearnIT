Recent natural disasters have added millions in costs for rebuilding facilities and equipment. The changing external environment and new competitive conditions in higher education have made it harder for HBCUs to develop and expand their research programs. Limited financial support hinders their ability to engage in cutting-edge scientific research and compete for federal research dollars. HBCUs have also experienced a decline in state support, despite being seen as partners in developing their state's economy. HBCUs have received limited support from private foundations and federal stimulus spending in recent years, leading to improved operational efficiencies. However, with the end of stimulus funding, many institutions are facing a loss of operating support. Executive orders since 1980 have aimed to strengthen HBCUs' participation in federally sponsored programs and improve their administrative infrastructure. The current executive order, signed by President Obama on February 26, 2010, aims to strengthen the capacity of HBCUs in federally sponsored programs. Each executive department and agency designated by the Secretary of Education must prepare an annual plan to increase HBCUs' participation in Federal programs and initiatives. This includes efforts to enhance HBCUs' competitiveness for grants and contracts, identify underserved programs, and promote public and private sector involvement. The NSF report from August 2008 shows that 33.0% of black science and engineering doctorate recipients in 2006 earned their bachelor degrees at HBCUs. Forecasts suggest that HBCUs need to expand efforts to attract and graduate students in science and engineering due to changing demographics. The Department of Education's September 2009 report projects a 26% increase in enrollment for black students between 2007 and 2018. The \"new majority\" groups, including Hispanic, Native American/Alaskan Natives, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and white students, are underrepresented in the sciences compared to their population fractions. The lack of minority scientists is seen as a national issue by Freeman A. Hrabowski, President of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) play a significant role in educating black Americans in science and engineering. The 1862 Morrill Act provided public lands for educational institutions, aiming to foster equal opportunities for all students, especially newly freed Blacks. However, the resulting land-grant higher education system failed to provide equal opportunities as black students were excluded from traditionally white institutions. Congress attempted to enforce racial equality through various legislation. The U.S. Supreme Court's interpretations of post-Civil War amendments defeated legislative efforts for racial equality in education. The 1882 decision declared the first Civil Rights Act unconstitutional, stating the 14th amendment only protected against direct discriminatory action by State governments. The Second Morrill Act of 1890 mandated States with dual education systems to establish land-grant institutions for both, resulting in 19 black land-grant institutions being established. The 1890 land-grant institutions faced funding disparities compared to the 1862 institutions, hindering their research efforts. Despite efforts to expand program offerings, they were never adequately funded by states and the Federal Government. The 1890 land-grant institutions faced funding disparities compared to the 1862 institutions, hindering their research efforts. They were not eligible for certain Federal Government programs until 1967, receiving research funds but not for constructing facilities. HBCUs are diverse, including public and private institutions, single-sex and coeducational, predominantly black and white, two-year and four-year institutions, research universities, liberal arts colleges, and professional schools. HBCUs, including public and private institutions, enroll approximately 11.6% of black students in higher education. They award around 33.0% of undergraduate degrees in science and engineering to black students. Xavier University, an HBCU, ranks first nationally in the number of blacks earning undergraduate degrees in biological and biomedical sciences. North Carolina A&T State University, an HBCU, leads in the number of black students earning undergraduate degrees in engineering. HBCUs contributed significantly to black students earning bachelor degrees in various fields, including physical sciences, computer sciences, mathematics, biological sciences, agricultural sciences, social sciences, and psychology. The National Science Foundation provides data on academic science and engineering support to colleges and universities in different categories. The distribution of federal R&D funds to colleges and universities is a major issue in the academic community. NSF found that the top 100 institutions received 80% of all academic R&D funding in FY2006, with minimal changes over 20 years. Elite institutions continue to receive the majority of funding, while less-prestigious research institutions struggle to compete. In FY2006, 71 HBCUs received a small fraction of federal R&D funding compared to all U.S. colleges and universities, despite an increase in funding over the past decade. In FY2006, HBCUs received $237.5 million for R&D, a decrease of $39.5 million from the previous year. Despite being 6.0% of all institutions conducting R&D, they only receive 1.0% of federal academic R&D support on average. Funding is concentrated at selected institutions, with the top 20 HBCUs accounting for 76.3% of total R&D support in FY2007. In FY2007, the top 20 HBCUs received 72.2% of funding for academic science and engineering support. There has been little change in the concentration of federal R&D support among these institutions since FY2000. Some institutions have seen increased support, leading to changes in their rankings. For example, Lincoln University ranked thirteenth in FY2007, up from twenty-ninth in FY2000. Delaware State University and Morehouse College also saw improvements in their rankings. In FY2007, HBCUs saw changes in rankings based on R&D support. Allen University ranked thirty-sixth, Xavier University ranked forty-sixth due to rebuilding after natural disasters. Facility construction is a significant investment for higher education institutions, impacting the quality of education. HBCUs face challenges with aging facilities and deferred maintenance. HBCUs established before 1900 face challenges with aging facilities and inadequate electrical systems for modern equipment. In the mid-1980s, hearings were held to address concerns about research space at minority-serving institutions. NSF was directed to collect data on academic research facilities issues. In a 1998 survey of 57 research-performing HBCUs, institutions reported insufficient science and engineering research space, with 88% indicating current space was inadequate. The majority of space was in biological sciences, agricultural sciences, and engineering. 48% of HBCUs reported their existing research space condition as inadequate. In a 1998 survey of 57 research-performing HBCUs, 48% indicated their existing research space was effective but needed limited repair/renovation. 15% required major renovation for science and engineering research. HBCUs reported $331.0 million in deferred construction and repair/renovation projects in 1998. Between 1988 and 1998, research space at 29 HBCUs increased significantly, with the most growth seen in engineering and agricultural sciences. During this period, construction projects were initiated by 11 HBCUs in 1996 and 1997, similar to the number in the 1988 survey. Only 4 HBCUs started construction projects between 1992-1995. In the 1998 survey, 29 HBCUs provided $64.3 million for new construction projects, with federal government being the largest funding source for science and engineering research. However, state and local governments became the primary funders in 1994-1997. Federal support increased but at a slower rate compared to other sources. The NSF provides funding for HBCUs through programs like HBCU-UP and CREST to enhance undergraduate programs and research capabilities. The estimated funding levels for FY2010 are $32.0 million for HBCU-UP and $30.5 million for CREST. In January 2008, NSF announced the ARTSI initiative to encourage black students to pursue degrees in robotics and computer science. The program would offer outreach programs at K-12 and college levels, support research activities at HBCUs, provide internships for minority students, and mentoring programs for undergraduates. Additionally, the Department of Agriculture administers a Capacity Building Grants Program to assist 1890 land-grant institutions and Tuskegee University in strengthening their research and teaching capabilities in food and agricultural sciences. In addition to the Capacity Building Grants Program, NIFA provides funding for research at the 1890 institutions through the Evans-Allen formula. NASA has a University Research Centers program to fund research projects in space science and applications. Each institution can receive up to $1.0 million per year for five years based on performance. The Curriculum Improvements Partnership Award for the Integration of Research will enhance teaching. The Curriculum Improvements Partnership Award for the Integration of Research (CIPAIR) will enhance teaching strategies across academic programs by providing $100,000 to $200,000 per year for three years. The NASA Science and Technology Institute for Minority Institutions (NSTI-MI) supports student internships and research clusters for underrepresented students. Funding for NSTI-MI in FY2010 is $2.4 million, supported by the National Defense Authorization Act, FY2010. The Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions Program (HBCU/MI) aims to enhance research capacity, develop inter-university research in defense technology, and increase personnel in critical scientific disciplines for national security. Approximately $66.6 million was allocated in FY2010. Sebetha Jenkins of Jarvis Christian College emphasized the importance of investing in HBCUs for the nation's future prosperity. A proposed program similar to EPSCoR would support minority-serving institutions by building capacity and partnerships with major research institutions. This initiative includes an HBCU centers program for education in scientific disciplines. Jenkins believes this program would enhance the R&D capacity of HBCUs. HBCUs have provided quality education for black students in scientific and technical disciplines, graduating a significant percentage of African-American students. Despite limited federal support, they have achieved success in education. Despite limited federal support, HBCUs face challenges in attracting and preparing a larger number of minority students in science and technology fields. This demographic shift may impact the development of the scientific workforce in the 21st century. Success in research programs at HBCUs is crucial for fostering scientific talent. The National Academies report emphasizes the importance of increasing participation of underrepresented minorities in science and engineering to ensure a high-quality supply of scientists and engineers in the US. Federal funding distribution for HBCUs is a critical issue facing these institutions. Many HBCUs are striving to enhance their research capacity in various areas like homeland security, cyberinfrastructure, and genomics. Improved funding for facilities and instrumentation is crucial for these colleges to contribute to the nation's economic vitality. Congress may explore options to bring HBCUs closer to other institutions in research partnerships. During the 110th Congress, the House passed H.R. 694, the Minority Serving Institution Digital and Wireless Technology Opportunity Act, which aims to provide funding for equipment, networking technology, and infrastructure to improve educational services at minority-serving institutions like HBCUs. Eligible institutions include HBCUs, Hispanic-, Alaskan Native-, or Native Hawaiian-serving institutions, and tribally controlled colleges and universities. The bill aims to provide funding for equipment, networking technology, and infrastructure to improve educational services at minority-serving institutions like HBCUs, Hispanic-, Alaskan Native-, or Native Hawaiian-serving institutions, and tribally controlled colleges and universities. Funding would support capacity-building technical assistance and the use of wireless networking technology to enhance research and education in scientific, engineering, mathematics, and technology instructions. Matching requirements would be required for grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts. Funding would be authorized for FY2008 and subsequent years. The Max Cleland Minority Serving Institution Digital and Wireless Technology Opportunity Act of 2007, S. 1650, aims to provide $250.0 million annually for FY2008 through FY2012 to strengthen minority institutions' ability in digital and wireless network technologies. The bill is designed to narrow the economic opportunity divide between students in minority serving institutions and other institutions by providing funding through grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements. Eligible institutions could receive up to $2.5 million annually. The Senate committee bill would establish an office in the Department of Commerce with cost sharing requirements for grant recipients. Cost sharing would be waived for institutions with no endowment or an endowment valued at less than $50.0 million. The Higher Education Opportunity Act established a program to provide federal support to Predominantly Black Institutions (PBIs) that qualify for funding. PBIs must have at least 40.0% black undergraduate enrollment and a total enrollment of at least 1,000 undergraduates. Grant proposals for PBIs could be in science areas. The Higher Education Opportunity Act established a program to provide federal support to Predominantly Black Institutions (PBIs) with at least 40.0% black undergraduate enrollment and a total enrollment of at least 1,000 undergraduates. Grant proposals for PBIs could be in science areas, technology, engineering, mathematics, teacher preparation, health education, and international issues. Title III, Part E of the HEOA provided funding for two new minority science and engineering improvement programs, including a partnership grant program to increase underrepresented minority youth participation in STEM education. Partnership grants would be awarded for five years with a minimum of $500,000, requiring non-federal matching funds. Another program aimed to encourage minorities to pursue careers in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology. The Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) provided funding for repair and renovation of academic research facilities, including Historically Black Graduate Institutions. Title III, Part B allocated formula grants to eligible institutions based on various factors, with a minimum of $250,000 per institution. Title III, Part D established a bonding authority of $1.1 billion for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) for facility repairs. The Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, 2010 allocated funding for HBCUs and minority serving institutions at $255.0 million annually from FY2010 to FY2019, totaling approximately $1.1 billion over 5 years and $2.1 billion over 10 years."
