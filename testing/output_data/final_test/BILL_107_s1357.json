    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. Congress finds that although Title IX does not explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, the Department of Education's 1997 policy guidance determined that sexual harassment against gay or lesbian students that hinders their participation in school programs is considered sexual harassment under Title IX. The 2001 \"Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance\" addresses gender-based harassment, including verbal, nonverbal, or physical aggression based on sex or sex-stereotyping, as a form of sex discrimination that schools must address. The 2001 \"Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance\" requires schools to address sex discrimination that limits a student's participation in the educational program. Evidence suggests that policies on sexual harassment against LGBTQ+ students may not be effectively implemented, as these students often face abuse from their peers. The 2000 study by the American Association of University Women found that many schools and universities lack procedures for handling title IX-based grievances. The 2001 Surgeon General's report highlighted the negative impact of antihomosexual attitudes on mental health, including increased depression among homosexual individuals. The 2001 Surgeon General's report highlighted the negative impact of antihomosexual attitudes on mental health, including depression and suicide rates, lower self-acceptance, and a greater likelihood of hiding sexual orientation. Studies show that 80% of gay men and lesbians have experienced harassment, 45% have been threatened with violence, and 17% have been physically attacked based on their orientation. The purpose of this Act is to examine how secondary schools are implementing policies to address sexual harassment against gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender students. The Act aims to study how educational institutions are implementing policy guidance on sexual harassment. The United States Commission on Civil Rights will conduct a nationwide study on sexual harassment of gay and lesbian students in secondary schools, based on policy guidance from the Office for Civil Rights. The United States Commission on Civil Rights will conduct a nationwide study on gender-based harassment affecting LGBTQ students in secondary schools, focusing on awareness and implementation of policy guidance. The term \"secondary school\" is defined in this section as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The Commission must report its findings and policy recommendations to Congress and the Secretary of Education within 18 months of the Act's enactment. The report and recommendations will be made public in an easily understandable manner, including through the Internet. Federal agencies are required to cooperate with the Commission. SEC. 4. COOPERATION OF FEDERAL AGENCIES.\n\nFederal departments and agencies must cooperate with the Commission for the study. They are required to provide data, reports, and documents as requested by the Commission.\n\nSEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\nFunds necessary for the Act's implementation in fiscal year 2002 are authorized to be appropriated and will remain available until expended."
