    "content": "The Act is titled the \"United States Seaport Multiyear Security Enhancement Act\" and includes findings related to seaport security. Congress finds that the Nation's seaports are a major terrorist target due to Al Qaeda's ties to the shipping industry. Protecting America's seaports is crucial for economic growth, as they handle 95% of overseas trade and support military mobilization. Maritime industries contribute $742 billion annually to the Gross National Product. The United States Coast Guard has issued final regulations requiring a significant investment in seaport security, costing $1.125 billion in the first year and $5.45 billion over 10 years. Congress should establish a multi-year seaport grant program to address the security and economic needs of the nation's seaports. The Act should recognize the security and economic needs of the nation and seaports. The Act emphasizes the importance of seaport security improvement projects. The Secretary of Homeland Security may grant funds to seaports for security enhancements. Seaports must submit applications for grants, and priority is given to projects that improve security or efficiency without compromising security. Matching requirements may apply. The Secretary of Homeland Security may grant funds to seaports for security enhancements, with matching requirements for eligible projects. Federal funds for projects should not exceed 75 percent of the total cost, with exceptions for small projects costing less than $25,000. The Secretary may approve grants with different matching requirements if deemed necessary. Letters of Intent are also required for project approval. The Secretary may issue a letter of intent to a seaport committing future budget authority for a security improvement project. The letter establishes a reimbursement schedule for the Government's share of project costs. Seaports must notify the Secretary after receiving a letter of intent. The Secretary can issue a letter of intent to a seaport for a security improvement project, notifying Congress before issuance. The letter is not a government obligation or financial commitment. The Secretary may impose reasonable administrative requirements for issuing a letter of intent under this Act. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Homeland Security. Notification to Congress is required when a grant is awarded under this section. $800,000,000 is authorized for appropriations annually to implement this section. The Secretary may impose administrative requirements for issuing a letter of intent under this Act. $800,000,000 is appropriated annually for fiscal years 2005 through 2009 to implement this section."
