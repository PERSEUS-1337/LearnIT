    "content": "The surge in interest in geologic carbon sequestration, also known as carbon capture and storage (CCS), is driven by the need to reduce CO2 emissions and address climate change. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 promotes research and development of CCS technology and addresses legal issues such as control of underground storage space, regulation of CO2 pipelines, and liability concerns. This report discusses legal hurdles associated with CCS technology, focusing on liability concerns. CCS involves capturing and sequestering CO2 emissions to address climate change. The process stores CO2 underground instead of releasing it into the atmosphere. CCS technology involves storing CO2 underground to address climate change. Legal issues include ownership of pore space, regulation of CO2 pipelines, and liability concerns that may hinder development. Understanding these issues is crucial for the implementation of CCS technology. The legal issues surrounding CCS technology include ownership and control of pore space for carbon dioxide storage. Existing property rights laws do not address this issue, so interpretation of legal instruments is necessary to determine relevant property rights. Property law disputes related to subsurface pore space have traditionally been handled at the state level. The ownership and control of subsurface pore space for CCS projects are typically handled under state law. State legislatures have established a \"majority rule\" that mineral rights holders do not automatically own or control pore space. However, on federally owned lands, pore space ownership becomes a federal issue. Private entities with mineral rights may also claim ownership or control over subsurface rights for CCS projects. The owner of mineral rights on land typically does not have control over subsurface pore space for CCS projects, according to state and federal laws. Legal precedent indicates that surface owners, not mineral rights holders, have the property interest in pore space for CCS purposes. This is also true for federal lands where mineral rights are leased. In the case of federal land with leased mineral rights, the federal government owns and controls the pore space for CCS projects. Legal precedent, like the Emeny v. United States case, supports this conclusion. The plaintiffs granted oil and gas leases covering 217,000 acres, including the area with significant helium deposits at Bush Dome. The United States obtained these leases and compensated parties, but plaintiffs reserved surface rights for underground gas storage. The United States extracted helium from Bush Dome for three decades until it was empty, then sought to store helium produced elsewhere. The United States extracted helium from the Bush Dome until it was empty. The plaintiffs argued that the government did not have the right to use the pore space for storage of helium produced elsewhere. The court agreed with the plaintiffs and ordered the United States to pay just compensation for using the Bush Dome as a helium storage facility. The United States extracted helium from the Bush Dome until it was empty. The court ruled that oil and gas leases may include the right to store gas produced elsewhere. In Tate v. United Fuel Gas Company, the West Virginia courts addressed pore space ownership after mineral extraction. In Tate v. United Fuel Gas Company, the Supreme Court of West Virginia ruled that the original owner/mineral rights holder only had the right to exploit gas and minerals within the pore space, not the right to use the pore space for gas storage. The owner of mineral rights may not have the right to use pore space for carbon dioxide capture and sequestration without permission from the surface estate owner, as per the \"majority rule.\" This was highlighted in the case of United States v. 43.42 Acres of Land, where compensation for land acquired for an underground crude oil storage tank was disputed between surface owners and mineral rights owners. The United States intended to construct an oil storage tank by extracting salt from a subterranean geological structure. Both defendants claimed exclusive compensation rights under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. The court considered common law authority and ruled that the landowner owns the opening left by mining operations after minerals are removed. The court ordered the United States to compensate both the landowner and mineral rights owner for the pore space used for crude oil storage. The case law favors attaching pore space ownership to the surface estate owner, but there is not unanimous agreement on this precedent. In Mapco v Carter and Central Kentucky Natural Gas Co. v. Smallwood, disputes arose over ownership and control of pore space in relation to mineral rights conveyance. Mapco extracted salt without consent, leading to a court order for compensation to co-owners. The Court of Appeals of Texas ordered Mapco to compensate co-owners of mineral rights for the sale of salt, stating that mineral rights include an ownership right in the subsurface formation. This case is different from claims involving subsurface pore space. In Central Kentucky Natural Gas v. Smallwood, a property owner granted a lease for oil and gas production and storage in the subsurface. The lessee stored gas from adjacent lands and paid only half of the rental fees, arguing they should be paid to the mineral rights holder, not the surface rights holder. The court ruled in favor of the lessee in Central Kentucky Natural Gas v. Smallwood, stating that revenue from stored gas should be paid to the holder of the mineral rights, not the surface rights holder. The decision was based on the classification of the stored gas as equivalent to native gas. The court ruling in Central Kentucky Natural Gas v. Smallwood favored the lessee, stating that revenue from stored gas belongs to the mineral rights holder. This decision is based on the principle that property rights not explicitly conveyed are retained by the owner. Courts would likely find that anything not explicitly mentioned in a lease, such as subsurface pore space, would remain with the grantor. Wyoming and North Dakota have enacted statutes to clarify ownership and control over pore space in anticipation of legal issues related to CCS technology. Wyoming and North Dakota have enacted statutes to clarify ownership and control over pore space for carbon dioxide storage. Wyoming's statute defines pore space as subsurface space for storage and grants ownership to surface rights owners. Mineral rights do not convey ownership of pore space according to the Wyoming statute. Wyoming has created a statutory framework for unitization of pore space beneath multiple tracts of real property. CCS activities in a pore space require approval from owners of at least 80% of the storage capacity. Liability for CO2 sequestration in pore spaces is presumed to be owned by the injector of the material. The Wyoming statute presumes ownership of liability for CO2 sequestration in pore spaces to the injector of the material. North Dakota's statute defines pore space as a cavity in a subsurface stratum, with ownership vested in the surface estate owner. A conveyance of surface rights automatically includes ownership of pore space below the surface in North Dakota. The Wyoming and North Dakota statutes differ in ownership of pore space, with North Dakota not allowing it to be severed from the surface estate. North Dakota requires consent from 60% of owners for CO2 sequestration. Mineral rights owners may have priority over surface rights owners in some cases. The default rule is that the mineral owner has the privilege to drill and take oil and gas, with some states clarifying the primacy of mineral rights over pore space for CCS. The authority to regulate CO2 movement to CCS facilities may be local or federal jurisdiction, depending on the transportation method. If an interstate pipeline system for CCS is developed, jurisdictional questions arise. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Surface Transportation Board (STB) are potential regulators for interstate pipelines transporting CO2 for CCS. FERC has authority over issuing certificates for pipeline construction, siting, and rates for transportation services. FERC has jurisdiction over regulation of oil pipelines under the Interstate Commerce Act, transferred from the ICC in 1977. FERC regulates transportation rates and capacity allocation for oil pipelines, while STB oversees rates for commodities other than oil and natural gas. Oil pipeline siting is not within FERC's jurisdiction. The STB, successor to the ICC, resolves railroad and pipeline disputes under the ICA. It has oversight authority over pipelines transporting commodities other than water, gas, or oil. Unlike FERC, the STB does not require pipeline companies to file tariffs or justify rates, but acts as a forum to resolve disputes. Parties can petition the STB for a hearing to challenge rates or other aspects of a pipeline's common carrier service. The federal regulatory agencies have jurisdiction over interstate pipeline rate and capacity allocation matters, but have rejected jurisdiction over CO2 siting and rates. Carbon dioxide is used for enhanced oil recovery, with pipelines like the Cortez Pipeline transporting CO2 for this purpose across state lines. The Cortez Pipeline, transporting a gas mixture of 98% CO2 and 2% methane, was at the center of a regulatory dispute over FERC jurisdiction. FERC ruled in favor of Cortez, stating that the proposed pipeline was not under their jurisdiction as the gas did not meet the definition of \"natural gas\" under the NGA. This decision highlighted the ambiguity in the term \"natural gas\" and FERC's recognition of different definitions. According to FERC, \"natural gas\" typically refers to a gaseous mixture of hydrocarbons, not including carbon dioxide. FERC determined that the Cortez Pipeline, which contained 98% CO2 and 2% methane, did not fall under their jurisdiction as it did not meet the definition of \"natural gas\" under the NGA. This decision highlighted the ambiguity in the term \"natural gas\" and FERC's recognition of different definitions. The ICC decision clarified that it does not have jurisdiction over CO2 pipelines, as they are excluded from ICC regulation based on legislative history and statutory language. The U.S. Department of Transportation will oversee safety standards for the pipeline. The ICC recognized a regulatory gap regarding CO2 pipelines and FERC's jurisdiction. Despite considering FERC's decision, the ICC concluded that CO2 pipelines were excluded from its jurisdiction after a comment period. The ICC excluded CO2 pipelines from its jurisdiction, but evidence suggests they could fall under the STB's oversight. A 1998 GAO report stated that interstate CO2 pipelines are subject to the STB's authority, listing 14 pipelines transporting CO2 for EOR under STB jurisdiction. The STB, successor to the ICC, may not be bound by the Cortez Pipeline decision on jurisdiction. Federal agencies can change their regulatory positions, as per the Supreme Court. CO2 regulation is subject to ongoing review and interpretation. Regulation of CO2 pipelines for CCS purposes by the STB or FERC remains a possibility, especially if CCS technology advances and interstate CO2 pipelines become more common. The potential regulatory \"gap\" may receive attention, but state laws, safety requirements, and federal antitrust enforcement agencies could address any issues that arise. Some analysts suggest the need for better federal regulatory authority over a potential CO2 pipeline network due to market power abuses, price discrimination, and conflicts between state and federal authorities. Federal antitrust enforcement agencies like the FTC and DOJ could address these issues, along with obtaining right-of-way from the federal government for pipelines crossing federal lands. The CO2 transport and storage sector's growth raises regulatory framework issues regarding federal and state jurisdiction. Congress may need to consider amending existing statutes for federal oversight of a potential national CO2 pipeline network. FERC and the STB are potential candidates for administering this oversight. The liability risks associated with CCS technology include groundwater contamination, seismic events, and surface releases. Uncertainty about financial responsibility for these liabilities could hinder the technology's development. The high liability costs of CCS technology, estimated at over $2 billion for a commercial scale power plant, pose a significant barrier to its development. To address this issue, some suggest creating a liability scheme to provide certainty to developers and mitigate catastrophic risks. The EPA has proposed a liability scheme under the Safe Drinking Water Act to offer greater protection from potential liabilities. On December 10, 2010, EPA issued a final rule for regulating underground injection of CO2 for CCS under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The rule includes technical requirements and a 50-year post-injection site care period for owners and operators of wells used for CO2 sequestration. Compliance involves submitting a site closure plan, continued monitoring, and modeling of the CO2 plume's spread. The final rule for regulating underground injection of CO2 for CCS under the Safe Drinking Water Act includes requirements for monitoring the CO2 plume, financial responsibility for corrective actions, well plugging, post-injection care, and emergency responses. Financial responsibility must be demonstrated in an acceptable instrument sufficient to cover these costs. The final rule for regulating underground injection of CO2 for CCS under the Safe Drinking Water Act includes requirements for financial responsibility, emergency response, and cancellation provisions. The instrument must be sufficient to address endangerment of underground sources of drinking water and approved by the EPA Administrator. Additional financial assurance or liability coverage options can be considered by Congress, such as the Price-Anderson Act for catastrophic loss concerns. The Price-Anderson Act addresses liability for nuclear energy facilities, requiring licensees to assume liability for damages and obtain insurance coverage up to $375 million. The act also establishes a fund for damages exceeding this amount, funded by retrospective premiums from licensees. The Price-Anderson Act requires licensees of nuclear energy facilities to assume liability for damages up to $375 million, with excess liability covered equally by all licensees. Cumulative liability per incident is capped at $12.6 billion, with repayment beyond that amount requiring congressional approval. This liability scheme helped make the nuclear power industry commercially viable in the 1950s by providing coverage for unknown potential liabilities. The Price-Anderson Act established a liability scheme for nuclear energy facilities, making the industry commercially viable by providing coverage for potential liabilities. Some propose a similar liability scheme for CCS projects to address uncertainty and limit liability exposure. The Price-Anderson Act established a liability scheme for nuclear energy facilities, making the industry commercially viable by providing coverage for potential liabilities. The legislation served as an incentive for the nuclear power industry to grow. The panel may use the act as a guide for addressing long-term financial responsibility issues in the CCS industry. Other proposed CCS liability models in the 111th Congress could provide a framework for future legislative proposals. The Department of Energy Carbon Capture and Sequestration Program Amendments Act of 2009 proposed requiring CCS facility licensees to obtain liability protection acceptable to regulators. The Secretary of Energy could agree to indemnify licensees for amounts exceeding the protection obtained, with a fee collected from licensees to cover this indemnification. This proposal had similarities to the Price-Anderson model, including the requirement for financial protection and federal indemnification. The proposal in the Department of Energy Carbon Capture and Sequestration Program Amendments Act of 2009 suggested that CCS facility licensees obtain liability protection acceptable to regulators. Federal indemnification would be provided by the Treasury, not from a separate fund collected retroactively from licensees."
