    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 11401.5 is added to the Insurance Code in the State of California. Section 11401.5 of the Insurance Code in California requires associations issuing long-term disability or long-term care policies to submit an actuarial opinion on the adequacy of reserves and related items by July 1, 2016, based on reasonable assumptions and actuarial standards. An association self-funding long-term care or disability policies is exempt from reporting if it markets policies issued by an insurer approved by the department. Associations seeking authority must prove adequate resources for benefits. The opinion required for reserves and related actuarial items must be supported by a qualified actuary, ensuring adequate provision for obligations under policies and contracts. It must adhere to actuarial standards of practice and include supporting memoranda. If the association fails to provide a compliant opinion and supporting memoranda, the commissioner will notify them of deficiencies and request specific amendments. If laws governing associations are deemed inadequate, the commissioner will recommend changes to protect members' interests by a specified date. Documents, materials, or information submitted to the Department of Insurance are considered proprietary and contain trade secrets. They are confidential, privileged, and not subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act. The commissioner cannot make them public without written consent. The association must give written consent before making documents, materials, or information public. Section 11401.6 of the Insurance Code requires associations that self-fund benefits to include specific language in contracts and certificates. This section will be in effect until December 31, 2018, unless extended or repealed by a later statute enacted before that date. The contract benefits are not regulated by the California Department of Insurance and are not guaranteed by the California Life and Health Insurance Guarantee Association. The Legislature finds that a limitation on public access to insurance holding company information is necessary to protect proprietary information. This section will be repealed on December 31, 2018, unless extended by a later statute."
