    "content": "The Act titled \"Middle Class Savings and Capital Gains Act of 1995\" introduces a lifetime net capital gain deduction for individuals under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Middle Class Savings and Capital Gains Act of 1995\" allows individuals a deduction for 100 percent of their net capital gain for the taxable year, with a $100,000 lifetime limit on the amount of net capital gain taken into account. The taxpayer can deduct their net capital gain for the taxable year, with a lifetime limit of $100,000, multiplied by the inflation adjustment factor for the calendar year. The inflation adjustment factor is determined by the percentage difference in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the current and previous calendar years. For joint tax returns, net capital gains are split equally between spouses for future year limitations. Gain on the sale of a principal residence by individuals under 55 is excluded from this section. The section provides exceptions for rental property and rules for property held jointly by spouses. It also states that individuals under 21 and estates/trusts are not eligible for deductions under this section. Coordination with the treatment of capital gain under the limitation on investment interest is also mentioned. The net capital gain for a taxable year is reduced by investment income under section 163(d)(4)(B)(iii). A transitional rule limits the net capital gain for the portion of the taxable year on or after January 1, 1995, especially for pass-thru entities. The deduction for capital gains shall be made at the entity level for pass-thru entities such as regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, S corporations, partnerships, estates, trusts, and common trust funds. This deduction is allowable in computing adjusted gross income and is included as paragraph (16) in section 62 of the Internal Revenue Code. Conforming amendments are made to section 172(d)(2) to accommodate this deduction. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to include deductions for capital gains at the entity level for pass-thru entities. Amendments are made to various sections including 691(c), 871(a), and 1402(i) to accommodate these changes. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to include deductions for capital gains at the entity level for pass-thru entities. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for part I of subchapter P of chapter 1 of the Code. The amendments made by this section regarding the capital gains deduction for individuals will apply to taxable years ending on or after December 31, 1994."
