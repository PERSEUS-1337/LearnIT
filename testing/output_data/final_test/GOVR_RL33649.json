    "content": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is a grants and civil rights statute providing federal funding for children with disabilities' education, requiring a free appropriate public education (FAPE). Enacted in 1975, it was revised by the 108th Congress with significant changes, including defining \"highly qualified\" teachers and new requirements for children. The U.S. Department of Education issued regulations for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) in response to changes made by the 108th Congress. These regulations clarify and strengthen various provisions, including defining \"highly qualified\" teachers and outlining requirements for children's participation in assessments. The focus is on student performance, with additional guidance provided in certain areas. The U.S. Department of Education issued regulations for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) in response to changes made by the 108th Congress. The report discusses provisions related to multi-year individualized education program (IEP) demonstration programs and infants and toddlers with disabilities under Part C of IDEA. The Department of Education stated that they have created a comprehensive document incorporating all requirements from the new law and regulations to provide a single reference for parents, State personnel, and school personnel. The final regulations for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) follow the structure of P.L. 108-446. They cover state and local agency eligibility, evaluations, IEPs, procedural safeguards, monitoring, enforcement, and grants. The final regulations for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) cover state and local agency eligibility, evaluations, IEPs, procedural safeguards, monitoring, enforcement, and grants. P.L. 108-446 includes provisions on grants, allotment, use of funds, and authorization of appropriations, as well as preschool grants for children with disabilities. Additionally, there is a provision prohibiting changes in IDEA regulations that would lessen protections for children with disabilities, added in response to regulatory reform attempts in 1983. The final regulations for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) cover various areas such as state and local agency eligibility, evaluations, IEPs, procedural safeguards, monitoring, enforcement, and grants. The regulations also include provisions to prevent changes that would reduce protections for children with disabilities. Additional regulations were issued in 2008 to clarify and strengthen existing regulations, including parental revocation of consent. The IDEA regulations issued in 2008 cover parental revocation of consent, employment of qualified individuals with disabilities, representation of parents in due process hearings, state monitoring and enforcement, and fund allocation to LEAs. These regulations took effect on December 31, 2008. Additionally, the ESEA requires states to ensure that all public-school teachers teaching core academic subjects are \"highly qualified.\" The IDEA, as amended by P.L. 108-446, requires all special education teachers to meet certain requirements, including those who teach core subjects exclusively to children with disabilities assessed against alternative achievement standards under ESEA. Special education teachers who teach core subjects exclusively to children with disabilities can meet the definition of highly qualified by demonstrating competence in all academic subjects based on state standards or subject matter knowledge appropriate to the level of instruction. Teachers may also qualify by meeting requirements in each core subject taught under applicable ESEA provisions. Special education teachers can qualify as highly qualified by meeting requirements in each core subject taught under ESEA provisions. Veteran special education teachers teaching multiple core subjects may also qualify through the HOUSSE option. Newly hired special education teachers with expertise in certain subjects have two years to meet the highly qualified definition for other core subjects. This two-year window is the only exception to the deadline for meeting the highly qualified definition under IDEA or ESEA. The regulations for highly qualified teacher requirements include language on alternative routes to certification and specific requirements for special education teachers. It clarifies that special education teachers not teaching core academic subjects only need a baccalaureate degree and full special education certification to meet the definition. Private school teachers are not subject to the highly qualified definition. The regulations for highly qualified teacher requirements do not apply to private school teachers. States can develop separate procedures for special education teachers, ensuring they meet the same content knowledge standards as regular education teachers. There is no legal action for not meeting the requirements, but parents can still file complaints about staff qualifications. The regulations clarify that a regular teacher who becomes certified as a special education teacher is considered a new special education teacher for the purposes of the highly qualified teacher definition. The IDEA differentiates between special education teachers for severely cognitively disabled children at the elementary level and those teaching above the elementary level. The statute references the HOUSSE alternative for elementary level teachers, but not for teachers at higher levels. The regulations differentiate between special education teachers for severely cognitively disabled children at the elementary level and those teaching above the elementary level. The statutory language does not explicitly reference the ESEA HOUSSE alternative for the latter group of teachers. \u00a7300.156(a) contains the general requirement that states must have personnel qualifications to ensure effective teaching to standards. The regulations ensure that personnel are adequately prepared to serve children with disabilities. Highly qualified general education teachers without special education certification can still provide instruction to children with disabilities. Private school placement for children with disabilities can be arranged by the LEA or SEA at their cost to fulfill the FAPE requirement. The IDEA allows children with disabilities to be unilaterally placed in private schools by parents, with the cost not covered by the LEA unless certain findings are made. Services for children in private schools have been a contentious issue, with provisions expanded in 1997 and changes made in 2004. Children in private schools are entitled to special education and related services. Private school children with disabilities are now entitled to special education services based on the location of the private school, not where the child resides. The responsibility for providing services has shifted from the LEA of residence to the LEA of attendance. The new law requires consultation with private school officials and parents, with added compliance procedures for complaints. The final regulations require private school officials to consult with the SEA and allows them to submit complaints to the Secretary of Education if dissatisfied. The LEA of attendance is responsible for locating, identifying, and evaluating parentally placed children in private schools, including children residing in another state. Children ages three to five are considered \"parentally placed\" if they attend private schools meeting the definition of \"elementary school.\" The regulations require private school officials to consult with the SEA and allow complaints to be submitted to the Secretary of Education. The LEA is responsible for identifying parentally placed children in private schools, including those residing in another state. Children aged three to five are considered \"parentally placed\" if they attend private schools meeting the definition of \"elementary school.\" IDEA grants must be used proportionally to provide services for these children, excluding the cost of child find. The regulations specify that parentally-placed private school children with disabilities do not have an individual right to receive all special education services as in public schools. The LEA makes final decisions on services and creates a service plan for these children. Privacy rights must be protected, requiring parental consent if a child enrolls in a private school outside the LEA of the parent's residence. Parental consent is required before sharing student information between officials in the LEA where the private school is located and officials in the LEA of the parent's residence. Public school advocates are concerned about the additional burden on school districts with a higher number of private schools. The American Association of School Administrators intends to address child find costs with Congress. Section 615 of IDEA provides procedural safeguards for children with disabilities and their parents, including provisions for a free appropriate public education (FAPE). Changes made by P.L. 108-446 include adding provisions for homeless children, a two-year statute of limitations for complaints and hearing requests, additional requirements for hearing officers, and allowing the local educational agency to file for due process. AASA plans to address these issues with Congress. The addition of a \"resolution session\" in P.L. 108-446 allows the local educational agency to file for a due process hearing, aiming to improve communication between parents and school officials to resolve disputes before a formal hearing. The 2004 reauthorization (P.L. 108-446) introduced a resolution session to facilitate timely dispute resolution in the best interest of the child. If an agreement is reached, a legally binding agreement must be signed by both parties. Changes were made to \u00a7615(k), including allowing school personnel to consider unique circumstances for changing a child's placement and revising language on manifestation determinations. The 1997 reauthorization and 2004 amendment (P.L. 108-446) of IDEA introduced the concept of a manifestation determination. This requires a review of relevant information within 10 days of changing a child's placement due to behavior related to a disability. The goal is to determine if the behavior was caused by the disability or the school's failure. The IDEA introduced the concept of a manifestation determination to review if a child's behavior was caused by their disability or the school's failure. If conduct is linked to the disability, the child can return to their original placement unless agreed otherwise. The IDEA allows parents to revoke consent for special education services in writing, emphasizing their role in protecting their child's rights. The regulations under IDEA emphasize parental involvement and choice in their child's education. LEAs cannot override a parent's decision to refuse consent for services. If consent is revoked, the LEA is not in violation of FAPE requirements and is not required to amend the child's records. The regulations under IDEA emphasize parental involvement and choice in their child's education. LEAs cannot override a parent's decision to refuse consent for services. If consent is revoked, the LEA is not in violation of FAPE requirements and is not required to amend the child's records. The majority of the regulatory language regarding procedural safeguards mirrors the statutory language in P.L. 108-446. However, the regulations make several additions, such as clarifying when a procedural safeguards notice must be provided and explaining the differences between a due process complaint and a complaint under the state complaint procedures. ED has provided a model procedural safeguards notice on its website. The ED made changes to the regulations for selecting mediators in special education disputes. States must maintain a list of qualified mediators, but now the SEA must select mediators on a random, rotational, or impartial basis without requiring involvement from both parties. This ensures unbiased mediator selection while giving flexibility to SEAs. The final regulations for selecting mediators in special education disputes removed a provision on signing confidentiality pledges before mediation. States can still allow parties to sign pledges for confidentiality. Changes in the regulations also address the use of lay advocates in hearings under Part B of IDEA. Individuals with special knowledge can now represent parties, even if they are not attorneys. In 2000, the Delaware Supreme Court ruled that a lay advocate representing families in due process hearings was practicing law without authorization. A 2006 survey showed that ten states, including Delaware, prohibit lay advocates from representing parents, while twelve states permit it, twenty-one states have no official policy, and eight states leave it to the hearing officer. The survey highlighted a shortage of affordable attorneys for parents in special education cases. Attempts to authorize lay advocates during IDEA reauthorization were unsuccessful. December 2008 regulations changed the interpretation by ED, allowing the use of lay advocates at due process hearings under certain conditions. The Department allows non-attorneys to represent parents in IDEA due process hearings based on State law. Regulations require a resolution session unless parties agree otherwise, with consequences for non-participation. The regulations allow for a resolution session in IDEA due process hearings, with consequences for non-participation by the parent or LEA. Confidentiality of discussions during the resolution session is not mandated by the statute but parties can enter into a confidentiality agreement if desired. The 2006 regulations require confidentiality in resolution meetings and provide additional guidance on discipline for children with disabilities. School personnel can consider unique circumstances on a case-by-case basis when deciding on a change in placement, as long as it is consistent with the requirements of the section. The 2006 regulations provide guidance on discipline for children with disabilities, allowing school personnel to consider unique circumstances on a case-by-case basis when deciding on a change in placement. The regulations also state that the ability to remove a child with a disability should be applied similarly to children without disabilities, as long as it does not constitute a change in placement. The 2006 regulations add a subsection for children removed for more than 10 school days, requiring educational services to continue as per FAPE guarantee. The Act modifies the concept of FAPE for children with disabilities removed for disciplinary reasons. The Act modifies the concept of FAPE for children with disabilities removed for disciplinary reasons, requiring services to enable participation in the general curriculum and progress towards IEP goals. LEAs are not obligated to provide the exact same services in the same settings, but must ensure continued participation and goal progress. School personnel can place a student in an interim alternative educational setting for up to 45 school days in cases involving weapons, drugs, or serious bodily injury. The IDEA statute requires services for children with disabilities removed for disciplinary reasons, with LEAs able to place students in an interim alternative educational setting for up to 45 school days in cases involving weapons, drugs, or serious bodily injury. The burden of proof in arguing for removal due to safety concerns lies with the public agency, as clarified in response to comments on the proposed regulations. The Supreme Court decision in Schaffer v. Weast regarding burden of persuasion in IDEA proceedings was noted by ED. The 2006 regulations allow a school district to seek a subsequent hearing to continue a child in an interim alternative educational placement if returning the child to the original placement may result in harm. P.L. 108-446 provides expedited timelines for disciplinary hearings under IDEA, with shortened time frames for resolution meetings to avoid delaying expedited hearings if no agreement is reached. The burden of proof for removing a child to an interim alternative educational setting lies with the public agency. The 2006 regulations allow for subsequent hearings to continue a child in interim alternative placement if harm may result from returning to the original placement. P.L. 108-446 changed the \"stay put\" provision in the appeals section, requiring an expedited hearing within 20 school days of the request, with a decision made within 10 school days after the hearing. The burden of proof for removing a child to an interim alternative setting lies with the public agency. The 2006 regulations allow for subsequent hearings to continue a child in interim alternative placement if harm may result from returning to the original placement. P.L. 108-446 changed the \"stay put\" provision in the appeals section, requiring an expedited hearing within 20 school days of the request, with a decision made within 10 school days after the hearing. The regulations reflect the change in stay-put requirements, providing protections for children not yet eligible for special education services. Several changes are made regarding when an LEA is deemed to have knowledge that a child is a child with a disability. An LEA is deemed to have knowledge if the parent expressed concern in writing to the LEA or the child's teacher about the need for special education, requested an evaluation, or if the teacher or LEA personnel expressed concerns about the child's behavior to the director of special education. The final regulations deleted the requirement for teachers to express concerns directly to the director of special education. States without this process were encouraged to make changes to meet the requirement. IDEA mandates that children with disabilities receive special education and related services to benefit from public education, including health-related services for some children. For example, a child reliant on a ventilator may need in-school staff to operate the equipment for school attendance. IDEA requires necessary staff and services for such children. Congress changed the connection between IDEA and Medicaid in 1988 to allow the use of Medicaid funds for health services for special education students. Medicaid now covers services listed in a child's IEP, easing the burden on states and school districts to fulfill IDEA requirements. In 1988, Congress amended Medicaid to allow the use of funds for health services for special education students, aligning with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Medicaid now covers services in a child's IEP, reducing the burden on states and school districts to meet IDEA requirements. The final regulations authorize schools to use Medicaid or other public benefits to provide services required under IDEA, reducing the burden on states and school districts. The 2006 final IDEA regulations allow schools to use public benefits for services under IDEA, with a new requirement for parental consent each time access to benefits is sought to maintain data confidentiality. The public agency must obtain parental consent before releasing a child's education records to a State Medicaid agency for insurance billing purposes, to protect privacy rights and ensure full parental awareness of the use of public benefits for services under IDEA. The provision requiring parental consent for accessing public benefits or insurance for services under IDEA has raised concerns about increased paperwork. Stakeholders worry this could hinder the Medicaid claiming process. Alexa Posny emphasized the need for parental consent each time benefits are accessed, aiming to inform parents about the frequency of benefit utilization without overwhelming them with paperwork. The IDEA statute defines \"a child with a disability\" based on various categories and stipulates the need for special education services. Examples of other health impairments include attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity disorder, but these are not exhaustive. Stakeholders have argued for the inclusion of other disabilities in the definition. The IDEA statute defines \"a child with a disability\" based on various categories and stipulates the need for special education services. Examples of other health impairments include attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity disorder, but stakeholders have argued for the inclusion of Tourette syndrome in the definition to correct misperceptions and prevent misdiagnosis. P.L. 108-446 expanded the definition of \"parent\" to include guardians who may act as parents of a child with a disability. The regulations clarify who can act as a parent for a child with a disability, stating that biological or adoptive parents are presumed to act unless they lack legal authority. If a judicial decree identifies someone to make educational decisions for the child, that person is considered the parent. Related services aim to help the child receive a free appropriate public education as outlined in their individualized education program. Public agencies must provide these services if deemed necessary by the IEP team. The regulations provide an exception for medical devices like cochlear implants, stating that services related to their optimization, maintenance, or replacement are not considered related services for the purpose of public education. Mapping of cochlear implants, although necessary for the child to hear well in school, does not have to be done during the school day. The Senate committee clarified that school districts are not responsible for mapping cochlear implants or associated costs. However, LEAs still have responsibilities for maintaining surgically implanted devices. The regulations also address the Maintenance of Effort (MOE) financial principle in federal educational statutes. The regulations provide exceptions to the local Maintenance of Effort (MOE) requirement, allowing for flexibility in funding decisions when senior special education personnel are replaced by lower-paid staff. This aims to reduce regulatory burden on school districts. The IDEA regulations aim to reduce burden on school districts by providing flexibility in funding decisions, while still ensuring the provision of FAPE to eligible children. States distribute IDEA Part B funds to local education agencies based on various factors, but there is ambiguity regarding funding allocation to charter schools. The IDEA regulations require states to allocate funds to charter schools, even if they have no students with disabilities enrolled. This ensures that funds are available for child find activities and serving children with disabilities who may enroll later. The regulations do not specify how funding should be allocated to charter schools that initially have zero students with disabilities. The IDEA regulations require states to allocate funds to charter schools, even if they have no students with disabilities enrolled. A base payment adjustment is made for LEAs, including public charter schools, that start providing special education to children with disabilities. The state must divide the base allocation among affected LEAs based on the number of children with disabilities served. The regulations also modify procedures for reallocating LEA funds. The IDEA regulations require assessments for children with disabilities to be provided in the most accurate language unless clearly not feasible. Concerns exist about over-identification of learning disabilities due to evaluation procedures. P.L. 108-446 adds specific requirements for determining specific learning disabilities, removing the need for a severe discrepancy between achievement and intellectual ability. LEAs can use a process based on scientific intervention for evaluations, and states must adopt criteria without requiring a severe discrepancy model. The regulations for determining specific learning disabilities no longer require a severe discrepancy between achievement and intellectual ability. States must adopt criteria based on scientific intervention, involving a team of qualified professionals and parents in the determination process. The regulations for determining specific learning disabilities are based on the child's achievement relative to age or state standards, not on disabilities or cultural factors. Performance and behavior must be observed in the learning environment. The regulations incorporate language from the act and modify some provisions. The regulations for IDEA Part B focus on student performance and shift from compliance with procedures. The Secretary of Education monitors implementation through oversight of states and state performance plans, enforcing Part B as described in \u00a7616(e). States are required to monitor implementation by LEAs and enforce Part B based on determinations made by the Secretary. The regulations for IDEA Part B require states to annually assess the performance of each LEA and enforce compliance promptly. States must report on LEA performance publicly and make their performance plans accessible to the public. The regulations for IDEA Part B require states to assess the performance of each LEA annually and enforce compliance promptly. States must make their performance plans accessible to the public within 120 days of submitting their annual performance report. Additionally, states must also make the annual reports on the performance of each LEA available to the public. States needing intervention must provide this information to the public as well. The December 2008 regulations clarify public notice requirements for enforcement actions by the Secretary. On April 9, 2007, final regulations were published regarding flexibility for determining adequate yearly progress under NCLB, amending ESEA and IDEA regulations to allow modified achievement standards for students with disabilities. The \"2% rule\" states that only 2% of students tested can achieve AYP. Amendments to ESEA and IDEA regulations require states to ensure participation of children with disabilities in assessments and provide guidelines for testing accommodations. States and LEAs must report the number of children with disabilities assessed under alternative assessment options. The act allows for multi-year IEP pilot demonstrations for up to 15 states, enabling parents and LEAs to adopt optional IEPs covering three years aligned with natural transition points. These IEPs must have measurable annual goals and be reviewed annually for progress, with more frequent reviews if needed. The Secretary is required to report on the effectiveness of the multi-year IEP demonstration programs. Additional requirements and selection criteria were issued in July 2007, stating that states needing assistance could have their participation terminated. States must provide specific materials in their proposals, including assurances for informing parents. The act requires participating LEAs to inform parents about differences between multi-year and standard IEPs, their right to revoke consent, and criteria for state proposals. P.L. 108-446 authorizes a paperwork reduction pilot program allowing the Secretary to waive certain requirements for up to 15 states. The House bill includes a pilot program to reduce paperwork burden for special education teachers, aiming to address the shortage of educators leaving the field due to excessive paperwork. States can participate in innovative measures to meet Act demands while focusing on educating children. The House bill aims to reduce paperwork burden for special education teachers to address the shortage of educators leaving the field. The IDEA infants and toddlers program under Part C authorizes grants to states for early intervention programs for children with disabilities, with eligibility based on a diagnosis of \"development delay.\" The IDEA Part C program provides early intervention services for infants and toddlers with a diagnosis of \"development delay\" through individualized family service plans (IFSPs). Services are to be provided in natural environments, and the 2004 reauthorization allows for extending services until the child is eligible for kindergarten. The IDEA Part C program provides early intervention services for infants and toddlers with developmental delays through individualized family service plans. The 2004 reauthorization allows for extending services until the child is eligible for kindergarten, with requirements for state policies to extend Part C services including informed consent from parents, annual notices, and educational components promoting school readiness. The IDEA Part C program provides early intervention services for infants and toddlers with developmental delays. The 2004 reauthorization allows for extending services until the child is eligible for kindergarten. The act requires the Secretary of Education to reserve 15% of appropriations for state incentive grants for states implementing extended Part C services. Other changes include adding registered dietitians and vision specialists to the list of qualified personnel. The IDEA Part C program provides early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities, including those affected by child abuse or substance abuse. Proposed regulations aim to add definitions and modify existing ones to support programs for these children and their families. The proposed regulations for the IDEA Part C program aim to add and modify definitions to reflect changes in the statute, such as adding a definition for \"ward of the state\" and incorporating provisions related to cochlear implants in the definition of health services. The proposed regulations for the IDEA Part C program aim to modify definitions to reflect changes in the statute, such as adding registered dieticians and vision specialists to the list of qualified personnel in the definition of early intervention services. The proposed regulations for the IDEA Part C program include allowing states to extend early intervention services for children until they are eligible for kindergarten. Requirements for implementing this state option are outlined, including specifying the age range for services and ensuring funds are not commingled or supplanted. The proposed regulations for the IDEA Part C program include exceptions to prohibitions on reducing expenditure levels for LEAs under Part B based on decreasing numbers of infants and toddlers with disabilities. Additionally, the regulations prohibit Part C lead agencies from charging indirect costs without approval and restrict charging rent, occupancy, or space maintenance costs to the Part C grant without prior Secretary approval. The proposed regulations for the IDEA Part C program include procedural safeguards for parents and infants, such as confidentiality provisions, parental consent, notice, surrogate parents, and dispute resolution options. Requirements for obtaining parental consent before administering screening procedures, evaluations, early intervention services, using insurance, and exchanging information among agencies are also outlined. The proposed regulations for the IDEA Part C program include procedural safeguards for parents and infants, such as confidentiality provisions, parental consent, notice, surrogate parents, and dispute resolution options. The regulations outline requirements for obtaining parental consent before administering screening procedures, evaluations, and early intervention services. Dispute resolution options include mediation, state complaints, and due process hearing procedures. If mediation resolves a complaint, a legally binding agreement must be signed by the parent and an agency representative with authority to bind the agency. The proposed regulations for IDEA Part C program include detailed departmental procedures for disapproving a state's application, requirements for federal monitoring and enforcement, and extensive provisions for using public and private insurance to pay for services under Part C. The proposed regulations for IDEA Part C program include requirements for using public and private insurance to pay for services provided under Part C. States would need parental consent to use public insurance or program benefits, and could use private insurance with parental consent. States could charge fees for some Part C services under certain circumstances, with restrictions on charging parents who are unable to pay. States could not charge fees for certain Part C services, such as child find and evaluation, or for services provided as part of FAPE below the age of 3."
