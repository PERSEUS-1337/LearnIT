The Mandatory Foreclosure Mediation Act requires mediation before foreclosure. The Mandatory Foreclosure Mediation Act requires servicers to make efforts for mediation and offer loan modifications before initiating foreclosure actions. Servicers must also suspend foreclosure actions until mediation proceedings are completed. During mediation proceedings, servicers must determine borrower eligibility for loan modification or alternatives to foreclosure and offer them if eligible. Foreclosure actions are suspended during this period, prohibiting notices, property sales, or judgments against the borrower. Servicers are not required to suspend foreclosure actions if they make reasonable efforts to schedule a mediation proceeding to determine borrower eligibility for loan modification or alternatives to foreclosure, and the borrower does not agree to participate. This section does not mandate servicers to delay unavoidable foreclosures. The Secretary will establish a mediation process to determine borrower eligibility for loan modification or alternatives to foreclosure. SEC. 4. BAR TO FORECLOSURE ACTIONS. A violation of this Act will prevent a foreclosure action, unless the servicer is in compliance with the Act. SEC. 5. REGULATIONS. The Secretary must issue regulations within 90 days of the Act's enactment. SEC. 6. REPORT. Servicers initiating mediation proceedings must submit quarterly reports to the Secretary."
