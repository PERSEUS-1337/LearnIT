    "content": "The Andean-U.S. free trade agreement negotiations began in May 2004 with the United States, Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador participating. After unsuccessful talks, Peru and Colombia each reached separate bilateral agreements with the United States in 2005 and 2006, respectively. Negotiations with Ecuador stalled. This report discusses the evolution from a single FTA to multiple bilateral agreements and major trade issues in the negotiations. Colombian President Uribe sought a free-trade agreement with the US to improve the economy and combat drug activity. President Bush initially hesitated due to focus on the FTAA. Talks stalled, leading Bush to consider bilateral trade discussions with Colombia. Senator Baucus supported free-trade talks with Colombia. Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley, along with other members of the Senate Finance Committee, urged USTR Zoellick to consider initiating free-trade negotiations with Colombia. The USTR traveled to Bogota to discuss the scope and depth of potential negotiations with Colombia's President. Peru and Ecuador also showed interest in FTA negotiations. Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia expressed interest in FTA negotiations with the United States. USTR Zoellick notified Congress of plans to begin negotiations with these countries, aiming to reduce trade barriers and promote investment. Ecuador and Bolivia were also considered for inclusion in the agreement. The combined markets of the Andean countries have a GDP of $463 billion and a population of 93 million people. The notification highlighted the potential benefits of an Andean FTA, including enhancing democracy, combating narcotrafficking, and addressing various concerns such as worker rights and disputes with U.S. investors. The USTR announced FTA negotiations with Colombia, addressing disputes with U.S. investors and worker rights concerns in Peru and Ecuador. Colombia was named for negotiations, indicating unresolved issues with other Andean countries. During the first round of FTA negotiations in Cartagena, Colombia in May 2004, negotiators agreed on a schedule for seven rounds by early 2005. Various groups protested the negotiations due to concerns about job loss in the agriculture sector. Thirteen rounds of negotiations were held by November 2005 for the U.S.-Andean FTA. Thirteen rounds of negotiations for the U.S.-Andean FTA were held between May 2004 and November 2005, with Bolivia attending as an observer. The USTR mentioned Bolivia's \"basic stability issues\" and the resignation of the Bolivian president in mid-June 2005 due to opposition to foreign participation in natural resource sectors. In December 2005, Evo Morales was elected as Bolivia's president, succeeding the interim president. In Ecuador, President Lucio Gutierrez was impeached in April 2005, and Alfredo Palacio became the new president. The negotiations for the U.S.-Andean FTA faced challenges in intellectual property rights and agriculture, leading to disagreements and the withdrawal of Colombian and Ecuadorian negotiators. In December 2005, U.S. and Peru reached a free trade agreement, eliminating tariffs and barriers to goods and services. U.S. Trade Representative and Peru's Minister of Foreign Trade announced the successful conclusion of negotiations. Colombia and Ecuador later expressed interest in joining the agreement. Colombia and Ecuador expressed interest in joining the free trade agreement with the United States. The agreement is seen as crucial for regional trade strategy, creating export opportunities, and fostering economic development while countering narco-terrorism. Ecuador also aims to continue negotiations for a similar agreement with the U.S. The Andean governments are pursuing FTAs with the United States to secure access to the U.S. market and attract foreign investment. However, there is grassroots opposition within the Andean countries due to concerns about economic benefits only benefiting a small segment of the population and worsening class separation. The Andean countries face opposition to a trade agreement with the United States due to concerns about the impact on poor farmers, potential revenue losses, and the need for regressive domestic taxes to make up for the losses. Anti-free trade sentiments were evident during the Cartagena round in September 2005. During the Cartagena round in September 2005, 7,000 anti-free trade activists gathered in Cartagena and Bogota, with protesters in Peru erecting roadblocks. The protests influenced governments to delay entry into an agreement. Ecuador's chief trade negotiator emphasized the importance of concluding an agreement to avoid being left out of the deal to be voted on in the U.S. Congress. In the U.S., the business community, including the National Association of Manufacturers, supported the Andean FTA. The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) supports the Andean Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and other FTAs, advocating for the removal of barriers, transparency in regulations, enforcement of laws, protection of U.S. investment, and intellectual property rights. However, a coalition of labor, religious, and environmental groups opposes the Andean FTA, citing lack of transparency and public dialogue in negotiations. The Andean negotiations are based on failed trade agreements, with signatories including AFL-CIO, American Friends Service Committee, and Public Citizen. The United States provides special duty treatment to imports from Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru under a regional trade preference program established by the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA). ATPA aimed to promote economic growth in the Andean region and discourage dependence on illegal drugs through legitimate economic activities. The Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA) was enacted on August 6, 2002, to reauthorize the ATPA preference program and expand trade preferences to include additional products. These products included petroleum, certain footwear, tuna, watches, and leather products. Duty-free benefits under ATPDEA ended on December 31, 2006. In 2005, a significant portion of U.S. imports from Andean countries entered duty-free under ATPDEA. In 2005, a small share of U.S. imports from Andean countries entered duty-free under normal trade relations. Only 7% of the value of imports was dutiable. The United States imported $20.1 billion from the four countries, with Colombia accounting for 44% of imports. In 2005, the United States imported $20.1 billion from Andean countries, with Colombia accounting for 44% of imports. Peru and Ecuador split the other half of imports and exports, while Bolivia had a small share. The leading U.S. import was petroleum oil, mainly from Ecuador and Colombia, with other imports including jewelry, gold, coal, coffee, copper articles, and cut flowers. Leading U.S. exports to the region were petroleum products, mining equipment, broadcasting equipment, and data processing machines. The FTA negotiations covered issues such as services trade, e-commerce, and government procurement. The main obstacles were agriculture and intellectual property rights. U.S. negotiators were interested in reaching agreement but refused to discuss agricultural subsidies, aiming to eliminate the \"price-band mechanism.\" The \"price-band mechanism\" is used by Colombia and Ecuador to impose fluctuating tariffs on imports to keep prices within a specific range. This mechanism is necessary to protect small farmers against subsidized imports and prevent drug production in Colombia. Andean negotiators emphasize the importance of this mechanism for their farmers. Additionally, access to the U.S. market is crucial for Andean producers of cut flowers and asparagus, but these products could displace U.S. producers. The United States and Andean countries have concerns about potential displacement effects on their respective producers under ATPDEA. Disagreements arise over data exclusivity rules in an FTA, with the US pushing for a five-year protection period for pharmaceutical and agricultural test data. Oxfam argues for exclusive guarantees in development and relief efforts. Oxfam opposes data exclusivity rules in the FTA, arguing it delays generic competition after patent expiration. Andean countries also oppose data exclusivity, fearing it hinders access to affordable pharmaceuticals. Bio-piracy concerns include protection of traditional knowledge and genetic resources. The US seeks \"second use\" protection and safeguards against parallel imports. The Andean countries opposed U.S. positions on trade negotiations with Ecuador and Colombia due to concerns about worker rights and violence against trade unionists. The International Confederation of Free Trade Unionists criticized Colombia's president for negotiating with paramilitary forces, who are accused of killing trade unionists. Colombia defended its human rights record and protection of union members. The U.S. State Department report on human rights in Colombia highlights issues with protecting union members' rights, including violence and discrimination. In Ecuador, concerns were raised about workers' rights violations and failure to uphold commitments. The U.S. State Department report on human rights in Colombia raises concerns about protecting union members' rights. In Ecuador, there are issues with workers' rights violations and failure to uphold commitments under the ATPDEA. The House Committee on International Relations discusses unresolved disputes involving U.S. investments in Andean countries. The House Committee on International Relations discusses disputes involving U.S. investments in Peru and Ecuador, warning that unresolved issues could hinder the approval of a Free Trade Agreement. At a hearing on U.S. trade agreements with Latin America, John Murphy of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce highlighted investment disputes with Peru and Ecuador as potential obstacles to their participation in an FTA. Progress has been made in resolving disputes with U.S. companies since 2005. Andean countries, particularly Colombia, raised concerns about visa and immigration issues, but U.S. negotiators maintained that immigration was non-negotiable. Environmental groups, including Friends of the Earth, raised concerns about investment provisions in a letter dated September 13, 2004. Environmental groups, such as Friends of the Earth, expressed concerns about the inclusion of an investment chapter similar to Chapter 11 of NAFTA in an Andean FTA. They argued that such provisions could allow foreign companies to bypass domestic courts. U.S. negotiators sought these provisions to protect American investments. The last round of negotiations involving the United States and the Andean countries took place in Washington in November 2005. Subsequently, Peru and Colombia signed bilateral FTAs with the United States. In 2005, Peru and Colombia signed bilateral FTAs with the United States, while talks with Ecuador were postponed multiple times due to differences, mainly related to agriculture. Ecuadorian President Alfredo Palacio expressed interest in a trade agreement with the United States but faced pressure from indigenous groups who protested against the free trade talks, fearing competition with U.S. farmers and disruption of their culture. Speculation arose that the United States might not renew the ATPDEA without a PTPA. The Means Committee released a report on a congressional trade mission to Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru focusing on the U.S.-Andean free trade agreement negotiations. The current unilateral trade preferences for Andean countries may not be renewed, requiring a reciprocal arrangement. US trade agreements with Colombia and Peru may be treated separately by Congress, limiting the possibility of a stand-alone Andean-US FTA. The Bush Administration's decision to negotiate separate FTAs with Peru and Colombia may impact the passage of free trade agreements. Uncertainty remains regarding a potential U.S.-Ecuador FTA. The narrow approval of CAFTA-DR suggests potential opposition to a U.S.-Andean FTA. Congress could vote on the agreements with Colombia and Peru this summer."
