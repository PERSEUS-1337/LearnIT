The Congress recognizes Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) as a group of complex developmental brain disorders that can cause a wide range of symptoms and affect an estimated 1 in 88 children by age 8. It also acknowledges that an estimated 1,500,000 individuals in the United States are affected by autism. More children will be diagnosed with autism this year than with AIDS, diabetes, and cancer combined. Autism is the fastest growing serious developmental disability in the United States, costing the nation over $35 billion per year. Boys are five times more likely than girls to have autism. There is currently no medical cure for autism, but evidence-based educational methods have been proven effective in improving outcomes for students with autism. Enrolling students with high functioning autism in general education classrooms with proper support is often the best approach. However, teachers and staff may not be adequately trained to work effectively with these students, but training programs can help improve outcomes for all students in the classroom. Children with autism in highly transient families, such as military or foreign service families, face challenges in the public education system due to frequent changes in duty station or parent deployment. It is crucial for school districts with a large transient population to have highly trained staff to provide effective services for students with autism. \"DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM AUTHORIZED for children with autism in highly transient families to address challenges in the public education system.\" The Secretary is authorized to carry out a grant program for schools to provide training on supporting children with autism spectrum disorder in various school settings. Training includes academic, behavioral, communication, social emotional support, and promoting positive peer interactions and social skills. The grant program supports training for schools to assist children with autism spectrum disorder in academic, behavioral, communication, and social skills. It includes technical assistance, recruiting skilled personnel, parental involvement, and a maximum duration of 5 years with 2 years for planning. The grant program supports training for schools to assist children with autism spectrum disorder in academic, behavioral, communication, and social skills. Eligible entities can use up to 20% of funds for administrative costs. To receive a grant, an entity must submit an application to the Secretary. The Secretary will evaluate the program and submit a report to the President and Congress within 1 year of completion. The report on the evaluation of the grant program for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) will be submitted to the President and Congress, along with recommendations for dissemination and replication. Definitions for ASDs and eligible entities are provided in the section. Eligible entities partnering with educational agencies or institutions of higher education can apply for grants. The term \"eligible local educational agency\" refers to a local educational agency with at least 10% of its special education population identified with autism spectrum disorders. The term \"institution of higher education\" is defined as per the Higher Education Act of 1965. The term \"local educational agency\" is defined in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Education as defined in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965."
