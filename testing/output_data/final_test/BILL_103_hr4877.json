    "content": "The \"S Corporation Investment Act of 1994\" allows S corporations to have up to 40 shareholders, an increase from the previous limit of 35 shareholders. Additionally, family members are treated as one shareholder under this act. Paragraph (1) of section 1361(c) is amended to treat family members as one shareholder in an S corporation, including husbands, wives, their estates, and lineal descendants of a common ancestor. The amended section 1361(c) treats family members as one shareholder in an S corporation, including lineal descendants of a common ancestor and their spouses. An individual is not considered a common ancestor if they are more than 4 generations removed from the youngest generation of shareholders. Adoption and other relationships are determined by the rules of section 152(b)(2). An election can be made under subparagraph (A)(ii). An election under subparagraph (A)(ii) in section 1361(c) requires the consent of all shareholders, remains in effect until terminated, and applies to only 1 family in any corporation. SEC. 4. INCREASE IN PASSIVE INCOME PERMITTED. The limit on passive income for corporations is increased from 25 percent to 40 percent. This change also applies to former C corporations. SEC. 5. REINVESTMENT RESERVE. An election under section 1361(c) requires shareholder consent and applies to only 1 family in any corporation. SEC. 1376. REINVESTMENT RESERVE. Part III of subchapter S of chapter 1 is amended to include a new section for a reinvestment reserve. SEC. 1376 introduces a new section for S corporations to establish a reinvestment reserve. The corporation can deduct payments made to the reserve, limited to 3% of taxable income. Earnings from the reserve investments are not taxed, and the reserve can be used for reinvestment purposes. The reinvestment reserve for S corporations can only be used for acquiring tangible property for business purposes. Contributions to the reserve must be deductible payments. Any distributions from the reserve are taxable income for the corporation. Amounts not withdrawn within 3 years are subject to specific treatment. The reinvestment reserve within the 3-year period beginning on the date of deposit is treated as distributed at the close of the period. Deemed distributions are taxed at the highest marginal rate, excluding the amount from gross income and imposing a tax equal to the highest rate specified in section 1. Certain rules apply similar to previous paragraphs. The rules of subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraphs (5) and (6) of section 7518(g) apply for this paragraph. A taxpayer is deemed to have made a payment to the reinvestment reserve on the last day of the taxable year if the payment is made within 2 1/2 months after the close of the taxable year. A new section is added to the table of sections for part III of subchapter S of chapter 1. SEC. 1376 establishes a reinvestment reserve. The amendments in this Act will be effective for taxable years starting after the enactment date."
