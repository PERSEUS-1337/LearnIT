    "content": "In this work, a parametric modal regression algorithm is proposed to find the conditional mode for multi-valued functions. The approach utilizes the implicit function theorem to learn a joint parameterized function over inputs and targets. It is shown to be effective in learning multi-valued functions, scaling well to high-dimensional inputs, and being particularly effective for certain unimodal problems. The proposed parametric modal regression algorithm aims to find the conditional mode for multi-valued functions by learning a joint parameterized function over inputs and targets. It is effective for certain unimodal problems, especially with high frequency data, and shows small improvements on regression datasets with asymmetric target distributions. Modal regression is a method designed for multi-modal distributions, aiming to adjust target values towards their closest empirical conditional modes using non-parametric techniques. This approach is different from Generalized Linear Models commonly used in machine learning, as it focuses on handling multiple modes effectively. Modal regression aims to adjust target values towards their closest empirical conditional modes using non-parametric techniques, which may face challenges in high-dimensional data. Recent work suggests using quantile regression for estimating conditional modes, but a parametric approach with neural networks could enhance these estimators. Learning a mixture distribution through conditional mixture models with parameters learned by a neural network is a potential strategy to extract conditional modes efficiently. In this paper, a new parametric modal regression approach is proposed to identify conditional modes efficiently by learning a parameterized function. The method aims to avoid the complexity of training procedures for the conditional distribution and the challenges of specifying the number of components in a mixture distribution. The approach utilizes the Implicit Function Theorem to develop an objective for learning the function on input features and target values. The Implicit Function Theorem is used to convert multi-valued functions to single-valued functions by learning a function f(x, y) that approximates local functions. The method effectively learns conditional modes on synthetic problems and scales well in high-dimensional inputs. It also improves prediction performance for uni-modal problems with quickly changing function values. Additionally, small improvements are shown on two regression datasets with asymmetric properties. The proposed method shows small improvements on regression datasets with asymmetric distributions. It allows for a variable number of conditional modes to be discovered for each x, making it a promising approach for parametric modal regression. The goal is to find the set of conditional modes for each x, which is a multi-valued function. Standard approaches involve learning p(y|x) or using nonparametric methods to estimate these modes. The text discusses the use of non-parametric algorithms like the mean-shift algorithm to estimate conditional modes in a conditional Gaussian Mixture Model. It also mentions the idea of learning a parameterized function to capture the relationship between x and y for extracting conditional modes. The approach involves using the implicit function theorem to learn a parameterized function f(x, y) to obtain the conditional modes. The text discusses learning a parameterized function f(x, y) to extract conditional modes using the implicit function theorem. This approach allows for identifying modal manifolds using general parametric function approximators like neural networks. The flexibility of the method lies in its ability to accommodate a variable number of conditional modes for each x. The Implicit Function Theorem guarantees the existence of a unique continuously differentiable function g(x) = y under certain conditions when the Jacobian matrix J is invertible. This function helps describe meaningful conditional modes y around each y j for x. The Implicit Function Theorem ensures the existence of a locally defined function to express y given x under certain conditions. Smooth local functions enable the identification of smooth modal manifolds, satisfying specific conditions for training f. The Implicit Function Theorem guarantees the existence of a locally defined function to represent y given x. The gradient condition ensures f(x, y) = 0 locally around g j (x), with non-zero values for y that are not conditional modes. Negative sampling is not necessary, simplifying the objective. The full objective is derived under stochastic targets, assuming Gaussian noise around conditional modes. The goal is to approximate (x, y) with a parameterized function f \u03b8 (x, y) under the constraint \u2202f \u03b8 (x,y) \u2202y = \u22121. The objective is to minimize the negative log likelihood of f \u03b8, encouraging invertibility with a quadratic penalty term. During prediction, the goal is to find y * that minimizes the function f \u03b8 (x * , y) 2 + ( 2, corresponding to conditional modes. The experiments conducted investigate the learning objective's properties, showing its utility for multimodal distributions and high frequency functions. The algorithm outperforms l2 regression by leveraging the NN's representation power, even on single-modal datasets. The experiment aims to study the algorithm's properties for modal prediction problems, comparing it to Mixture Density Networks (MDN). Both algorithms use a two hidden layer neural network and are optimized with different learning rates. Prediction performance is evaluated using root mean squared error (RMSE). MDN predicts mode by maximizing the learned log likelihood over evenly spaced values. Further details on MDN parameter sensitivity are provided in Appendix B. In a study comparing our algorithm (Implicit) to MDN for modal prediction, we conducted experiments on single-circle and double-circle datasets. Our algorithm showed higher sample efficiency, robustness to parameter settings, and scalability to high dimensional feature space. MDN, on the other hand, was sensitive to the number of mixture components and had larger variance across different random seeds. Our algorithm outperforms MDN on the double-circle dataset by using 4 components for learning. The training set consists of 40,000 data points sampled from a circle with added Gaussian noise. MDN struggles with only two mixture components, requiring three for better performance. Learning curves demonstrate our algorithm's faster and more stable learning process. Predictions outputted by our approach and MDN are compared in Figure 3(a)(b). The double-circle dataset poses a challenge for p(y|x) as a mixture of Gaussian components. Our algorithm outperforms MDN by using 4 components, while MDN struggles with only 2 components. MDN requires more components than the true distribution to achieve superior performance. Our algorithm achieves superior performance compared to the competitor on the high-dimensional double circle dataset. Using tile coding, we project the original one-dimensional x to binary features and input them into neural networks. While both algorithms converge faster, MDN converges to a worse solution. This is the first time modal regression is tested on such a high-dimensional dataset. We verify the learned error distribution by examining the empirical density of our error function. Our algorithm outperforms the competitor on the high-dimensional double circle dataset by projecting x to binary features and inputting them into neural networks. The error function appears Gaussian distributed, with a small variance when trained without noise. A synthetic dataset is generated with high-frequency targets using zero-mean Gaussian noise. The dataset is designed to be difficult to learn due to the high frequency of the function in certain intervals. Existing works indicate that the bandwidth limit of the true function affects the sample efficiency of learning algorithms. High frequency functions with large bandwidth limits are challenging to learn, as per the Shannon sampling theorem. The learning behavior is examined using a neural network with 16x16 hidden tanh units for l2 regression. The algorithm uses a neural network with 16x16 hidden tanh units for l2 regression. Extensive parameter sweep was done to optimize performance, including varying activation functions and learning rates. Implicit has one more input unit compared to the other algorithm. Evaluation curves on the testing set show the testing error as noise variance increases. The learning curve is plotted by evaluating testing error every 10k iterations, averaged over 30 random seeds. 1 million iterations were run to ensure sufficient training for both algorithms. Our algorithm achieves lower error than l2 regression without observation noise. As noise increases, algorithm performance decreases towards l2 regression. High frequency areas are more difficult to learn, but after sufficient training, errors in high and low frequency regions are reduced. Neural network representation shows performance gain. The learned NN representation in figure 6(b) shows pairwise distances between points on the domain x \u2208 [\u22122.5, 2.5]. The heatmap reveals insights into why Implicit outperformed l2 regression, highlighting areas where l2 regression fails to learn certain parts of the space. Our approach shows high resolution on high frequency areas and low resolution on low frequency areas, leveraging the representation power of the NN effectively. It performs comparably to standard regression approaches on real-world datasets. Appendices include learning curves and experiment details. The study compares linear regression and neural network models for predicting bike rental counts using the Poisson distribution. Results are averaged over 5 runs with RMSE and MAE reported. The neural network model outperforms linear regression on the bike sharing dataset. The study compares linear regression and neural network models for predicting bike rental counts using the Poisson distribution. In the case of using linear function approximator, LinearPoisson outperforms LinearReg. However, in a deep learning setting, NNPoisson performs worse than regular l2 regression. The algorithm shows slightly better performance without assumptions on the conditional distribution. The dataset for predicting a song's release year using audio features is treated as a regular regression dataset. The algorithm's performance is shown in Table 2. The paper introduces an implicit function learning approach for modal regression, showing competitive performance on real-world datasets with different target distributions. Future directions include establishing connections to KDE-based modal regression methods for finite sample analysis. The implicit function learning algorithm may overfit to noise and regularization techniques like random dropout can be used for noisy data. In an online learning setting, efficiency in prediction is important, and ideas from reinforcement learning can be borrowed. Alternative constraints on the Jacobian should be investigated instead of restricting diagonal values to -1. The appendix contains additional experimental results for reproducible research. The curr_chunk discusses the use of multi-value function prediction in inverse problems, presenting results on a classical inverse function domain. The learning dataset includes 80k training examples with noise. Implementation details for reproducing results are provided, based on Python 3.3.6 and Tensorflow 1.11.0. Algorithms are trained using Adam optimizer with mini-batch size 128 and Xavier initialization for neural networks. The curr_chunk discusses parameter settings and dataset generation for an implicit function learning algorithm. Parameters are chosen based on testing error, and datasets like circle and double circle are generated using specific methods. High dimensional double dataset is also explained. Tile coding software is referenced for further information. The setting for tile coding used to generate features includes a memory size of 128, 8 tiles, and 4 tilings. The neural network size remains the same as in the low-dimensional case. For the mixture density network (MDN), tanh hidden layers and varying mixture components are used. Learning rates are swept over and the best ones are chosen for single and double circle datasets. The dataset is generated by sampling x values and computing targets based on specific equations. Optimization is done for both l2 regression and the algorithm. The best parameters are chosen for l2 regression and the algorithm, with learning rates of 0.01 and 0.001 respectively. The performance difference is verified with a learning curve at a rate of 0.001. The bike sharing and song year datasets information is presented in figures 10 and 11 respectively. The two datasets have different target distributions. Using 64x64 tanh hidden units and sweeping over learning rates from 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001, tanh units work better than relu for l2 regression. The contributor suggests using the last 51630 as a testing set, with performance similar to random split."
