    "content": "The Act titled \"Community Disaster Loan Equity Act of 2005\" is referred to as the \"Short Title.\" It includes findings in Section 2. Congress finds that major disasters, including natural disasters and those caused by terrorist acts, lead to economic decline and reduced tax collections by State and local governments in affected areas. A report by the Government Accountability Office confirmed significant tax revenue losses in New York City and the State of New York following the 2001 terrorist attack. The impact of Hurricane Katrina on State and local tax revenues is also noted. The impact of Hurricane Katrina on State and local tax revenues is believed to be extensive. The President may provide loans to local governments under the community disaster loan program if they suffer substantial revenue losses due to a major disaster. Repayment of the loan may be canceled if post-disaster revenues are insufficient to meet the government's operating budget. The Community Disaster Loan program provides financial assistance to local governments facing revenue losses and expenses after a major disaster. Loans may be forgiven if post-disaster revenues are insufficient to cover the operating budget. The program has a $5,000,000 limit for loans related to major disasters, established by the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000. The $5,000,000 limitation for loans under the Community Disaster Loan program is seen as unfair for heavily populated areas like New York City and areas severely affected by disasters like Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana. This limitation hinders the program's objective of providing meaningful assistance to local governments recovering from major disasters. In October 2005, the Mayor of New Orleans announced layoffs of 3,000 city employees due to reduced tax revenues after Hurricane Katrina. SEC. 3. COMMUNITY DISASTER LOANS. Section 417 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act is amended to include State or local government eligibility. The amount for disaster relief assistance is now based on need and shall not exceed $5,000,000. Additionally, a provision for Incidents of National Significance is added, allowing for loans to States or local governments facing substantial revenue loss due to a major disaster deemed as such by the President. The amendment to Section 417 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act allows for loans to States or local governments facing substantial revenue loss due to a major disaster of national significance, as defined in the national response plan. The amendments apply to major disasters occurring on or after August 24, 2005."
