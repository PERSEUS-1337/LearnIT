Each fiscal year, agencies must identify and describe all programs, determine administrative expenses and service expenditures, estimate the number of clients and beneficiaries served, and estimate the number of employees administering each program.

This information can be sourced from the catalog of domestic and international assistance programs. The head of each agency must publish a report on the official website containing information on program performance reviews, improper payment rates, and estimated amounts of improper payments for each program that makes payments. The report must include information on improper payments, unspent program funds, and recommendations to consolidate, eliminate waste, and terminate unnecessary programs.
