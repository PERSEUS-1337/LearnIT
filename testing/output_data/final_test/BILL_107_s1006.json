    "content": "The Act titled \"Renewable Fuels for Energy Security Act of 2001\" mandates renewable content in motor vehicle fuel. The Act \"Renewable Fuels for Energy Security Act of 2001\" mandates the use of biodiesel, biogas, and biomass derived from renewable sources like vegetable oils, animal fats, landfill gas, sewage waste, feedlots, and decaying organic material for compression-ignition engines. The term \"biomass\" includes dedicated energy crops, wood, plants, grasses, agricultural residues, fibers, animal waste, municipal solid waste, and other waste. Biomass ethanol is ethanol derived from biomass. Renewable fuel includes biodiesel, ethanol, liquid fuel from biomass, and biogas. The Renewable Fuel Program requires motor vehicle fuel to contain a quantity of renewable fuel, such as biomass ethanol or biogas, to reduce fossil fuel usage. The Secretary of Energy determines the gasoline-equivalent gallons needed to meet the applicable percentage for each 6-month period. The applicable percentage for a 6-month period of a calendar year is determined according to a table, unless modified. The applicable percentage of renewable fuel for calendar years 2002 to 2012 is as follows: 0.8, 0.9, 1.1, 1.3, 1.5, 1.7, 2.0, 2.3, 2.6, 3.0, and 3.42. The applicable percentage of renewable fuel for calendar years 2012 to 2016 and thereafter is as follows: 3.42, 3.84, 4.24, 4.63, and 5.00. Adjustments may be made by the Secretary in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture based on State petitions. The calendar year may have inadequate domestic supply or distribution capacity in the State to meet the specified percentage. States must submit a petition for adjustment by September 1 of the preceding year, and the Secretary will approve or deny it before the calendar year begins. Additionally, a credit program must be established within 270 days after a certain date. The Secretary must establish a credit program within 270 days after a certain date. This program allows for the generation, use, and expiration of credits by those refining, blending, or importing motor vehicle fuel with a higher quantity of renewable fuel than required. Credits can be used, held, or transferred for compliance purposes and expire after 2 years. The regulations allow refiners, blenders, or importers to enter agreements to generate or purchase credits if unable to meet requirements. They may also be required to conduct tests and submit reports for compliance with fuel composition. The regulations allow for penalties to be imposed on individuals or entities that fail to comply with fuel composition requirements, with a maximum penalty of $25,000 per day of non-compliance plus the economic benefit gained. Compliance with regulations may also involve submitting periodic reports to the Secretary. Enforcement of regulations may result in civil action by the Secretary for non-compliance, including injunctions and other relief. Each day of non-compliance with averaging period regulations constitutes a separate failure."
