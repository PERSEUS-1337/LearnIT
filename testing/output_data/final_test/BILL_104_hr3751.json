    "content": "The Act titled \"Managed Care Bill of Rights for Consumers Act of 1996\" outlines requirements for managed care plans. The Managed Care Bill of Rights for Consumers Act of 1996 mandates that managed care plans must cover services from specialists not contracted with the plan if the plan lacks a specialist for a specific condition. Additionally, enrollees can continue treatment from a specialist without pre-authorization if referred by a primary care physician. The Managed Care Bill of Rights for Consumers Act of 1996 allows enrollees to receive services from specialists not contracted with the plan if referred by a primary care physician. Emergency services must be covered without prior authorization, regardless of provider contracts. Additionally, plans must provide translation and bilingual resources if 5% of enrollees in an area belong to a single ethnic-minority group. The Managed Care Bill of Rights for Consumers Act of 1996 requires managed care plans to provide translation services for enrollees who are members of an ethnic-minority group that speaks English as a second language. Plans are also prohibited from offering financial incentives to physicians to limit necessary services. The determination of medically necessary treatment can only be made by licensed professionals. A managed care plan must determine and pay for medically necessary services as determined by licensed health care practitioners. Plans are required to provide services in areas with medically underserved populations. A managed care plan must provide services in areas with medically underserved populations, ensuring a minimum number of doctors per enrollee, disclosing financial arrangements, guaranteeing geographical accessibility of services, and offering a meaningful choice of providers. A managed care plan must offer enrollees a choice of at least three providers in each category based on their health needs, allow them to seek care from out-of-network providers, and ensure confidentiality of collected information. The Health Care Financing Administration must establish grievance procedures for enrollees of managed care plans within 90 days of the Act's enactment, ensuring confidentiality of collected information. SEC. 3. ENFORCEMENT. Any entity offering a managed care plan that violates section 2 will face civil money penalties determined by the Secretary. The provisions of the Social Security Act will apply to these penalties. SEC. 4. REGULATIONS. The Secretary will create necessary regulations for this Act. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. The term \"area\" refers to the local health-service area in a managed care plan. The term \"emergency department\" includes trauma centers in hospitals meeting specific criteria. An \"emergency medical condition\" is a sudden onset medical condition with severe symptoms. Emergency services refer to health care items and services provided in a hospital's emergency department, including ancillary services necessary to evaluate and treat a sudden onset medical condition with severe symptoms until it is stabilized. The condition must be of sufficient severity that a layperson would reasonably expect serious health jeopardy, impairment to bodily functions, or dysfunction of any bodily organ without immediate medical attention. The curr_chunk defines terms related to healthcare, such as licensed health care practitioner, managed care plan, and medically underserved population. The curr_chunk defines terms related to healthcare, such as participating physician, Secretary of Health and Human Services, and stabilized emergency medical condition. The provisions of this Act will apply to managed care plans offered or renewed 90 days after the enactment date."
