    "content": "Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section called \"PART L--RESOURCE STAFF FOR STUDENTS\" with a new finding under section 10993. Congress finds that there is a significant need for more mental health professionals in schools to support students, as the current ratio of students to counselors is far above the recommended level. Many children requiring mental health services do not receive the help they need, and existing counselors are overwhelmed with administrative tasks. Student populations are expected to grow significantly over the next few years, leading to a high demand for school-based services. More than 100,000 new dedicated resource staff for students will be needed to increase student-to-staff service availability. Federal support for reducing the student-to-staff ratio is crucial as it can lead to reduced violence and substance abuse, as well as improvements in students' academic achievement. The purpose of this part is to recruit, train, and hire 100,000 school-based resource staff to work with students in grades 6-12 to reduce student-to-counseling ratios, address mental and emotional needs, and support school staff in early intervention and identifying warning signs of violence and mental health needs. The Student Resource Staff Program aims to recruit, train, and hire 100,000 school-based resource staff to support students in grades 6-12 by reducing student-to-counseling ratios, addressing mental and emotional needs, and assisting in early intervention for identifying warning signs of violence and mental health needs. The Secretary will award grants to establish or expand resource staff for students' needs, allocating funds based on the population under 18 in each state. Grants will be awarded for up to three years, and local educational agencies must submit applications describing their secondary public schools. The program description must include the targeted secondary public school population, their specific needs, available counseling resources, planned activities and services, evaluation methods, and qualified personnel. The program must be developed and administered by qualified personnel. Funds should supplement non-Federal sources and not replace them. Grants are for student resource staff programs that comply with the purpose under section 10994. A resource staff member must have mental health competence and training to provide services to children and adolescents in a school setting. Qualified personnel for student resource staff programs in schools must have state licensure or certification in mental health, national certification in mental health, a master's degree in school counseling, or 60 graduate semester hours in school psychology with supervised internship experience. The text chunk discusses the qualifications required for student resource staff programs in schools, including the need for state licensure or certification in mental health, a master's degree in school counseling, or 60 graduate semester hours in school psychology with supervised internship experience. Additionally, there is authorization of appropriations for funding these programs in the amount of $3.5 billion for fiscal year 2000, decreasing to $2.8 billion for fiscal years 2002-2004."
