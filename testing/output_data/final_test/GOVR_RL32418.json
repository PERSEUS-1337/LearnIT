    "content": "The report provides background information on the Virginia-class nuclear-powered attack submarine program, with a proposed FY2020 budget of $9.9 billion for procurement. Congressional decisions on Virginia-class boats could impact Navy capabilities, funding, and the shipbuilding industrial base. The Navy's Columbia class ballistic missile submarine program is discussed in a separate report. The U.S. Navy operates three types of submarines\u2014nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs), nuclear-powered cruise missile and special operations forces (SOF) submarines (SSGNs), and nuclear-powered attack submarines (SSNs) capable of various missions including covert intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, mine warfare, and anti-submarine warfare. During the Cold War, U.S. SSNs focused on anti-submarine warfare against Soviet submarines, with covert ISR and SOF operations also important. Post-Cold War, SSNs shifted focus to other missions but now prioritize ASW against Russian and Chinese submarines due to renewed great power competition. The Navy aims for a 355-ship fleet, including 66 SSNs, with historical force-level goals outlined since the Reagan Administration. During the 1980s, the SSN force had over 90 boats as part of a plan for a 600-ship Navy, including 100 SSNs. By FY2018, there were 51 SSNs in service, including 31 Los Angeles-class, 3 Seawolf-class, and 17 Virginia-class boats. The Los Angeles-class submarines, procured between FY1970 and FY1990, are equipped with torpedo tubes and can carry torpedoes or Tomahawk cruise missiles. The final 31 boats in the class have additional vertical launch system tubes for Tomahawk missiles. The Seawolf class submarines were originally intended to include about 30 boats, but procurement was stopped after three boats due to changes in military requirements and defense spending levels. The three Seawolf-class submarines are the Seawolf (SSN-21), the Connecticut (SSN-22), and the Jimmy Carter (SSN-23). SSN-21 and SSN-22 entered service in 1997 and 1998, respectively, while SSN-23 entered service in 2005. The Seawolf-class submarines, including SSN-23, entered service in 2005. They are larger than Los Angeles-class boats and equipped with eight torpedo tubes. The Virginia-class submarines are designed to be more cost-effective and incorporate newer technologies, with recent procurement costs at $2.8 billion each. The Virginia-class submarines have an estimated unit procurement cost of $3.2 billion. The first boat entered service in October 2004. Annual numbers of Virginia-class boats procured from FY1998 to FY2019 are shown in Table 1, with plans for procurement in FY2020-FY2024. The Navy added a third boat to the FY2020 budget request, which will be constructed on a schedule similar to a boat procured in FY2023. The Block V boats for FY2019-FY2023 are being procured under a multiyear procurement contract. The Block V Virginia-class submarines are being procured under a multiyear procurement contract, continuing a trend from previous MYP contracts for Block IV, Block III, and Block II boats. The Block I boats were procured under a block buy contract. Virginia-class boats are built by General Dynamics' Electric Boat Division in Groton, CT, and Quonset Point, RI. The arrangement for jointly building Virginia-class submarines was proposed by General Dynamics' Electric Boat Division (GD/EB) and Huntington Ingalls Industries' Newport News Shipbuilding (HII/NNS) in 1997. The aim is to minimize costs by building the submarines at a low annual rate in two shipyards while preserving key construction skills. GD/EB and HII/NNS each build certain parts of the submarines, taking turns building reactor compartments and performing final assembly. This has resulted in a roughly 50-50 division of work between the two shipyards. The Navy's Submarine Unified Build Strategy (SUBS) involves joint construction of Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines at GD/EB and HII/NNS, with most work at GD/EB. HII/NNS will receive a larger share of work for the Virginia-class attack submarine program. The Navy aims to reduce procurement costs to allow for the purchase of two Virginia-class submarines in FY2012 for $4.0 billion. The Navy aimed to reduce procurement costs for the Virginia-class attack submarine program to $4.0 billion for two submarines in FY2012. The program received recognition for successful acquisition, despite initial cost growth challenges. The Virginia-class attack submarine program faced challenges in meeting scheduled delivery times as it transitions to producing VPM-equipped boats. This resulted in months-long delays in building boats compared to targeted delivery dates. The Navy plans to build future Virginia-class boats with the Virginia Payload Module. The Virginia-class attack submarine program is transitioning to building boats with the Virginia Payload Module (VPM), which includes additional vertical launch tubes for storing and launching Tomahawk missiles or other payloads. The VPM could increase the total number of torpedo-sized weapons carried by the Virginia class design by about 76%. This is intended to compensate for the loss of submarine force weapon-carrying capacity with the retirement of Navy's Ohio-class submarines. The Navy's Virginia-class submarines are being equipped with Virginia Payload Modules (VPM) to increase their weapon-carrying capacity. Each submarine can carry up to 154 vertically launched Tomahawk missiles, totaling 616 for four boats. The estimated costs for Virginia-class boats with VPMs are around $3.2 billion, while those without are $2.8 billion. The Navy is also making acoustic and design improvements to the Virginia-class submarines. The Navy is enhancing the Virginia-class submarines with Virginia Payload Modules (VPM) to maintain superiority over Russian and Chinese submarines. The estimated combined procurement cost for three Virginia-class boats in FY2020 is $9.3 billion. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget includes funding for completing the boats' procurement cost, as well as future procurement and component funding under the FY2019-FY2023 MYP contract. The U.S. Navy is requesting an additional $9.9 billion for the procurement of submarines in FY2020, with General Dynamics/Electric Boat and Huntington Ingalls Industries/Newport News Shipbuilding being the only two shipyards capable of building nuclear-powered ships. The submarine construction industrial base includes numerous supplier firms and laboratories across multiple states, with much of the material being procured from sole-source suppliers. The Navy's nuclear-powered aircraft carrier construction program provides stabilizing work for nuclear-propulsion component suppliers. A carrier nuclear propulsion plant is equivalent to five submarine propulsion plants in terms of work. The Navy's projection shows that the FY2020 30-year shipbuilding plan would achieve the Navy's 66-boat SSN force-level goal by FY2048, with a projected valley in the number of SSNs from the mid-2020s through the early 2030s. The projected valley in SSN force levels from the mid-2020s through the early 2030s is a concern due to a small number of SSNs procured in the 1990s. This could lead to operational strain and weakened deterrence against adversaries like China. The Navy's FY2020 budget proposes extending the service life of older Los Angeles class submarines to mitigate this issue. The Navy plans to refuel and extend the service life of up to five more Los Angeles-class SSNs beyond FY2024. Maintenance backlogs at Navy shipyards have caused deployment delays for SSNs, putting pressure on available submarines. A GAO report highlighted significant maintenance delays and costs for attack submarines between FY2008 and FY2018. Between fiscal year 2008 and 2018, attack submarines have faced 10,363 days of idle time and maintenance delays due to shipyard delays. The Navy spent over $1.5 billion to support idle submarines. Workforce shortages and facility needs are being addressed by the Navy. The Navy has not effectively allocated maintenance periods between public and private shipyards, leading to increasing attack submarine idle time. Leveraging private shipyard capacity could help mitigate maintenance delays, but a comprehensive business case analysis is needed. Navy leadership acknowledges the need to be more proactive in utilizing private shipyard repair capacity to address these challenges. The Navy faces challenges with submarine maintenance backlog, particularly impacting Los Angeles class submarines. Private shipyards have underutilized capacity, leading to operational availability issues. The House Appropriations Committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to address these issues within 90 days. The Navy is directed to submit a comprehensive five-year submarine maintenance plan to Congress within 90 days, utilizing both public and private nuclear-capable shipyards. The plan should aim to provide predictable maintenance availabilities and estimate potential cost savings. The Navy has updated the initial plan to incorporate data from the President's FY 2020 budget. In the post-Cold War and post 9/11 era, defense strategies have been re-postured with reductions in maintenance capacity, increased Operational Tempo, and budget uncertainties affecting the submarine fleet. The root cause of submarine idle time is public shipyard capacity not keeping pace with maintenance requirements, as highlighted in a recent Government Accountability Office report. The workload backlog at public shipyards led to late deliveries of attack submarines, impacting maintenance capacity. The Navy hired over 20,600 workers from FY 2013 to FY 2018 to address the imbalance, but 56 percent of the workforce has less than five years of experience, requiring increased training investment. The Navy has addressed the imbalance in workforce experience by hiring over 20,600 workers from FY 2013 to FY 2018. However, 56 percent of the workforce has less than five years of experience, necessitating a greater investment in training. To improve on-time delivery of maintenance availabilities, the Navy has rescheduled availability inductions to align with the shipyards' capacity, resulting in some submarine maintenance backlog and idle time accumulation. Additionally, the Navy has outsourced submarine maintenance availabilities to private shipyards to balance workload at public shipyards. The Navy is taking actions to improve submarine operational availability by outsourcing maintenance to private shipyards. Congress is considering whether to approve Navy's funding requests for the Virginia-class program in FY2020. Submarine idle time is expected to be eliminated by the end of FY 2023. The Navy is requesting funding for a third Virginia-class boat in FY2020, which was added to the budget request during the FY2020 planning cycle. This boat has not received prior-year advance procurement funding and would be constructed on a schedule similar to a boat procured in FY2023. The Navy is proposing full funding for this procurement, similar to past practices for nuclear-powered ships. The Navy is considering providing advance procurement (AP) funding for a third Virginia-class boat in FY2020-FY2022, followed by full funding in FY2023. Supporters argue that this approach could free up FY2020 funding for other programs like the LPD-17 Flight II amphibious ship program or Navy aircraft acquisition. Supporters of fully funding a third Virginia-class boat in FY2020 argue that it would reduce funding requirements for the Virginia-class program in FY2021-FY2023, potentially freeing up more funding for other DOD programs. They also believe it would demonstrate resolve to adversaries like China and address industrial-base challenges of building both Columbia-class and Virginia-class boats. The Navy faces challenges in building both Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines and Virginia-class attack submarines simultaneously, raising concerns about potential industrial base bottlenecks. The ability to meet procurement rates for both types of submarines is in question due to reported challenges faced by shipyards and suppliers in meeting delivery schedules. The Virginia-class program is transitioning to producing two VPM-equipped boats per year. Congress is concerned about technical risks in the design of the Block V version. The Navy plans to award a multiyear contract for 10 Block V submarines with acoustic improvements and VPM starting with the second submarine. The design of Block V submarines will differ from Block IV by approximately 20 percent. The Block V submarines will differ from Block IV by approximately 20 percent, with 70 percent of the changes considered major. The program office plans to complete basic and functional designs for VPM by construction start, but the shipbuilder is behind schedule in completing detail design work. The Navy and shipbuilder will need to balance staffing levels for the remaining Block V design work with efforts for the new Columbia class ballistic missile submarine. The construction of Block V and the Columbia class ballistic missile submarine will coincide in fiscal year 2021, requiring the Navy and shipbuilder to manage resources. Vendor quality issues have caused a delay in the schedule for the payload tubes for the first two submarines with VPM. The Block V effort is part of the SSN 774 major defense acquisition program, overseen by the Navy since 2015. The Navy plans to accelerate tube manufacturing with a second vendor to recover time, but this may increase program costs. The Navy continues oversight of the Block V program, addressing issues such as hull coating problems, defective parts in Virginia-class boats, and congressional actions on FY2020 funding. Additionally, concerns were raised in a 2018 report from DOD's Director, Operational Test and Evaluation regarding Virginia-class program issues. Since the Reagan Administration, submarine force-level goals have evolved, with plans for a 600-ship Navy including 100 SSNs. The George H. W. Bush Administration initially aimed for 80 SSNs but later reduced the goal to 55 boats by 2012. The Clinton Administration set a goal of 45 to 55 SSNs as part of its defense policy reviews. The Clinton Administration set a goal of 55 SSNs for the Navy, with a total of about 310 ships. A Joint Chiefs of Staff study concluded that having 55 SSNs by 2015 and 62 by 2025 would be necessary to meet war fighting requirements and counter technological threats. The 1999 JCS study concluded that having 68 SSNs in 2015 and 76 in 2025 would meet war fighting requirements and counter technological threats. The figures were not officially adopted as DOD force-level goals, but the 2001 QDR revalidated the need for a fleet of about 310 ships, including 55 SSNs. The report emphasized the importance of restructuring and reorganizing as DOD's transformation effort matures. In 2003-2004, DOD and the Navy conducted studies on undersea warfare requirements. A Navy study in 2004 recommended reducing attack submarine force levels to as few as 37 boats, with options for homeporting submarines at Guam and using satellites and UUVs for ISR missions. A 2005 Navy report projected force levels for FY2035, with alternatives for a 260-ship fleet with 37 SSNs or a 325-ship fleet with 41 SSNs. A 2005 DOD study called for maintaining a force of 45 to 50 attack submarines. The Navy proposed maintaining a fleet of 313 ships in 2006, including 48 SSNs. In December 2016, they aimed for 355 ships, including 66 SSNs. Funding options for SSNs include two years of advance procurement (AP) funding followed by full funding or one year of AP funding followed by full funding. The Navy proposed maintaining a fleet of 313 ships in 2006, including 48 SSNs. In December 2016, they aimed for 355 ships, including 66 SSNs. Funding options for SSNs include two years of advance procurement (AP) funding followed by full funding or one year of AP funding followed by full funding. Navy testimony in 2007 suggested that additional SSNs could not be procured until FY2010 at the earliest. The Navy proposed maintaining a fleet of 313 ships in 2006, including 48 SSNs. In December 2016, they aimed for 355 ships, including 66 SSNs. Funding options for SSNs include two years of advance procurement (AP) funding followed by full funding or one year of AP funding followed by full funding. Navy testimony in 2007 suggested that additional SSNs could be procured in FY2009 and/or FY2010 without prior-year AP funding. Congress has used single-year full funding in the past to procure nuclear-powered ships. Under the Administration's proposed FY1988 budget, CVNs 74 and 75 were to be procured in FY1990 and FY1993, respectively. However, Congress decided to accelerate the procurement of both ships to FY1988 and fully funded them that year at a combined cost of $6.325 billion. The ships entered service in 1995 and 1998. The spare set of Nimitz-class reactor components in FY1980 and FY1988 allowed for quicker construction but Congress's constitutional authority to appropriate funding was what enabled single-year full funding for carriers. Funding options for SSNs include two years of advance procurement (AP) funding followed by full funding or one year of AP funding followed by full funding. Congress has used single-year full funding in the past to procure nuclear-powered ships. The process of building a SSN would still take several years, with advance work on components and construction work on the ship itself. If there is no AP funding, the outlay rate could be slower, and the ship would enter service later than normal. Congress has previously funded ships with the knowledge that construction would start later, resulting in a longer time to enter service. The Navy conducted a study in 2006 to address the projected decrease in SSN force levels in the 2020s and 2030s. The study projected a decrease to 40 boats before recovering to 48 by the early 2030s. The daily deployment requirement for SSNs is 10, with a peak wartime demand of 35 deployed SSNs. The Navy plans to increase the SSN force by deploying 35 SSNs within a certain timeframe. This includes 10 SSNs deployed daily and 25 additional SSNs surged from the United States. By reducing Virginia-class shipyard construction time to 60 months, the force would bottom out at 42 boats instead of 40. Extending the service lives of 16 existing SSNs by 3 to 24 months would further increase the force to 44 boats. The total cost of extending the lives of 16 boats would be roughly $500 million in constant FY2005 dollars. The resulting force that bottoms out at 44 boats could meet the 10.0 requirement for day-to-day deployed SSNs throughout the 2020-2033 period if about 40 SSN deployments in the 2025-2032 period were lengthened from six months to seven months. However, the force could not meet the peak projected wartime demand of 35 SSNs deployed within a certain timeframe, generating a total deployment of 32 SSNs instead. Lengthening SSN deployments would not improve the force's capabilities. Lengthening SSN deployments from six months to seven months would not improve the force's ability to meet the peak projected wartime demand of about 35 SSNs deployed within a certain amount of time. To meet the 35-boat figure, an additional four SSNs beyond those planned by the Navy would need to be procured. Procuring one to four additional SSNs could reduce the number of seven-month deployments required to meet the day-to-day deployed SSNs requirement during the period 2025-2032. The Navy added caveats to the results of procuring additional SSNs, stating that the requirement for deployed SSNs could change in the future. The peak wartime demand of 35 SSNs is a projection that may vary in subsequent analyses. Identifying 19 SSNs for service life extension is based on current evaluations, but their suitability may change if their condition worsens in the future. The Navy's projection for extending the service life of submarines may be impacted if conditions change, leading to potential reductions in extension time or even shortening service lives. Rare events like accidents could also force submarines out of service early. Additionally, seven-month deployments could affect retention rates for submarine personnel."
