    "content": "This report provides Congress with official data on transfers of conventional arms to developing nations by major suppliers from 2004 to 2011, including worldwide transactions. It aims to help Congress identify supplier-purchaser relationships in weapons acquisitions and assess how the international weapons trade may impact U.S. national interests. Maintaining regional stability and ensuring allies' security have long been key elements of U.S. foreign policy. The report provides Congress with data on arms transfers to developing nations by major suppliers, helping evaluate U.S. foreign policy decisions regarding arms sales and control arrangements. It focuses on arms transfers to regions with high potential for conflicts and where most of the conventional arms trade occurs. The conventional arms trade during the Cold War was used as a foreign policy tool by the United States and the Soviet Union to support friendly states. Post-Cold War, U.S. arms transfer policy focuses on enhancing the capabilities of allied nations to address regional security threats. Global patterns of arms transfers have shifted, with relationships between suppliers and recipients adapting to changing circumstances. During the period of 2004-2011, arms sales by foreign suppliers have shifted towards economic considerations rather than foreign policy objectives. Developing nations remain the primary focus of arms sales, accounting for a significant percentage of international agreements and deliveries. In 2011, arms deliveries to developing nations accounted for 63.3% of the global value, with data from 2004-2011 superseding previous editions. The data are in U.S. dollars, adjusted for inflation, excluding U.S. commercial arms exports and transfers to subnational groups. In 2011, global arms transfer agreements reached $85.3 billion, a significant increase from $44.5 billion in 2010. The United States led worldwide agreements with $66.3 billion, accounting for 77.7% of all agreements. In 2011, global arms transfer agreements reached $85.3 billion, with the United States leading worldwide agreements at $66.3 billion, accounting for 77.7% of all agreements. Russia ranked second with $4.8 billion in agreements, down from $8.9 billion in 2010. The United States and Russia collectively made agreements valued at over $71 billion, representing 83.3% of all international arms transfer agreements. Developing world nations accounted for 79.2% of all arms transfer agreements globally in 2008-2011, compared to 66.7% in 2004-2007. In 2011, the United States led global arms deliveries with nearly $16.2 billion, followed by Russia at $8.7 billion and the United Kingdom at $3 billion. These top three suppliers collectively delivered 62.9% of all arms worldwide, totaling $27.9 billion. The total value of international arms deliveries in 2011 was approximately $44.3 billion, showing an increase from the previous year. In 2011, global arms deliveries totaled $44.3 billion, an increase from the previous year. Developing nations accounted for 59.5% of all international arms deliveries, with a total value of $167 billion from 2008-2011. Worldwide weapons orders increased significantly in 2011 to $85.3 billion, with the United States leading with $66.3 billion in agreements. In 2011, global arms deliveries increased to $44.3 billion. The U.S. dominated the market with $66.3 billion in agreements, representing 77.7% market share. Other major suppliers saw declines, except for France whose agreements rose to $4.4 billion. Russia experienced a significant decline in agreements, dropping to $4.8 billion. The collective market share of major West European suppliers fell from 12.2% to 7.2%. The global arms market saw a significant increase in 2011, with the U.S. dominating with $66.3 billion in agreements. Other major suppliers, including France, experienced declines. The Eurozone financial crisis and slow international recovery have limited defense purchases, leading many nations to defer or limit new major weapons systems. Some have focused on upgrades and training services instead. Orders for weapons upgrades and support services remain lucrative for weapons suppliers despite the reduction in demand for major weapons systems. Competition among sellers has intensified as new arms sales have become more challenging to secure. Weapons-exporting nations are targeting both traditional and new clients to sustain revenue in a stagnating market. Competition among arms suppliers has intensified as they face the challenge of providing competitive weapons in type and price. To overcome limited defense budgets in developing nations, suppliers are offering flexible financing options and guarantees of counter-trade, co-production, and licensed production in contracts to secure new orders. Intense competition is expected between European nations, the United States, and consortia for arms sales to affluent states, with recent examples including combat aircraft sales to the Persian Gulf states. The competition for arms sales to oil-rich Persian Gulf states and India is fierce, with developing nations demanding cost offsets, advanced technology transfers, and domestic production options in their contracts. European weapons suppliers rely on sales to wealthy developing nations in the Near East and Asia to support their domestic weapons development programs. Developed nations are limiting arms purchases from other developed nations to protect their national military industrial bases. Several major arms suppliers are emphasizing joint production of weapons systems with other developed nations to share costs and preserve productive capacity. Some nations focus on niche weapons categories where they have specialized production capabilities. Competition for weapons contracts has led to consolidation of domestic defense industries in key weapons-producing nations. Developing nations with significant financial assets continue to launch costly weapons-procurement programs despite financial constraints. The increase in oil prices since 2008 has benefited major oil-producing states in funding arms purchases, while causing economic difficulties for oil-consuming states. Despite economic volatility, some nations in the Near East and Asia have resumed large weapons purchases, notably Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and India. Developing nations in these regions base their decisions on the strength of their economies when proceeding with major arms acquisitions. In Latin America and Africa, developing nations are modernizing their military forces through major arms purchases. Limited financial resources force these countries to be selective in their weapons acquisitions. The value of arms transfer agreements with developing nations in 2011 was $71.5 billion, a significant increase from previous years. In 2011, arms transfer agreements with developing nations totaled $71.5 billion, a substantial increase from 2010. The United States and Russia dominated the arms market in the developing world from 2008 to 2011, making 69.5% of all agreements during this period. During 2008-2011, the United States and Russia were the top arms suppliers to developing nations, with the United States leading for five out of eight years. Russia was the top supplier from 2004-2007, while France and the United Kingdom also had significant shares in arms transfer agreements. Russia has been a major arms supplier to key purchasers in the developing world, with significant agreements with India, clients in the Near East and Southeast Asia, and a focus on Venezuela in Latin America. The country has adopted flexible payment arrangements, including forgiving debts to secure deals. Russia has been forgiving debts to secure arms deals with prospective clients, while also improving follow-on support services for its weaponry. France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and the United States have all been successful in selling arms to developing countries, with each country specializing in different types of weapon systems. Despite competition from other major arms suppliers, the United States is likely to remain the primary supplier to key developing world nations, especially those capable of purchasing new weapons. Since the Cold War, the US has built a large and diverse client base for arms equipment globally, regularly securing arms agreements and providing upgrades, spare parts, and support services to previous clients. This consistent business flow, even without major new agreements, positions the US as a reliable supplier for new-generation military equipment to traditional buyers. The value of arms transfer agreements with developing nations increased from 2004 to 2011, reaching a peak of $71.5 billion. Sales to more affluent developing nations, especially key oil-producing states in the Persian Gulf, drove this increase, with the US enhancing the militaries of its key partners in the region. European and non-European suppliers, including China, have also secured some agreements in recent years. Non-European suppliers, including China, have secured agreements with developing nations, but at lower levels compared to major weapons suppliers. They have made significant arms deals like missile sales and light combat systems. These suppliers often sell older or less-advanced equipment, focusing on small arms and light weapons rather than major weapons systems. While their aggregated agreement values appear larger, individually, their annual arms transfer values are comparatively low. Most of these suppliers do not rank high in the value of their arms agreements and deliveries. In 2011, the United States saw a significant increase in the value of arms transfer agreements with developing nations, reaching $56.3 billion. The U.S. market share also rose to 78.7%, with major orders coming from the Near East and Asia, particularly from Saudi Arabia. Other non-European suppliers, like China, have secured agreements with developing nations but at lower levels compared to major weapons suppliers. In 2011, the United States secured high-value arms agreements with countries in the Near East and Asia, including Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E., Oman, India, and Taiwan. The total arms agreement reached $56.3 billion, reflecting the U.S. advantage in defense support arrangements globally. The agreements involved sales, upgrades, and support services for a variety of weapon systems. The United States secured high-value arms agreements in 2011 with countries in the Near East and Asia, including Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E., Oman, India, and Taiwan. The agreements involved sales, upgrades, and support services for a variety of weapon systems, with significant costs associated. The agreements with Saudi Arabia included providing new F-15SA fighter aircraft, upgrading existing fleet, Apache and Blackhawk helicopters, and long-term logistics support for over $29 billion. Additionally, agreements with the U.A.E. included THAAD System Fire Units and Chinook helicopters, and with Oman for F-16 fighter aircraft. In 2011, the United States secured high-value arms agreements with countries in the Near East and Asia, including Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E., Oman, India, and Taiwan. The agreements involved sales, upgrades, and support services for various weapon systems, with significant costs associated. The total value of Russia's arms transfer agreements with developing nations in 2011 was $4.1 billion, a decrease from $7.7 billion in 2010, placing Russia second in such agreements with the developing world. Russia's arms transfer agreements with developing nations declined significantly from 23.5% in 2010 to 5.7% in 2011. Despite this decrease, Russia remained a leading supplier of arms to developing countries, making nearly $31.1 billion in agreements from 2008-2011. This reflects Russia's successful efforts to overcome industrial production problems after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Former Soviet client states received military aid grants and discounts on arms purchases. Russia adapted its selling practices in the developing world to regain and sustain a share in the international arms market. It offers creative financing, payment options, and licensed production agreements to sell weapons. Efforts to expand its arms customer base have had mixed results. Russia has successfully signed arms agreements with Malaysia, Vietnam, Burma, Indonesia, Venezuela, and Algeria in Southeast Asia and other developing nations. Its competitive military equipment ranges from basic to advanced, appealing to less affluent countries. Missiles and aircraft are significant exports, while naval systems lag. Limited funding for research and development hampers Russia's long-term arms sales prospects. Russia's arms development and sales programs have been important, particularly with India and China, providing sustained business for a decade. However, Russia has lagged behind other major arms suppliers in developing and producing weaponry, which may deter expansion of its arms client base. Despite this, Russia has sold major combat fighter aircraft and main battle tanks to India in the mid-1990s and continues to provide support services for these weapons systems. Russia has lost major contracts to other key weapons suppliers, threatening its long-standing supplier relationship with India. The United States has been seeking to expand its military cooperation with and arms sales to India as part of the U.S. strategic shift to the Asia-Pacific region. Russia has also sold advanced aircraft and naval systems to China, including fighter aircraft, destroyers, and submarines. China's arms acquisitions from Russia aim to enhance military capabilities in Asia and influence events in the region. U.S. policy concerns include providing appropriate military equipment to allies in Asia to counter potential threats from China. Tension exists between Russia and China over the latter's practice of reverse engineering weapons obtained from Russia. The largest arms transfer agreements Russia made in 2011 were with Syria. In 2011, Russia signed significant arms transfer agreements with Syria for 36 Yak-130 fighter/trainer aircraft and with China for 123 AL-31FN jet aircraft engines. China emerged as an arms supplier during the Iran-Iraq war, providing weaponry to both sides. China's arms sales have been regional and targeted in the developing world, averaging over $2 billion annually from 2008 to 2011. China's arms transfer agreements with developing nations peaked in 2005 and 2007 at $2.7 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively. In 2011, the total was $2.1 billion, with continuing contracts with Pakistan playing a significant role. Most of China's sales were smaller-valued deals in Asia, Africa, and the Near East, rather than major weapons systems. Chinese military equipment is generally less advanced than that from Western suppliers or Russia, limiting its appeal to developing nations with significant financial resources. China's arms sales to developing nations peaked in 2005 and 2007, totaling $2.7 billion and $2.5 billion respectively. In 2011, the total was $2.1 billion, with ongoing contracts with Pakistan being significant. China's weapons systems for export are based on designs obtained from Russia, with a focus on small arms and light weapons for states in Asia and Africa. China has also supplied missiles to countries like Iran and Pakistan. China's arms sales to developing nations have raised concerns about China's commitment to missile transfer restrictions. Chinese entities supply missile-related technology, hindering efforts to prevent proliferation of advanced missile systems. China also sells small arms and light weapons to African states, likely to enhance its international political power. China's arms sales to developing nations, especially in Africa, are seen as a way to increase its international political power and access to natural resources like oil. The United Nations has been trying to establish an Arms Trade Treaty to regulate conventional arms sales globally, but the negotiations in July 2012 failed to reach a consensus on the treaty draft. China's opposition to the Arms Trade Treaty draft raises doubts about its future success. Major European arms suppliers like France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy have provided sophisticated weapons to various countries, serving as alternative sources for nations not supplied by the United States for policy reasons. During the Cold War, NATO allies generally supported the U.S. in restricting arms sales, but post-Cold War, European countries like France prioritize national decision-making in arms sales, driven more by economic factors than foreign policy. France uses foreign military sales to fund development of new weapons for its military. The potential for policy differences between the United States and major West European supplying states over conventional weapons transfers has increased in recent years. France and Germany led an effort in 2004-2005 to lift the arms embargo on China, opposed by the United States. This episode caused tension between the U.S. and some EU members. The arms sales activities of major European suppliers will continue to be of interest to U.S. policymakers. The major West European suppliers, including France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy, saw a decrease in their share of arms transfer agreements with developing nations from 2010 to 2011. Their collective share dropped from 14.9% to 5.7%, with a total value of $4.1 billion in 2011. France was the leading supplier with $2.7 billion in agreements, while Italy had $1.1 billion. This trend is of interest to U.S. policymakers due to the potential impact on sales of advanced military equipment to countries of concern in U.S. national security policy. From 2004 to 2011, major West European suppliers like France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy were significant players in the arms market. They secured large arms agreements in specific years, with France leading in 2009 and 2005, the UK in 2007 and 2004, Germany in 2008 and 2006, and Italy in 2010. These nations strengthened their competitive positions in arms exports through government support and could produce advanced air, ground, and naval weapons systems. The major West European suppliers compete for arms sales contracts with developing nations against the United States, especially in the Persian Gulf states. The demand for U.S. weapons makes it challenging for European suppliers to secure new contracts, but they continue to make significant arms transfer agreements each year. Efforts to enhance their market share in the face of strong U.S. demand were key factors in inducing European Union member states. The European Union member states adopted a new code of conduct for defense procurement practices on November 21, 2005, at the European Defense Agency's steering board meeting. The EU aims for this code to become mandatory to promote greater cooperation within the European defense equipment sector in awarding contracts. This cooperation is expected to preserve the defense industrial bases of individual EU states, enhancing their ability to compete globally in arms sales. Some European arms companies have phased out production of certain weapons systems and are increasingly engaging in joint production. European arms suppliers are engaging in joint production ventures to sustain their defense industrial bases. They are collaborating with other European suppliers and client countries, as well as with the United States on projects like the Joint Strike Fighter. The main markets for arms are in the Near East and Asia, with Latin American and African nations being minor purchasers. The United States has focused on maintaining stability in developing regions by supporting arms sales that align with this goal. Other arms suppliers may prioritize financial gain over stability concerns, leading to differing perspectives on appropriate arms sales. Regional arms agreement data tables in the report show where various arms suppliers are focusing their attention and who their principal clients are. The Persian Gulf crisis of August 1990-February 1991 led to major arms acquisitions in the Near East, establishing the United States as the guarantor of Gulf security. Key purchasers like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the UAE increased their weapons purchases. The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates, have been purchasing advanced weapons systems due to concerns over the growing strategic threat from Iran. These purchases have focused on air, naval, and missile defense systems. Egypt and Israel have also been modernizing their military by increasing purchases of advanced weaponry, mainly from the United States. Saudi Arabia has been the primary arms purchaser in the Persian Gulf region, with total arms agreements valued at $52.1 billion from 2008 to 2011. The UAE also made substantial orders totaling $17.2 billion during the same period. During 2008-2011, the Near East region led in arms agreements with $116.6 billion, while Asia ranked second with $60.3 billion. The United States was the top arms supplier to the Near East in 2004-2007 with $16.1 billion in agreements. From 2008 to 2011, the United States dominated arms agreements in Asia with almost $92 billion, accounting for 78.9% of the region's agreements. Russia accounted for 5.2% of the agreements in the same period, totaling $6 billion. Asia is the second-largest region in the developing world for orders of conventional weaponry, with several developing nations upgrading and modernizing defense forces, leading to new conventional weapons sales in the region. Russia was the main supplier of advanced conventional weaponry to China in the mid-1990s, selling fighters, submarines, destroyers, and missiles. Russia has been a major arms supplier to China and India for over a decade, selling a variety of weapons including fighters, submarines, destroyers, and missiles. India, while historically a key customer of Russian arms, has diversified its weapons supplier base in recent years by purchasing defense systems and equipment from Israel, France, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Italy. Russia has also expanded its client base in Asia, securing aircraft orders from Malaysia, Vietnam, Burma, and Indonesia. In recent years, India has diversified its weapons suppliers, purchasing defense systems from Israel, France, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Italy. This shift in arms purchases indicates that Russia may face new competition for the Indian arms market. India eliminated Russia from a competition to supply new-generation combat fighter aircraft in 2011, with France winning the contract. Other major arms agreements in Asia include the United States selling F-16 fighter aircraft to Pakistan and Sweden selling an AWACS airborne radar system. In 2007, Pakistan contracted with China for J-17 fighter aircraft production and purchased an AWACS aircraft. In 2009, Pakistan bought J-10 fighters from China. The United States sold UH-60M Blackhawk helicopters to Taiwan in 2010 and the Patriot air defense system in 2011 for $2 billion. Asia was the second-largest developing-world arms market, with a decrease in arms transfer agreements value from 2004-2007 to 2008-2011. In the period of 2004-2007, Asia saw a significant increase in arms transfer agreements, with the United States and major West European suppliers playing a significant role. Saudi Arabia emerged as the leading arms purchaser in the developing world during 2004-2011, with India and China being major recipients of arms sales. Saudi Arabia ranked first in arms transfer agreements, totaling $52.1 billion in the period of 2008-2011, accounting for 25.1% of all agreements with developing nations. India ranked second with $21.3 billion in arms transfer agreements during the same period. These increases reflect ongoing military modernization efforts by both countries since the 1990s. India ranked second in arms transfer agreements during 2008-2011 with $21.3 billion, accounting for 10.3% of all developing-world agreements. The top 10 recipients collectively accounted for 68.2% of all agreements during this period, with Saudi Arabia leading in 2011 with $33.7 billion in agreements. In 2011, India ranked second in arms transfer agreements with $6.9 billion, while the United Arab Emirates ranked third with $4.5 billion. Saudi Arabia was the leading recipient of arms deliveries among developing world recipients in 2011, receiving $2.8 billion. India ranked second in arms deliveries with $2.7 billion, and Pakistan ranked third with $1.8 billion. Arms deliveries to the top 10 developing nation recipients were valued at $17.1 billion, accounting for 61.1% of all arms deliveries to developing nations in 2010. Weapons deliveries to developing nations are dominated by the United States, Russia, and major West European suppliers. Other European and non-European suppliers, including China, also play a significant role. Deliveries to the Near East region from 2008-2011 included tanks, APCs, combat aircraft, helicopters, and missiles from the United States and Russia. From 2008 to 2011, substantial quantities of major combat systems were delivered to the Near East region, including tanks, self-propelled guns, armored vehicles, combat aircraft, helicopters, air defense, and anti-ship missiles from various suppliers. During 2008-2011, significant combat systems like armored vehicles, combat aircraft, helicopters, air defense, and anti-ship missiles were delivered to the Near East region by major suppliers like the United States, Russia, and European countries. These systems, including aircraft platforms and naval craft, are costly and constitute a large portion of arms deliveries. Other weapon systems like anti-ship and surface-to-surface missiles also pose security threats in the region, with Russia delivering 110 anti-ship and 50 surface-to-surface missiles during this period. European suppliers delivered 50 anti-ship missiles, while non-major, non-European suppliers delivered 40 during a four-year period. Data on arms transfer agreements with developing nations by major suppliers from 2004 to 2011 are presented in tables. Delivery data reflecting sales implementation are also provided. Worldwide arms transfer agreements and deliveries from 2004 to 2011 are detailed in additional tables. Using this data for purposes beyond assessing general trends in seller/buyer activity may lead to invalid conclusions.

Table 24 shows the top 10 recipients of arms transfer agreements in 2011, based on the total current dollar values of their agreements with all suppliers. The data on arms transfers provide information on actual deliveries of military equipment to regions, showing trends in the delivery of important classes of weaponry. The tables display deliveries from major suppliers like the United States, Russia, China, and European countries to developing nations from 2004 to 2011. The data on arms transfers show trends in deliveries of military equipment to developing nations in Asia, the Near East, Latin America, and Africa. Quantitative data on weapons categories may not accurately reflect the quality or quantity of weaponry delivered. Recent conflicts suggest that weapon quality can outweigh quantity. Superior training and operational proficiency may be more crucial for successful warfare than the size of a nation's weapons inventory. Ten tables provide detailed information on deliveries. Table 30, 31, 32, 35, 36, and 37 display total dollar values for arms transfer agreements and deliveries worldwide from 2004-2011.
