    "content": "The dictionary learning problem involves modeling data as a linear combination of columns in a matrix called a dictionary, with sparse weights known as coefficients. Provable algorithms have been developed for dictionary learning, but they only guarantee recovery of the dictionary, not the coefficients. NOODL is a new approach that focuses on optimizing coefficient recovery in dictionary learning. NOODL is a Neurally plausible alternating Optimization-based Online Dictionary Learning algorithm that recovers both the dictionary and coefficients exactly at a geometric rate. It is scalable for large scale distributed implementations in neural architectures and involves simple linear and non-linear operations. Experimental evaluation confirms its effectiveness in comparison to current techniques for sparse models to avoid overfitting. Sparse linear combinations of dictionary columns are used to exploit sparsity properties, especially with overcomplete dictionaries capturing dataset richness. Dictionary learning (DL) involves learning an unknown dictionary A and sparse coefficients x from data samples y. This model extends the low-rank model by allowing each data vector to reside in a separate low-dimensional subspace, resulting in a union-of-subspace model. DL is used in signal processing and machine learning tasks such as denoising. Dictionary learning involves tasks such as denoising, image inpainting, clustering, classification, and deep learning analysis. Alternating minimization-based techniques have been successful despite the non-convexity of optimization problems. Popular heuristics include regularized least squares and greedy approaches like MOD and k-SVD. However, analyzing dictionary learning and matrix factorization models is challenging. Recent theoretical works have motivated the development of provable algorithms. Recently, provable algorithms for dictionary learning have been proposed to explain the success of alternating minimization-based techniques. While existing works focus on guarantees for dictionary recovery, it is also crucial to have guarantees on coefficient recovery for tasks like classification and clustering. Sparse approximation after dictionary recovery does not help, as errors in the dictionary degrade our ability to recover coefficient support. Existing results only guarantee recovery of sparse coefficients in a 2-norm sense when errors are non-negligible. In this work, a simple online dictionary learning algorithm is presented, motivated by a regularized least squares-based problem. The algorithm leverages the convexity of the problem with respect to the sparse coefficients to recover the dictionary using a gradient descent-based strategy. An iterative hard thresholding-based update step is used to recover the coefficients, showing promising results with an appropriate initial estimate of the dictionary and a mini-batch of data samples at each iteration. The NOODL algorithm achieves geometric convergence to true factors x and A, with exact recovery of coefficients and linear convergence properties. It is scalable and involves simple operations, making it suitable for practical applications. Major contributions include provable coefficient recovery and an IHT-based strategy for updating coefficients under the EIV model. The NOODL algorithm provides unbiased estimation of factors and linear convergence, making it suitable for machine learning applications with streaming data. Its online nature and neural implementation allow for distributed implementations in neural architectures to solve large-scale problems. The NOODL algorithm offers unbiased estimation of factors and linear convergence, suitable for machine learning with streaming data. Experimental evaluations verify its theoretical properties and compare performance with other provable DL techniques. The algorithm assumes coefficients can be recovered after dictionary retrieval, but guarantees for coefficient recovery may be limited.

(2015) propose an IHT-based coefficient update step that removes bias in dictionary estimation and avoids expensive post-processing for coefficient recovery. The initialization requires the initial estimate of the dictionary to be close to the true dictionary at each iteration, ensuring progress and accuracy in the analysis. The incoherence parameter \u00b5 measures the closeness of dictionary elements, with smaller values preferred. Coefficients are drawn from distribution class D, with support size at most k and non-zero entries being sub-Gaussian and pairwise independent. Randomness of coefficients is crucial for finite sample analysis of convergence. The randomness of coefficients is essential for finite sample analysis of convergence. Support recovery of sparse coefficients requires conditions on the support's randomness and the values it takes. The algorithm focuses on finding the right direction for descent in the least squares objective. Our algorithm focuses on finding the appropriate direction for descent based on the geometry of the objective. It utilizes a gradient descent-based strategy for dictionary update, leading to an approximate gradient descent approach due to unknown coefficients. The analysis establishes conditions for the concentration of the empirical gradient vector and matrix around their means, ensuring progress at each iterate. This local descent condition is crucial for support recovery of sparse coefficients and is related to the true dictionary columns. Our algorithm focuses on gradient descent for dictionary update, ensuring progress with sparse coefficients. The analysis establishes conditions for concentration of the gradient, leading to support recovery. Key model assumptions include specific coefficient distributions and sparsity levels. The main result is presented in Theorem 1, with detailed notation and analysis in Appendices A and B. The main result, Theorem 1, establishes that with certain assumptions and new samples provided to Algorithm 1, the coefficient estimates converge to the true model parameters. This convergence is achieved through appropriate dictionary initialization and learning parameters. The main result, Theorem 1, shows the symbiotic relationship between the number of IHT steps (R) and the error in dictionary estimation. By controlling the noise variance, NOODL can achieve small errors at a geometric rate. Theorem 1 emphasizes the importance of making progress on both factors to converge to the true model parameters. The introduction of the IHT step adds complexity to the analysis of dictionary and coefficients. Analyzing the coefficients involves deriving conditions to preserve correct signed-support and decomposing the noise term.

The neural architecture consists of three layers - input layer, weighted residual evaluation layer, and output layer. The main stages of operation involve initial hard thresholding phase and iterative hard thresholding phase, as shown in the timing diagram in FIG2. The IHT phase begins at timing sequence = 3, where output layer neurons communicate the iterates x (r+1) (j). The IHT phase involves output layer neurons communicating iterates x (r+1) (j) to the second layer for evaluation. The process continues until time instance = 2R + 1 to generate the final coefficient estimate x for the current batch of data. The input layer is then injected with (y (j), 1) for residual sharing and gradient evaluation. The procedure enters the \"Hebbian Learning\" phase, where each output layer neuron communicates the final coefficient estimate x (t) (j) to the second layer for residual evaluation and gradient estimation. The process involves using layer neurons to evaluate the empirical gradient estimate for updating the current dictionary estimate via gradient descent.

The results of the convergence analysis comparing NOODL with other techniques show superior performance in dictionary and coefficient recovery. NOODL outperforms Arora15 and Mairal '09 in recovering coefficients using Lasso algorithm. Our approach shows superior performance in dictionary and coefficient recovery compared to other techniques like Arora15 and Mairal '09. Sparse approximation after dictionary recovery can lead to poor coefficient recovery in biased dictionaries. Our method is applicable in real-world machine learning tasks where coefficient recovery is important. Additionally, our coefficient estimation step is online, unlike other techniques that require expensive sparse approximation steps. NOODL outperforms other algorithms in computational time and error convergence without the need for expensive tuning procedures. It achieves superior results with geometric convergence, making it faster overall despite slightly longer per iteration times. The neural architecture in Section 4 can reduce computation time by incorporating sparse recovery steps using Lasso (via FISTA) at every iteration for Arora15(''biased'') and Arora15(''unbiased''). This approach allows for a fair comparison of techniques, with an analysis of computation time per iteration using two metrics. The computation time per iteration is analyzed using two metrics: average time per Lasso update and average time to scan over all values of the regularization parameter. The Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA) is used, with a fixed step-size of 1/L. Although scanning across 50 values of the regularization parameter would provide better results, 10 values are chosen due to cost constraints. The study chose 10 values for the regularization parameter due to cost constraints, highlighting the challenges of large-scale applications. Guarantees on coefficient recovery may exist in terms of closeness in 2-norm sense when the dictionary is not known exactly. Arora et al. (2015) scanned across 50 values for coefficient estimation using Lasso, while Mairal '09 scanned 10 values. Arora et al.'s techniques still incur a large error compared to NOODL at convergence. The study by Arora et al. (2015) found that their techniques incur a large error at convergence. In contrast, the NOODL algorithm exhibits superior convergence properties and geometrically converges to the true factors, making it faster and more reliable. Additionally, the Matrix Bernstein lemma provides guarantees for random matrices in terms of their maximum value and expected value."
