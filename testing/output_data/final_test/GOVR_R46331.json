The Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) subsidizes 72.5% of qualified health insurance for eligible taxpayers. Two groups qualify for the HCTC: those eligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) and individuals with defined-benefit pension plans taken over by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Eligible individuals must not be able to enroll in certain health coverage or be eligible for other specified coverage to claim the tax credit. The Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) is financed through a permanent appropriation and not subject to annual appropriations. The Trade Act of 2002 authorized the HCTC and specified eligibility criteria. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 expanded eligibility and subsidy for the HCTC. The Trade Adjustment Assistance Extension Act of 2011 established a sunset date, and the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015 retroactively reauthorized the HCTC. The Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) was reauthorized in 2015 and has a sunset date before January 1, 2021.

Medicare pays LTCHs under the LTCH prospective payment system, which is typically higher than payments under the IPPS. PSRA amended the law regarding LTCH PPS payments. The LTCH PPS payment is now only available for discharges meeting specific clinical criteria, such as prior ICU stay or ventilator services. Patients with psychiatric or rehabilitation diagnoses do not qualify. Temporary exceptions exist for certain spinal cord conditions. The LTCH PPS payment is available for discharges meeting specific clinical criteria, with temporary exceptions for certain spinal cord conditions. A site neutral payment rate is phased-in for LTCH discharges that do not qualify for the LTCH PPS based on clinical criteria. During a phase-in period, LTCHs received a blended payment amount based on 50% of the LTCH PPS rate and 50% of the site neutral payment rate. The LTCH PPS rate and 50% of the site neutral payment rate were phased out for discharges not meeting specific criteria. BBA 2018 extended the transition period for site neutral payments for LTCH patients for an additional two years. The extended transition period expired for discharges in FY2020 and onwards. Medicare pays LTCHs under the LTCH PPS, which is typically higher than payments under the IPPS. LTCHs are paid the LTCH PPS rate for patients meeting specific criteria, such as prior ICU stay or ventilator services. Discharges with psychiatric or rehabilitation diagnoses do not qualify. A site neutral payment rate is phased in for discharges not meeting LTCH PPS criteria. The 21st Century Cures Act established temporary criteria for payment under the LTCH PPS related to certain spinal cord conditions for discharges in FY2018 and FY2019. The LTCH PPS rate applies if specific requirements are met, including the LTCH being a not-for-profit on June 1, 2014, and a certain percentage of discharges being classified under specific DRGs. The LTCH during FY2014 discharged patients with catastrophic spinal cord injuries, acquired brain injury, or other paralyzing neuromuscular conditions from at least 20 states. Medicare payments for physician services are based on a fee schedule using relative values units (RVUs) assigned to service codes. The Medicare fee schedule for physician services is based on relative value units (RVUs) that consider the work, practice expenses, and malpractice costs involved. The RVUs are adjusted for geographic variations and converted into dollar amounts using a conversion factor. CMS continually refines the methodology for estimating RVUs and is required to review them every five years. The ACA mandates periodic adjustments to RVUs for potentially misvalued physician services under the Medicare fee schedule. The HHS Secretary has authority to adjust RVUs for Medicare physician reimbursement based on changes in medical practice, coding, or new data. Certain radiation therapy codes were identified as potentially misvalued in 2015, leading to the creation of new codes during the transition to an episodic payment model. The Patient Access and Medicare Protection Act required CMS to maintain code definitions and RVUs from 2016 in 2017 and 2018. The Patient Access and Medicare Protection Act (PAMPA) maintained code definitions, work RVUs, and direct inputs for practice expense RVUs for radiation therapy and related imaging services in CY2017 and CY2018, keeping payments unchanged. PAMPA also directed the HHS Secretary to develop an episodic alternative payment model for radiation therapy services. BBA 2018 Section 51009 extended payment restrictions through CY2019, which expired after December 31, 2019. The expiring demonstration projects and pilot programs related to Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and private health insurance programs are set to expire in 2020. These projects were enacted in the ACA or extended in the CARES Act. No similar projects expired in 2019. The 116th Congress has various demonstration projects and pilot programs related to healthcare that are set to expire in 2020. These projects cover areas such as Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and private health insurance programs. The previous CRS report, R45781, also included expiring provisions related to these healthcare programs. The 116th Congress has healthcare demonstration projects and pilot programs expiring in 2020, including Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and private health insurance programs. These provisions were detailed in the previous CRS report, R45781, and some have expired or been extended beyond CY2020. Two private health insurance provisions set to expire in 2019 were permanently repealed in the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (P.L. 116-94). Unlike other provisions extended past CY2020, the extension for the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF) was mentioned. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF) underwent significant revisions in CY2020, detailed in R45781. The appendix includes an updated provision summary, excluding demonstration projects. The Demonstration Program to Increase Access to Dental Health Care Service expired in 2017.

The PCORTF receives funding from various sources, including annual appropriations, fees on health insurance policies, and transfers from the Medicare Trust Funds. ACA Section 6301 provided specific funding amounts to the PCORTF for fiscal years 2010 to 2019. The termination date of PCORTF was extended multiple times through legislative acts, with the latest extension funding it through FY2029. The funding for PCORTF has been extended through FY2029 by appropriating net revenues from fees on health insurance policies and self-insured plans. The termination dates for the fees and the requirement to transfer 20% of funds to the HHS Secretary have also been extended. Modifications have been made to the authorizing language for PCORI. The PCORTF funding expires after September 30, 2029, with funds transferred to the HHS Secretary under IRC Section 9511 remaining available until expended.
