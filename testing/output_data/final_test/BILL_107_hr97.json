    "content": "The \"Notch Fairness Act of 2001\" may be cited as the short title. It introduces a new guaranteed minimum primary insurance amount for eligibility during a transitional period. The \"Notch Fairness Act of 2001\" introduces amendments to Section 215(a) of the Social Security Act, including a transitional increase amount for certain individuals' primary insurance amounts. The \"Notch Fairness Act of 2001\" introduces amendments to Section 215(a) of the Social Security Act, including a formula for calculating a transitional increase amount for certain individuals' primary insurance amounts based on specific percentages. The \"Notch Fairness Act of 2001\" introduced amendments to the Social Security Act, specifying percentage-based benefits eligibility from 1979 to 1987: 55%, 45%, 35%, 32%, 25%, 20%, 16%, 10%, and 3%. The \"Notch Fairness Act of 2001\" amended the Social Security Act to specify percentage-based benefits eligibility from 1979 to 1987, ranging from 55% to 3%. The excess under former law for individuals is defined as the difference between the applicable former law primary insurance amount and the primary insurance amount calculated under current law. The applicable former law primary insurance amount is determined based on the individual's primary insurance amount under the law in effect in December 1978. The primary insurance amount is determined based on the individual's earnings after 1950 (or 1936 if applicable) up to age 61, plus the 3 years with the highest wages. The primary insurance amount is calculated based on an individual's wages and self-employment income, with specific conditions for application to ensure a higher amount. The primary insurance amount of an individual can be calculated by filing an election with the Commissioner of Social Security. The election must be filed in the prescribed form and manner. If the election is filed after December 31, 2001, it will be null and void. Upon receiving a timely election, the Commissioner will certify it to the Secretary of the Treasury for payment. The Treasury will pay an individual $5,000 in 4 annual installments from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund. The first payment will be made by July 1, 2002. The individual's primary insurance amount will not be affected by this payment. If at least one beneficiary files a timely election by December 31, 2001, the Commissioner will certify it to the Secretary of the Treasury for payment. The Secretary of the Treasury will pay beneficiaries $5,000 in 4 annual installments from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund. The first payment will be made by July 1, 2002, and the primary insurance amount of the beneficiaries will not be affected. If beneficiaries file a timely election by December 31, 2001, the Commissioner will certify it for payment. The amendments made by this Act will be effective as if they were part of the Social Security Amendments of 1977, with no increase in benefits before July 2002. The changes will only apply to benefits payable after fiscal year 2002. The spending limits for budget authority and outlays under this Act for fiscal years before 2003 are extended to fiscal year 2002 and beyond. Recomputation of benefits is required for individuals entitled to monthly insurance benefits under the Social Security Act for June 2002. The Commissioner of Social Security must recalculate the primary insurance amount for individuals receiving monthly benefits under the Social Security Act for June 2002, taking into account the amendments made by the Act of 1977. The legislation requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to adjust discretionary spending limits for fiscal year 2002 to offset the increase in direct spending resulting from the enactment of the legislation. This decrease in discretionary spending will be treated as direct spending legislation decreasing the deficit for that fiscal year."
