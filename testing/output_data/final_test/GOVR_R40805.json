    "content": "President Obama signed the FY2010 Department of Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriation Act into law on December 16, 2009. The enacted bill provided $122.1 billion, $15.1 billion more than FY2009. The President's request was $123.2 billion, $16.2 billion more than FY2009. DOT and HUD received additional funding in FY2009 through the ARRA emergency stimulus act. The FY2010 Department of Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriation Act provided $72.4 billion for DOT, reflecting slight increases over FY2009 funding. The HUD request was $45.5 billion, with the House-passed bill providing $47.1 billion. The President also requested $5.3 billion for other related agencies, including $5 billion for a new national infrastructure bank. Additionally, the President requested the termination of five programs receiving $212 million in FY2009 funding. In FY2010, $212 million in funding was allocated to programs in the THUD appropriations act, with a total of $17 billion in budget reductions requested for programs deemed inefficient. Two programs were not funded, while three received increased funding totaling $346 million. Congress aimed to pass all 12 FY2010 appropriations bills separately to avoid bundling them into a consolidated act, which was made challenging by the new administration taking office in 2009. In FY2010, the new administration faced delays in submitting the budget request due to dealing with major initiatives like energy and health care reform. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations reorganized their subcommittee structure multiple times since 2003. In 2003, the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations reorganized their subcommittee structure, reducing the number of subcommittees from 13 to 10. This included combining the Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies subcommittee with the District of Columbia subcommittee, adding jurisdiction over appropriations for the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Judiciary. The resulting subcommittee was known as the Subcommittee on Transportation. The Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development, The Judiciary, District of Columbia, and Independent Agencies (TTHUD) was created by the Senate Committee on Appropriations, reducing its subcommittees to 12. The Senate added jurisdiction over appropriations for Housing and Urban Development and the Judiciary to the TTHUD subcommittee, while retaining a separate District of Columbia Appropriations subcommittee. The House and Senate subcommittees had almost identical coverage, with the main difference being the Senate's separate bill for District of Columbia appropriations. In 2007, both Committees on Appropriations reorganized their subcommittee structures. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations reorganized their subcommittee structures, dividing the responsibilities of the TTHUD subcommittees between two new subcommittees: Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies (THUD); and Financial Services and General Government. This reorganization complicates year-to-year comparisons of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development appropriation bills, as their appropriations now appear in different bills with various other agencies. Other factors, such as supplemental appropriations for disaster response and changes in the Department of... The funding trends for the Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) from FY2004-FY2009, excluding emergency and supplemental funding, are shown in Table 4. Table 5 details the funding provided for DOT in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the FY2009 THUD appropriations act, and the amounts requested for FY2010. The President's FY2010 budget requested $72.4 billion for the Department of Transportation, an increase of $5.2 billion from the previous year. DOT funding comes from discretionary funding and contract authority, which allows for obligations without further legislative action. The ObLim is a spending control mechanism that limits the amount of contract authority the government can spend. It is set in the authorizing legislation and included in the DOT appropriations bill. References to DOT funding include discretionary funds and the contract authority Oblim. Congress faced issues regarding the solvency of the Highway Trust Fund and FY2010 transportation funding initiatives. The funding issues in transportation included the solvency of the Highway Trust Fund, pending expiration of authorizations for federal aviation, highway, and transit programs, and a $8.7 billion rescission of contract authority. The President requested $5 billion for a national infrastructure bank and $1 billion for high-speed and intercity passenger rail grants. Most federal highway funding comes from the Highway Trust Fund, funded by taxes on gasoline, diesel fuel sales, and truck-related sales. The Highway Trust Fund faced solvency issues due to higher-than-expected highway funding levels and lower revenues during the economic recession. Congress transferred $8 billion in general revenues to the Fund in FY2008 to maintain its balance. The President's FY2010 budget proposed drawing $5 billion from the Highway Trust Fund for the federal highway program, with $36 billion to be appropriated from the general fund of the Treasury. Congress rejected this proposal and transferred $7 billion from the general fund to the Highway Trust Fund in July 2009 to maintain solvency. This is expected to keep the Fund solvent for most of FY2010. Funding authorization for aviation programs expired in FY2007, and Congress has extended authorization for the aviation program. The SAFETEA highway and transit program authorization were set to expire on September 30, 2009. Congress passed two short-term extensions, extending the authorization to February 28, 2010, in response to the President's request for an 18-month extension. During the last reauthorization of highway and transit programs, the authorization was extended repeatedly, totaling almost two years beyond the original expiration date. The Bush Administration aimed to limit spending in the bill, resulting in $8.7 billion in contract authority being rescinded from the federal highway program on September 30, 2009. SAFETEA-LU provided states with more contract authority than obligational authority. The actual level of contract authority expenditure is determined by the limitation of obligations. Unused contract authority accumulates over time for each state. Congress has included rescissions of contract authority in annual THUD appropriations bills since SAFETEA was enacted. Congress included rescissions of contract authority in annual THUD appropriations bills to provide more highway funding to states within budget limits. This practice made enacted highway funding levels appear smaller than they actually were, reducing unused contract authority for states. Some states faced larger rescissions than their unused authority, impacting federal highway funding in FY2010. Efforts to prevent the September 30, 2009 rescission failed. Senator Barbara Boxer led the Senate Committee on. The September 30, 2009 rescission failed as Congress allowed it to take place, impacting federal transportation funding for states in FY2010. This decision reduced the opportunity for future budget tactics involving unused contract authority. In FY2010, Congress did not rescind any contract authority under the Federal Highway Administration account, unlike the $3.2 billion rescission in FY2009. The President proposed $5 billion for a national infrastructure bank to support large projects with federal grants and loan guarantees. The House did not fund the bank but suggested transferring $2 billion to the high-speed and intercity passenger rail grant program. The Senate did not provide funding for the national infrastructure bank in FY2010 but allocated $1.1 billion for transportation infrastructure grants to state and local governments. These grants aim to have a significant impact on the nation, metropolitan areas, or regions, with a focus on urban and rural communities. At least $250 million (23% of the total) must be spent on projects in rural areas, and there are limits on grant sizes. The conferees provided $600 million for national infrastructure development grants, with a focus on rural areas and a lower minimum grant size of $1 million. They also discussed the creation of a national infrastructure bank through the normal authorization process. The President requested $1 billion for grants to states and entities for intercity passenger rail projects, with a total request of $5 billion over five years. The Congress provided $5 billion over five years for a program, in addition to $8 billion from the ARRA. The first grants were awarded in January 2010. The FAA budget includes funding for air traffic control systems and grants for airport planning and development. The President's budget requests $15.96 billion for FY2010, which is $579 million more than the provided amount. The House and Senate approved funding of $15.98 billion and $15.99 billion respectively for FY2010, with slight variations in allocations for different accounts. The enacted legislation ultimately provided $15.60 billion, which was a 3% increase from FY2009 and slightly more than the requested amount. The enacted FY2010 budget was $15.60 billion, slightly more than the requested amount. Funding for AIP and EAS programs was approved as requested, with AIP funds used for airport development projects and EAS program funding increased to $150 million. Total funding for FY2010 was $200 million. The FY2010 budget allocated $200 million for the Essential Air Service (EAS) program, an increase from $123 million in FY2009. The program aims to maintain air service to small rural airports by subsidizing costs. The President's budget requested $41.8 billion for federal highway programs, with $36.1 billion from the general fund to address financial challenges in the Highway Trust Fund. In FY2009, FHWA received $42.8 billion in funding, with $41.8 billion from the Highway Trust Fund. Congress transferred $7 billion from the general fund to the Trust Fund to ensure solvency until FY2010. Conferees urged FHWA to improve bridge inspections. To ensure the Trust Fund's solvency and support for FY2010 THUD appropriations, Congress must take additional steps. The Administration requested $550 million for FMCSA, including $310 million for state grants for truck and bus safety enforcement. The House and Senate approved the funding, with a focus on electronic on-board data recorders for carriers with violations. The National Transportation Safety Board recommends recorders for all commercial vehicles. FMCSA was directed to issue the final rule promptly. The FMCSA is directed to issue a final rule promptly and report on encouraging recorder installation in commercial vehicles. The Senate Committee on Appropriations directed FMCSA to use research funding to educate motor carrier operators on safety technologies. The Administration requested $867 million for NHTSA, including grants for highway safety programs. The House and Senate provided funding, with slight variations in amounts. The enacted legislation provided $873 million for NHTSA, with additional funds allocated for specific projects like in-vehicle alcohol detection technologies and safety research on vehicles using alternative fuels. Despite a decrease in overall highway fatalities, motorcycle fatalities have been on the rise. Research suggests that mandating helmet use for all motorcyclists is the most effective safety policy, although some riders strongly oppose this requirement. Some motorcyclists oppose mandatory helmet laws, which were once enforced through penalties on states by Congress. However, in 1995, Congress repealed this provision, leading to 30 states without universal helmet laws. Despite an increase in motorcycle fatalities, the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended allowing the Department of Transportation to work with states on proposals to reduce these fatalities. The Administration requested a significant increase in funding for the Federal Railroad Administration in FY2010. The Administration requested a $2.7 billion increase for the Federal Railroad Administration in FY2010, with most of the funding allocated for intercity passenger rail and high-speed rail grants. The House-passed bill provided $5.8 billion, with $4.0 billion for rail grants and the possibility of transferring $2 billion to a national infrastructure bank. Amtrak received $1.5 billion, slightly more than the previous year. The Senate-passed bill allocated $3.0 billion, with additional funding for rail grants. The additional funding provided in FY2010 included grants for intercity passenger rail and high-speed rail, Amtrak, railroad safety technology, and rail line relocation and improvement. $50 million was allocated for railroad safety technology to fund a grant program for train control technologies. The enacted legislation provided $4.4 billion, $1.6 billion more than requested, with $1.5 billion for grants. In FY2010, additional funding of $1.5 billion was allocated for grants, mainly for passenger rail and high-speed rail development, safety, and rail line relocation. Amtrak's Inspector General resigned in June 2009, leading to an investigation by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding Amtrak's OIG as an independent agency, separate from Amtrak's appropriation under FRA. In FY2010, an amendment to the THUD bill required Amtrak to allow passengers to transport firearms in checked baggage by March 31, 2010, or risk losing federal funding. The Administration requested $10.3 billion for FTA for FY2010, an increase of $104 million over the previous year. Most of FTA's funding goes to state and local transportation authorities for various transit services. The FTA funding from the Highway Trust Fund was proposed to be reduced from 81% in FY2009 to 48% in FY2010, with the rest coming from general revenues. Congress did not support this change. The House-passed bill recommended $10.5 billion, with an increase of $148 million, including a $150 million grant to WMATA. The Senate-passed bill provided $11.1 billion, with additional funding for the New Starts program and grants for energy efficiency and greenhouse gas reduction. The Senate Committee on Appropriations allocated $100 million for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the economic stimulus act. FTA received grant applications totaling over $1 billion. The enacted legislation provided $10.7 billion, with $8.3 billion from the Trust Fund. The final legislation included $2.0 billion for the New Starts program and $75 million for energy efficiency grants. Two major discretionary grant programs under FTA are the Bus and Bus Facilities Program and the New Starts Program. The Bus and Bus Facilities Program funds the purchase of new buses, maintenance, and construction of facilities. The House and Senate allocated $584 million for the program in FY2010. The New Starts program funds fixed-guideway transit systems. The New Starts program funds fixed-guideway transit systems with $2.0 billion allocated in FY2010, slightly less than the Senate recommendation of $2.3 billion. MARAD received $363 million, $30 million more than the requested amount. MARAD received $363 million in funding, $30 million more than requested. The largest components of its budget are the Maritime Security Program and Operations and Training. The Administration requested $174 million for the Maritime Security Program, the same as in FY2009. Operations and Training received $153 million, $30 million more than in FY2009. The House's recommendation cut $12 million from the requested level for Maritime Program expenses. The Senate committee added $17.5 million for small shipyard assistance and $10 million for the Maritime Guaranteed Loan Program, exceeding the requested levels. Congress also provided additional funding for small shipyards and guaranteed loan subsidies not requested by the House. President Obama's FY2010 budget request for HUD included a $5 million Maritime Guaranteed Loan Program. The budget authority provided and available were compared in Table 6, with and without emergency appropriations. The request aimed for a 7.7% increase in regular annual appropriations for HUD programs. The House-passed version of H.R. 3288 would provide over an 11% increase in regular annual appropriations for HUD programs, exceeding the President's request by 3%. The Senate Committee-reported version would offer less than the House-passed bill but more than the President's request, resulting in an 8.5% increase in regular annual appropriations for HUD programs. Funding levels for HUD in FY2010 were ultimately determined by the Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 111-117). The Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 111-117) provided more funding for HUD in FY2010 than the Senate recommended and the President requested, but less than the House recommended. The 9% increase in total HUD funding over FY2009 levels required an 11% increase in net new budget authority. The FY2010 budget is the first of the Obama Administration and contains new initiatives reflecting the administration's priorities. The FY2010 budget for HUD aims to address the nation's housing and economic crisis, promote affordable rental housing, invest in rural and metropolitan communities, drive energy-efficient housing, and transform HUD's operations. President Obama's Transformation Initiative includes new initiatives such as transferring funding for research and technology development. The budget also requests $20 million in new appropriations for these initiatives. The budget for FY2010 includes $20 million in new appropriations to combat mortgage fraud, specifically in the Federal Housing Administration programs. Both the House and Senate versions of H.R. 3288 supported the President's Transformation Initiative by including the requested funds. The Energy Innovation Fund, a proposal by the Obama Administration, aims to promote energy efficiency in housing with a $100 million fund, including a \"Local Initiatives Fund\" providing grants and subsidies. The House-passed bill included funding for local energy retrofit funds, an energy efficient mortgage program, and a Multifamily Energy Pilot. The Senate Committee-passed version of H.R. 3288 included lower funding levels for all three components of the President's Energy Innovation Fund. The bill provided lower funding levels for energy efficient mortgage and Multifamily Energy Pilot programs, as well as the Local Initiatives Fund. The Choice Neighborhood Initiative, similar to the HOPE VI program, aimed to revitalize distressed neighborhoods with competitive grants. The President's FY2010 budget proposed no new funding for HOPE VI but requested $250 million for the new Choice Neighborhoods Initiative. The Choice Neighborhoods Initiative aims to transform, rehabilitate, and replace HUD public and assisted housing. It also supports affordable housing and community development activities in surrounding areas to improve residents' lives. The House and Senate Committee had differing views on funding for the program. The House bill would fund HOPE VI, while the Senate Committee bill would allocate more than half of the funding for PHA-led projects. The final FY2010 funding bill provided $200 million for HOPE VI and $65 million for the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative demonstration. The Housing Trust Fund, established in 2008, had contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but their funding was suspended in 2008 due to financial difficulties. The Housing Trust Fund, established in 2008 with contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, was left without funding due to their financial difficulties. Despite authorization for alternative funding sources, no money has been directed to the fund. The President's budget proposed $1 billion in mandatory funding, but a source has not been identified. The Section 8 voucher program, funded by HUD, provides rental subsidies for low-income families. HUD funds over two million Section 8 vouchers administered by public housing authorities, with a budget primarily for renewals and program administration. In FY2009, $11 billion was allocated for voucher renewals, with an additional $4 billion in advance appropriation. Despite a $750 million rescission, a total of $14.284 billion was available for CY2009 renewals based on PHAs' data from FY2008. HUD also estimated PHAs' unspent reserves using the same data. HUD estimated PHAs' unspent reserves (Net Restricted Assets, or NRA) based on FY2008 data. However, inaccuracies in estimates of costs, utilization, and NRA balances have led to some PHAs facing funding shortfalls in CY2009. Approximately 15% of PHAs administering the voucher programs are affected, and HUD is working with agencies to address these issues using the FY2009 $100 million renewal set-aside and $30 million administrative fee set-aside. HUD is advising agencies on cost-cutting measures to address funding shortfalls in voucher renewals. Agencies facing shortfalls are urged to contact HUD before terminating assistance. The second continuing resolution allowed HUD to use $200 million from FY2009 for FY2010 budgets. The President requested $16.189 billion for voucher renewals in FY2010, with additional funding proposed by the House and Senate. The House-passed version of H.R. 3288 included $75 million for new incremental vouchers for homeless veterans through the HUD-VA Supported Housing (HUD-VASH) program. The Senate Committee-passed version of H.R. 3288 funded renewals at the Senate-requested level. Incremental vouchers are new vouchers to help serve additional families beyond the existing two million vouchers. The Senate Committee-passed version of H.R. 3288 included funding for HUD-VASH vouchers and Family Unification Program vouchers. Public housing provides rental units for low-income families, with funds allocated to public housing authorities for maintenance and administration. In FY2010, Congress provided $4.455 billion for the Operating Fund, which was sufficient to fund an estimated 90% of PHA budget eligibility. President Obama requested just under $4.600 billion, but industry groups argued for $5.050 billion. The final funding in P.L. 111-117 was $4.775 billion for the Operating Fund, and $2.244 billion for the Capital Fund. Obama's FY2010 budget requested $2.244 billion for the Capital Fund, with $2.199 billion available for formula grants. This amount is close to the estimated $2 billion in new capital needs annually in public housing, along with a backlog of around $20 billion in unmet needs. Both the House and Senate funded the Capital Fund at $2.5 billion, exceeding the President's request and the FY2009 level. The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program is a major source of federal financial assistance for neighborhood revitalization and economic development activities. The Administration's budget request for FY2010 proposed a $550 million increase in total CDF appropriations, including full funding for the CDBG program. Additionally, $150 million was allocated for the Sustainable Communities Initiatives and $50 million for activities previously funded under other HUD accounts. The House-passed version of H.R. 3288 included $4.599 billion for CDF activities, with $4.167 billion for formula-based CDBG funds to state and local governments. The House-passed version of H.R. 3288 recommended changes in funding for CDF appropriations and CDBG formula-based funding compared to the Administration's request. The difference in funding would be used for congressionally designated special projects under the EDI and NI subaccounts. Both the House-passed and Senate Committee-passed versions of H.R. 3288 support the Administration's Sustainable Communities Initiative with new appropriations to promote regional integration of housing, transportation, and energy. The CDF funding in P.L. 111-117 includes $3.99 billion for CDBG grants, $173 million for EDI, $22 million for NI, and $150 million for the Sustainable Communities Initiative. The BEDI program provides grants for redevelopment of industrial sites with environmental contamination, and the Section 108 loan guarantee program helps finance brownfield redevelopment activities. The Obama Administration proposed changes to the Section 108 loan guarantee program in the FY2010 budget, suggesting a fee-based assessment instead of a credit subsidy. Congress funded the program at $6 million in P.L. 111-117, maintaining the existing structure. The BEDI program's separate appropriation was also proposed for elimination in the same budget. The BEDI program for FY2010 may not receive funding, but activities could still be funded under the CDBG program. The House-passed bill would allocate $25 million for BEDI, while P.L. 111-117 provided $18 million. HUD's housing counseling program offers grants to counseling agencies for various housing services, including foreclosure mitigation counseling through NeighborWorks America. The President's budget proposed $100 million for HUD housing counseling in FY2010, with an additional $33.8 million for the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program. The House bill allocated $75 million for housing counseling, a $10 million increase from FY2009 but $25 million less than the President's proposal. The House bill allocated $75 million for housing counseling, a $10 million increase from FY2009 but $25 million less than the President's proposal. The Senate Committee-passed bill would provide $100 million for HUD Housing Counseling and $65 million for the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program (NFMCP). P.L. 111-117 included $87.5 million for HUD housing counseling and $65 million for the NFMCP. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insures mortgage loans made by private lenders to eligible borrowers through two program accounts. The FHA has two program accounts: MMI/CMHI for home mortgages and GI/SRI for riskier mortgages. The FHA has had a surplus in recent years, but the President's FY2010 budget request would require positive appropriations due to lower-than-expected appreciation rates in the HECM program. The President's budget request for FY2010 would require $798 million in positive appropriations for HECMs. Both the House-passed and Senate Committee-passed versions of H.R. 3288 aim to minimize the credit subsidy needed in the MMI fund by adjusting factors used to calculate the principal limit for HECMs. The Senate Committee-passed version of H.R. 3288 would reduce the positive subsidy requirement for HECMs to $288 million, compared to $798 million in the President's budget. P.L. 111-117 included a proposal to administer the HECM program without a credit subsidy. Ginnie Mae, an agency of HUD, guarantees timely payments on securities backing FHA-insured mortgages. Increased FHA activity leads to increased Ginnie Mae activity. The President's budget estimated Ginnie Mae would provide $720 million in offsets, compared to $193 million in FY2009. The ARRA included $48.1 billion for DOT programs and $13.7 billion for HUD programs. The legislation aimed to expedite fund expenditure. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act, FY2010 extended surface transportation program authorization to February 28, 2010. The Jobs for Main Street Act of 2009 provided $150 billion in emergency funding for transportation and housing programs. The Jobs for Main Street Act of 2009 aims to stimulate the economy by providing funding for transportation and housing programs. It includes $37.3 billion for the Department of Transportation (DOT) for highway and transit grants, extending authorization to September 30, 2010. Additionally, it allocates over $1 billion to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund and $1 billion for competitive grants through the Public Housing Capital Fund. The Senate has not yet taken action on this Act."
