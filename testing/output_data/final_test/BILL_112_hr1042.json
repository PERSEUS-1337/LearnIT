Congress finds that the Delhi Sands Flower-loving Fly was listed as an endangered species in 1993, with a recovery plan issued in 1997 due to threats and low potential for recovery. The Delhi Sands flower-loving Fly's recovery plan could not establish delisting criteria due to the cryptic nature and rarity of the species. The 5-year review report states that current knowledge is insufficient to evaluate down-listing criterion 2. Conservation areas for the fly are not managed to maintain perpetual sand supply, and the long-term impact of this is unclear. The Delhi Sands Flower-loving Fly's population monitoring is complicated by its cryptic nature and low density. Surveys have been ineffective in quantifying population variables, and public support for conservation is limited. The species' life history is largely unknown, and there is uncertainty about the long-term impact on the dune ecosystem. The Delhi Sands Flower-loving Fly's population monitoring is challenging due to its low density. Observations of Rhaphiomidas trochilus larvae were used to understand the larval biology of the fly. A commenter suggested the fly may be non-native to the area. No new information indicates an expanded range for the fly. Suitable habitat area is limited. (14) Although potential habitat has expanded, no new occupied sites support a significant population of the Delhi Sands Flower-loving Fly. (15) Abundance data since listing show no clear trends due to the fly's rarity. (16) Range-wide surveys have not been done due to funding and access issues. The 5-year review report highlighted challenges in estimating Delhi Sands Flower-loving Fly population trends due to limited data quality. Efforts by biologists showed that substantial work is needed to measure demographic trends effectively. Additionally, the lack of regulations addressing habitat loss poses a threat to the fly's habitat, mainly on privately owned land. Most Delhi Sands Flower-loving Fly conservation sites are too small and fragmented to support populations over time. Existing areas are at risk from nonnative grasses, off-road vehicles, and lack monitoring programs. Historical habitat loss limits conservation and restoration opportunities. The Delhi Sands Flower-loving Fly faces extinction due to limited habitat for conservation and restoration. The small, isolated populations are at risk from habitat loss and fragmentation, with uncertain population sizes. Small populations are more vulnerable to extinction due to inbreeding and loss of genetic variation. The Delhi Sands Flower-loving Fly populations are at risk due to small size, habitat fragmentation, and limited monitoring suggesting no population increases. This leads to vulnerability to extinction from inbreeding, loss of genetic variation, and environmental threats like wildfires, floods, droughts, or disease epidemics. The Delhi Sands Flower-loving Fly populations are at risk due to habitat fragmentation, making them vulnerable to extinction. Continued listing as an endangered species is questioned due to outdated research and lack of evidence showing population growth over the years. The Delhi Sands Flower-loving Fly populations are at risk due to habitat fragmentation, making them vulnerable to extinction. SEC. 3. TREATMENT OF CERTAIN SPECIES AS EXTINCT. Section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to treat limited listed species as extinct after 15 years unless there is a substantial population increase or no economic hardship on communities. Limited listed species are those listed as endangered without the possibility of determining their status. Limited listed species may be considered extinct after 15 years if their status cannot be determined at the time of listing."
