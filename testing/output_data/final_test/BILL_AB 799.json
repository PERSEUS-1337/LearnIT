    "title": "AB 799",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 23102 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to exempt certain corporations or limited liability companies from being considered as doing business in California if they only hold stock or bonds and engage in limited activities. Section 17941 is also amended to define a limited liability company doing business in the state. Limited liability companies defined in Section 23101 must pay an annual tax to the state for doing business, as specified in Section 23153. Additionally, any limited liability company operating in the state must pay the tax if articles of organization have been accepted by the Secretary of State, until a certificate of cancellation is filed. If a taxpayer files a final return with the Franchise Tax Board, they will be notified that the annual tax is due until a certificate of dissolution or cancellation is filed with the Secretary of State. The tax is due by the 15th day of the fourth month of the taxable year for limited liability companies, except those exempt from taxes under specific sections. A limited liability company formed under state law is not taxable as a corporation for California tax purposes. It may be exempt from tax if it meets certain criteria, such as being exempt under specific sections or being classified as a qualified investment partnership for California income tax purposes. A qualified investment partnership for California income tax purposes must meet specific criteria, including having at least 90 percent of its total assets in qualifying investment securities or investments in a partnership. Additionally, at least 90 percent of its gross income must come from interest, dividends, and gains from qualifying investments. A qualified investment partnership must file a partnership return if required to file a federal return under Section 6031 of the Internal Revenue Code. If not required to file a federal return, the partnership must file an information return as prescribed by the Franchise Tax Board. If the Secretary of State files a certificate of cancellation for a limited liability company, certain tax provisions will apply as if the company were treated as a corporation for that limited purpose only. The company is not entitled to a reimbursement for any taxes or fees already paid. A small business limited liability company owned by a deployed member of the US Armed Forces is exempt from taxes if the owner is deployed and the company operates at a loss or ceases operation. The Franchise Tax Board can create regulations, including defining \"ceases operation.\" \"Deployed\" refers to active duty during combat or homeland defense, excluding training or permanent station changes. The text defines \"operates at a loss\" for a limited liability company and specifies that a \"small business\" is one with total income of $250,000 or less in the state. This provision will be inactive for taxable years starting on or after January 1, 2018. The act enacts a tax levy and takes immediate effect."
