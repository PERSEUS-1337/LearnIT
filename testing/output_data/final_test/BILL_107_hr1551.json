    "content": "The \"Repetitive Flood Loss Reduction Act of 2001\" amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to include a new section focused on reducing repetitive flood losses. The Director will implement a program to reduce repetitive flood losses by purchasing structures and providing grants for eligible mitigation activities. These activities must be proposed by the State, community, or local flood management agency to reduce flood risks and protect against flood losses. The Director will implement a program to reduce repetitive flood losses by purchasing structures and providing grants for eligible mitigation activities that are cost-effective, technically feasible, and consistent with established criteria. Grants will be limited by available funds and can only be used for eligible mitigation activities proposed by flood management agencies to reduce flood risks and protect against losses. The section allows for eligible mitigation activities such as elevation, relocation, demolition, or floodproofing of structures in flood-prone areas. It also includes minor physical mitigation efforts to reduce flooding severity and damage, excluding major flood control projects unless approved by the Director. To be eligible for a grant under this section, a State, community, or local flood management agency must submit an application detailing the mitigation activities and structures to be protected. The application should also include the total amount of payments made under the flood insurance program for the structures in question. The Director requires detailed information for grant applications, including eligibility of mitigation activities and any additional information deemed necessary. Applications must be approved or rejected within 30 days. Grants will not exceed 75% of total mitigation costs, and matching funds are required from the State, community, or local flood management agency. The Director requires detailed information for grant applications, including eligibility of mitigation activities and any additional information deemed necessary. Grants will not exceed 75% of total mitigation costs, and matching funds are required from non-Federal sources. The Director shall offer to purchase repetitive substantial flood loss structures at a price not greater than 125 percent of the fair market value. The Director may purchase repetitive substantial flood loss structures if the owner accepts the offer, with coordination from local flood management agencies. Owners who refuse the offer may face increased premiums. The Director may establish a duration for an offer made for flood insurance coverage on a structure. The premium rate will be 150% of the rate at the time of the offer, with a deductible increase of $5,000. Upon renewal, the owner of a repetitive substantial flood loss structure will be notified that the offer is still open. Increased premiums and deductible for repetitive substantial flood loss structures if the owner does not accept an offer from the Director. Premium rate will be 150% of the original rate with a $5,000 deductible increase for subsequent flood damage events. The Director, in consultation with regional flood plain administrators, develops a list of repetitive substantial flood loss structures and deposits all collected amounts into the Repetitive Flood Loss Reduction Fund. After acquiring a structure, the Director offers to transfer it to the local flood management agency with jurisdiction over the area. The Director offers to transfer acquired structures to local flood management agencies or the State if the agency refuses. The transfer is made without compensation and under terms set by the Director to protect US interests. Oversight is conducted on grant recipients to ensure compliance with approved mitigation activities. The Director can recapture grant funds if mitigation activities are not carried out, depositing them into the Repetitive Flood Loss Reduction Fund. A fund is created within the Treasury for this purpose. $100,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2002 to carry out these activities. The section allocates funds for acquisitions and grants, with 90 percent for acquisitions and 10 percent for grants. Definitions for \"community\" and \"repetitive substantial flood loss structure\" are provided."
