This section introduces a new credit for student loan program startup costs under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

The credit is subject to a dollar limitation based on the number of employees participating in an eligible employer plan. The student loan program startup costs credit allows eligible employers to claim 50% of qualified startup costs. An eligible employer is defined as one that has not maintained a qualified employer plan for the same employees in the preceding 3-taxable-year period. The term 'costs' refers to necessary expenses of an eligible employer related to establishing or administering an eligible employer plan, excluding payments to employees. An eligible employer plan is a student loan repayment plan where the employer provides qualified matching contributions for each employee annually. The term 'qualified matching contribution' refers to employer contributions made to an eligible employer plan on behalf of an employee, equal to the lesser of the employee's contribution or $2,000. The 'first credit year' is the taxable year when the eligible employer plan becomes effective. Special rules apply for aggregation of employers and plans, disallowance of deduction for startup costs equal to the credit, deduction for matching contributions, and the option for taxpayers to elect not to claim the credit. In subsection (b) of section 38, amendments are made to include the student loan program startup costs credit. Subsection (c) of section 196 is also amended to include the same credit. Additionally, a clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart D. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. The amendments made by section 45S apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2016."
