    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Federal Support Payment Act\" and includes declarations of Congress. The Congress declares that every child has a right to be supported by their parents, even if they travel to another state, leaving behind neglected children. This right transcends debt and ensures that parents fulfill their obligations. The Congress enacted the Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984 to assist children in obtaining financial support from their parents, regardless of circumstances. The policy aims to enforce court orders for individuals to meet their obligations to their children, even if they have migrated to different states. The Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984 aim to ensure that parents meet their financial obligations to their children, even if they have moved to different states. State courts are given jurisdiction to order migrants to fulfill their obligations to prevent children from suffering and becoming a burden on the public. The Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984 give state courts jurisdiction to enforce support orders for parents who have moved to different states. This includes adding a new chapter to Title 28 of the United States Code for the enforcement of state court support orders. The Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984 grant state courts authority to enforce support orders across state lines through a new chapter in Title 28 of the United States Code, defining key terms like 'support order', 'obligor', and 'obligee'. Sec. 3802 outlines the process for registering a support order in a different state, while Sec. 3803 addresses enforcement in the court where the order is registered. Sec. 3803 outlines the enforcement of a support order, including contempt proceedings for non-compliance and the requirement to register any modifications of the order. The cost of enforcement proceedings can be taxed against the party at fault, and the obligor may have to pay the obligee's attorney fees if necessary. When a support order is registered or enforced in court, written notice must be sent to the original court. State courts have jurisdiction over civil actions brought by a citizen of another State to order child support payments."
