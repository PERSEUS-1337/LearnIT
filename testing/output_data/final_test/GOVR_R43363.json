The cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) is calculated from the third quarter of the base year to the third quarter of the current year. The COLA is announced by the Social Security Administration in December and becomes effective in January of the following year. The Social Security Administration calculates cost-of-living adjustments (COLA) annually based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers. COLA payments reflect benefits from the previous month. In 2016, there was no COLA due to negative inflation. Inflation is measured by the CPI-W, which estimates price changes for goods and services purchased by households primarily earning wages. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) computes overall inflation by weighting price changes based on spending. The CPI-U is more widely used than the CPI-W, with the former reflecting 87% of the population's expenditures compared to the latter's 32%. Despite measuring inflation for urban wage earners and clerical workers, the CPI-W is still used for Social Security COLA adjustments. Both CPI measures closely track each other, but there are inherent shortcomings in any price measure due to variations in actual purchases and prices paid. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) calculates overall inflation based on spending, with the CPI-U reflecting 87% of the population's expenditures. Despite measuring inflation for urban wage earners and clerical workers, the CPI-W is used for Social Security COLA adjustments. Shortcomings in price measures include variations in actual purchases and prices paid. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has made adjustments to reduce an upward bias in the CPI, such as accounting for new products and changes in product quality, and incorporating procedures to address the \"substitution effect\" where consumers adjust their purchasing patterns in response to price changes. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) calculates overall inflation based on spending, with the CPI-W reflecting 87% of the population's expenditures. The CPI-W does not fully account for substitution, leading to an overstatement of inflation. Additionally, a \"small-sample\" bias causes inflation to be systematically overstated due to limited price data collection by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Some analysts argue that the CPI-W may underestimate inflation for Social Security beneficiaries, particularly older Americans who spend more on healthcare and housing. This group's spending habits differ from the urban wage and clerical workers tracked by the CPI-W, with a significant portion of their expenses going towards healthcare. This discrepancy contributes to the difference in growth rates between the CPI-W and the CPI-E, a price index for the elderly. Older Americans also spend more on goods with prices that tend to rise faster than average. The Chained CPI for All Urban Consumers (C-CPI-U) was introduced by BLS in August 2002 to fully account for consumer substitution and eliminate bias. Unlike the traditional CPI, the C-CPI-U updates weights monthly, reflecting changes in spending patterns and chaining two months together. It tends to increase at a slower rate than the CPI-W, impacting Social Security benefits. The C-CPI-U, introduced in 2002, grows slower than CPI-W, impacting Social Security benefits. Estimates show a 0.3 percentage point difference, with the CBO predicting a 0.25 point average due to methodological changes. Data collection for spending patterns occurs every two years, with the final release of C-CPI-U based on actual spending data, up to two years after price data collection. Some propose using the initial release of the C-CPI-U for Social Security COLA calculations to address the long time lag between initial and final releases. Low-income elderly may struggle to adjust spending as they primarily spend on essential items like housing, food, and healthcare. The C-CPI-U may underestimate the impact of inflation on low-income elderly who have less ability to substitute among essential items. Congress directed BLS to introduce the CPI-E in 1987 to track spending patterns of older consumers. The CPI-E was developed by BLS in 1987 to track spending patterns of older consumers. However, it may not fully represent the elderly population's price index due to differences in geographic areas, retail outlets, and consumption weights. This index may not be suitable for Social Security COLAs as it does not account for the diverse population of beneficiaries. The CPI-E has shown a faster increase than the CPI-W or CPI-U since 1982. Bills in Congress aim to tie Social Security COLAs to a CPI for the elderly. Debates focus on using the C-CPI-U or CPI-E instead of the CPI-W for COLAs, considering the growing importance of Social Security for older beneficiaries. The projected impact of a change in the COLA on Social Security's finances would be cumulative, affecting benefits for older beneficiaries over time. Changes in COLAs would have a small initial impact on new beneficiaries but would be more significant for those who receive benefits for many years, such as the elderly or long-term disabled individuals. The COLA change would affect Social Security benefits over time, with reductions for older beneficiaries and increases for retirees. The impact grows with age, with benefits being 6.5% lower at age 85 under the new policy. The number of affected individuals decreases with age. The impact of a change in COLAs on Social Security benefits varies with age. Older beneficiaries with higher lifetime earnings are most affected, while older beneficiaries with lower current income rely more on their benefits. Poverty rates increase with age, especially among those aged 65 to 69. Among Social Security beneficiaries, poverty rates increase with age. Older beneficiaries rely more on their Social Security benefits, with over half of those aged 80 and older depending on it for at least 80% of their total income. Changing how the COLA is computed would impact current beneficiaries, while other proposals would affect new beneficiaries or those aged 55 or younger. The system's annual income and cost rates are key indicators of Social Security's long-term financial status. The Social Security cost rate is projected to increase from 14% to 17% by 2035. The income rate is expected to remain at 13%. Changing the COLA calculation method could lead to a 4% decrease in benefits or a 3% increase in spending. The system's 75-year summarized cost rate is projected to be 16.77% of taxable payroll. The 75-year summarized cost rate is projected to be 16.77% of taxable payroll, with an income rate of 13.89%, resulting in a deficit of 2.88%. Changing the COLA calculation method could reduce the deficit by 0.56% using C-CPI-U or increase it by 0.38% using CPI-E. Implementing the C-CPI-U for benefits paid in 2016 and later would save $116 billion from FY2016 through FY2024, while using CPI-E could increase spending by about $93 billion over the same period. The President's 2014 budget proposed using the C-CPI-U for Social Security COLA calculation, with older beneficiaries being sheltered from the full effect of the change. Similar proposals were made by the Fiscal Commission and the Bipartisan Policy Center in 2010. The budget also included a provision to increase benefits for older beneficiaries starting at age 76 for retired workers and in the 15th year of benefit eligibility for disabled workers, phased in over 10 years. The proposal aims to increase benefits for older beneficiaries, with a 5% increase for 85-year-olds and a second increase at age 95. This would benefit those with lower benefits more than those with higher benefits. The Fiscal Commission also suggested a similar 20-year benefit bump up for those eligible for benefits for 20 years. The proposal suggests enhancing retirement benefits gradually from age 62 to 64, with a 5% increase phased in over five years. Measures include increasing initial benefits for lower lifetime earnings and potentially linking COLAs to wage growth instead of inflation. Currently, retirees do not benefit from the increase in purchasing power of wages after age 60. The Social Security COLA affects program parameters such as the taxable wage base. Some proposals suggest means-testing COLAs based on income or benefit levels. This change could increase Social Security spending, requiring offsetting measures like tax increases or benefit reductions. The taxable wage base for Social Security payroll tax in 2015 is $118,500. Exempt wage amounts under the retirement earnings test are $15,720 for workers under full retirement age and $41,880 for workers at full retirement age in 2015. The substantial gainful activity (SGA) threshold for blind individuals receiving Social Security disability benefits is $1,820 in 2015. These program elements are adjusted annually based on the national average wage index, with no adjustment if there is no COLA. The absence of a Social Security COLA in 2016 affects beneficiaries of various programs, including low-income elderly, disabled persons, veterans, and federal civil service annuitants. This results in no COLA increase for Supplemental Security Income, Veterans' Pension Benefit Programs, and Railroad Retirement Board Programs. Medicare Part B enrollees may also be impacted as most have their premiums withheld from their Social Security benefits. In 2016, due to a 0% Social Security COLA, about 70% of Medicare beneficiaries had their Part B premiums protected from increasing under the hold-harmless provision. However, 30% of beneficiaries, including higher-income enrollees and new Medicare Part B enrollees, were not covered by this provision. Enrollees, including those not receiving Social Security benefits and low-income individuals with Medicaid-paid premiums, may face significantly higher Part B premiums without the hold harmless provision. COLAs for programs like CSRS and Military Retirement System use the same measurement period as Social Security. FERS also aligns its COLA measurement period with Social Security but uses a modified formula. Disabled veterans and certain survivors do not have automatic inflation indexing for benefits. Disabled veterans and certain survivors do not have automatic inflation indexing for benefits, but Congress enacts legislation each year to provide a COLA equal to the Social Security COLA for Veterans' Disability Compensation and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) for Survivors."
