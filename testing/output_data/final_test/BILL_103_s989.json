    "content": "The Aviation Industry Revitalization Act of 1993 may be cited as the \"Aviation Industry Revitalization Act of 1993\". It declares a policy regarding the aviation industry. The United States commercial airline industry is facing severe financial distress, with record losses and excessive debt burdens leading to the cancellation of new aircraft orders. Air carriers are struggling to obtain financing for new equipment, which may jeopardize the phaseout of older, noisier aircraft. Increasing the average fuel efficiency of aircraft could benefit both the conservation of natural resources and the reduction of fuel costs. Increasing the average fuel-efficiency of aircraft fleets would benefit various stakeholders such as states, local communities, aerospace manufacturing companies, airline employees, and shareholders. Establishing a revolving fund for a Federal loan guarantee program to support the financing of new, modern, fuel-efficient aircraft is recommended to ensure economic stimulus and industry competitiveness. The airline industry is phasing out older, less fuel-efficient aircraft to improve overall efficiency and reduce noise levels. SEC. 9310 of the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 authorizes the guarantee of financing for new aircraft. The Secretary is authorized to guarantee loans for new aircraft financing for air carriers meeting specified conditions. A fund called the 'New Aircraft Guarantee Program Fund' is established in the Treasury for this purpose. The Fund consists of fees and surcharges for the loan guarantee program. Amounts are available to the Secretary without further appropriations. Initial authorization allows for necessary sums to pay administrative expenses. Terms and conditions for loan guarantees include the delivery of new aircraft. The loan guarantee program requires the delivery of new aircraft to an air carrier by December 31, 1999, for the purpose of financing new aircraft that meet stage 3 noise standards. Guarantees are only available for purchases from companies that disclose audited financial information and are based in countries compliant with international aerospace trade agreements. The loan guarantee program requires air carriers to deliver new aircraft by December 31, 1999, to finance planes meeting stage 3 noise standards. Guarantees are available for purchases from companies in compliance with international aerospace trade agreements. Air carriers must agree to remove aging or Stage 2 aircraft within the contiguous United States upon receiving new financed aircraft. The loan guarantee program mandates air carriers to replace aging or Stage 2 aircraft in the contiguous United States with new planes meeting stage 3 noise standards. If an air carrier is receiving only all-cargo aircraft, they can modify existing Stage 2 aircraft to meet the noise standards instead. The loan guarantee program requires air carriers to replace aging or Stage 2 aircraft in the contiguous United States with new planes meeting stage 3 noise standards. Air carriers receiving only all-cargo aircraft can modify existing Stage 2 aircraft to meet the noise standards instead. Any aircraft removed from service must be taken off the registry of certificated aircraft by the Secretary, unless it is used solely outside the contiguous United States. The loan guarantee program requires air carriers to replace aging or Stage 2 aircraft in the contiguous United States with new planes meeting stage 3 noise standards. Air carriers must warrant that they did not, after April 1, 1993, and will not on and after the date of delivery, take delivery of a new aircraft financed under this section if it is not in compliance with Stage 3 noise standards. The air carrier must not place aging or Stage 2 aircraft in service after April 1, 1993, except in specific circumstances like mergers, acquisitions, route purchases, or leases agreed upon before April 30, 1993. Violation of this warranty is prohibited. The Secretary may revoke loan guarantees for an air carrier violating warranty terms. Waivers allowing operation of Stage 2 aircraft after 1999 are prohibited. Regulations for the loan guarantee program must be implemented within sixty days. The Secretary must fulfill fiduciary duties to implement the program. The Secretary must apply fiduciary standards when making loan guarantees, ensuring repayment and requiring sufficient collateral. Loan amounts guaranteed cannot exceed 85% of the aircraft manufacturer's price. Fees may be assessed for loan guarantees. The Secretary must apply fiduciary standards when making loan guarantees, ensuring repayment and requiring sufficient collateral. Loan amounts guaranteed cannot exceed 85% of the aircraft manufacturer's price. Fees, including subsidy fees, annual administrative fees, and surcharges, are assessed for loan guarantees under this section. The Secretary administers loan guarantee program fees to cover expenses. Adjustments are made annually to assess adequacy of fee collections. A surcharge or rebate is applied as needed. An annual report is submitted to relevant committees. The Secretary administers a loan guarantee program and submits an annual report to relevant committees. The report describes the program's progress, identifies any problems, and details the loan guarantees made, including the recipients. Definitions for \"aging aircraft\" and \"air carrier; United States\" are provided in the section. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms related to the New Aircraft Guarantee Program Fund, including \"Fund,\" \"new aircraft,\" and \"remove from service.\" These definitions clarify the eligibility criteria and processes involved in the program. The curr_chunk defines \"Stage 2 aircraft\" and \"Stage 3 aircraft\" in relation to regulations on aircraft use in common carriage outside the United States."
