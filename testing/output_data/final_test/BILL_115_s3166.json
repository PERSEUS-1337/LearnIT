During World War II, the Army formed 6 Ranger Battalions and 1 provisional battalion, all consisting of volunteers. The concept of Ranger units was inspired by British commando units and the US military tradition of using light infantry for scouting and raiding operations. The Ranger Battalions included the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Infantry Battalions activated at different locations and dates. During World War II, the Army formed 6 Ranger Battalions and 1 provisional battalion, all consisting of volunteers. The 4th Ranger Infantry Battalion was activated on May 29, 1943, in North Africa, and consolidated on July 21, 1943. The 5th Ranger Infantry Battalion was activated on September 1, 1943, at Camp Forrest, Tennessee. The 6th Ranger Infantry Battalion was originally activated on January 20. The Army formed 6 Ranger Battalions and 1 provisional battalion during World War II, all consisting of volunteers. The first combat operations of Army Rangers occurred on August 19, 1942, during a raid on Dieppe. During the North African campaign, the 1st Ranger Battalion led by Major William O. Darby achieved success in difficult battles, leading to the formation of 2 additional Ranger Battalions. The Battalion was awarded battle honors for actions in Tunisia, including capturing enemy positions and defending against the German Afrika Korps. The 29th provisional Ranger Battalion, formed from volunteers of the 29th Infantry Division, demonstrated courage in raids in Norway and France. After a successful raid on a German radar site, the Battalion was disbanded to make way for new Ranger units. During 1943, the 1st, 3d, and 4th Ranger Battalions were active in Sicily and Italy. The 1st and 4th Rangers secured landing beaches in Sicily, while the 3d Battalion silenced gun positions in Licata. In Italy, the 1st and 4th Rangers seized high ground at Maori despite being outnumbered by enemy forces. After the invasion of Italy, Rangers continued to be used in night attacks to seize key terrain ahead of advancing Allied forces. At the Anzio beachhead, the majority of the 1st, 3d, and 4th Ranger Battalions sustained heavy casualties after being cut off behind German lines. Only 6 Rangers out of more than 767 men returned to friendly lines after a failed mission to infiltrate German positions. The 4th Battalion, along with two other battalions, suffered heavy casualties and were inactivated. The 2nd and 5th Ranger Battalions were formed for operations in Western Europe, engaging in combat on D-Day at Pointe du Hoc. Rangers in the 2nd Battalion, led by Lieutenant Colonel James E. Rudder, overcame obstacles to secure the cliffs against German forces. During June, July, and August of 1944, the 2d and 5th Ranger Battalions were engaged in close-range fighting in hedgerows and villages in Brest. In Western Germany, they attacked in darkness to secure vital positions for the main Army attacks. The 5th Ranger Battalion was commended for outstanding performance during the final drive into Germany in late February and early March 1945. The 6th Ranger Battalion earned battle honors for seizing high ground in German lines, resulting in heavy casualties during 5 days of fighting. Their actions allowed the main Army attack to overcome German defenses, capture Trier, and reach the Rhine River. In the Pacific, the Battalion rescued over 500 Allied prisoners from the Cabanatuan POW camp in the Philippines in 1945. The 1st Ranger Infantry Battalion, led by Lieutenant Colonel Henry A. Mucci, demonstrated heroism by infiltrating Japanese-held territory to rescue prisoners of war at the Cabanatuan camp in the Philippines. They successfully killed all Japanese sentries, returned to American lines with minimal casualties, and participated in various campaigns. The 2d Ranger Infantry Battalion participated in campaigns in Normandy, Northern France, Rhineland, Ardennes-Alsace, and Central Europe. They received the Presidential Unit Citation with streamers embroidered with \"EL GUETTAR\" and \"SALERNO\" for their contributions.
