    "title": "AB 1382",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 368 of the Penal Code is amended to provide special protections for elders and dependent adults, similar to those for minor children. This is due to their potential confusion, medication use, mental or physical impairments, and inability to protect themselves or report crimes. Willfully causing harm or suffering to an elder or dependent adult under conditions likely to result in great bodily harm or death is prohibited. Willfully causing harm or endangering the health of an elder or dependent adult is punishable by imprisonment or a fine. If the victim suffers great bodily injury, the defendant will receive an additional term in prison based on the victim's age. Any person who knows or reasonably should know that a person is an elder or dependent adult and willfully causes them to suffer unjustifiable physical or mental pain will face imprisonment. If the victim is under 70 years old, the defendant will receive a five-year term, while if the victim is 70 years or older, the term will be seven years. Any caretaker who causes harm to an elder or dependent adult, or places them in a dangerous situation, is guilty of a misdemeanor. Repeat offenses can result in a fine or jail time. Non-caretakers who commit theft, forgery, or fraud against elders or dependent adults face punishment if they knew or should have known about the victim's status. Any individual who unlawfully takes or obtains money, goods, or services exceeding $950 may face a fine up to $2,500, imprisonment up to one year, or both. For amounts under $950, the penalty is a fine up to $1,000, imprisonment up to one year, or both. Any caretaker of an elder or dependent adult who commits theft, embezzlement, forgery, fraud, or identity theft involving property or personal information of the elder or dependent adult faces a fine up to $2,500, imprisonment up to one year, or both. If the value of the stolen property exceeds $950, the penalty increases to a fine up to $10,000, imprisonment for two to four years, or both. Any person who commits false imprisonment of an elder or dependent adult by violence, menace, fraud, or deceit faces imprisonment for two to four years. \"Elder\" refers to a person aged 65 or older, while \"dependent adult\" refers to a person between 18 and 64 with physical or mental limitations. A \"dependent adult\" refers to a person between 18 and 64 years of age with physical or mental limitations. A \"caretaker\" is defined as a person who has the care, custody, or control of an elder or dependent adult. In cases of violating these provisions, the court may require counseling as a condition of probation. The defendant must pay for their participation in the counseling program as determined by the court, considering their ability to pay. No defendant shall be denied probation due to inability to pay."
