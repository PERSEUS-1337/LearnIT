The Administrator shall establish a Water Quality Research Technical Advisory Committee to review and comment on the program plan for water pollution control research. The committee will advise on the development and implementation of the program plan annually. The Water Quality Research Technical Advisory Committee advises the Administrator annually on priority needs for water pollution control research, makes recommendations on innovative processes for subsidization, and reviews the results of research and technology demonstration. The Water Quality Research Technical Advisory Committee is composed of 7 members appointed by the Administrator based on recommendations from the National Academy of Sciences. Members must have experience in water pollution control research. They serve without compensation but receive travel expenses. The Committee meets at least 4 times a year. The Water Quality Research Technical Advisory Committee, composed of 7 members appointed by the Administrator, meets at least 4 times a year. The Committee will terminate 5 years after its establishment. The Administrator must report to Congress annually on the program plan's status and results, including the Committee's comments. SEC. 7. TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM FOR WATER QUALITY ENHANCEMENT AND MANAGEMENT. Amends Title I of the Act to include a new section 123 for a technology demonstration program focused on water quality enhancement and management. The Administrator will establish a nationwide demonstration program to promote technology innovations and alternative approaches to water quality management, as well as reduce costs for municipalities complying with the Act. The program will consist of 10 projects per year in selected municipalities based on submitted plans. The nationwide demonstration program aims to address adverse water quality impacts in ecosystems by working with the Water Quality Research Technical Advisory Committee, state agencies, and stakeholders. It includes a strategy for municipalities to achieve water quality goals effectively and at reduced costs compared to traditional methods mandated by the Act. The nationwide demonstration program aims to address adverse water quality impacts in ecosystems by working with the Water Quality Research Technical Advisory Committee, state agencies, and stakeholders. It includes a schedule for achieving municipality goals and selecting projects to advance innovative approaches in addressing various water quality issues. The Administrator is responsible for selecting municipalities based on specific criteria. The Administrator is responsible for selecting municipalities for a nationwide demonstration program to address water quality impacts. The program aims to include projects reflecting diverse geographic distribution and nontraditional approaches, prioritize projects addressing multiple issues, and ensure grants for small communities with populations of 10,000 or less. The nationwide demonstration program addresses water quality impacts by selecting municipalities for projects with diverse approaches. Grants are prioritized for small communities with populations of 10,000 or less, with a cap of 25% of funds per municipality. Projects require a 20% non-Federal cost share, and municipalities must submit effectiveness reports to the Administrator and Congress. The Administrator will compile and submit reports to Congress every 2 years on the status and results of the demonstration program. Successful project results will be incorporated into Administrator-administered programs. $20,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2003 to 2007."
