Congress acknowledges that the economy has not been benefiting working families in the United States, with wages stagnating despite increased productivity and GDP. The wealth gap has widened, posing a threat to democracy and the well-being of many families struggling to afford basic necessities. The economic crisis in the United States is exacerbated by high unemployment rates, leading to low wages and decreased bargaining power for workers. This has resulted in a significant portion of corporate profits going to executives, leaving the majority of workers behind since 1980. The Congressional Budget Office's estimate of full employment contrasts with the 1949-1979 era when the US economy was below full employment only 31% of the time. This weak labor market has had significant consequences for workers, with women's median wages rising by only 20.6% since 1979, while men's wages have fallen by 8.9% despite a 64.3% growth in economy-wide productivity. Workers' share of corporate income has significantly decreased from 82.3 percent in 2000 to 75.5 percent today, resulting in a $535 billion loss in earnings this year. Hourly wages for the bottom 70 percent of the workforce have fallen between 2002 and 2014, indicating wage stagnation across income levels. Highly educated workers are also facing challenges in the current labor market. Even highly educated workers are struggling in the economy, with wages for college-educated and advanced-degree workers declining in recent years. Congress has mandated the Federal Reserve to pursue maximum employment and stable prices, aiming for full employment with a 2 percent inflation rate. Since the Great Recession, the US economy has consistently had high unemployment and low inflation rates, causing harm to millions of people. The current economic situation in the United States is causing harm to millions of people. Long-term unemployment, high involuntary part-time employment, and a depressed labor force participation rate are key indicators of the weak economy. Despite no evidence that a 3-4% inflation rate would be harmful, many believe the Federal Reserve should aim for stable prices. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System treats its 2-percent inflation target as a ceiling, consistently raising interest rates prematurely during recoveries. Inflation remains below the 2-percent target and shows no signs of accelerating uncontrollably. In the late 1990s, the US economy reached genuine full employment with benefits like higher wages for everyone. In the late 1990s, the US economy reached genuine full employment with benefits like higher wages for everyone, robust wage gains for African-Americans and Hispanics, and a large Federal budget surplus. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System resisted pressures to raise interest rates, allowing the unemployment rate to continue to fall. Achieving genuine full employment should be the foremost economic priority of the United States. Achieving genuine full employment should be the foremost economic priority of the United States, with all branches of the Federal Government using their full power to accomplish this goal. The Federal Reserve Act is amended to define maximum employment as an economy with an unemployment rate of not more than 4 percent and stable inflation."
