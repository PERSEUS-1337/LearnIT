    "content": "Exports of Alaskan North Slope oil are addressed in an amendment to Section 28 of the Mineral Leasing Act. The amendment allows for the export of Alaskan North Slope oil unless the President determines it is not in the national interest. Factors considered include the impact on petroleum availability and results of an environmental review. The President may impose terms and conditions on the export of Alaskan North Slope oil if it is determined to be in the national interest, considering potential adverse effects on the environment and the impact on oil supply shortages and prices. The President can impose restrictions on the export of Alaskan North Slope oil to ensure it aligns with the national interest. Oil transported by pipeline in Alaska must be exported on U.S.-owned and documented vessels, except in specific circumstances. This does not limit the President's authority under various acts. The Secretary of Commerce will issue rules for implementing the President's national interest determination regarding oil exports within 30 days. If exporting oil causes sustained shortages or high prices, the Secretary may take action to address adverse effects. If exporting oil causes sustained material adverse employment effects in the United States, the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, may recommend action to the President, including modifying or revoking export authority. Administrative action in this regard is not subject to certain sections of the United States Code. The GAO will provide a report. The Comptroller General will review energy production in California and Alaska, including the effects of Alaskan North Slope oil exports on consumers, refiners, and shipbuilding industries in the West Coast and Hawaii. A report will be provided to Congress with findings and recommendations to address job loss and adverse impacts. The Comptroller General will review the impact of Alaska North Slope oil exports on consumers and refiners in the West Coast and Hawaii. The House of Representatives passed the document on July 24, 1995, with Robin H. Carle as the Clerk."
