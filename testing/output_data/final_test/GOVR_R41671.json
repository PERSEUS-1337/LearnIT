    "content": "Adaptive management is the process of incorporating new scientific and programmatic information into project implementation to ensure goals are efficiently met. It promotes flexible decision-making to modify or create activities based on new circumstances. The federal government has embraced adaptive management for natural resource management, endorsed by scientists, land managers, and academic observers. Some criticize adaptive management for its limited ability to bring about meaningful change in projects due to constraints and political influences. Congressional interest in adaptive management has focused on its role in guiding federal efforts to restore large-scale ecosystems like wetlands. Management has been proposed as a guiding principle for large-scale ecosystem restoration efforts like the Everglades, Chesapeake Bay, and Lake Tahoe. Congress has authorized adaptive management programs to complement restoration by improving monitoring, research, and providing flexibility for management decisions. Previous experience with adaptive management can inform Congress in authorizing new efforts and overseeing ongoing ones. The report provides background on adaptive management in ecosystem restoration, focusing on federal efforts in freshwater ecosystems. It analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of adaptive management and offers preliminary issues for Congress to consider in funding and oversight. Adaptive management was introduced in the 1970s to address conservation challenges in uncertain and changing ecosystems. Adaptive management in ecosystem restoration has evolved into passive and active forms. Passive adaptive management focuses on choosing the best management option at key decision points based on available information, while active adaptive management involves testing multiple hypotheses and exploring various options throughout implementation to achieve the best outcomes. Active adaptive management involves selecting the best path for achieving objectives by monitoring and incorporating results from experiments. It is more costly but provides more information about the ecosystem. The flexibility of adaptive management can help solve complex technical problems and engage stakeholders in decision-making. The implementation of adaptive management in ecosystem restoration initiatives involves stakeholder input and can create uncertainty. There is no standard model for adaptive management, but common elements exist in many efforts. Adaptive management programs in ecosystem restoration involve setting objectives, using models of the system, and conducting scientific experimentation and monitoring to achieve goals. Individual program variations are detailed in case studies provided in the Appendix. Adaptive management programs involve setting objectives, using models, conducting experiments, and monitoring progress. Management options are necessary for adaptive management, which may involve stakeholder input and mechanisms to incorporate change. The National Research Council examined adaptive management in the context of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' management of water resources in 2004. The study found multiple views and definitions of adaptive management being applied to agency projects throughout the federal government, with no statutory definition of adaptive management. Research indicates that the application of internal agency definitions of adaptive management varies widely at the project level. The U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) Technical Guide defines adaptive management as a decision process that promotes flexible decision making in the face of uncertainties, allowing for adjustments based on better understanding of outcomes. It involves careful monitoring of outcomes to advance scientific understanding and adjust policies or operations in an iterative learning process, recognizing the importance of natural variability in ecological resilience and productivity. Adaptive management is a decision process that promotes flexible decision making in the face of uncertainties, emphasizing learning while doing. It aims to enhance benefits, meet environmental, social, and economic goals, increase scientific knowledge, and reduce tensions among stakeholders. The Technical Guide provides information on when and how adaptive management should be used, and a problem-scoping key to determine its appropriateness under specific circumstances. The guide advises on the implementation of adaptive management, including assessing the problem, designing the framework, implementing the program, monitoring results, evaluating progress, and making necessary adjustments. In 2000, federal agencies adopted a unified policy for a \"watershed approach\" to federal land management to achieve Clean Water Act goals. The unified policy for federal land management adopted in 2000 aimed to achieve the goals of the Clean Water Act through adaptive management. This approach involves testing, monitoring, and evaluating strategies based on scientific findings and societal needs to improve watershed conditions. The policy emphasized collaboration with stakeholders and using scientific information for designing and implementing watershed planning and management programs. The legislation proposed in 2009 aimed to develop an adaptive management plan for the Chesapeake Bay watershed, but it was not enacted into law. The White House Council on Environmental Quality also proposed incorporating adaptive management into water resource projects for federal agencies. The proposed guidelines for water resource projects suggest incorporating adaptive management to avoid and minimize adverse impacts. However, a formal definition and specific implementation details are lacking. Other agencies, like the U.S. Forest Service, use adaptive management in projects such as the Northwest Forest Plan. The Northwest Forest Plan and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers utilize adaptive management in ecosystem restoration initiatives. The EPA also incorporates adaptive management in environmental projects. Adaptive management is a key strategy used by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other organizations for managing natural resources. It involves developing a plan, monitoring, evaluating results, and adjusting management plans. This approach is applied in various areas such as national oceans policy, species conservation, and ecosystem restoration in freshwater habitats. The report focuses on applying adaptive management to large-scale ecosystem restoration, which involves scientific, managerial, cultural, and political factors. There are differing opinions on the effectiveness of adaptive management in restoring complex ecosystems, with observers noting both benefits and difficulties in federal efforts. Adaptive management is used in ecosystem restoration to address uncertainties and test alternatives for restoring ecosystems. It aims to lead to robust decisions, efficient investments, and quicker goal achievement. Benefits include initiating restoration efforts in the presence of scientific uncertainty. Adaptive management in ecosystem restoration addresses uncertainties and allows for flexibility in dealing with changing circumstances over long time periods, up to 50 years or more. It helps in addressing unforeseen shifts in the ecosystem due to climatic conditions, species composition, and habitat alteration. Adaptive management in ecosystem restoration involves creating formal monitoring networks and processes to track progress and provide consistent information over time. Stakeholder buy-in is increased through formal participation, allowing for input on desirable changes and societal/cultural inputs. Additionally, it serves as an oversight tool for ecosystem restoration. Adaptive management in ecosystem restoration serves as an oversight tool for monitoring progress and evaluating the effectiveness of restoration strategies. It also helps generate fundamental information about the ecosystem being restored by improving understanding of ecosystem functions and facilitating the construction of predictive models. Despite challenges in implementation, adaptive management has the potential to inform reflection on program goals and drive future responses. The appendix to the report discusses common themes hindering adaptive management programs, such as issues connecting science to resource management, challenges in achieving consensus for changes, and limitations in implementing changes. Connecting experimentation to operational changes is a major challenge for adaptive management. Adaptive management programs often fail to result in significant long-term changes due to weak linkages between planning, assessments, and outcomes. Recommendations are made to groups or officials but are not always implemented automatically. Traditional regulatory and political processes still play a crucial role in major changes. The concept aims to use science to guide project pathways, but scientific conclusions are not always clear and can lead to differing interpretations. Adaptive management programs face challenges in reaching consensus among stakeholders when scientific conclusions are unclear. Lack of flexibility to make changes to a program can hinder the effectiveness of adaptive management. Assurances to stakeholders, such as legal or financial constraints, can limit the scope of changes that can be implemented. Adaptive management programs may face limitations in flexibility due to constraints like resource availability or funding. Undefined objectives and performance measures can hinder progress, leading to delays in taking action. Stakeholder disagreements and uncertainties in outcomes can also impede the success of adaptive management efforts. Adaptive management in ecosystem restoration projects can face challenges, leading to delays in decision-making. Specific examples of adaptive management in various locations are discussed in the report's appendix. Factors like project complexity and timing influence the success of adaptive management efforts. Adaptive management is crucial for ecosystem restoration projects, but its effectiveness can vary depending on project complexity. It may be challenging to determine the best restoration approach, especially for complex initiatives involving multiple stakeholders and needs. The Glen Canyon Adaptive Management Program is an example of how adaptive management is used to address complex issues over time. The program for ecosystem restoration involves various stakeholders and complex issues. Disagreements among interest groups have caused setbacks in long-term restoration efforts related to dam operations. Adaptive management can be applied to evaluate and adjust existing restoration projects for optimum results. The Everglades program is using adaptive management to oversee restoration projects already in progress. Adaptive management is being utilized in ecosystem restoration projects to optimize operations and potentially prioritize future initiatives. The size and scope of adaptive management programs can vary, with some making minor adjustments to existing projects while others involve more controversial changes at the programmatic level. Adaptive management initiatives in ecosystem restoration projects involve significant changes that can face regulatory hurdles. Leadership and coordination responsibilities vary, with some initiatives giving more control to the federal government. Critics argue for increased stakeholder involvement to improve decision-making and project buy-in. Some efforts have formal stakeholder engagement structures but still maintain federal control. The Glen Canyon Adaptive Management Program allows non-federal stakeholders to participate in a Working Group responsible for analyzing results and making recommendations to the Secretary of the Interior. However, the federal government retains significant control by having its own representatives in the group. The Chair is selected by the Secretary of the Interior, potentially preserving traditional decision-making authority. Some adaptive management initiatives opt for collaborative leadership structures, like the Platte River program developed by multiple parties. The program's Governance Committee rotates leadership among five original signatories, diluting the federal role. Day-to-day duties are handled by an executive director chosen by the Committee. This collaborative approach may require the federal government to relinquish some traditional decision-making authority. The government may need to give up some traditional leadership authority in adaptive management efforts, but involving third parties like professional mediators can increase stakeholder buy-in. Initiatives like the Platte River Implementation Program hire non-federal Executive Directors to coordinate science and outreach. Some programs also utilize third party conflict resolution specialists to facilitate discussions among stakeholders. Professional mediators are seen as crucial for consensus building in adaptive management efforts. The roles of federal, state, and local stakeholders in adaptive management efforts are crucial. Initiatives like the Missouri River Recovery Program and the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Program involve diverse stakeholders in governance structures. The Missouri River Implementation Committee and the CERP adaptive management plan allow stakeholders to provide recommendations and comments to the Corps. The Everglades restoration plan involves multiple stakeholders providing comments on monitoring and restoration efforts, but the direct impact of these comments on decisions is unclear. The challenge lies in reaching consensus and providing substantive recommendations for adaptive management efforts. A smaller working group representing various interests has been designated for the Glen Canyon Adaptive Management Program to expedite debate, although fundamental value issues may still persist. Some argue that making a group \"advisory\" to the federal government may dilute its power and stakeholder investment. The use of federally appointed representatives in adaptive management could lead to charges of non-representation. Decision rules are crucial in adaptive management efforts, determining final recommendations by a governance body. Different approaches to decision rules have pros and cons, impacting collaborative efforts. Most efforts incorporating adaptive management prefer consensus-based decision-making to consider multiple interests, but face challenges when consensus is not reached. Some initiatives involve stakeholders in decision-making, while others retain central decision authority within the federal government. The Platte River program is an example of such efforts. When consensus cannot be reached, efforts like the Platte River program use a 9/10 vote requirement to make decisions. This approach ensures all stakeholders negotiate and reach a recommendation, but it can also make it challenging to reach a final decision, especially in contentious disputes. A super-majority vote may be used as an alternative when consensus is not achieved. The decision-making model with a super-majority vote is utilized when consensus cannot be reached. For example, the Glen Canyon program requires 2/3 of its 25 members to pass a recommendation in such cases. This method can be helpful for contentious efforts involving multiple stakeholders. However, some argue that this approach may discourage collaboration by removing the incentive to negotiate. Clear rules on these votes could help maintain good-faith negotiations. Another method for making decisions in adaptive management efforts is to use a forum to solicit input on federal efforts from a wide range of sources. The federal government may play a strong role in decision-making for adaptive management efforts by soliciting input from non-federal stakeholders. Their preferences are shared in workshops or meetings and then considered by federal decision-makers, who may choose to make changes without strictly following stakeholder recommendations. This model protects federal authority while incorporating various interests. Adaptive management involves federal government seeking input from non-federal stakeholders to consider various interests in decision-making. Some argue this inclusive approach is preferable to decisions made by a small group of representatives. However, lack of clearly defined objectives and milestones can hinder implementation. Adaptive management requires clear and measurable goals for successful implementation. The Glen Canyon Adaptive Management Plan lacked measurable objectives, which slowed the working group's progress. Incorporating quantified Desired Future Conditions may improve the effectiveness of adaptive management. The Glen Canyon AMWG lacked measurable objectives, hindering progress. The Platte River Program achieved restoration by setting specific goals and milestones before implementing adaptive management. Policy makers must decide whether to start experimentation before agreeing on objectives. Ecosystem restoration initiatives with adaptive management need to balance experimentation and goal-setting. The adaptive management process requires a balance between flexibility and certainty for stakeholders. While flexibility is crucial for achieving defined goals, it can create uncertainty among stakeholders who rely on certain resources. Policy mechanisms have been developed to address this balance. Several policy mechanisms have been created to fine-tune the balance between flexibility and certainty in ecosystem restoration initiatives with adaptive management. These mechanisms aim to establish limits to the flexibility of adaptive management by anticipating foreseen circumstances and creating mitigation plans. Stakeholders are provided with a clear picture of how adaptive management could change the trajectory of a program or project, reducing uncertainty. However, this approach also limits the flexibility of the process to foreseen circumstances. Some ecosystem restoration initiatives have fundamental assurances or boundaries that limit flexibility for change, such as legal assurances associated with specific programs. Stakeholder involvement in the adaptive management process can help reduce uncertainty. Stakeholder involvement in the adaptive management process can lower uncertainty by allowing input and increasing buy-in. Congressional guidance for federal adaptive management programs varies, from authorizing agencies to prescribing a process in legislation. Congress has historically refrained from providing extensive guidance, often leaving details up to the agency or providing broad authorization language. The executive branch may interpret broad authorization language as a mandate for adaptive management programs. Some programs, like the Platte River program, have been initiated without Congressional guidance. Congress could choose to maintain a limited role in authorizing adaptive management programs, giving the executive branch autonomy but making them responsible for addressing concerns. Some believe that more guidance from Congress could help solve difficulties with adaptive management efforts. If Congress decides to play a greater role, there are potential areas of interest for policymakers. If Congress decides to play a greater role in adaptive management efforts, they could provide guidance by designating a federal representative, assigning stakeholders to oversee the program, and mandating specific procedures for implementation. Congress could play a greater role in adaptive management by specifying procedures, setting goals, and providing assurances to stakeholders in ecosystem restoration initiatives. This could include requiring changes to operations be subject to a vote by a working group, setting formal restoration goals, and establishing a reporting process on progress. Congress may provide assurances to stakeholders in adaptive management efforts by specifying requirements that will not significantly alter ongoing operations or resource allocations. Variations in actions can be considered to better suit the needs of individual ecosystem restoration initiatives, as a one-size-fits-all approach may not be effective due to differing objectives, resources, and scope. For example, initiatives impacting water supplies may require assurances in legislation to limit water restoration requirements, while plans addressing endangered species may need assurances on specific procedures. Federal agencies may benefit from broad authority to develop adaptive management plans for threatened or endangered species, as it allows for greater flexibility in the long run. While prescriptive congressional guidance could clarify issues, it may also face criticism and require more difficult amendments. Increasing congressional oversight of adaptive management in restoration could be another approach to address these concerns. Congress could increase oversight of adaptive management in restoration initiatives by conducting hearings, requiring periodic reviews by independent evaluators, and addressing issues such as stakeholder representation and management structures. The implementation of adaptive management can be challenging despite its straightforward concept of using science and monitoring to guide projects towards their goals. Adaptive management faces challenges due to political, economic, and cultural constraints, hindering its effectiveness in achieving goals. Stakeholder interests and the balance between flexibility and certainty can impede the implementation of adaptive management programs. Stakeholder resistance may arise if the program significantly impacts their interests. Adaptive management programs face challenges due to stakeholder resistance and the complexity of resource challenges. Implementing changes in response to research and monitoring is crucial for effectiveness, but finding a compromise between stakeholders' interests can be difficult. Stakeholders may not fully commit to long-term changes in objectives, especially if it involves giving up something important. Implementing monitoring and experimentation stages is easier than collaboration and decision-making, and meaningful ecosystem changes from restorative actions can take years to measure. Meaningful changes in ecosystems due to restorative actions can take years to measure. Adaptive management initiatives face governance challenges, including federal and non-federal roles in leadership, decision-making processes, collaboration among stakeholders, and setting quantitative goals. Congress has provided limited guidance on adaptive management, which is guiding large-scale ecosystem restoration initiatives and is expected to play a significant role in future projects. Adaptive management is guiding ecosystem restoration initiatives and may see increased congressional involvement in the future. Case studies show varying levels of maturity and approaches to governance and implementation. The Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Program is a comprehensive example of adaptive management in the United States, initiated in 1997 in response to the Grand Canyon Protection Act. It aims to mitigate impacts on downstream resources of the Colorado River while adhering to existing laws governing the river. The Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Program (AMP) was established in 1997 to address competing requirements of the Colorado River. The AMP is governed by the Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Working Group (AMWG), a Federal Advisory Committee responsible for making recommendations to the Secretary of the Interior regarding dam operations. The Working Group consists of 25 representatives from various federal, state, private, and non-profit groups appointed by the Secretary. Meetings are held biannually, and decisions are made using a collaborative decision model to seek consensus. The AMWG employs a collaborative decision model for consensus and active adaptive management, running experimental water flows to assess ecosystem impacts. It considers input from sub-groups like the GCMRC and Technical Working Group, as well as reviews from an independent science advisory panel. Recommendations for program changes are made to the Secretary of the Interior based on consensus or 2/3 majority votes. The Adaptive Management Program (AMP) has conducted experimental water flows for 13 years, monitored by the GCMRC. The program has improved scientific understanding of the Colorado River ecosystem, but critics argue it has not addressed the fundamental question of reconciling power generation with environmental flows. Critics have noted issues with the leadership, governance, and actions of the Adaptive Management Program (AMP) in reconciling power generation with environmental flows. They argue that the program lacks a feedback mechanism to adjust regulatory actions based on monitoring data and lacks measurable goals for restoration. The collaborative decision-making model under the AMP has also been criticized. The Working Group acknowledges the failure of AMP participants to reach consensus on important issues, citing a lack of collaboration as a major concern. Some criticize the 2/3 majority vote option for discouraging negotiation and collaboration, potentially leading to entrenched voting blocs. Criticisms also target the central authority within the Department of the Interior for having too much control over the AMP's funding and structure. Observers are divided on whether the challenges faced by the Glen Canyon program are unique or fundamental to adaptive management and collaborative decision-making processes. The Platte River Adaptive Management Plan is part of the larger Platte River Recovery Implementation Program, aiming to provide Endangered Species Act compliance for water-related activities in the basin. The Department of the Interior has proposed modifications to establish quantifiable targets for Desired Future Conditions, but agreement on quantitative targets is pending. The Cooperative Agreement between the Governors of Colorado, Nebraska, and Wyoming, and the Secretary of the Interior established a program to conserve federally listed species' habitat in the Platte River basin. A Governance Committee was formed to develop a detailed program for four target species, ensuring compliance under the ESA for water activities. The Adaptive Management Plan (AM Plan) was created in 2006 by the Governance Committee's Adaptive Management Working Group to guide all adaptive management efforts for the Platte River Recovery Implementation Program. The AM Plan for the Platte River Recovery Implementation Program includes four central objectives for species management and two priority hypotheses for testing. The Governance Committee, consisting of multiple stakeholders, makes policy decisions for adaptive management, requiring consensus or a 9/10 vote. The Platte River Implementation program is coordinated by a rotating chair from one of the signatory organizations. Subgroups provide technical and financial support, overseen by an Executive Director hired by the Governance Committee. The program's detailed plan was negotiated over 10 years but has not faced significant criticism. No major outside review has been conducted so far. The Glen Canyon AMWG has achieved consensus on major action items since 2007, with progress on hypothesis testing and program milestones. Only one vote was needed, passing nine to zero. The Governance Committee evaluates progress annually and considers changes. The Missouri River Recovery Program (MRRP) is in early development stages, authorized by Congress in 2007. The Missouri River Recovery Program (MRRP) was established by the Corps in 2008 to restore the Missouri River ecosystem and recover three federally listed species. The Corps is taking actions to meet the requirements of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's 2000 Biological Opinion. Adaptive management is a guiding principle for the initiative, with a draft framework published for conducting adaptive management activities. The program is expected to involve federal and non-federal entities, with ultimate management authority residing with the Corps. The Adaptive Management Work Group (AMWG) is proposed to lead the development of adaptive management strategies. The Adaptive Management Work Group (AMWG) is the primary entity leading the development of adaptive management strategies for the Missouri River Recovery Program (MRRP). It consists of Federal and State agencies, academics, and consulting expertise. The AMWG focuses on related actions/projects to inform project managers and product delivery teams within the Corps. Other entities also support adaptive management strategy development and implementation for the MRRP by providing scientific information and coordinating functions. The Missouri River Implementation Committee (MRRIC) serves as the primary non-federal collaborative forum for Missouri River recovery activities. The Missouri River Recovery Implementation Committee (MRRIC) was authorized in WRDA 2007 with 70 members, including non-governmental stakeholders, states, American Indian Tribes, and federal agencies. The committee makes advisory recommendations to the Secretary of the Army based on consensus votes, with no decision rules in place. While the Corps and FWS have committed to using adaptive management for the MRRP, a formal mechanism for non-federal stakeholder participation has not been finalized. The MRRIC has informally coordinated with the MRRP on adaptive management activities, including a sandbar habitat project and environmental assessment by the Corps. The Corps is working on an emergent sandbar habitat project and environmental assessment. The future adaptive management efforts may not fully incorporate the broad base of stakeholders reflected in the MRRIC. The Lower Colorado Multi-species Conservation Program aims to conserve 26 species with input from various interest groups. The Lower Colorado River Multi-species Conservation Program (MSCP) is a 50-year initiative to conserve 26 species while maintaining water and power supplies. The program was established in 2005 to achieve compliance under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) by consulting with the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) and Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). Non-federal entities received an incidental take permit for 50 years in exchange for supporting habitat and wildlife improvement efforts. The program is managed by various program documents. The Lower Colorado Adaptive Management Program (LCAMP) was developed by the MSCP to address scientific uncertainty in habitat creation and fish augmentation methods. It is implemented by the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) and involves consultation among the Program Manager, the Steering Committee, and scientific reviews to evaluate conservation measures under the MSCP. Adaptive management in the LCAMP involves consultation among the Program Manager, Steering Committee, and FWS. A monitoring program evaluates habitat creation and fish population techniques, providing data for modifying or developing projects. Proposed modifications are evaluated by the Steering Committee to ensure alignment with MSCP goals and budget limits. Changes are categorized as foreseen or unforeseen, with action plans and budgets reviewed by FWS for compliance with the incidental take permit. Proposed changes under the LCAMP fall into foreseen and unforeseen categories. Foreseen changes do not require amendments to existing documents and have remedial measures in place. Unforeseen changes are addressed within HCP regulations, with the Director determining their existence. Minor changes due to unforeseen circumstances may not require document amendments, providing assurance to stakeholders. The LCAMP allows for foreseen and unforeseen changes, with minor unforeseen changes not requiring document amendments, providing assurance to stakeholders. The federal government cannot demand additional resources or restrictions without stakeholder consent. The effectiveness of LCAMP has not been evaluated, but its success depends on addressing both foreseen and unforeseen circumstances in the program documents. The MSCP addresses foreseeable changes and mitigation measures, but does not directly address climate variability. It focuses on prioritizing water distribution for habitats to benefit covered species. Criticisms of adaptive management include concerns about flexibility and authority for implementing conservation changes. The MSCP has a process for making changes to the program involving approval by the Steering Committee and concurrence by the FWS. If a proposed change doesn't pass these steps, there is no additional process for implementation. Cooperation with the AMP is required, but the limits of what is practicable are undefined. The Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) aims to restore the shrinking Everglades ecosystem in Florida by increasing water storage for both natural and human use during wet and dry seasons. Federal restoration efforts are guided by the Water Resources Development Act of 2000, which authorizes the implementation of CERP to address new information and unforeseen circumstances. Adaptive management is an essential component of the Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP), which incorporates new scientific information and future changes. Funding was authorized for an adaptive assessment and monitoring program, with plans outlined in 2003. However, limited restoration projects have hindered the implementation of adaptive management. It is expected to be conducted at both programmatic and project levels to adjust monitoring plans, project components, sequencing, and operations as new projects are initiated. Adaptive management in the Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) is tailored to fit each project's complexity and management options. All ecosystem restoration projects under CERP must have an adaptive management plan structured to operate effectively under variable conditions. The Restoration, Coordination and Verification (RECOVER) team, guided by the 2003 regulations, oversees the science and monitoring of CERP with the RECOVER Leadership Group (RLG) as the primary coordinating body. The RECOVER team, consisting of 12 members, plays a key role in developing performance measures and evaluating projects under CERP. They are responsible for preparing reports, conducting assessments, and developing goals. However, actual changes to CERP are managed by the System Planning and Operations Team (SPOT) and the Corps of Engineers. Any proposed changes to CERP require consultation with federal, state, and tribal agencies, and fall into three categories. The RECOVER program in the Everglades involves making changes to project implementation, operational improvements, and adjustments to CERP. Significant changes require Congressional authorization. Adaptive management in the Everglades is guided by the CERP Adaptive Management Strategy and the CERP Adaptive Management Integration Guide. These documents aim to incorporate new scientific information and improve the South Florida ecosystem. The Everglades' adaptive management process involves stakeholder participation through reviewing reports, but lacks a formal advisory body. Constraints like the Federal Advisory Committee Act limit direct dialogue between government and non-government stakeholders. Few CERP projects have implemented adaptive management, with ongoing efforts to refine planning and receive feedback on the process. Critics of the current adaptive management process in the Everglades argue that stakeholder participation is limited to reviewing documents without a central forum for direct input. They believe this setup favors special interests and lacks transparency in decision-making. The Adaptive Management Strategy lacks transparency in decision-making regarding changes to CERP projects, with unclear processes for senior-level decision-makers to act upon recommendations. The Strategy aims to represent societal values, scientific input, and policy reconciliation in selecting preferred options."
