    "content": "Section 106(3) of the Copyright Act grants a copyright holder the exclusive right to distribute copies of a copyrighted work to the public by sale, rental, lease, or lending. Section 602(a) prohibits the importation of copies acquired outside the US without the copyright holder's authority. The \"first-sale\" doctrine in \u00a7 109(a) allows the owner of a lawfully made copy to sell or dispose of it without the copyright owner's permission. The \"first sale\" doctrine allows the owner of a lawfully made copy to sell or dispose of it without the copyright owner's permission. Once a copyrighted item is sold, the copyright owner loses control over its distribution. The Copyright Act's first sale doctrine allows the owner of a lawfully made copy to sell it without the copyright owner's permission, promoting the Progress of Science and useful Arts. This doctrine balances copyright holders' rights with the public's interest in owning tangible material. Gray-market goods are products imported into the U.S. without authorization. Gray-market goods, also known as parallel imports, are legitimate products imported into the United States without the authorization of the intellectual property holder. These goods are usually manufactured abroad and sold at discounted prices by third parties, bypassing authorized distribution channels. The legal question in Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Omega S.A. was whether a manufacturer's right to prohibit unauthorized importation of copyrighted works is exhausted by the initial foreign sale of copies made outside the United States. In Quality King Distributors, Inc. v. L'anza Research International, Inc., a California company sold copyrighted hair care products at different prices domestically and internationally. The products were manufactured in the US and sold with copyrighted labels. Gray-market goods were sold to a distributor in Malta, which were then bought and imported by Quality King Distributors for resale. Quality King Distributors bought copyrighted hair care products from a Malta distributor and imported them for resale in the US. L'anza sued for infringement of distribution and importation rights under the Copyright Act. The Supreme Court ruled that the first sale doctrine applies to imported copies of copyrighted works, limiting the copyright holder's distribution rights. The Supreme Court ruled that the first sale doctrine applies to imported copies of copyrighted works, limiting the copyright holder's distribution rights under the Copyright Act. The Supreme Court ruled that the first sale doctrine applies to imported copies of copyrighted works, limiting the copyright holder's distribution rights under the Copyright Act. The case involves a \"round trip\" journey of copies from the US to abroad and back, clarifying that copyright protection is territorial and does not extend beyond the nation's borders. Omega, a Swiss corporation, sells wristwatches worldwide with a copyrighted \"Omega Globe Design\" logo. Costco imported Omega watches from the gray market and sold them in the US without authorization, leading to a lawsuit for copyright infringement. Costco imported Omega watches from the gray market and sold them in the US without authorization, leading to a lawsuit for copyright infringement. Omega sued Costco for infringing its distribution and importation rights under the Copyright Act. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that the first sale doctrine does not apply to imported goods manufactured and first sold abroad, preventing Costco from using this defense against Omega's infringement claims. Costco argued that the Supreme Court's Quality King decision did not overrule the Ninth Circuit's general rule that the first sale doctrine is limited to copies legally made in the United States. The Ninth Circuit distinguished Quality King by applying it only to goods made in the US and then sold abroad without the copyright holder's consent. The appellate court explained that applying \u00a7 109(a) to copies made abroad would violate the presumption against extraterritorial application of U.S. law. Copies covered by \"lawfully made under [Title 17]\" in \u00a7 109(a) are not simply those made by the owner of a U.S. copyright, but must be made within the United States where the Copyright Act applies. The Ninth Circuit cited Justice Ginsburg's concurrence in Quality King, approving its interpretation of \u00a7 109(a). The court noted that its interpretation could allow a copyright holder to exercise distribution rights even after multiple sales of a foreign-made product in the US. However, the court's earlier precedents allowed the first sale defense in cases involving foreign-made copies if the copyright holder authorized a domestic sale. Since Omega did not authorize the domestic sales in this case, the court did not need to decide if this exception survived Quality King. The Supreme Court is considering whether the first-sale doctrine applies to imported goods manufactured abroad, based on a case involving Costco and copyright holder rights. Costco argued that the Ninth Circuit's distinction between goods made in the United States and those made abroad has no basis in the Copyright Act's first sale doctrine. They warned that upholding the Ninth Circuit's ruling could have severe consequences for the U.S. economy, as manufacturers may prefer to produce goods abroad to gain more control over sales and use. This could lead to retailers and consumers being hesitant to buy or sell such products due to potential liability for infringement. The Ninth Circuit's decision on the first-sale doctrine could lead to unintended liability for infringement, especially for goods manufactured abroad. Omega argued that importing or distributing copies made overseas could infringe on copyright owner's exclusive rights. This could have significant implications for libraries lending foreign books or movies. Omega contended that making copies abroad for foreign distribution falls outside the scope of the Copyright Act. Omega argued that Congress intended to allow for the segmentation of domestic and foreign markets in copyright law. The United States government supported the Ninth Circuit's decision in Costco, stating it aligns with existing copyright law interpretations. The government noted that potential adverse policy effects from Congress's decision in 1976 to expand Section 602's ban on unauthorized importation have not materialized. Congress can adjust the balance between copyright protection and other policy objectives. Elena Kagan recused herself from Costco v. Omega due to her previous involvement in the case. The Supreme Court's decision in Costco v. Omega was impacted by Justice Kagan's recusal, leading to a 4-4 split and an affirmed judgment without establishing precedent. The Ninth Circuit's ruling on the first sale doctrine for goods manufactured abroad remains in effect within that circuit, while other federal circuits are free to issue conflicting opinions.

The legal question may be revisited in a future case or through potential legislation to clarify the relationship between the Copyright Act's first sale provision and importation rights. This issue is of interest to various parties involved in the secondary markets of copyrighted goods."
