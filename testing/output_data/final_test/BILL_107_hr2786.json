    "content": "The term 'joint resolution' refers to a resolution introduced by a qualifying Member after the President's report on the deployment of a National Missile Defense system is received by Congress. The resolution must not have a preamble and must be titled 'Joint resolution relating to deployment of a National Missile Defense system.' A qualifying Member is specified for the House of Representatives. The joint resolution must be introduced by a designated Member of the House or Senate, as specified by the majority or minority leader. The provisions of the National Missile Defense Deployment Criteria Act of 2001 apply to the resolution in the same manner. Limitation on funds for procurement for National Missile Defense System. Limitation on funds for procurement for National Missile Defense System: No funds can be used for the system unless the President certifies adequate testing against countermeasures and a joint resolution is enacted. The certification must ensure a testing program is in place to meet identified threats and that sufficient ground and flight testing has been conducted. The joint resolution introduced by a qualifying Member after receiving the President's report concurs with the determination relating to testing against countermeasures for a National Missile Defense system. The Missile Defense Deployment Criteria Act of 2001 outlines the establishment of a program for operationally realistic testing against countermeasures for a National Missile Defense system. Qualifying Members designated by the majority or minority leaders of the House of Representatives or Senate can introduce a joint resolution related to this testing. If a committee does not report a joint resolution within 60 legislative days, it will be discharged and placed on the House calendar. Once reported or discharged, any Member can move to proceed with the resolution in the House of Representatives. The House allows a Member to move to proceed with a joint resolution the day after announcing their intention. The motion is privileged, not debatable, and cannot be amended or postponed. If agreed to, the House immediately considers the joint resolution as unfinished business. Debate is limited to two hours, divided equally between supporters and opponents, with no amendments allowed. The joint resolution process includes limitations on amendments, debate, and motions such as tabling or reconsideration. Appeals on procedural decisions are decided without debate. Senate consideration follows specific provisions, and if both Houses have similar joint resolutions, they are handled accordingly. If the House receives a joint resolution from the other House, specific procedures apply. The joint resolution from the other House cannot be referred to a committee and can only be considered for final passage. The House receiving the joint resolution will follow its usual procedure but will vote on the joint resolution from the other House for final passage. Once the joint resolution from the other House is dealt with, the original joint resolution from the receiving House cannot be considered. In the computation of the 60-day period for a joint resolution, a legislative day is a calendar day when the House is in session. The continuity of Congress session is broken only by an adjournment sine die at the end of the second session. These provisions are enacted by Congress as part of their rulemaking power and supersede other rules if inconsistent, recognizing the constitutional rights. The constitutional right of either House to change rules relating to procedures is recognized in the same manner and to the same extent as any other rule of that House. SEC. 5. OPERATIONALLY REALISTIC TESTING AGAINST COUNTERMEASURES FOR NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE. The Secretary of Defense directs the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization to include countermeasures in testing the National Missile Defense system before it becomes operational. This includes testing against likely decoys and determining the system's ability to discriminate between warheads. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Director of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, will determine additional funding needed for the National Missile Defense system to fulfill requirements for discriminating between warheads and countermeasures. The Secretary will submit this determination to Congress annually by April 15. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Director of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, will submit an annual report to Congress by April 15 on the Department's efforts to test the National Missile Defense system against countermeasures. The report will assess foreign countries' countermeasures, the system's ability to defeat them, and plans for demonstrating this capability. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Director of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, will submit an annual report to Congress on the National Missile Defense system's testing against countermeasures. An independent panel of scientific and technical experts will assess the countermeasures available, the system's operational effectiveness, and the adequacy of the testing program to demonstrate its capability. No annual report is required once the system becomes operational. The Panel evaluates the ground and flight testing of the National Missile Defense system against countermeasures to determine operational effectiveness and discrimination capabilities. The Panel evaluates the National Missile Defense system's testing against countermeasures and submits an annual report with recommendations for improvement. Countermeasures are defined as deliberate actions by countries with long-range ballistic missiles to defeat the system, including submunitions and anti-simulation techniques. The National Missile Defense system uses anti-simulation and decoys like Mylar balloons to disguise the warhead signature, along with a shroud cooled with liquid nitrogen to reduce the infrared signature."
