    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Health Care Access for Small Businesses Act of 2003\". Congress finds that the number of uninsured Americans has been increasing, reaching over 41 million in 2002. Uninsured individuals are less likely to receive preventive care, leading to avoidable hospitalizations. Their lack of insurance results in inefficient healthcare payment methods, with $34.5 billion of $99 billion in care going unpaid in 2001. The government covers 85 percent of $30 billion in uncompensated care, with private insurance enrollees also contributing through higher premiums. Expanding coverage will improve overall health and reduce costs for taxpayers, businesses, and consumers. Helping small businesses access affordable health care is crucial, as 82 percent of uninsured individuals come from working families. Over half of small businesses with less than 50 employees do not offer health insurance. Innovative community-based solutions have emerged.
