    "content": "Since 2014, the United States and a coalition have partnered with Kurdish groups to combat ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Kurdish forces, praised for their effectiveness, have taken control of ISIS territory with coalition air support. Kurdish military success has complicated partnerships with Iraq and Turkey. The United States has partnered with Kurdish groups in Iraq and Syria to combat ISIS, leading to military success but complicating relationships with Iraq and Turkey. Concerns arise about the terms and durability of U.S. support for Kurdish groups. The United States has partnered with Kurdish groups in Iraq and Syria to combat ISIS, leading to military success but complicating relationships with Iraq and Turkey. Considerations include the extent of Kurdish involvement in military operations, effects of U.S. support on state cohesion, strategic priorities conflicting with Kurdish goals, leverage between the U.S. and Kurdish groups, and relationships among Kurdish groups. The United States has partnered with Kurdish groups in Iraq and Syria to combat ISIS, leading to military success but complicating relationships with Iraq and Turkey. Legal authorities permit the Administration to provide arms and funding for Kurdish groups under certain conditions. U.S. officials announced over $400 million in support for Iraqi Kurdish fighters, drawn from Defense Department funds appropriated by Congress for countering ISIS. Additional funds have been requested for FY2017 to counter ISIS, including support for Kurdish groups. Iraqi Kurdish fighters, numbering approximately 160,000, are divided between regular peshmerga and elite forces like the Zeravani. They had primarily served as internal security providers before the 2014 conflict with ISIS. About 40,000 peshmerga fight in integrated KRG brigades, while the rest are loyal to either the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) or the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). The U.S.-led coalition has trained several thousand peshmerga for anti-ISIS operations, typically supplying arms through Iraq's central government or with its approval. The United States and other countries provide weapons directly to the Kurds with Iraqi government approval. NATO countries have supplied anti-tank missiles and transport helicopters to the peshmerga. Despite receiving equipment from various sources, KRG leaders have expressed a need for heavy weaponry for longer-range attacks against IS forces. The U.S.-led coalition is providing additional equipment to the peshmerga for anti-IS operations in Mosul. The US and other countries provide weapons to the Kurds with Iraqi government approval, including Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) armored personnel carriers, anti-tank weapons, mortars, and light arms. Iran and Russia also supply the peshmerga with artillery and arms. US military trainers and advisors have been in KRG-controlled areas since 2014, engaging in direct action missions in Iraq and Syria. Over 5,000 US military personnel are deployed in the region. The US provides weapons to the Kurds with Iraqi government approval, including MRAP armored personnel carriers, anti-tank weapons, mortars, and light arms. US military trainers and advisors have been in KRG-controlled areas since 2014, engaging in direct action missions in Iraq and Syria. More than 5,000 US military personnel are deployed throughout Iraq. The Defense Department announced over $400 million in assistance to Kurdish peshmerga in April 2016. Proposed legislation for FY2017 would authorize funding for peshmerga and other local forces. In early 2016, Senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain called for assistance to pay peshmerga salaries. Senator Bob Corker expressed concerns about directly funding the KRG, citing potential risks of encouraging the country's breakup. Various political and budgetary issues within the KRG and with the Iraqi central government could complicate the KRG's role in countering the Islamic State, including budget difficulties linked to oil revenue disputes and global oil prices. The KRG faces challenges such as disputes over leadership, tensions with Baghdad, and potential statehood referendum issues. Despite these issues, the KRG's military capacity has not been significantly undermined. The US announced assistance for KRG fighters in April 2016, as the KRG was reportedly struggling to pay peshmerga salaries. In 2016, the US signed an MOU with the KRG and Baghdad for assistance. Disputes over oil sharing and peshmerga salaries were tentatively resolved. US assistance to security forces in Iraq is coordinated through the Iraqi national government. The U.S. has debated promoting Iraq's unity under a non-sectarian government. Critics have raised concerns about the Iraqi Security Forces' performance against the Islamic State and the central government's failure to support local Kurdish and Sunni forces. Some legislative proposals in the 114th Congress aimed to provide direct U.S. assistance to specific forces in Iraq. The FY2016 NDAA proposed allocating 25% of $715 million in ITEF funding to assist peshmerga and local Sunni forces without Baghdad's approval. This sparked debate in Iraq, leading to the removal of the reference to these forces as \"countries.\" The Obama Administration expressed concerns about U.S. assistance for Kurds in northern Iraq potentially undermining Iraq's unity. Arms deliveries to KRG-affiliated forces were expedited in response to complaints about delays in receiving U.S.-provided weapons. The FY2016 NDAA provided a legal basis for direct U.S. support to Iraqi Kurdish and Sunni forces. The FY2016 NDAA authorized direct U.S. support to Iraqi Kurdish and Sunni forces, giving the President discretion to provide arms to Kurdish peshmerga for anti-IS purposes if the Iraqi government fails to address minority grievances and enhance inclusivity. The Defense Department and State Department reported progress by the Iraqi government in these areas. Funds appropriated under P.L. 114-113 for Iraq are to enhance Kurdistan Regional Government security services and security programs in Kurdistan. The House Appropriations Committee strongly encourages building the capacity of the KRG against the Islamic State. The FY2017 NDAA extends funding authorization for peshmerga and other forces with a \"national mission\" through December 31, 2018. Financing (FMF)-Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds for loans usable by Iraq for U.S. arms purchases, with a focus on Kurdish Peshmerga and Sunni tribal security forces in Iraq. $50 million of the $969.5 million authorized for ITEF allocated for peshmerga and Sunni tribal security forces in Mosul. $289.5 million appropriated to ITEF for counter-terrorism operations. The $289.5 million appropriated for ITEF is designated for counter-terrorism operations, specifically to support the Kurdish Peshmerga in their fight against ISIL and to alleviate economic pressures faced by the Kurdistan Regional Government. This funding complements previous assistance and aims to ensure cooperation in the ongoing campaign against ISIL. The IMF approved a $5.34 billion loan for Iraq in July 2016. The Obama Administration requested a $1 billion sovereign loan guarantee for Iraq in August 2016. H.R. 2028 authorizes the use of FY2017 Economic Support Fund money for loan guarantees to Iraq, with a commitment to distribute proceeds equitably among regions and governorates, including the Kurdistan Region. The FY2017 bill proposed by the House Appropriations Committee requires that a minimum of 17 percent of U.S. guaranteed lending proceeds benefit the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. The FY2017 NDAA conference report mandates a joint Defense Department/State Department report on strategies to defeat political and military challenges. The joint Defense Department/State Department report outlines strategies to defeat the Islamic State, including military conditions for defeat, political transition in Syria, Iraqi political reform, size of Iraqi Security Forces, and roles of U.S. allies in regional stability. A Comptroller General's report will assess transparency and accountability in financial assistance to Iraq. The Defense Department is closely monitoring the involvement of Kurdish forces in military operations surrounding Mosul as the offensive against IS progresses. ISF and local Sunni tribal fighters are expected to play a larger role in combat and post-conflict security in Mosul, rather than Kurdish forces or Shia militias, to minimize tensions and maintain political unity in Iraq. The peshmerga seized Kirkuk in June 2014, complicating cooperation with ISF. Kurdish interests lie in maintaining control over Kurdish-populated areas. Improved capabilities of non-Kurdish forces through training and U.S. support. Unprecedented cooperation between ISF and peshmerga in Mosul operations. KDP steering KRG to reject 2017 budget conditions on oil autonomy. The Iraqi parliament voted to include the Popular Mobilization Forces in the military, while Turkish military personnel in Bashiqa are training local fighters for anti-IS operations near Mosul. Turkish officials claim that some of these fighters receive artillery support from Turkey, leading to protests from Baghdad to the UN Security Council. The Turkish military presence in Iraq is disputed, with Iraqi Prime Minister protesting to the UN Security Council. President Erdogan's comments on Mosul's future escalated tensions, with Iraq insisting on sovereignty. Some Iraqi Shia groups view Turkish forces as occupiers. Turkey is concerned about PKK presence and Iranian-backed Shia groups in northern Iraq. Shia PMF militias are advancing towards Tal Afar, a city with a mixed Sunni and Shia population of ethnic Turkmen. Turkey deployed additional forces to the border crossing at Silopi and threatened intervention if Shia PMF forces harm Sunni Turkmen inhabitants. Turkish forces in Bashiqa are based on territory controlled by KDP-affiliated peshmerga forces. Vice President Joe Biden emphasized respecting Iraq's territorial integrity in a conversation with KDP leader Barzani. State Department reiterated the importance of respecting Iraq's sovereignty in a daily press briefing regarding the situation in Bashiqa. In a daily press briefing, the State Department emphasized the need for Iraq and Turkey to resolve the situation in Bashiqa through continued dialogue. Iraqi and Turkish officials discussed a possible resolution, with Iraq open to Turkish presence if sovereignty is recognized, and Turkey considering withdrawal if the area remains secure after peshmerga recapture. Turkish officials are concerned about PKK gaining control in areas like Sinjar as IS fighters are pushed out of northern Iraq. Turkish efforts, possibly in conjunction with the KDP, to counter PKK influence in certain areas could complicate cross-border dynamics. Iran's IRGC is reportedly supporting the PKK to weaken Turkey and the KRG. The focus of the Syria train-and-equip program shifted to supporting existing units fighting the Islamic State. YPG forces joined with non-Kurdish units to form an umbrella organization. The U.S. military began supporting the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) by airdropping weapons and deploying Special Forces personnel in northern Syria. President Obama authorized additional U.S. forces, including special operations forces, to deploy to Syria to work closely with the SDF. Some U.S. personnel recruit non-Kurdish fighters for the SDF, which has become a key recipient of U.S. weapons. In early 2016, the United States was establishing air bases in Kurdish-controlled areas in northern Syria for logistics and personnel support. U.S. officials highlight the diverse composition of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), with the YPG playing a predominant role. General Joseph Dunford stated that there are around 14,000 Arabs among the 30,000-strong SDF. The SDF's constituent elements are fluid, with groups joining or leaving depending on military changes. The YPG remains lightly armed and utilizes guerrilla-style tactics in battle. Reports suggest they received U.S. weapons aid, which was delivered to Arab elements of the SDF. The U.S. has made subsequent resupply deliveries to Arab militias associated with the SDF, with some analysts considering the aid essentially for the YPG. Plans to directly arm Syrian Kurdish groups with small arms and ammunition have been considered. The YPG remains lightly armed and uses guerrilla-style tactics in battle. U.S. support for the SDF has been limited to small arms due to Turkish concerns. General Dunford testified that arming Syrian Kurds could enhance the anti-IS effort. YPG's weapons sources include black market purchases and seized caches. Speculation about other arms sources includes Iraqi Kurdish groups and the PKK, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization. The United States may rely more on Kurdish ground forces in Syria due to lack of a state partner. The U.S. aims to strengthen non-Kurdish partners in the SDF to capture IS-held territory and provide security to non-Kurdish populations. Turkey, a NATO country, seeks influence in border areas of Iraq and Syria. Turkey sees the PYD/YPG as a terrorist organization and wants to shape future outcomes in the region. Turkey opposes US support for PYD/YPG due to its links with PKK. PYD influence in northern Syria fuels conflict with PKK in Turkey. Despite US not equating PYD/YPG with PKK, evidence shows close ties between the two groups. PKK cadres dominate YPG leadership in Syria. US support for YPG may encourage broader PKK activities. Turkey's military conducted a cross-border operation in Syria in August 2016, supporting Turkish tanks and Syrian Arab and Turkmen units under the Free Syrian Army. This operation, codenamed \"Euphrates Shield,\" aimed to oppose the PKK and its affiliates, who sought to destabilize central authority in Turkey. The PYD, with ties to the PKK, has become somewhat distinct from its roots according to analysts. Operation Euphrates Shield, initiated by Turkey, aims to counter terrorist groups like ISIS and the PKK. It seeks to prevent Kurdish fighters from establishing a presence in contested territories between Afrin and Kobane. Turkish forces have clashed with Kurdish units in the area, with airstrikes targeting Kurdish-controlled areas. Turkish airstrikes targeted Kurdish-controlled positions, killing hundreds of YPG personnel. Turkish-supported forces focus on gaining control of Al Bab, a key transport hub coveted by all parties in northern Syria's conflict. President Erdogan mentioned possible action in Manbij. Kurdish fighters were asked to retreat east of the Euphrates River, but Erdogan claimed PYD/YPG elements remained. U.S. officials suggest increasing Turkish-supported troop numbers for military or political goals. Turkey may need to increase troop numbers to achieve military or political objectives in the region. US forces have supported Turkish-backed forces in operations against ISIS, but have urged them and Kurdish-led forces to avoid conflict. US forces are embedded on both sides to maintain communication and prevent clashes. However, US forces did not provide airstrikes for Turkish operations in Al Bab, as Turkey pursued these independently. The PYD has been seeking international legitimacy and involvement in Syrian political talks, but has faced objections from Turkey. Speculation surrounds Turkish operations in Al Bab, with concerns about Syrian government involvement in airstrikes. The PYD in Syria has faced objections from Turkey regarding their participation in political talks. Despite hosting PYD leader Salih Muslim in the past, Turkey insists on the involvement of other Syrian Kurds. The PYD is considering declaring a federal region for ethnosectarian groups in areas under their control, and conducted a census in preparation for elections. Some opposition remains from other Syrian Kurdish groups, and concerns have been raised about YPG compliance with international laws. The PYD in Syria faces objections from Turkey for their involvement in political talks and is considering declaring a federal region for ethnosectarian groups. Syrian Kurds have instituted self-rule but remain dependent on the Syrian government for various services. Turkey and the KRG have closed their borders to goods from PYD-controlled areas. Syrian Kurdish autonomy could impact various stakeholders in the conflict. The conflict in Syria could impact various stakeholders, including the government, Islamic State, Sunni groups, minorities, and outside actors. The U.S. opposes self-rule but is open to a federal system chosen by the Syrian people. Russia supports granting Syrian Kurds special status, but the Syrian government rejects the idea. The PYD/YPG have been relatively non-belligerent but have clashed with the Syrian government in the past. Clashes between the YPG and the Asad regime occurred in Al Hasakeh in August 2016. Reports suggest YPG received military assistance from the regime and Russian forces enabled YPG actions. U.S. officials discussed operations against IS fighters in Raqqah following the Mosul offensive. A three-phase plan was outlined, including preparatory air strikes, isolating Raqqah, and a direct assault. Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend expressed plans for the assault. Operations focused on Raqqah are urgent to prevent IS fighters from regrouping and carrying out external attacks. The SDF offensive to isolate Raqqah received support from the U.S.-led coalition, with U.S. Special Forces assisting as advisors. U.S. forces are providing air support to the SDF, including YPG and Arab fighters, as part of the operations to isolate Raqqah. The isolation phase of operations to isolate Raqqah from IS fighters may take months, with U.S. officials hinting at impending operations influenced by pressure to accelerate the fight against ISIS. The timeline could be affected by the transition to the incoming Trump Administration and the need for resources in Raqqah. IS fighters are reportedly relocating to Deir ez Zor near the Iraqi border in response to threats in Mosul and Raqqah. General Dunford's September 22 congressional testimony revealed US assistance to anti-IS forces in preparation for a Raqqah operation. The 30,000 to 40,000 SDF fighters expected to participate are mostly Syrian Kurds (YPG) and Syrian Arabs. Questions remain about the forces to seize Raqqah and manage post-conflict administration. Kurdish YPG forces are considered the most numerous and capable, but they are not intended to hold Raqqah according to General Dunford. In preparation for the Raqqah operation, US military officials emphasize the importance of building up the Arab contingent of the SDF, following the model of using local forces in previous operations. The local forces recruited from areas like Manbij form the core of the assault force, but the extent of their ability to secure areas without YPG presence remains unclear. Townsend anticipates challenges in recruiting and training new local forces for operations in Raqqah. Existing SDF forces will handle most of the basic combat training, with US advisors assisting in specialty courses. Turkey expresses concerns about the coalition partnering with the SDF, particularly the YPG elements within it. Turkish officials urge coalition to end support for YPG and suggest Turkish-backed forces join US in Raqqah operations. Questions remain on Turkey's ability to influence Syria's political outcomes through military action. Dialogue ongoing to determine best force for Raqqah. Analysis suggests SDF may be better suited for military campaign, but potential clashes with Turkish-supported forces near border could hinder anti-IS efforts. The potential for wider territorial clashes near the Turkish border could impact anti-IS coalition objectives in Raqqah. Uncertainty surrounds the priorities of YPG and Turkey in Raqqah, given their rivalry for Al Bab and Manbij. Direct Turkish involvement in Raqqah raises concerns about ethnic sensitivities and local acceptance. Humanitarian and human rights concerns affect Kurdish-populated areas where Kurdish forces are active. Concerns persist about the humanitarian impact of the U.S.-backed Iraqi forces' assault on Mosul. Concerns remain about the humanitarian impact of the operation in Kurdish-controlled areas, with a possible influx of internally displaced persons to KRG. Over 1 million IDPs have sought shelter in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq due to conflicts in Iraq and Syria. As of December 2016, an estimated 225,500 Syrians, mostly of Kurdish origin, have fled to the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI), where nearly one-third of the population are internally displaced persons (IDPs). The KRG initially allowed displaced persons to enter and stay in the KRI, but later imposed restrictions due to financial concerns. IDPs, refugees, and foreigners now require security clearance and work permits to work in the region. Many displaced persons have been denied access to safe areas by Iraqi and KRG authorities, citing security concerns, although some believe the measures have sectarian and discriminatory undertones. The State Department acknowledges concerns of sectarian and discriminatory undertones in measures affecting IDPs entering the KRG. The U.S. Embassy is advocating for freedom of movement for IDPs. Syrian refugees in the KRI are mostly housed in camps with UNHCR assistance, while some opt to live in cities. The KRG lacks resources to register and track all IDPs, leading to a lack of coordinated strategy for facilities and services. The Iraqi government and KRG are providing humanitarian aid to IDPs living in camp and non-camp settings, with half in Dohuk province. Assistance is coordinated through civil society, local communities, and international organizations. The KRG's fiscal crisis is worsened by the population increase. Coordination mechanisms like the JCMC in Baghdad and JCCC in Erbil support the humanitarian operation. The absorption capacity of host communities is reaching a critical threshold, leading to competition for jobs and resources between residents and displaced individuals. The KRG has requested $1.4 billion in additional revenue to stabilize the economy and has sought international support despite ongoing fighting and displacement. In areas like the KRI, insecurity hinders humanitarian efforts to assist refugees and IDPs affected by conflict. Limited government services, health issues, and food insecurity increase the vulnerability of millions of civilians, with children making up a significant portion of the displaced population. Emergency education support is a major concern, along with the distribution of winter kits and kerosene to displaced families in Dohuk, Erbil, and Sulimaniyah by UNHCR. Since October 2016, UNHCR has provided cash assistance to over 10,000 displaced families and nearly 10,000 Syrian refugee families. With the Mosul military operation ongoing, over 100,000 people have been displaced, and experts predict this number could rise to 1 million. Most displaced families are heading towards areas controlled by the Iraqi Government or the KRG. Efforts are being made to increase capacity to support these civilians, with many being sheltered in UNHCR-supported camps. In the area around Mosul, there are currently six camps with three more being built and one planned. Hundreds of thousands of vulnerable residents in newly retaken areas urgently need assistance. Reports of water and food shortages, as well as increased trauma injuries, are concerning. A High Advisory Team, including the Government of Iraq, KRG, militaries, and the U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator, meets regularly to coordinate the humanitarian response. In northeast Syria, over 750,000 people, including IDPs and Iraqi refugees, require assistance in Al Hasakeh governorate. In northeast Syria, approximately 500,000 Syrian IDPs are sheltering in areas controlled by Syrian Kurds. International organizations provide limited humanitarian assistance, mainly for basic needs. Escalations in fighting and border closures with Iraq are increasing displacement. The Humanitarian Response Plan for Iraq in 2016 appealed for $861 million, with 83% funded as of December 2016. The overall Iraq appeal is 83% funded as of December 21, 2016, with U.S. humanitarian assistance totaling $1.1 billion since FY2014. The U.N. Mosul Flash Appeal seeks $284 million, 92% covered as of December 21, 2016. The U.S. is the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to the Syria crisis, allocating over $5.9 billion since FY2012. Assistance is needs-based and can be used countrywide in Iraq and Syria for the displaced and vulnerable populations. The conflict in Kurdish-controlled areas of Iraq and Syria has heightened international concerns about the vulnerability of civilians to violence and mistreatment by the Islamic State and other actors. The U.N. Secretary-General reported instances of mass executions, kidnappings, rape, and torture in areas retaken from ISIL. In areas retaken from ISIL, there are reports of arbitrary arrests, killings, destruction of property, and efforts to change demographic composition. Concerns about mistreatment by Iraqi and Syrian Kurdish authorities of non-Kurdish populations have received international attention, with allegations of displacement, looting, and destruction of villages. The KRG officials have displaced Arab communities under the guise of security, but it seems to be a punishment for their perceived support of IS and a way to solidify territorial gains in disputed areas. This is part of an effort to rectify past injustices by the Saddam Hussein regime. Amnesty International's report highlights the unlawful demolitions of buildings and homes, mostly belonging to Arabs, by KRG security forces between September 2014 and May 2016. The KRG authorities conducted an investigation into the destruction of homes, attributing it to the U.S.-led coalition's actions and the peshmerga's detonation of explosives. Human rights groups have reported abuses by Kurdish groups in Syria, raising concerns about the coalition's reliance on them for securing territory in ethnically diverse areas. Some Members of Congress are considering policy options related to U.S. support for Kurdish groups in Iraq and Syria, focusing on the risks of U.S. equipment falling into the wrong hands and the need for better humanitarian assistance for displaced persons. They are also assessing the extent to which the U.S. can influence Kurdish decisions and how these decisions may impact U.S. strategic goals in the region. The nature of Kurdish decisions and their impact on U.S. strategic goals in Iraq and Syria, including relationships with various actors. Policy questions in late 2016 regarding the roles of Kurdish ground forces, arms assistance, and conditions on aid shipments. The policy questions in late 2016 revolved around the impact of Kurdish decisions on U.S. strategic goals in Iraq and Syria, including relationships with various actors. The focus was on the roles of Kurdish ground forces, arms assistance, and conditions on aid shipments. The focus in late 2016 was on Kurdish decisions impacting U.S. strategic goals in Iraq and Syria, including relationships with different actors. Officials aim to leverage Kurdish military successes by empowering non-Kurdish forces in Sunni Arab areas like Mosul and Raqqah. The future of the U.S.-Kurdish partnership beyond anti-IS cooperation remains uncertain and could hinge on current outcomes. Policymakers may see closer U.S.-Kurdish ties as a way to promote stability in a region marked by instability and tensions. The potential impact of closer U.S.-Kurdish relations on regional stability is debated. Some believe it could lead to stability due to Kurdish support for U.S. operations, secular leadership, and relative prosperity. However, others fear it could destabilize the region as Kurdish groups may seek to increase their influence, wealth, and autonomy at the expense of others. Ultimately, U.S. policy will depend on various factors, including long-term commitments. The United States is willing to maintain long-term commitments in the region, valuing Kurdish groups as partners in achieving U.S. objectives."
