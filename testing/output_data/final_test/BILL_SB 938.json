    "title": "SB 938",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 2356.5 of the Probate Code is amended to provide conservatorship for individuals with major neurocognitive disorders (MNCDs) such as Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and Parkinson dementia. This aims to meet their unique needs and safeguard their dignity and rights. Psychotropic medications, including antipsychotic medications, are used to control behavior in individuals with major neurocognitive disorders (MNCDs). The FDA requires a black box warning label on antipsychotic medications due to the increased risk of death for elderly people with MNCDs. Granting powers to a conservator to authorize these medications requires additional protections. MNCD is defined as a major neurocognitive disorder in the DSM. A conservator can authorize placing a conservatee in a secured care facility if they have a major neurocognitive disorder, lack capacity for informed consent, and have mental function deficits impairing their understanding. The conservator can authorize the placement of a conservatee in a secured care facility if they have a major neurocognitive disorder. The conservatee must benefit from a secure environment, and the least restrictive placement is in a secured perimeter residential care facility for the elderly. The conservator can choose the secured setting based on the person-centered care plan. Additionally, the court must find clear and convincing evidence that the conservatee has a major neurocognitive disorder before authorizing the administration of psychotropic medications. The conservatee with a major neurocognitive disorder lacks capacity for informed consent to psychotropic medications. Evidence from a physician is needed to show the need for medication. Treatment for adherents of prayer-based healing should be by a practitioner of that religion. A petition for authority to act under this section requires the conservatee to be represented by an attorney, produced at the hearing, and supported by a physician or psychologist's declaration regarding the findings for any power requested. The psychologist must have at least two years of experience in diagnosing MNCDs. The petition for authority under subdivision (d) must be supported by a physician's declaration detailing the conservatee's diagnosis, behavior, recommended medication, previous treatments, and expected effects of the medication on mental health and symptoms. The Judicial Council shall adopt rules and forms for implementing the section, providing guidance on evaluating medication requests. The petition for authorization can be filed by designated persons. The court investigator shall annually report to the court every two years regarding the conservator's authorization. The conservatee must be informed of their right to object to the conservator's powers, and the report will determine if the granted powers are warranted. If objections arise, the court will appoint an attorney for the conservatee. The attorney must take action within 30 days of receiving the court investigator's report in Section 1470) of Part 1. The attorney must file a petition with the court regarding the conservatee's status and submit a written report stating the petition's appropriateness. If granted authority to administer psychotropic medications, the conservator can make changes without court approval, within the granted authority. The conservatee may be prescribed psychotropic or antipsychotic medication in certain hospital settings or for non-MNCD related purposes with the conservator's informed consent under Section 2355."
