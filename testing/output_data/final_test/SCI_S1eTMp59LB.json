    "content": "Doc2Dial is an end-to-end framework that generates conversational data from business documents through crowdsourcing. This data is used to train automated dialogue agents for customer care tasks. The framework uses documents to create tasks for collecting annotations that simulate dialog flows. Crowd workers then produce utterances based on these dialog flows. The result is dialogue data grounded in the documents with annotations to ensure data quality and dialogue flexibility. This approach addresses the need for automated dialogue agents in online customer assistance, overcoming challenges in training with human-human dialogues. A solution to the need for automated dialogue agents in customer care tasks is to build machine-assisted agents based on business documents. These agents can perform task-oriented dialogues by identifying contextual conditions and retrieving relevant solutions from the documents. This approach addresses the preference of customers for interactive conversations over reading lengthy documents. DOC2DIAL is an end-to-end framework for generating conversational data grounded in business documents, enabling dialogue agents to recognize preconditions and solutions to carry out diagnostic interactions. The DOC2DIAL framework aims to generate conversational data from business documents via crowdsourcing, minimizing manual dialog flow creation while ensuring data quality control. It focuses on identifying document content solutions, creating specific dialog flows, and enabling easy scalability for crowdsourcing platforms. The DOC2DIAL framework aims to generate conversational data from business documents via crowdsourcing. It involves labeling text spans as preconditions or solutions, identifying relations between them, and simulating dialog flows. The process can be deployed synchronously or asynchronously, allowing crowd workers to work on individual turns without timing constraints. The outcome includes document-grounded dialogues and various annotations to ensure data quality for developing dialogue agent technologies in customer care. The DOC2DIAL framework introduces an end-to-end approach to generate task-oriented conversational data from business documents. It includes a pipeline approach with interconnected tasks to minimize manual effort in crafting dialog flow and ensure data quality. The system supports both synchronized and asynchronized dialogue collection processes, allowing flexible dialogue composition guided by document content and annotations. This work is motivated by the success of training automatic agents with documents, as seen in machine comprehension tasks like CoQA and QuAC. The DOC2DIAL framework introduces an end-to-end approach to generate task-oriented conversational data from business documents, minimizing manual effort and ensuring data quality. It enables the extraction of complex preconditions and solutions from documents to create complete dialogues. The DOC2DIAL framework introduces an end-to-end approach to generate task-oriented conversational data from business documents. It involves tasks like TextAnno for labeling text spans and RelAnno for identifying relations between preconditions. The DOC2DIAL framework involves tasks like TextAnno for labeling text spans and RelAnno for identifying relations between preconditions. The task also includes text pairs to be labeled as is-precondition-of or is-solution-of for cross validating annotations. DialAnno collects dialog utterances based on pre-generated dialog flow, with each turn corresponding to a dialog scene. Document Processing prepares input documents for annotation tasks. Document Processing prepares input documents for annotation tasks by obtaining syntactic-semantic analysis and extracting sub-clauses with discourse connectives. Well-structured documents with descriptive sub-titles and discourse connectives are considered good candidates for generating dialogues with dynamic flows. The system can automatically assign labels based on linguistic indicators and employ heuristics based on HTML tree structures and text. Dialog Flow Composition generates dialog flows for DialAnno based on labels of precondition/solution text and their relations obtained via TextAnno and RelAnno. The dialog scene for each turn is determined by selected text span content, role, and dialog act. The dynamics of the dialog flows are introduced by varying these factors constrained by relations collected via RelAnno. Content is randomly selected from a candidate pool of preconditions and solutions identified in the document, updated after every scenario generated. For the pilot study, DOC2DIAL is applied to various documents and task contexts. 1900 documents were filtered, resulting in 26,000 labeled text spans as preconditions or solutions. 5 dialog flows per document were generated and evaluated by crowd workers. After generating dialog flows from 1900 filtered documents and labeling 26,000 text spans as preconditions or solutions, crowd workers evaluated the dialog flows. 67% of the turns were labeled as \"match\", with mismatches often due to disagreements on preconditions/solutions. Sample task in Figure 5 demonstrated crowd workers' ability to interpret dialogues when understanding text in context."
