    "content": "The 114th Congress will face water resource issues related to federal infrastructure, flood and drought emergencies, and distribution of investments for water supplies, navigation, flood management, and ecosystem protection. These issues have a regional impact but require federal oversight, such as responding to droughts in California and coastal flooding from hurricanes like Sandy. The 114th Congress will need to address water resource challenges such as infrastructure, flood and drought emergencies, and distribution of investments for water supplies, navigation, flood management, and ecosystem protection. This includes balancing competing demands for water and river management, coping with budget limitations, and addressing the impact of federal project operations on the environment. The federal role in water resources development, management, and protection, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation, will be a key focus for Congress. The report discusses key policy issues for the 114th Congress related to water resource management, including flood and drought preparedness, project funding priorities, and aquatic ecosystem restoration. Legislative activity is specific to federal water resource agencies like the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation, as well as water use by various sectors. Legislation enacted during the 113th Congress for these agencies was less than in prior Congresses. During the 113th Congress, legislation for federal water resource agencies like the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation was limited due to congressional earmark policies. However, the Congress enacted an omnibus Corps authorization bill, the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (WRRDA 2014, P.L. 113-121), and provided appropriations for the agencies to conduct their work. Energy and environmental policy also impact water resources management. During the 113th Congress, legislation was enacted to facilitate nonfederal hydropower development and make alterations to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission licensing process. Provisions related to water management in California were included in the FY2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The Congress also reauthorized the National Integrated Drought Information System. The 113th Congress enacted legislation to support farmers, crop production, and agricultural water conservation through the farm bill (P.L. 113-79). The bill also included provisions for groundwater protection, soil and water conservation, and drought and flood disaster assistance for agricultural producers. Legislation considered but not enacted included measures to augment water supplies, settle Indian water rights claims, and authorize regional aquatic ecosystem restoration. Several bills in the 113th Congress addressed aquatic ecosystem restoration efforts nationwide, focusing on water quality, habitat restoration, project construction, and governance. Bills were introduced for the Great Lakes, Long Island Sound, and Lake Tahoe, aiming to authorize comprehensive ecosystem restoration initiatives and funding reauthorization. The 113th Congress considered bills for ecosystem restoration initiatives and funding reauthorization, including the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. Legislation was also introduced to address water supply issues, such as the federal Central Valley Project in California. The 113th Congress considered legislation related to water research and development, including desalination and state water resources research institutes. They also looked at coordinating federal research to understand and reduce risks from energy and water sector interdependencies. Unlike the previous Congress, they did not address broad federal water science and research. The 114th Congress may address the lack of coordination in water science and research spread across federal agencies. Concerns exist about the adequacy of current research to address domestic and international water challenges. Certain basin issues, such as federal reservoir operations in various river basins, are likely to receive congressional attention. This includes the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers, Missouri River, Colorado River, Klamath River, and Rio Grande River. The 114th Congress may focus on various river basins like the Colorado, Klamath, and Rio Grande. Discussions on the future operation of Corps facilities on the Columbia River and its tributaries are ongoing. Drought assistance, planning, and oversight of restoration activities in different regions, including the Chesapeake Bay and Everglades, may also be addressed. Themes in regional restoration efforts for federal water resources projects in the 114th Congress include new project services, protection of endangered species, drought and flood management, and water quality concerns. Congress may also address updated planning guidance, climate change adaptation, and the impact of endangered species designations on water resource project construction and operations. The government has long been involved in efforts to facilitate navigation, expand irrigation, and reduce flood and drought losses through federal dam and navigation projects. Federal involvement has expanded to include municipal water supply development and protection of water-related resources. Increasing pressures on water supplies have led to conflicts, especially in the West and Southeast, due to population growth, environmental regulation, climate change, and other factors. Congress plays a significant role in water resources management, addressing issues such as water source contamination, agricultural and energy water demands, climate change, and public interests in in-stream recreation. Responsibilities are shared with state, local, and tribal governments, with Congress setting policies for federal water projects and providing direction for construction and maintenance within a complex framework of competing objectives and legal decisions. Federal water resource construction activities declined in the late 20th century due to fiscal constraints, changing national priorities, and environmental impacts. Proposals for renewed federal assistance aim to address growing pressures on water supplies and manage regional water resources effectively. Recent drought conditions in the West and Southwest, along with disasters like Hurricane Sandy and Midwest floods, have raised questions about the federal role in water resources management. Trade-offs in distributing federal appropriations, risk management, and division of responsibilities among local, state, and federal entities are being scrutinized. Most large dams and water diversion structures in the US were built with the assistance of Reclamation or the Corps to provide reliable water supplies. Reclamation projects provide water for irrigation and some municipal uses, managing dams and reservoirs in 17 western states. The Corps focuses on navigation and flood damage reduction, operating nationwide with diverse activities including flood damage reduction projects and waterways. They have constructed thousands of projects, including dams, reservoirs, and hydroelectric power plants generating over $1 billion in revenue annually. The Corps of Engineers has constructed numerous water-related projects, including dams, reservoirs, and hydroelectric plants. They also work on flood damage reduction and navigation projects. The agency maintains 900 miles of levees out of the estimated 100,000 miles in the nation, with the rest operated by nonfederal entities. Other federal agencies, such as the NRCS and EPA, also play a role in water resources development and conservation. The Corps of Engineers focuses on water projects and programs, while other federal agencies like the EPA and NRCS also contribute to water resources development and conservation. The report provides information on federal water activities and financing options. The Corps of Engineers responds to flood and drought events, constructs and maintains navigation, flood control, and ecosystem restoration projects, and issues permits for activities affecting waterways. Congress authorizes Corps activities through omnibus bills like the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA), enacted biennially but irregularly due to stakeholder conflicts. The most recent WRDAs were in 2000, 2007, and 2014, with funds typically appropriated by Congress. The recent WRDAs were enacted in 2000, 2007, and 2014. Congress appropriates funds for these activities in annual Energy and Water Development Appropriations acts. The 114th Congress may pursue questions related to national flood risk and federal actions to reduce that risk, especially regarding Corps facilities and their operations during drought and flood conditions. Reservoir management by the Corps, such as in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint basin, and Corps operation of dams on the Missouri River are controversial topics. The controversies surrounding the Missouri River include its impact on downstream navigation, flood control, species, and upstream water supplies. Reclamation has built large multi-purpose water projects like Hoover Dam and Grand Coulee Dam since the early 1900s, primarily for irrigation and hydropower. Construction authorizations slowed in the 1970s and 1980s, leading Reclamation to shift its focus to managing water resources in an environmentally friendly manner. Reclamation projects face challenges in managing water resources in an environmentally and economically sound manner. Increased population, prolonged drought, and various water demands have led to pressure to alter project operations, which is complicated by water rights and contractual obligations. Unlike the Corps, Reclamation projects do not have a regularly scheduled authorization vehicle, but individual project authorizations may be included in omnibus bills. Reclamation projects, like the Corps, face challenges in managing water resources amidst drought and climate change. Project authorizations have slowed since the 112th Congress due to earmark moratoria. Controversies over water management in various river basins have been exacerbated by low water flows. The ongoing issues with Reclamation's operation of pumps in the Bay-Delta and their impact on water users and endangered species have been worsened by low water conditions, including the severe drought in 2014. Drought and low water supplies are projected to continue in California and other western areas in 2015. Some key water project and management issues for consideration in the 114th Congress include responding to drought, federal reservoir operations, water delivery, and regulatory obstacles to new water storage projects. In the 114th Congress, key water project and management issues include federal reservoirs, water delivery, regulatory obstacles to new storage projects, Reclamation's Safety of Dams program, aging infrastructure, Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley water reliability, species concerns, project adjustments, Klamath River Basin restoration, Colorado River water management, San Joaquin River restoration settlement funding, and oversight. Congress may also focus on Reclamation's mission and future role in western water supply and resource management. Project sponsors are considering new partnerships in project development, with construction to be done by nonfederal sponsors due to delays in new project studies. Some are seeking independent nonfederal financing for water resources infrastructure. Congress questions Reclamation's shift to a water resources management agency and advocates for increased focus on water storage and supply augmentation through various technologies. Frustration with regulatory hurdles and concerns over species protection are also expressed. Some groups criticize Reclamation for not doing enough to protect species and the environment. The 114th Congress is dealing with water resources issues like flood and drought management, project funding priorities, and aquatic ecosystem restoration. Drought conditions in California and the West have led to water supply limitations, reduced agricultural production, and degraded wildlife habitat. Congress faces challenges in coordinating drought information through various federal agencies. The 113th Congress enacted legislation to address drought operations and water supply issues, including reauthorizing NIDIS and expanding EPA loan opportunities. Multiple bills focused on drought operations of Reclamation facilities, water efficiency, conservation, and water storage projects. Several bills proposed changes to water storage projects and the Stafford Act, with some bills addressing drought in the western U.S. through authorizations and appropriations. Congress may continue to address drought planning and preparedness through oversight hearings and legislation. Periodic intense flooding events like Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and Midwest floods in 2011 have tested the nation's emergency response system, resulting in billions of dollars in damages. The Corps is the main flood-fighting agency, but other agencies like FEMA also play a role in flood response and mitigation. Responsibilities for flood damage reduction are shared among federal, state, local, and tribal governments, with states and local governments playing a primary role in floodplain management due to their jurisdiction over land use decisions and zoning. The 113th Congress was involved in flood policy, including FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program and flood damage reduction programs. The 114th Congress may consider ways to reduce flood risk by improving infrastructure, promoting pre-disaster recovery plans, and removing disincentives to improved floodplain management. The nation's aging water infrastructure, including dams, locks, and levees, poses a significant risk. The aging U.S. water infrastructure, including dams, locks, and levees, poses a significant risk due to limited capital investments and funding. Various proposals have been suggested to address the need for major capital investments in these structures, such as authorization of loan programs and inclusion in infrastructure bank funding. No comprehensive solutions have been enacted to date. In the 113th Congress, proposals were made to address funding for water infrastructure repairs and upgrades, including utilizing project revenues, deauthorizing projects, or transferring them to nonfederal entities. Some believe more information is needed before major funding solutions are considered. The Senate enacted legislation requiring increased reporting on infrastructure backlog. Frustration with the pace of authorization for federal water projects has led to local sponsors seeking limited federal partnership or future reimbursement. In the 113th Congress, proposals were made to address funding for water infrastructure repairs and upgrades, including utilizing project revenues, deauthorizing projects, or transferring them to nonfederal entities. The FY2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act included provisions for the Secretary of the Interior to partner with local joint power authorities for planning and feasibility studies. This expanded the ability for nonfederal entities to advance funding for federal projects to spur project construction. The 113th Congress proposed various funding options for water infrastructure repairs and upgrades, including utilizing project revenues and transferring projects to nonfederal entities. The FY2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act allowed the Secretary of the Interior to partner with local joint power authorities for planning and feasibility studies, expanding nonfederal entities' ability to fund federal projects. Additionally, Title X of WRRDA 2014 authorized the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) pilot program for loans and loan guarantees for flood damage reduction, public water supply, and wastewater projects. The TIFIA program and earmark moratoria have impacted water resource project funding by reducing specific project additions to budgets and funding broad categories of activities instead. This has led to some projects historically supported by Congress receiving less or no funding in recent appropriations bills. The 114th Congress may consider the status and priority of federal efforts to restore aquatic ecosystems impacted by development and water resource projects, including initiatives in the Everglades, California Bay-Delta, Great Lakes, Gulf Coast, Chesapeake Bay, Klamath Basin, and other areas. Legislation for governance and restoration plans for the Great Lakes and oversight of Gulf Coast restoration efforts may be discussed. Authorization for new construction projects in the Everglades, like the Central Everglades Planning, could also be addressed. Authorization for new construction projects in the Everglades, such as the Central Everglades Planning Project (CEPP), may face delays due to concerns about streamlining authorizations. Funding for restoration initiatives could be controversial in the 114th Congress, with deliberations over FY2016 appropriations potentially addressing ecosystem restoration in various bills."
