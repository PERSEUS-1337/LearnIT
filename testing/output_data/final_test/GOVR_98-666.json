Factors like predators, droughts, floods, and changing ocean conditions impact their populations. El Ni\u00f1o, Pacific decadal oscillation, and climate change also affect salmon habitat and distribution. Salmon declines in the 1990s hurt fishing-dependent communities in the Northwest and northern California. By the late 1990s, west coast salmon abundance had drastically decreased. Fishing closures led to the loss of nearly 80% of the region's job base, with a total industry loss of approximately 72,000 jobs over 30 years. Currently, 28 distinct salmon populations are listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Anadromous trout and salmon populations are threatened under the Endangered Species Act, with some identified as \"species of concern.\" Many Pacific Coast anadromous fish populations are at risk, with some already extinct. Human activities like logging, grazing, and urban development have contributed to the decline of these populations. Human activities such as logging, grazing, mining, agriculture, urban development, and water use can harm aquatic habitat, leading to siltation, higher water temperatures, and reduced nursery habitat for salmon. Streamside vegetation removal, stream channelization, and water diversions exacerbate these issues, increasing predation on salmonids by marine mammals, birds, and other fish. Water basins in Oregon, eastern Washington, and northern California are now over-appropriated, with more legal permits for water diversion than available water during hot periods. Dams in the Federal Columbia River Power System have significant impacts on anadromous fish, with some being described as \"fish-friendly\" while others can physically block fish migrations, kill juveniles, and expose fish to harmful gas levels. Delayed migration due to dams can increase predation and bacterial infections for both juvenile and adult salmon. Adult salmon face increased predation, bacterial infections, and stress from higher temperatures. Decreased river flow delays juvenile downstream migration. Controversy surrounds changing FCRPS operations to benefit salmon due to cost implications for dam and power generation changes. Fish hatcheries along the Pacific Coast aim to augment natural salmonid populations and replace lost fish due to dam blockages. Hatchery practices in the 1970s were found to reduce genetic diversity in fish populations. Commercially caught salmon in the Pacific Northwest and northern California mostly come from hatcheries. The mixing of populations by hatcheries and transplantation has led to reduced genetic diversity in fish populations, resulting in decreased genetic fitness of wild populations and loss of stream-specific adaptations. Hatchery fish have lower survival rates and struggle to adapt to changing ocean conditions or escape predators. Harvesting intermingled salmonid populations poses challenges in protecting ESA-listed populations while promoting the harvest of abundant native and hatchery fish. Managing fisheries to avoid surplus returns to hatcheries can lead to overharvesting natural populations, causing controversy over how much the harvest of abundant populations should be curtailed to protect less abundant ESA-listed populations. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) implements the Endangered Species Act (ESA) for anadromous salmonids, receiving petitions to determine listing as \"endangered\" or \"threatened.\" The Secretary of Commerce decides based on substantial information provided in the petition. The Secretary of Commerce decides on listing anadromous salmonids under the Endangered Species Act. If listed, NMFS must designate critical habitat and develop a recovery plan. Federal agencies must consult with NMFS to avoid harm to listed species. NMFS issues a \"biological opinion\" (BiOp) with an incidental \"take\" statement to authorize limited harm to species. If a jeopardy opinion is issued, it includes reasonable and prudent alternative actions to avoid harm. NMFS may issue multiple BiOps related to salmon each year. For example, a 1995 BiOp focused on developing a strategy for salmon passage in the Columbia and Snake Rivers, leading to a shift away from transporting juvenile salmonids downstream by truck or barge. The Corps completed a System Operations Review of the Columbia and Snake River hydropower system in 2000, considering breaching the lower Snake River dams as an option. NMFS issued a revised BiOp in December 2000, which did not recommend dam breaching but included steps to consider it if necessary. A revised 2004 BiOp without dam breaching was remanded to NOAA by the Federal District Court of Oregon. NOAA released a revised BiOp in 2008, which was reviewed for adequacy by the court. The Obama Administration filed an Adaptive Management Implementation in 2009 after evaluating the BiOp. The Obama Administration filed an Adaptive Management Implementation Plan (AMIP) in 2009 to address fish population declines, including mitigation actions, research, monitoring, and preparation for potential dam breaching. Judge Redden acknowledged the AMIP as a positive step but requested more information on its integration with the BiOp. NMFS released a modified BiOp with the AMIP in 2010. In 2010, NMFS released a modified BiOp with the Adaptive Management Implementation Plan (AMIP) to address fish population declines. However, in 2011, a federal court deemed the supplemental BiOp insufficient, leading to temporary measures from 2005 still dictating the Federal Columbia River Power System operation. Despite efforts by states, tribes, and industries, salmon populations in the Columbia River Basin have continued to decline despite significant investments in technical improvements and habitat enhancements. Despite efforts to improve salmon survival through water purchases, some populations have continued to decline. State governments and tribal councils are increasingly interested in developing comprehensive salmon management efforts to avoid ESA listings. NMFS encourages integrated management efforts among federal, state, and tribal agencies to save listed species and prevent future listings. The Oregon Coastal Salmon Restoration Initiative serves as a model for federal/state/local partnerships to prevent the listing of coho salmon in Oregon. The federal court decision clarified that plans to avoid listing endangered species must be based on enforceable recovery measures, not speculative future actions. New governance options are being explored for salmon in the Columbia River basin. Restoration efforts for California salmon are outlined in the CVPIA and San Joaquin River Restoration Program. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is coordinating plans for fish population recovery in the Central Valley under the CVPIA authority. The NMFS BiOp identified threats to native fish populations in the Central Valley Project area, including endangered salmon and green sturgeon. A court ruling in 2010 overturned salmon protection rules in the BiOp, leading to negotiations for the Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement. The Klamath River stakeholders negotiated an agreement in 2010 to address conflicting water management objectives. A related Hydropower Settlement Agreement may lead to the removal of four dams blocking salmon and steelhead spawning areas. The U.S. District Court established pesticide buffer zones in response to a citizen suit under the Endangered Species Act. The NMFS is reviewing pesticides and issuing BiOps for their use near \"salmon-supporting waters\" in Washington, Oregon, and California. Restrictions on pesticide application are controversial among agricultural interests. In 1993, NMFS issued a policy on artificial propagation of Pacific salmon under the ESA to guide hatchery use for salmon recovery. The policy aims to recover wild populations in their natural habitat without relying on artificial propagation. Hatchery programs in Washington, Oregon, and British Columbia mark coho salmon for selective harvesting by fishermen. Similar programs are in place for Chinook salmon and steelhead trout. Reviews of Columbia River hatcheries have been conducted to assess their contribution to salmon recovery. An independent scientific panel has identified hatchery programs that are not aiding in recovery and ways to reduce the harvest of ESA-listed fish. The summary conclusions of managing hatchery broodstocks for genetic integration with natural populations, promoting local adaptation, minimizing ecological interactions, and maximizing survival of hatchery fish were highlighted in a report funded by the Resource Renewal Institute. The report recommended establishing White House leadership for salmon recovery actions and transferring implementation responsibilities from the Bonneville Power Administration to the Fish and Wildlife Service. The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) is transferring funding to the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) for salmon recovery programs. Audit and oversight of the Northwest Power and Conservation Council and BPA are being initiated for compliance. Federal agencies are directed to consider climate change and population growth in salmon recovery plans. An Executive Order is issued to protect independent science in federal programs. Support is given for a study on the removal of the Lower Snake River Dams. The White House Council on Environmental Quality is tasked with developing a federal water management-salmon recovery plan for the Columbia River Basin.
