    "content": "The Act titled \"National Forest Fire Fuels Reduction Act\" addresses fire hazards caused by insect infestation and tree overcrowding in National Forest System lands. The National Forest Fire Fuels Reduction Act acknowledges the deteriorating forest health conditions on National Forest System lands and the need for immediate timber cutting to address the fire danger. Pending litigation hinders timely wildfire risk reduction, and existing processes are insufficient to mitigate the danger promptly. Collaboration with states, local governments, industry users, and some environmental groups supports environmentally responsive actions to create defensible fuel zones. The Secretary is authorized to cut additional timber within existing timber sale analysis areas to reduce insect and disease infestation or fire hazard, prioritizing areas near private properties where owners are already taking action. The Secretary is authorized to cut timber on lands with fire hazard or insect infestation near private properties or communities, high resource value areas, and existing roads. The Secretary is authorized to cut timber in areas with high fire hazards or insect infestation, using forest timber sale funds. Timber sales in preparation before the enactment of this Act are subject to its provisions. The Secretary will utilize all available authority, including private contractors and expedited fire contracting procedures, to prepare and advertise timber sales. The Secretary is authorized to prepare and advertise timber sales for forest fire fuels reduction, exempt from certain contracting regulations. Cost considerations will not preclude these activities, even if costs exceed revenues. The Secretary is authorized to conduct forest fire fuels reduction timber sales, with costs potentially exceeding revenues. Reforestation of harvested land must be promptly implemented, and sales can proceed despite any court orders. The Secretary is directed to expedite timber sales on Federal lands despite any court orders, including those related to the Endangered Species Act. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 allows for reduced restrictions on non-Federal lands within the range of the northern spotted owl, based on a 1994 analysis. This regulation does not necessitate an environmental impact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Forest fire fuels reduction timber sales are not subject to administrative review. Judicial review of such sales can only be conducted in the United States district court where the affected Federal lands are located, within 15 days of the initial advertisement of the sale. No waivers of this requirement are allowed. The Secretary is prohibited from awarding a challenged forest fire fuels reduction timber sale for 45 days after a challenge is filed. Courts cannot issue restraining orders or injunctions related to such sales, and the standard of review allows courts to permanently enjoin, modify, or void a sale. The court can permanently enjoin, modify, or void a forest fire fuels reduction timber sale if it is found to be arbitrary or not in accordance with the law. Civil actions must be heard promptly, and a final decision must be made within 45 days, unless more time is needed to comply with the Constitution. The district court may assign cases to Special Masters for prompt review and recommendations. The court can set rules for procedures with shorter time limits than Federal rules. Appeals must be filed within 30 days. The Secretary is prohibited from selecting certain Federal lands. The Secretary is prohibited from selecting, authorizing, or undertaking forest fire fuels reduction timber sales on excluded lands, which include areas in the National Wilderness Preservation System, roadless areas recommended for wilderness designation, and areas where timber harvesting is prohibited by statute. The Secretary is not required to issue formal rules under section 553 of title 5, United States Code, to implement this section or carry out the authorities provided by this section. The documents and procedures required for forest fire fuels reduction timber sales satisfy the requirements of various applicable Federal laws. The Endangered Species Act of 1973, National Forest Management Act of 1976, Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960, and international agreements are relevant. No sale unit can be released if endangered bird species are nesting within the acreage. The actions authorized should not impact wilderness capability, suitability, or roadless character. The Secretary is required to report to Congress. The Secretary must report to Congress on the implementation of this section by November 30, 2002, and every 6 months thereafter."
