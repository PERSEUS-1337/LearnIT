    "content": "Corinthian Colleges, Inc. (CCI) operated multiple for-profit higher education institutions with over 100 locations nationwide. The U.S. Department of Education placed CCI under increased financial oversight due to concerns about data inconsistencies and job placement rates. Corinthian Colleges, Inc. (CCI) faced financial issues due to data inconsistencies in job placement rates. To avoid closure, CCI reached an agreement with the U.S. Department of Education to sell or teach-out its programs. Zenith Education Group, a nonprofit subsidiary of ECMC, was formed to buy a significant number of CCI's schools in 2015. In February 2015, Zenith Education Group agreed to buy 53 of Corinthian Colleges, Inc.'s schools. As part of the agreement with the U.S. Department of Education (ED) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Zenith provided $480 million in debt relief to former CCI students. CCI faced a $30 million fine for misrepresenting job placement data at Heald College locations, leading to the closure of its remaining 30 schools with 13,500 enrolled students. CCI filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May 2015. Additional findings of misrepresentation were announced by ED in November 2015. Zenith Education Group agreed to provide $480 million in debt relief for former Corinthian Colleges, Inc. (CCI) students who took out private education loans. The relief will reduce borrowers' total loan balances by 40%, benefiting those with qualifying Genesis loans. Borrowers will still be responsible for repaying the remaining balance. Eligible borrowers do not need to attend the CCI schools purchased by Zenith to qualify for this debt relief. Students who attended a CCI school that closed may be eligible to have the full balance of their outstanding HEA Title IV loans discharged without needing to take additional steps. Loan servicers will notify borrowers if they qualify for debt relief, which applies to loans made under the Direct Loan, Federal Family Education Loan, and Perkins Loan programs. Different procedures may apply depending on the reason for loan discharge, such as school closure or borrower defense against repayment. Borrowers of Parent PLUS Loans may be eligible for loan discharge if they are unable to complete their program due to school closure. Discharged loans may result in reimbursement of previous payments and removal of adverse credit history. Eligibility criteria include stopping attendance within 120 days of closure and inability to complete the program at the closed school or a comparable program elsewhere. The closing school offers students the option to complete their education through a teach-out at another school. If a student refuses the teach-out and enrolls in a similar program at another school, they may not qualify for loan discharge. Borrowers attending closed CCI schools in April 2015 are eligible for loan discharge if they do not finish their program through a teach-out or transfer credits to a similar program. The Department of Education (ED) has expanded the timeframe for students who attended closed CCI schools in April 2015 to have their Title IV student loans discharged. Approximately 15,000 students are now eligible for loan discharge, with borrowers required to fill out an application and continue making payments until a decision is made. Loan servicers can grant forbearance during the application process. Borrowers attending closed CCI schools can seek loan discharge by cooperating with ED in legal proceedings. Failure to cooperate may result in revocation of discharge. Borrowers may assert defenses against repayment on FFEL or DL program loans. Borrowers of DL program loans can defend against repayment based on acts or omissions of the school. If successful, ED will determine the debt amount. If a borrower successfully defends against repayment, ED will determine the amount of debt relief, which may include forgiving part or all of the loan balance and reimbursing previous payments. Adverse credit history linked to the loan will be removed. There is no established process for seeking debt relief through a defense against repayment, but a committee was formed in 2015 to create procedures for such claims. The Department of Education (ED) appointed a Special Master to oversee borrower defense issues for former Corinthian Colleges Inc. (CCI) students and develop a system to support students at other institutions with repayment claims. Borrowers who submitted claims before June 8, 2015, or subsequently, can request loan forbearance and stop collections on defaulted loans. ED streamlined the process for borrowers who attended CCI's Heald College locations and found misrepresentations in job placement rates, resulting in a $30 million fine. The Department of Education fined the company $30 million for misrepresentations in job placement rates at Heald College programs. Eligible borrowers can apply for loan discharge through an expedited process by completing an attestation form. Borrowers can also request forbearance and stop collections on defaulted loans while their claims are processed. Additionally, findings were announced against CCI for misrepresenting placement rates at Everest Colleges, Wyotech campuses, and Everest University online.

Borrowers can also request forbearance and stop collections on defaulted loans while their claims are processed. Additionally, findings were announced against CCI for misrepresenting placement rates at Everest Colleges, Wyotech campuses, and Everest University online. The Special Master has begun a review of the findings, speculating that approximately 15,000 former CCI students may be eligible for closed school discharge under expanded withdrawal timeframes. As of November 18, 2015, ED had received 10,527 applications for closed school discharge, with 5,814 approved, resulting in approximately $75,461,790 in federal student loans being discharged. As of December 3, 2015, 5,340 borrowers from Heald, Everest, and Wyotech schools had submitted defense against repayment claims to ED. The Special Master recommended debt relief for 1,312 Heald students, resulting in $27,832,370 in discharged Title IV loans. Loan discharge won't affect future loan eligibility. The lifetime loan limit amounts and time limits for student loans are not likely to be affected by loan discharge due to school closure. The period of attendance at a closed institution does not count towards eligibility for additional assistance. When student loan debt is forgiven, the canceled amount is included in the borrower's gross income according to the Internal Revenue Code. The IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2015-57 addressing tax treatment for former CCI students with discharged federal student loans. Under the procedure, students won't be taxed on discharged loans under certain conditions. Former CCI students with discharged federal student loans will not be taxed on the amount of the loan discharge. They also do not have to increase taxes owed in the year of discharge to account for previously claimed education-related credits and deductions. However, the tax treatment of former CCI students with forgiven private education loans is not addressed in the revenue procedure, potentially subjecting them to having the discharged loan amount included in their gross income unless they qualify for an exemption. Students who were insolvent may avoid taxation on discharged debts if based on fraud or misrepresentation. No relief for Pell Grant recipients or restoration of Pell lifetime eligibility. The closure of schools does not provide relief for students who used Pell Grants or GI Bill benefits. There are no provisions to restore eligibility for Pell Grants or GI Bill entitlement. The Department of Veterans Affairs ensures that no debts will be created for students due to school closures. Students who used GI Bill benefits at a closed school may not have their entitlement restored, but they will not have to repay the benefits received."
