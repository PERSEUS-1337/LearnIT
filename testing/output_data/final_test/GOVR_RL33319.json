    "content": "As Congress considers immigration reform legislation, concerns arise about the Department of Homeland Security's ability to handle increased immigration workload. Secretary Michael Chertoff initiated the Second Stage Review to prioritize work based on risk, focusing on strengthening border security, interior enforcement, and reforming immigration processes. DHS agencies involved in immigration functions include Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported management problems in DHS immigration agencies, with the Heritage Foundation highlighting increased agency involvement and resulting issues. Assessing DHS effectiveness in immigration policy involves considering immigration laws, agency management, and funding resources. The report focuses on the management and administration of immigration policy within DHS, analyzing the division of responsibilities and organizational structure. It includes a brief history of federal immigration responsibility, an overview of current immigration functions in DHS, and an analysis of available workload data. The report provides perspectives on immigration workload data and the history of federal immigration responsibility. Congress's role in naturalization and immigration is derived from the U.S. Constitution. Various immigration functions were transferred between departments over time, leading to the establishment of the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization. The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) was established in 1933, later moving to the Department of Justice in 1940 for national security reasons. In 1952, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) consolidated immigration laws. Currently, five federal departments, with the Department of Homeland Security as the lead, have important immigration responsibilities. In the 1970s and 1980s, organizational critiques of INS arose due to its inability to control illegal immigration and growing backlogs of adjudications. The GAO published reports highlighting problems in adjudications, enforcement of immigration laws, and case record management. The Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy recommended strengthening and streamlining INS, suggesting elevating it as an agency within DOJ and upgrading the Commissioner to a Director reporting directly to the Attorney General. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) further strengthened immigration enforcement. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) strengthened immigration enforcement by authorizing legal sanctions against employers who hire unauthorized aliens and legalized the status of millions of unauthorized aliens in the US. However, it did not address the organizational issues raised by the Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy (SCIRP). The IRCA Commission called for the creation of an Agency for Migration Affairs to address these issues. The 1990 final report recommended creating an Agency for Migration Affairs to consolidate immigration, naturalization, and refugee functions. Concerns about INS management focused on balancing immigration benefits adjudication and law enforcement. The U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform in 1997 also highlighted administrative and management problems. The U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform identified administrative and management issues within the INS, recommending a fundamental reorganization by dismantling the agency. Reports from the GAO and DOJ Office of Inspector General criticized INS for outdated databases, lack of system integration, and communication gaps among field offices. The U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform recommended a reorganization of INS due to administrative and management issues, including outdated databases and communication gaps. Previous Commissioners proposed restructuring INS into separate enforcement and service branches, with legislative action considered post-9/11 attacks. Congress debated creating a new immigration agency within DOJ or dispersing INS's functions among different agencies before ultimately establishing the DHS. The debate in the 107th Congress focused on the location of immigration and citizenship functions previously handled by INS and DOS. Options included placing INS in a new DHS division, splitting enforcement and service functions, or creating a separate Directorate of Immigration Affairs within DHS. The debate in the 107th Congress focused on the location of immigration and citizenship functions previously handled by INS and DOS. Options included placing INS in a new DHS division, splitting enforcement and service functions, or creating a separate Directorate of Immigration Affairs within DHS. There was considerable debate over whether the issuances of visas should remain with the DOS when the President's proposal to establish DHS was debated. The House Select Committee on Homeland Security approved compromise language on visa issuances in H.R. 5005 that retained DOS's administrative role but added specific language to address policy and national security concerns. The House passed H.R. 5005, retaining the compromise language on visa issuances in the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The act placed immigration functions into a Bureau of Border Security and kept the U.S. Customs Service intact. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency reported directly to the Secretary of Homeland Security under the act. The USCIS reports directly to the Secretary of Homeland Security and is responsible for adjudicating immigration petitions, naturalization petitions, refugee and asylum claims. The Attorney General retains authority over immigration law interpretation. The EOIR, which administers federal immigration laws, remains in the DOJ. Section 1502 of the HSA gives the President authority for the first year. The HSA granted the President authority to reorganize the newly created Department of Homeland Security. This led to the split of the U.S. Customs Service and the Bureau of Border Security into Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for border activities and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for interior enforcement in 2003. In 2003, the Department of Homeland Security split the U.S. Customs Service and the Bureau of Border Security into Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for border activities and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for interior enforcement. CBP inspectors are now responsible for all primary inspections at the border. The Department of Homeland Security split the U.S. Customs Service and the Bureau of Border Security in 2003, creating Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for border activities. CBP inspectors enforce laws for all aliens seeking entry into the United States, inspecting individuals for citizenship status and admissibility. Goods imported into the U.S. are subject to customs inspection, while animals and plants are also inspected at the border. Legal, administrative, and policy issues have arisen with unified border inspections, including concerns over the working relationship between the Department of State (DOS) and DHS regarding visa issuances. The Department of Homeland Security established Customs and Border Protection in 2003 to handle border activities, with CBP inspectors enforcing laws for all aliens seeking entry into the U.S. Concerns have arisen over the working relationship between DOS and DHS regarding visa issuances, with proponents of DOS playing a principal role in visa issuances citing consular officers' country-specific knowledge. Former DHS Secretary Thomas Ridge created an Office of International Enforcement in the Border and Transportation Security Directorate to oversee DHS's activities under the MOU with DOS. The Department of Homeland Security established Customs and Border Protection in 2003 to handle border activities, including enforcing immigration laws and conducting inspections at U.S. ports of entry. Border patrol coordinates with other federal agencies for border security and management, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Coast Guard. U.S. Coast Guard and CBP inspectors verify individuals seeking entry into the United States, determining their eligibility and status. They inspect passports, visas, and use databases like US-VISIT to confirm eligibility. Immigration inspectors also facilitate the processing of people into the country, including asylum seekers without proper documents. They are seen as having dual roles of enforcement and service. The law requires pre-inspection programs at selected overseas locations to prevent inadmissible aliens from entering the United States. CBP inspectors at foreign airports, part of the Immigration Security Initiative, identify national security threats. Passenger manifests are transmitted through APIS for advance inspections. Programs like PortPASS, now under CBP, expedite traveler processing. The PortPASS program, now under CBP, allows precleared enrollees to bypass immigration and customs inspections at land ports of entry, easing commuter traffic with dedicated lanes for low-risk frequent travelers. ICE investigators focus on immigration-related probes, national security priorities, suspected criminal acts, fraudulent activities, and alien smuggling and trafficking.ICE investigators are considered law enforcement agents. ICE investigators, a subset of law enforcement agents, prioritize investigating violations of immigration law related to illegal aliens working in the US. This includes employers hiring illegal aliens. The Detention and Removal Office oversees custody of detained aliens and their deportation, focusing on those with criminal, terrorist, or national security backgrounds as required by the INA. ICE investigators prioritize investigating violations of immigration law related to illegal aliens working in the US, including employers hiring illegal aliens. The Detention and Removal Office oversees custody of detained aliens for deportation, focusing on those with criminal, terrorist, or national security backgrounds as required by the INA. Deportable individuals include those with final orders of deportation, asylum seekers pending determination, and aliens identified for removal based on specified grounds such as criminal offenses, terrorist activities, security concerns, falsification of documents, unlawful voting, immigration fraud, violations of immigration status, and becoming a public charge within five years of entry. ICE maintains databases tracking aliens in the US, including the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS) for certain foreign nationals subject to special registration requirements. The National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS) requires certain foreign nationals from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, and Syria to undergo special registration procedures upon entry to the US. Nonimmigrants are fingerprinted, photographed, and registered at the port of entry. DHS may require additional registration interviews at ICE offices to ensure compliance with visa conditions. Additionally, the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) tracks foreign students studying in the US after admission to certified schools. The SEVIS system tracks student information, while the US-VISIT system uses biometric data for identity verification. US-VISIT draws on the IDENT system and other databases. Exit pilot programs for biometric data collection are in place at 15 air and sea ports. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorist Prevention Act of 2004 calls for accelerated implementation of a comprehensive entry and exit data system. DHS announced the third increment of US-VISIT on September 14, 2005, stating that entry procedures would be implemented at all land border ports of entry by December 31, 2005. USCIS handles immigration petitions, naturalization petitions, refugee and asylum claims, and related services. DOS Consular Affairs partners with USCIS for visa issuance. USCIS adjudicators determine eligibility for visa issuance, naturalization, and adjustment to LPR status. They assess residency, moral character, English proficiency, and knowledge of U.S. government for aliens seeking citizenship. Background checks are required for all applicants. The USCIS Office of International Affairs adjudicates refugee applications, processes parolees, conducts background checks for immigrant petitions abroad, and handles asylum cases. USCIS also deals with humanitarian cases like Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and makes determinations on various immigration benefits and services. ICE officials determine humanitarian parole recipients. USCIS provides a range of immigration benefits and services, including processing work authorizations and adjudicating immigration and naturalization petitions. The agency must confirm eligibility for specific immigration statuses and address any legal requirements. USCIS has the Office of Fraud Detection and National Security to handle national security issues and identify fraud in immigration processes. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) established the Ombudsman for the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to assist individuals and employers with resolving problems, proposing changes in administrative practices, and submitting annual reports to Congress on improving services. The DHS also transferred the responsibility of compiling and analyzing immigration data to the Assistant Secretary for Management. The DHS established the Office of Immigration Statistics (OIS) to analyze immigration data and assess its effects in the United States. Secretary Chertoff's Second Stage Review (2SR) in 2005 led to department reorganization and new policy initiatives, including measures to secure borders and reduce illegal migration demand. The DHS reorganized to enhance security and improve customer service, abolishing the Directorate of BTS but keeping CBP, ICE, and USCIS separate. A new Directorate of Policy now handles policy coordination functions, with broad support for this department-wide policy function. Senator Susan Collins emphasized the need for an Under Secretary for Policy in January 2005. The DHS reorganized to enhance security and improve customer service, abolishing the Directorate of BTS but keeping CBP, ICE, and USCIS separate. A new Directorate of Policy now handles policy coordination functions, with broad support for this department-wide policy function. There is unanimity on the need for an Under Secretary for Policy to establish crosscutting immigration policy and departmental policy on various homeland security matters. The 2SR organizational structure, effective in October 2005, gives CBP, ICE, and USCIS a direct line to the DHS Secretary, alongside other key operational components. The intersection of the new Directorate of Policy with these operational components is yet to be clarified. The DHS reorganized in October 2005 to enhance security and customer service, abolishing the Directorate of BTS. The DHS Office of Immigration Statistics publishes data on immigration workload, based on the Performance Analysis System (PAS) from FY1997-FY2005. PAS data measures immigration workload and reflects staff allocation and resource demand. The DHS Office of Immigration Statistics uses the Performance Analysis System (PAS) to measure immigration workload, which is influenced by external factors like demographic, social, and political aspects. Border patrol apprehensions are shaped by DHS resources and external factors driving illegal crossings. The workload in adjudication of benefits and services is influenced by external factors, while enforcement workload is a combination of resources, staffing, and external factors. The PAS data provides snapshots of immigration workload, with petitions for immigration adjudications dominating USCIS service-side workload. The USCIS handles naturalization petitions, refugee and asylum claims, family petitions, foreign worker petitions, employment authorizations, and adjustments of status. In FY2005, 5.6 million immigration applications were filed, with a peak of 7.3 million petitions in FY2001. The pending immigration caseload has been decreasing, with 3.2 million cases pending in FY2005, the lowest since FY2000. The number of LPRs petitioning to naturalize has increased in the past year but has not reached the highs of the mid-1990s. The pending caseload for naturalization remains over half a million, with some LPRs waiting one to two years for processing. Asylum petitions filed decreased in the late 1990s but rose again to 66,356 in FY2001, with 42,114 claims filed in FY2003. The number of asylum cases filed with USCIS has decreased to 32,900 in FY2005, with approval rates varying from 28% to 44%. The pending USCIS asylum caseload declined after processing reforms in the 1990s, reaching 98,499 by the close of FY2005. CBP inspected 417.0 million persons in FY2005, with the majority entering at land ports of entry. The southwest border sees the highest volume of travelers seeking entry into the United States, with a small percentage found inadmissible. Border patrol agents, mainly deployed along the southwest border, spend much of their time apprehending aliens. Apprehensions at the southwest border had decreased until recently, with a sharp drop after September 11. Prosecutions for immigration violations peaked in FY2000 and decreased in FY2003. In FY2003, 5,670 defendants were prosecuted for criminal alien cases, fraud investigations, and smuggling cases. Arrests for immigration law violations have significantly decreased, with employer violations dropping from 17,554 in FY1997 to 445 in FY2003. The number of employers violating immigration laws decreased significantly from 17,554 in FY1997 to 445 in FY2003. This decline is attributed to policy shifts towards other enforcement priorities. Arrests of aliens for immigration violations also decreased, from 14,963 in FY2000 to 9,319 in FY2003. Alien removals increased from FY1997 to FY2000 but dropped in 2001 before reaching a high of 204,193 in FY2005. Various grounds, including criminal offenses and immigration fraud, lead to alien removals. The number of alien removals dropped by 7,979 from FY2000 but reached a high of 204,193 by FY2005. Criminal aliens removed have increased steadily, while noncriminal grounds remain the main basis for removals. Immigration workload has declined since 2001, except for the removal of aliens. Some workload trends are increasing, such as border apprehensions and immigration adjudications, while others have declined or remained flat. DHS is making progress in managing immigration caseloads, with USCIS showing a reduction in pending cases. The drop in CBP inspections reflects international travel trends more than CBP policies. Qualitative analyses and organizational evaluations provide a broader understanding of the immigration system. Specific concerns include integration issues between ICE and CBP. Representative Christopher Cox raised questions about DHS organization during a House Committee hearing in March 2005. Questions remain about whether DHS is managing its immigration enforcement and border security resources efficiently. Anecdotal evidence suggests that separating customs and immigration inspectors from their investigative colleagues may hinder cooperation between ICE and CBP. Some believe that the distinction between ICE's 'interior enforcement' and CBP's 'border security' functions leads to administrative overlaps and conflicts. Media reports focus on criticisms by stakeholders, including concerns about separate legal offices for ICE and CBP. One of the biggest problems in immigration enforcement is the lack of coordination between ICE and CBP due to separate legal offices and differing interpretations. There are disputes over parole for investigative leads, with concerns that former Customs agents at ICE prioritize investigations over enforcing immigration rules. Public opinion shows a disapproval of the Administration's handling of illegal immigration, highlighting the need for better integration and coordination between agencies. The lack of coordination between USCIS and ICE in fraud and national security investigations is a significant issue. USCIS established the Office of Fraud Detection and National Security to handle these matters, previously done by the INS enforcement arm now part of ICE. The GAO reported difficulties in investigations regarding benefit fraud, with USCIS field officials noting ICE's lack of resources to pursue cases as needed. Additionally, USCIS faces problems with background checks according to the DHS Inspector General. The DHS Inspector General found issues with USCIS's background checks, citing reliance on applicant-submitted information and lack of a risk-based plan for security checks. USCIS's management controls were deemed insufficient, leading to processing backlogs. Despite progress in reducing pending cases, USCIS may struggle to eliminate backlogs for certain complex application types. The dispersal of immigration functions across three agencies within DHS creates challenges in clear chain of command. Only the Director of USCIS has exclusive immigration responsibilities. The Secretary of DHS shares immigration policymaking roles with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State. The disaggregation of immigration operations within DHS raises questions about the effectiveness of the organizational structure. Independent assessments have highlighted various management problems, including issues with USCIS processing, ICE enforcement efforts, and cooperation between CBP and ICE. The GAO has noted that many of the management issues from the former INS persist within the DHS structure. The former INS remains within the DHS organizational structure, and the paucity of evaluations describing successes does not necessarily indicate failure. Inspector general reports focus on areas needing improvement, which may be due to inadequacies in immigration laws or funding rather than agency management. The question remains whether enough time has passed to assess DHS's effectiveness in managing immigration policy. Congress is considering comprehensive immigration reform and the effectiveness of DHS's current configuration in implementing such reform, raising organizational issues. Key organizational issues regarding communication and coordination among CBP, ICE, and USCIS, the agency responsible for legal opinions on immigration law and policy, the need for a formal enforcement arm for USCIS, and the potential merger of immigration enforcement functions in CBP and ICE are being addressed in the broader policy-making context by Congress. The effectiveness of DHS in managing immigration policy and the potential for substantial reorganization of immigration functions are also being considered. Congress considers three key elements - immigration laws, funding, and management - to achieve an effective immigration policy. The Department of State issues visas, while USCIS approves immigrant petitions for legal permanent residency. Visa requirements are outlined in the INA, with some flexibility for additional regulations. All aliens must adhere to these requirements when seeking visas. The Visa Waiver Program requires all aliens seeking visas to undergo admissibility reviews by DOS consular officers. These reviews ensure eligibility for visas and admission, checking for criminal, national security, health, and immigration law violations. Machine-readable visas with biometric identifiers like finger scans have been issued since October 2004. The 9/11 Commission emphasized the importance of targeting travel as a weapon against terrorists. The 9/11 Commission recommended combining intelligence, operations, and law enforcement to target and disrupt individuals involved in fraudulent visas and passports. The Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration administers refugee assistance programs. The Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration oversees U.S. contributions to organizations aiding refugees abroad and coordinates refugee admissions to the United States. It collaborates with various agencies and international organizations to shape U.S. migration policy and participates in regional migration dialogues. The Executive Office of Immigration Review interprets immigration laws in Department of Justice Immigration Courts. The Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR) administers federal immigration laws through immigration court proceedings, appellate reviews, and administrative hearings. It consists of the Board of Immigration Appeals, the Office of the Chief Immigration Judge, and the Office of the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer. EOIR decides cases related to eligibility, inadmissibility, deportation, asylum appeals, and relief from deportation. Legislation has been introduced to create statutory authority for EOIR within the Department of Justice. The Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR) administers federal immigration laws through court proceedings and hearings. Legislation has been introduced to establish statutory authority for EOIR within the Department of Justice, allowing the Attorney General to play a crucial role in interpreting immigration law. The Office of the Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices investigates and prosecutes charges of immigration-related employment discrimination, offering grants for public education programs on anti-discrimination provisions. The Attorney General has significant authority in enforcing and interpreting immigration law, especially through overseeing the Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR). While the Department of Homeland Security has primary responsibility for immigration law enforcement, the Attorney General retains important powers in this area. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) lead in protection against foreign nationals with communicable diseases. A medical examination is required for aliens seeking legal permanent residency or refugees, and may be required for aliens seeking nonimmigrant visas. Immigration inspection determines if an alien is inadmissible due to a health-related condition, including AIDS and other communicable diseases. The Office of Refugee Resettlement in HHS oversees refugee resettlement since the 1980 Refugee Act. The HHS refugee resettlement program administers transitional assistance for refugees and Cuban/Haitian entrants. The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 makes trafficking victims eligible for benefits. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred responsibility for unaccompanied alien children to HHS. The Department of Labor handles labor certifications for foreign workers. The Department of Labor oversees labor certifications for foreign workers, including permanent employment-based immigrants, temporary agricultural workers, and temporary nonagricultural workers. The U.S. employer is responsible for completing the foreign labor certification process. The Wage and Hour Division enforces worker protections for temporary foreign worker visa categories, including minimum wage, overtime, child labor laws, and prevailing wage requirements. The U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform recommended restructuring the INS to improve management of the federal immigration system. They proposed a clear division of responsibility among existing federal agencies and consolidation of functions. This included restructuring immigration enforcement operations at the border and in the interior of the United States. The U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform recommended restructuring the INS to improve management of the federal immigration system by streamlining responsibilities among different federal agencies. This includes adjudication of immigration-related applications, enforcement of immigration-related employment standards, and appeals of administrative decisions. The goal is to ensure coherence, consistency, and fairness in immigration law enforcement and services. The U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform recommended restructuring the INS to improve management of the federal immigration system by streamlining responsibilities among different federal agencies. This includes adjudication of immigration-related applications, enforcement of immigration-related labor standards, and fair review of immigration decisions. The reorganization plan modified the immigration enforcement functions by creating the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which combined INS interior enforcement functions with resources and missions from the Customs Service and the Federal Protective Service. The Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement will enforce immigration and customs laws within the US interior and protect federal buildings. The Assistant Secretary will oversee detention and removal programs, intelligence, and investigations, advising on policies that may affect the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services. The Act establishes services under Subtitle E, renaming the \"Customs Service\" to the \"Bureau of Customs and Border Protection.\" The Bureau will be under the Commissioner of Customs and report to the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security, combining resources and missions related to borders and ports of entry. The Commissioner will oversee Border Patrol, inspections programs, and agricultural inspections. The Assistant Secretary advises the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security on policies and operations of the Bureau that may impact the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services."
