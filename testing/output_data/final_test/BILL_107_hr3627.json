    "content": "The \"No Safe Harbor Act\" states that harboring or supporting individuals engaged in terrorist activities against the US will be considered acts of aggression. Failure to assist in identifying or prosecuting terrorists will also be seen as aggression. Sanctions will be imposed as a result. The President may impose sanctions on countries supporting terrorism or not cooperating with US antiterrorism efforts. This includes countries failing to assist in antiterrorist investigations or providing sanctuary for terrorists. The President may impose sanctions on countries that provide sanctuary for individuals suspected of terrorist activity, fail to extradite suspects, allow support for terrorist groups, recruit individuals for terrorism, or refuse to assist in intelligence gathering related to terrorist activity. Sanctions may be imposed on countries that support terrorist activity, including economic embargo and blocking property of such countries in the United States. Sanctions may include prohibiting imports and exports, travel restrictions, and denial of entry into the United States for citizens or nationals of the sanctioned country. The President may impose sanctions on entities by blocking their property in the US and prohibiting imports and exports. The President has regulatory authority to issue necessary regulations, licenses, and orders, with penalties for violations under this Act. The Emergency Economic Powers Act penalties apply to violations under this Act. The President has the authority to compensate victims of terrorism by liquidating blocked property. The President can also waive provisions for countries or entities based on national interests. Definitions are provided in the legislation. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. This section defines \"terrorist activity\" and \"United States person\" in the context of the Act."
