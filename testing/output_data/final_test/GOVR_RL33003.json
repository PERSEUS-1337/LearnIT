    "content": "Since 1952, Egypt's military has produced four presidents: Gamal Abdel Nasser, Anwar Sadat, Hosni Mubarak, and Abdel Fattah el Sisi. These leaders have ruled with strong support from the security establishment, facing opposition mainly from the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. The Arab Spring in 2011 led to Mubarak's resignation, briefly altering Egypt's political landscape. During the tumultuous period following Hosni Mubarak's resignation in February 2011, Egypt experienced political upheaval, including the presidency of Muhammad Morsi from the Muslim Brotherhood. Morsi's rule exposed deep divisions in Egyptian politics, leading to mutual distrust, political gridlock, and public dissatisfaction. Following mass demonstrations against Morsi's rule, Egypt's military, led by Defense Minister Sisi, dissolved Morsi's government, suspended the constitution, and installed an interim president. The Muslim Brotherhood protested, leading to a violent crackdown by the military and police, resulting in the deaths of at least 1,150 demonstrators. The military justified their actions as necessary for national security. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al Sisi justifies actions against encampments as a national security threat. Egypt aims for a more independent role in the region, expanding international support beyond the U.S. Relations with the Trump Administration are strong, but Egypt also partners with Arab Gulf states, Israel, Russia, and France. Criticism of Egypt's human rights record hinders closer U.S.-Egyptian ties. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al Sisi has widened crackdown against dissent, aiming at Muslim Brotherhood initially but now encompassing broader political speech. Proposed constitutional amendments would give Sisi unprecedented power, extending presidential term limits and executive control over judiciary. Sisi's consolidation of power includes placing family members in key positions, stifling opposition and criticism. This comes amid steady economic growth in Egypt. The Egyptian government has implemented austerity measures to reduce debt, despite steady economic growth. Economists predict a 5.3% GDP growth driven by tourism and gas production. However, Egyptians face double-digit inflation due to currency fluctuations and subsidy cuts. President Sisi defends his economic policies, acknowledging the hardships of reform. The IMF has commended Egypt's reform efforts. The IMF praises Egypt's reform efforts, emphasizing the need for private sector growth to absorb the labor force. Recent developments show an active foreign policy, including hosting international forums and President Sisi leading the African Union. Discussions at the EU-Arab summit focused on terrorism, migration, and the growing Chinese and Russian interest in the Middle East. President Sisi in Egypt is consolidating power with the help of political allies from the security establishment. Key personnel changes were made in June 2018, including appointing Mohamed Ahmed Zaki as defense minister and Mahmoud Tawfik as interior minister. A new law passed in July 2018 grants judicial immunity to senior military commanders for acts committed since the 2013 military coup. The new law in Egypt grants immunity to senior military commanders, potentially keeping them on reserve duty for life and ineligible to run for president. Prosecution of senior commanders under this law requires authorization from the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces appointed by President Sisi. The law aims to deter challenges to President Sisi's rule, potentially allowing him to remain president for life through proposed constitutional amendments. Proposed changes to the constitution in Egypt could allow President Sisi to serve two additional terms, grant him more authority over judicial appointments, and establish a new Senate. President Sisi has faced international criticism for cracking down on political dissent and freedom of expression. The U.S. State Department's report on human rights conditions in Egypt in 2017 highlighted various issues including arbitrary killings, disappearances, torture, harsh prison conditions, arbitrary arrests, political prisoners, limits on freedom of expression, restrictions on the press and internet, and discrimination against LGBTI persons. The government in Egypt faced arrests, imprisonment, and degrading treatment. There were reports of child labor and ineffective response to violence against women. International organizations rank Egypt globally on human rights, democracy, and development. Other issues include convictions of civil society representatives in 2013, controversial NGO law in 2017, detention of American citizens, and treatment of Coptic Christians. In Egypt, individuals were wrongly convicted in Case 173 for operating without a license and receiving foreign funds. After a retrial in 2018, they were acquitted of all charges. U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo supported President Sisi's efforts to amend Egyptian law to prevent similar incidents. However, Case 173 remains active with asset freezes and travel bans on Egyptian civil society activists. In Egypt, asset freezes and travel bans were imposed on civil society activists. President Sisi signed Law 70 of 2017, which drew international condemnation. The new law requires NGOs to get approval from internal security for foreign funding and restricts their activities. President Sisi announced plans to amend the law at the World Youth Forum in 2018. Egypt is working on amending laws to regulate NGOs better. The Ministry of Social Solidarity is in talks with local NGOs to make necessary changes. American citizens detained in Egypt, like Mustafa Kassem, are straining U.S.-Egyptian relations. Lawmakers are seeking Trump Administration support for Kassem's release. American citizen Mustafa Kassem is wrongfully arrested and convicted in Egypt. Vice President Pence raised his case with President Sisi in 2018. Despite Sisi's calls for Muslim-Christian coexistence, Coptic Christians still face discrimination and attacks. Coptic Christians in Egypt have concerns about state regulation of church construction, with demands for reform of long-standing laws dating back to 1856 and 1934. The 2014 constitution mandates parliament to reform building code regulations, leading to the approval of a church construction law in 2016. Despite some welcoming the law, others argue it remains discriminatory, allowing governors to deny permits without appeal and imposing security provisions. The IMF projects 5.3% GDP growth for Egypt in 2019, supported by strong policy implementation. A $12 billion loan agreement with the IMF has seen $10 billion disbursed as of March 2019. Key sources of foreign exchange are up, unemployment is at its lowest since 2011, and the government has implemented economic reforms recommended by the IMF. Egypt's energy sector is also contributing to the economy's rebound. Egypt's energy sector is boosting the economy's recovery, with the country being the largest oil producer in Africa outside of OPEC and the third-largest natural gas producer on the continent. The Zohr natural gas field, the largest ever discovered in the Mediterranean Sea, has started commercial output. Egypt aims to become a regional gas hub by utilizing its own gas fields and importing gas from Israel and Cyprus for liquefaction and reexport. Israeli and Egyptian companies have acquired shares in an undersea pipeline connecting Israel to the northern Sinai Peninsula. An undersea pipeline connecting Israel to the northern Sinai Peninsula will transport natural gas from Israel to Egypt for reexport as part of a $15 billion gas deal. Egypt convened the Eastern Mediterranean Gas Forum to consolidate regional energy policies. Despite positive economic outlook, challenges remain with high inflation and growing public and foreign debt. In recent years, Egypt's high debt levels have led to the government allocating a significant portion of the budget towards debt-service payments, impacting spending on health and education. Economists predict that public debt will reach 84.8% of GDP and external debt 32% of GDP ($101.7 billion) in 2019. Despite successful economic reforms in the short term, structural issues like heavy dependence on imports in the industrial sector pose challenges. The economy's growth increases demand for foreign currency, putting pressure on dollar reserves, which have been built up through foreign borrowing, leading to a significant increase in foreign debt. Experts warn that without addressing these issues, Egypt's finances could face another crisis soon. Egypt's military plays a significant role in the nation's economy as a food producer and manufacturer of consumable products. The military is economically self-sufficient, producing and selling surplus goods for revenue. Military-owned companies benefit from infrastructure contracts and have expanded into new markets, offering cheaper goods than imports or private sector products. President Sisi, who came to power in 2014, aims to defeat terrorist groups and their ideology, particularly the Muslim Brotherhood. He has cracked down on a wide range of opponents, leading to ongoing terrorist violence in Egypt, especially in the Sinai Peninsula. The Islamic State's Sinai Province affiliate (IS-SP) has been conducting an insurgency against the Egyptian government since 2011. IS-SP is known as the most lethal terrorist group in Egypt, responsible for attacks on the military, Coptic Christians, and Russian tourists. The deadliest attack in Egypt's modern history was carried out by IS-SP at the Al Rawdah mosque in 2017, killing 305 people. Combatting terrorism in the Sinai is challenging due to various factors, including geography. The Sinai Peninsula poses challenges for the Egyptian government due to its mountainous terrain, sparse population, and a mix of Palestinians and Bedouin Arab tribes with a history of distrust towards the state. Bedouins face discrimination and exclusion, leading to a thriving black market economy based on smuggling. Residents seek autonomy and basic rights such as property rights and access to government services. The lack of development and underinvestment in northern Sinai exacerbate these issues. Economics: Bedouins in northern Sinai claim Egypt has underinvested in the region, focusing on southern tourist destinations instead. The flat desert terrain lacks irrigation for large-scale agriculture. Egyptian governance in Sinai has been hindered by corruption. Diplomacy: The 1979 Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty limits Egypt's military presence in Sinai, serving as a buffer zone between the two countries since Israel returned control in 1982. The Multinational Force and Observers (MFO) monitor the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty in the Sinai. Egypt and Israel cooperate in countering terrorism, with reports of close military coordination. Israel has conducted covert airstrikes in Egypt with approval. Egyptian forces have declared a state of emergency to combat IS-SP in northern Sinai. Egyptian forces and police have imposed a state of emergency, curfews, and travel restrictions in northern Sinai. Media access has been limited, and an old air base may be upgraded for counterterrorism operations. Critics argue that military action alone is insufficient and policies addressing local grievances are needed. Residents of Sinai face restrictions on joining senior state positions, army, and police. Residents of North Sinai are prohibited from holding senior state positions, working in the army, police, judiciary, or diplomacy. Development projects in the region have been lacking for 40 years, with villages like Rafah and Sheikh Zuwayed lacking schools, hospitals, and modern water systems. Egyptian military efforts in Sinai have reduced terrorist attacks, with the 2018 \"Operation Sinai\" campaign eliminating IS-SP leaders. The military armed progovernment tribesmen to assist in combating militants, a new strategy in the region. The military's recent campaign in northern Sinai has restricted militants' movements, destroyed hideouts, and eliminated trained elements. However, once the military reduces its presence, terrorist groups may reconstitute. CENTCOM Commander General Joseph L. Votel praised the Egyptian Armed Forces for effectively fighting ISIS in Sinai and addressing underlying issues. In other areas of Egypt, small nationalist insurgent groups like Liwa al Thawra and Harakat Sawaed Misr pose a threat. Insurgent groups like Liwa al Thawra and HASM, formed by former Muslim Brotherhood activists, have carried out assassinations and bombings in Egypt. The U.S. State Department designated them as Global Terrorists in 2018. Attacks on the economy persist, such as the bombing of a tourist bus in Giza in December 2018. In Egypt, a roadside bomb near the pyramids in Giza killed 4 people and injured 11 others. No group claimed responsibility for the attack. Egypt and Israel have cooperated on a $15 billion natural gas deal, while also working together against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Egypt is working to broker talks between Israel and Hamas to establish a cease-fire in Gaza. They oppose Islamist groups in the region and are trying to weaken Hamas by restoring Palestinian Authority presence in Gaza. Egypt controls the Rafah border crossing into Gaza, giving them leverage over the situation. Egypt's control over the Rafah border crossing gives them leverage over Hamas, but they use it cautiously to avoid a humanitarian crisis. Egypt has strong relations with Gulf Arab monarchies like Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Kuwait, who have provided financial assistance to Egypt. Saudi Arabia hosts millions of Egyptian expatriates and UAE companies have invested in the Egyptian economy. Egypt transferred sovereignty of two islands to Saudi Arabia, sparking criticism of President Sisi. In June 2017, Egypt joined Gulf Arab monarchies in boycotting Qatar. Egypt supports Saudi-led coalition in Yemen against Houthi forces, backs Haftar in Libya, seeks order on western border, and aims for return of Egyptian workers to Libya for economic reasons. Egypt has close ties to Haftar and the LNA, aligning with France and the UAE to support Haftar's position for the reunification of the Libyan army. The 2019 LNA offensive in southern Libya adds pressure on the Government of National Accord and complicates UN efforts for dialogue and elections. Egypt also faces regional disputes with Nile Basin countries like Ethiopia. The government of Egypt is involved in regional disputes with Nile Basin countries, particularly Ethiopia over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. Egypt is concerned that the dam will limit the flow of the Nile River, leading to water shortages. President Sisi aims to strengthen relations with African states and has also improved ties with Russia. Under President Sisi, Egypt has strengthened ties with Russia, including arms deals such as upgrading aircraft and purchasing attack helicopters. This relationship has been seen as a way to restore Egyptian stability and international prestige, especially in light of strained U.S.-Egyptian ties during the Obama Administration. Egypt has strengthened ties with Russia under President Sisi, including arms deals and cooperation on nuclear energy. This includes purchasing the naval version of the Ka-52 and the S-300VM surface-to-air missile defense system from Russia. Additionally, Egypt reached a deal with Russia to construct a 4,800-megawatt nuclear power plant in Daba'a, with Russia lending Egypt $25 billion over 35 years for the project. Egypt and Russia have strengthened ties, including military cooperation in conflict zones like eastern Libya. Russian Special Forces in Egypt's western desert may be aiding General Haftar. A draft agreement on air space usage was signed in 2017. Despite warming relations, complications arose from a 2015 terrorist attack affecting Russian tourism in Egypt. A trade dispute over Russian wheat imports occurred in 2016. Egypt and Russia have strengthened ties, including military cooperation in conflict zones like eastern Libya. In 2016, a trade dispute over Russian wheat imports occurred. Egypt, the largest global importer of wheat, has also built diplomatic and military procurement relationships with France. Egypt has purchased major air and naval defense systems from French defense contractors in the last five years, including Gowind Corvettes and a FREMM multi-mission Frigate. In February 2015, Egypt purchased 24 Rafale multirole fighters from France. There is a possibility of a new procurement agreement for 12 additional Rafale fighters. The Rafale has been used in combat in various countries and is also utilized by Egypt. In 2018, the United States blocked France from exporting the SCALP air-launched cruise missile to Egypt due to concerns about sensitive technology transfer. Additionally, France announced the sale of two Mistral-class Helicopter Carriers to Egypt in 2015. Egypt purchased two Landing Helicopter Dock (LHD) vessels for $1 billion in 2016, capable of carrying helicopters, landing craft, and tanks. In 2017, Egypt announced the purchase of 46 Ka-52 Alligator helicopters from Russia for the LHDs. In January 2019, French President Macron raised human rights concerns during a visit to Egypt. President Trump has praised Egypt's counterterrorism efforts and worked to restore diplomatic engagement and arms sales. The United States and Egypt have strengthened their bilateral ties through high-level diplomatic engagement, joint military exercises, and arms sales. Despite some foreign assistance being withheld for policy reasons, the U.S. Defense Department notified Congress of a $1 billion sale of defense equipment to Egypt, including 10 AH-64E Apache Attack Helicopters. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo emphasized the desire for a stronger partnership with Egypt during a policy speech in January 2019. The United States has strengthened ties with Egypt through diplomatic engagement, military exercises, and arms sales. Calls have been made for President Sisi to promote economic freedom and open exchange of ideas. Human rights advocates urge Western governments to withhold assistance if constitutional amendments extending Sisi's presidency are approved. U.S. officials are urged to express concern about the amendments to the Egyptian constitution. U.S. officials are urged to express strong concern about the amendments to the Egyptian constitution, citing Egypt's poor record on human rights and democratization. Lawmakers have passed appropriations legislation withholding FMF to Egypt until certain conditions are met, with a national security waiver included in most cases. The Administration has recently obligated several tranches of FMF to Egypt, including $1 billion in FY2018. In FY2018, $300 million in FMF for Egypt remains withheld until certification of support for democracy and human rights. The Administration waived certification for $195 million in FY2017 FMF, but Senator Patrick Leahy has placed a hold on $105 million seeking more information on a detained Egyptian-American. Administration notified Congress of intent to obligate $1.039 billion in FY2017 FMF out of $1.3 billion appropriated. The Administration notified Congress of its intent to obligate $1.039 billion in FY2017 FMF out of a total of $1.3 billion appropriated. $65.7 million in FY2017 FMF was not obligated, and $195 million was withheld until a national security waiver was issued in August 2018. For FY2019, the President requested $1.381 billion in foreign assistance for Egypt, with nearly all funds allocated to the FMF account. The FY2019 Omnibus provides a total of $1.419 billion in bilateral U.S. foreign assistance for Egypt, including $1.3 billion in FMF. The FY2019 Omnibus provides $1.419 billion in bilateral U.S. foreign assistance for Egypt, with conditions including sustaining the strategic relationship with the United States and meeting obligations under the 1979 Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty. ESF funds are withheld until certain criteria are met, such as dismissing convictions from democracy-related trials in Egypt. The FY2019 Omnibus includes conditions for bilateral U.S. foreign assistance to Egypt, such as sustaining the strategic relationship with the United States and meeting obligations under the 1979 Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty. ESF funds are withheld until certain criteria are met, including dismissing convictions from democracy-related trials. Additionally, the act includes limitations on ESF and FMF funds, with a provision to withhold $300 million of FMF funds until the Government of Egypt takes effective steps to advance democracy and human rights. The FY2019 Omnibus includes conditions for bilateral U.S. foreign assistance to Egypt, with a focus on sustaining the strategic relationship and meeting obligations under the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty. There are concerns over Egypt's alleged weapons procurement from North Korea, leading to restrictions on certain funds until steps are taken to advance democracy and human rights. Egypt has not yet received security assistance from DOD-managed accounts, despite receiving $78.3 billion in bilateral foreign aid from the United States between 1946 and 2016. The 1979 Peace Treaty between Israel and Egypt marked the beginning of U.S. financial support for peace in the region, with commitments outlined in separate memoranda to each country. The Carter Administration pledged to support Israel's military and economic assistance requirements, while offering an expanded security relationship with Egypt for military equipment sales, subject to Congressional review. The 1979 Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty is a bilateral agreement not involving the United States. U.S. aid to Egypt and Israel is approved by Congress, with the U.S. traditionally providing aid to maintain regional balance and security cooperation. The United States may sign a bilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with a foreign country for foreign aid, with specific amounts over a set time period, subject to Congress approval. Currently, there is no U.S.-Egyptian MOU specifying total aid to Egypt, but Congress allocates aid through various accounts like Foreign Military Financing (FMF) and Economic Support Funds (ESF). Egypt also receives International Military Education and Training (IMET) to enhance military cooperation with the U.S. since the 1979 peace treaty with Israel. Since the 1979 Israeli-Egyptian Peace Treaty, the United States has provided Egypt with significant military assistance through the FMF program. This aid has been used by Egypt to purchase major U.S. defense systems like the F-16 fighter aircraft, M1A1 Abrams battle tank, and AH-64 Apache attack helicopter. The Obama Administration has restricted future FMF grants to be used only for \"counterterrorism, border security, Sinai security, and maritime security\" purposes. The Trump Administration's approach to determining which U.S.-supplied military equipment would aid Egypt in countering terrorism and securing its borders is unclear. Defense experts believe the Egyptian military is not adequately prepared to face threats from terrorist groups like Sinai Province. There is a need for heavy investment in rapid reaction forces with advanced weaponry and enhanced intelligence capabilities to address this challenge. Egypt has received substantial U.S. military assistance, including early disbursement of funds and interest-bearing accounts, to purchase weapons, optics, communication gear, and aviation assets. This aid has allowed Egypt to acquire U.S.-origin equipment and enhance its intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities. Egypt has received substantial U.S. military assistance, including early disbursement of funds and interest-bearing accounts, to purchase weapons, optics, communication gear, and aviation assets. Congress has permitted Egypt to continue earning interest on FMF funds deposited in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The EDA program allows the U.S. to provide excess defense equipment to friendly nations, with Egypt being eligible as a major non-NATO ally. U.S. economic aid to Egypt has been reduced over the past two decades. U.S. economic aid to Egypt has been significantly reduced over the past two decades, from $833 million in FY1998 to a request of $75 million for FY2019. The relationship shifted towards emphasizing \"trade not aid\" as Egypt transitioned to a lower-middle-income economy. Congress scaled back aid due to agreements with Israel, leading to a gradual decrease in aid to Egypt. Relations between the U.S. and Egypt were strained during the George W. Bush Administration over democracy issues. During the final years of the Obama Administration, distrust of U.S. democracy promotion assistance in Egypt led to obstruction of U.S.-funded economic programs. The Government Accountability Office reported unobligated ESF funding of $460 million in 2015, prompting the reprogramming of $108 million in FY2015 funds for other purposes due to delays in program implementation. In 2017, the Trump Administration reprogrammed FY2016 ESF for Egypt, dividing U.S. economic aid into USAID-managed programs and the U.S.-Egyptian Enterprise Fund, funded through the ESF appropriations account."
