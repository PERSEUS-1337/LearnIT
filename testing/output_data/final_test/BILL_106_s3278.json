    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Department of Energy Nanoscale Science and Engineering Act\". It includes findings related to nanoscale science and engineering. The Congress acknowledges the importance of nanoscience and nanoengineering in creating new materials and advancing technology for energy exploration, production, and efficiency. These advancements will also strengthen U.S. science, technology, and medicine. The Congress recognizes the significant intellectual challenges in nanoscience and nanoengineering, requiring public support for research and development. Advances in self-assembly of atom clusters are necessary for practical applications in energy and manufacturing. New scientific instruments and specialized facilities will be essential for progress in this field, likely requiring centralized construction. The Department of Energy's Office of Science is well suited to manage nanoscience and nanoengineering research and development. Contributions from individual researchers and multidisciplinary research teams are required to advance in this field. The Office of Science is the principal federal supporter of research in physical and computational sciences, genomics, and life sciences. The Office of Science supports research and development by individual investigators and multidisciplinary teams, managing special user facilities for both university and industry researchers. The Department of Energy program is established under SEC. 3. The Secretary of Energy, through the Office of Science, will support research in nanoscience and nanoengineering. The program will focus on understanding phenomena on the scale of 1 to 100 nanometers. The Director of the Office of Science will support individual investigators and multidisciplinary teams, and develop special equipment or facilities for research in nanoscience and nanoengineering. The program will focus on nanoscience and nanoengineering research, supporting technology transfer activities and coordinating with industry and federal agencies. Funds will be available for projects to develop special equipment for research in nanoscience and nanoengineering, including measuring properties at the scale of 1 to 100 nanometers. The program focuses on nanoscience and nanoengineering research, supporting technology transfer activities and collaborations among universities, laboratories, and industry. Facilities may include electron microcharacterization, microlithography, and scanning probe facilities. At least one facility will have a specific mission of technology transfer. All financial assistance awards under this Act require merit review. Financial assistance awards under this Act require independent merit review. Authorization of appropriations for the Secretary of Energy for fiscal years 2002 to 2006: \n- $160,000,000 for 2002\n- $270,000,000 for 2003\n- $290,000,000 for 2004\n- $310,000,000 for 2005\n- $330,000,000 for 2006\nFunds allocated for Nanoscience and Nanoengineering Research Centers and Major Instrumentation for the same fiscal years:\n- $55,000,000 for 2002\n- $135,000,000 for 2003\n- $150,000,000 for 2004\n- $120,000,000 for 2005\n- $100,000,000 for 2006"
