    "content": "President Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act into law on March 23, 2010. The Act includes provisions that impact Medicare payments, covered benefits, and care delivery. The U.S. House of Representatives passed an amendment to the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 on March 21, 2010, which would amend the PPACA and make changes to Medicare-related provisions. The Reconciliation bill includes provisions related to health care, revenues, and Medicare programs. Subtitle B of Title I modifies provisions in the PPACA related to Medicare fee-for-service, Medicare Advantage, and Medicare outpatient prescription drug programs. Subtitle D focuses on reducing waste, fraud, and abuse. Subtitle E contains revenue-related provisions, including changes to the Medicare tax provision in PPACA. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that total mandatory annual expenditures for Medicare would grow significantly by 2019, with cumulative spending expected to exceed $7 trillion. The PPACA as amended by the Reconciliation bill would reduce direct spending by $511 billion over FY2010-FY2019, with Medicare accounting for approximately $390 billion of the reduction. Total Medicare reductions over the 10-year period are estimated at about $460 billion, offset by payment increases of close to $70 billion. The estimated Medicare savings are about $10 billion less than the estimated savings for PPACA alone, primarily due to changes in cost savings estimates for certain provisions. The Reconciliation bill, H.R. 4872, would modify Medicare provisions in the PPACA, raising an additional $123 billion in revenue over 10 years. Changes include adjustments to Medicare tax provisions and new provisions in Subtitles B, D, and E of Title I. The PPACA provisions reduce DSH payments to hospitals by 75% starting in FY2015. Hospitals will receive additional payments based on a formula considering factors like the reduction in DSH funds and the percentage change in the uninsured under-65 population. The Reconciliation bill would implement these changes in FY2014 and modify the formula for distributing additional DSH payments. PPACA provisions will adjust hospital payments based on the change in uninsured under-65 population. The Reconciliation bill will increase DSH spending by $3 billion over 10 years. Provisions in the PPACA implement a full productivity adjustment for various hospital services. The Reconciliation bill revises market basket updates for Medicare providers, reducing the MB by varying percentage points from FY2014 to FY2019. This change is estimated to decrease Medicare spending by $9.9 billion over 10 years. Physicians with ownership or investment interests in hospitals exempt from self-referral prohibition under PPACA and H.R. 4872. Changes target date to December 31, 2010. The bill would change the target date to December 31, 2010, and allow certain physician-owned hospitals to expand. CBO estimates this change would increase Medicare spending by $0.1 billion over 10 years. Additionally, the reconciliation bill would provide $400 million for two years to increase Medicare payments to acute care hospitals in low-cost counties. The provision in Section 3135 of the PPACA changes the utilization rate assumption for calculating payment for advanced imaging equipment from 50% to 65% for 2010 through 2012, increasing Medicare spending by $400 million from FY2011 through FY2012. The utilization rate for advanced imaging equipment payment will increase to 70% in 2013 and 75% in 2014. CBO estimates a $1.2 billion increase in cost savings over 10 years due to this change. Geographic adjustments in the Medicare physician fee schedule account for differences in resource costs, with Geographic Practice Cost Indices reflecting area comparisons to the national average. The bills set a temporary floor value of 1.00 on the physician work index from January 2004 to December 2009. PPACA directed adjustments to the practice expense GPCI in 2010 and 2011 to reflect differences in costs of employee wages and rents. The manager's amendment to the Reconciliation bill modifies the adjustment for 2010 and 2011, increasing costs by $0.4 billion. The Reconciliation bill changes payments to MA plans, tying the maximum payment to a percentage of spending in original Medicare. It also repeals the Comparative Cost Adjustment program and requires plans to spend a minimum amount on patient care or pay a fine. The Reconciliation bill modifies MA payments by tying them to a percentage of spending in original Medicare. Plans must spend a minimum amount on patient care or pay a fine. Section 1102 would repeal and replace the methodology for determining MA payments. The Reconciliation bill would replace the current methodology for determining MA payments with blended benchmarks based on a percentage of per-capita spending in original Medicare. The benchmarks would be phased in over two, four, or six years, with adjustments based on the level of spending in original Medicare in each county. The Reconciliation bill introduces new blended benchmarks for MA plans based on per-capita spending in original Medicare. Qualifying plans with a 4-star rating or higher would receive increased benchmarks, with larger increases in qualifying areas. Plans with low enrollment or new plans could also qualify. The Reconciliation bill introduces new benchmarks for MA plans based on per-capita spending in original Medicare. Plans with higher quality ratings would receive higher rebates, ranging from 50% to 70% of the difference between the bid and the benchmark. The bill would also repeal a provision granting the Secretary authority to expand coding intensity adjustments beyond 2010. The Reconciliation bill would require the Secretary to apply coding intensity adjustments after 2010 and set minimum adjustments starting in 2014. It would repeal the six-year program for examining comparative cost adjustment in designated areas. The bill also addresses Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) and how premium revenue is allocated for health care services. The Reconciliation bill includes provisions for managing Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, such as requiring plans with an MLR below .85 to make payments and potential enrollment restrictions for non-compliance. CBO estimates a $17.0 billion decrease in 10-year costs compared to previous legislation. Medicare law also defines a standard benefit structure for Part D prescription drug coverage. The Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit includes a coverage gap known as the \"doughnut hole.\" In 2010, enrollees have a $310 deductible and 25% coinsurance until reaching $2,830 in drug spending. After this limit, they pay full drug costs until hitting $6,440. Without assistance, enrollees face $4,550 in out-of-pocket costs before reaching the catastrophic phase. PPACA changes Part D, requiring compliance with a voluntary agreement with the pharmaceutical industry starting July 1, 2010. The PPACA requires drug manufacturers to provide Part D enrollees with discounts of 50% for brand name drugs during the coverage gap starting July 1, 2010. The Reconciliation bill would repeal this requirement, instead providing $250 rebates to Part D enrollees entering the coverage gap in 2010, with the discount starting on January 1, 2011. Higher income enrollees would also be eligible for the discount. The Reconciliation bill would phase out the Part D coverage gap by reducing enrollee cost sharing for generic and brand name drugs. Beneficiary cost sharing would be 25% from 2020 onwards, similar to the initial coverage phase. The bill would also slow the growth rate of the catastrophic coverage limit and include beneficiary co-payments and manufacturer discounts in calculating out-of-pocket costs. CBO estimates the bill would increase costs by $24.8 billion over 10 years. The Reconciliation bill, in addition to the PPACA, would increase costs by $24.8 billion over 10 years. It includes provisions to reduce Medicare fraud and abuse, such as new requirements for community mental health centers and modifications to Medicare's claims review processes. The Reconciliation bill includes provisions to reduce Medicare fraud and abuse, such as requiring community mental health centers to provide 40% of services to individuals not eligible for Medicare. It also restricts Medicare reimbursement for certain mental health services and removes limitations on prepayment review to combat improper payments and fraudulent billing. The Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control (HCFAC) account is funded to fight healthcare fraud, waste, and abuse with approximately $1.5 billion for FY2010. Additional funding of $10 million for fiscal years 2011-2020 and $250 million over fiscal years 2011-2016 is appropriated. Enhanced screening and oversight measures for Medicare providers are included in the PPACA, with the Secretary authorized to impose measures and withhold payment to DME suppliers for 90 days in cases of fraud risk. The provisions in the PPACA and Reconciliation bill aim to save $0.6 billion over 10 years by imposing additional hospital insurance taxes on high-income taxpayers. This includes a 0.9% payroll tax on high-income workers with wages over $200,000 for single filers and $250,000 for joint filers, effective after December 31, 2012. The tax applies only to wages above these thresholds, increasing the total payroll tax to 2.35% for wage income over the specified thresholds. The Reconciliation bill clarifies thresholds for additional Medicare taxes on high-income taxpayers. It also imposes an investment income tax on interest, dividends, and capital gains, expected to raise $86.8 billion over 10 years. The Reconciliation bill imposes a 3.8% tax on net investment income for taxable years after December 31, 2012, applicable to those with modified adjusted gross income over $250,000 for joint filers. The tax also applies to income from estates and trusts, but not to active income from trade for self-employed and S-corporations. The provision is expected to raise an additional $123.4 billion in revenues over a 10-year period."
