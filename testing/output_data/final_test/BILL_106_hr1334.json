The Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 amended section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, establishing new criteria and procedures for the EPA Administrator to assess pesticide tolerances in food. This includes determining the acceptability of pesticide residues in food entering interstate commerce or imported into the United States. The Administrator must follow these criteria and procedures when deciding on issuing new tolerances for pesticides or approving new pesticide uses. The Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 introduced new risk assessment criteria and regulatory concepts for pesticide tolerances, requiring major modifications to existing EPA practices. This includes reassessing all tolerances under the new criteria and procedures, with new statutory terms such as \"aggregate exposure\" and \"reasonable certainty that no harm\" being introduced. The Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 introduced new risk assessment criteria and regulatory concepts for pesticide tolerances, requiring major modifications to existing EPA practices. Terms like \"aggregate exposure\" and \"reasonable certainty that no harm\" are crucial in assessments and reassessments under the Act. The EPA must revoke tolerances if exposure poses the greatest risk to human health. The Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 introduced new risk assessment criteria and regulatory concepts for pesticide tolerances. The Administrator finds that the sum of exposure from all tolerances exceeds safe levels, but the Act does not provide criteria for revoking tolerances to reduce exposure. The Act also lacks procedures for involving stakeholders in decision-making before proposed rules are issued. Revised criteria under the Act require new data categories for the Administrator to make sound decisions. The Administrator is working on making accurate decisions on tolerance assessments and reassessments, with data collection efforts ongoing. New data requirements depend on decisions yet to be made regarding testing and compounds. Public proceedings are being held to interpret and amend the Act, determine needed data, ensure transparency, and utilize available authority effectively. The Administrator is urged to use authority wisely in deciding which tolerances to revoke and provide transition periods for products being removed from the market. Failure to do so could harm agriculture, food production, and related industries, reducing availability of fruits and vegetables and causing disruptions. Planned public proceedings are yet to begin. The potential removal of certain products from the market due to regulatory requirements could have disruptive effects on various sectors such as public health protection and pest control. Concerns include the development of resistance in pest species to remaining products. The transition to a free market system in agriculture as mandated by the Freedom to Farm Act may also have negative impacts on U.S. agricultural products. The Administrator is making decisions on tolerance assessments and reassessments while conducting policy development. Issuing pesticide decisions before new policies are in place may lead to outdated or overly stringent measures, causing unwarranted concern and harming product marketability. The amended Act has slowed the approval process for new pesticide chemicals, new uses of pesticides, and emergency exemptions due to the need for developing new criteria, reassessing existing tolerances, and resource allocation. Congressional guidance is necessary for the Administrator to make reasonable, well-supported, and balanced decisions regarding priority choices and resource allocation under the amended Act. This guidance is crucial to avoid disruptions in agriculture, the economy, and international trade caused by premature decisions or public misunderstanding. The Administrator should use available authority to resolve policy issues, announce data needs, and clarify the tentative nature of findings to prevent unwarranted speculation. To ensure well-supported decisions, the Administrator should clarify the tentative nature of findings and allow for extended implementation periods for adverse decisions when necessary. SEC. 3. SPECIAL DATA REQUIREMENTS; REQUIREMENT FOR CALLING IN ADDITIONAL DATA. Section 408(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to require submission of additional data if needed to support the continuation of a tolerance or exemption for a pesticide chemical residue on food. The Administrator may modify, suspend, or revoke a tolerance or exemption for a pesticide residue in food only after considering additional data obtained through methods described in paragraph (2) of the section. The Administrator can obtain additional data for modifying, suspending, or revoking a tolerance or exemption for pesticide residue in food by issuing a notice to the person. Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act are made to reflect these changes. SEC. 4. REVIEW. The text amends Section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to give the Administrator authority to determine public-interest requirements and publish them in the Federal Register. It also requires public input before issuing a final rule. The Administrator must issue a proposed rule with a 60-day public comment period before issuing a final rule under subsection (d)(4), and an advance notice of proposed rulemaking before issuing a proposed rule under subsection (e). SEC. 5. Tolerances for emergency uses amended to allow Administrator to issue tolerance or exemption for pesticide residue in emergency situations without considering other tolerances or exemptions if no significant dietary risk. SEC. 6. Reports on resources and priorities. The Environmental Protection Agency must submit a report to Congress by January 15, 2000, detailing the financial resources needed for fiscal years 2001-2005 to implement amendments related to pesticide regulations. This includes processing registration applications, petitions, and requests promptly. The Environmental Protection Agency must report to Congress on the financial resources needed for implementing pesticide regulation amendments, including processing applications and reallocating resources if increased appropriations are not available. The Department of Agriculture must report to Congress on the financial resources needed for implementing the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 for fiscal years 2001 through 2005, including reallocating resources if increased appropriations are not available. The Department of Agriculture must report to Congress on the financial resources needed for implementing the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 for fiscal years 2001 through 2005, including reallocating resources if increased appropriations are not available. The report should detail the impact of insufficient funding on the Secretary's responsibilities and describe the reallocations of existing resources that would be necessary to fulfill those responsibilities. SEC. 7. INTERNATIONAL TRADE EFFECTS. The Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with other agencies, will establish a program to monitor the competitiveness of major US agricultural sectors in the global market. This includes fruits, vegetables, corn, wheat, cotton, rice, soybeans, and nursery crops. Factors related to sustainability and competitiveness will be examined to inform regulatory decisions. The Secretary of Agriculture will prepare periodic reports on factors influencing regulatory decisions related to the competitiveness of major US agricultural sectors in the global market. Reports will be submitted to Congress biennially, starting from October 1, 2000."
