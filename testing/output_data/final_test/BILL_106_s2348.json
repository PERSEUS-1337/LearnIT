    "content": "FAIRNESS AND ACCURACY IN STUDENT TESTING. Congress acknowledges the significant increase in the use of large-scale achievement tests in education, leading to high-stakes decisions for students. Concerns have arisen about the negative consequences of relying solely on these tests, prompting questions on how to ensure their fair and accurate use. In 1999, the National Academy of Sciences completed a study on appropriate methods for ensuring that tests assessing student performance are not used in a discriminatory manner. The study focused on principles of measurement validity, attribution of cause, and effectiveness of treatment. The National Research Council found that tests, when used appropriately, can provide valuable information for decision-making in education. However, tests are not perfect and do not provide an exact measure of a student's knowledge or skills. There is a need to ensure that all students meet high standards. To meet world-class standards, world-class curricula and instruction are needed for all students. However, in many parts of the country, significant work is required to implement such high-quality curriculum and instruction. Currently, curricula often focus on memorization and skill mastery rather than student understanding and application of concepts. Additionally, instruction in core subjects is highly stratified, with students in lower tracks receiving far less than a world-class education. Problems with test validity are most pronounced in this context. The National Research Council recommends that stakeholders have access to information about tests and their interpretation to effectively discharge their educational responsibilities. Test validity issues are most significant among young children, especially those under 8 years old or below grade 3. Well-designed assessments can be beneficial for monitoring educational trends in students aged 5 and above. The National Research Council recommends providing information about tests and test scores to the public and incorporating it into teacher education. High-stakes decisions should not be based solely on a single test score but should consider other relevant information about the student's knowledge and skills. The National Research Council recommends using multiple sources of information, including grades and teacher recommendations, for high-stakes decisions about students. Large-scale assessments should not be used for students under 8 years old or below grade 3. High-stakes testing programs should have well-designed evaluation components to monitor their impact on all students, especially minorities, English-language learners, and students with disabilities. The Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing, endorsed by leading experts and organizations, guide decisions on standardized test use in education. Test performance should not be the sole factor in decisions regarding student retention, graduation, or tracking, and must meet professional validity standards. The test must meet professional validity and reliability standards, allow score interpretations based on functional performance levels aligned with curriculum, and utilize multiple measures of student achievement. The test must meet professional validity and reliability standards, allow score interpretations based on functional performance levels aligned with curriculum, and utilize multiple measures of student achievement. Students tested should have multiple opportunities to demonstrate proficiency, with appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities. The test should be administered according to guidance from the test developer and be of adequate technical quality. The State or local educational agency must provide accommodations for students with limited English proficiency, including ensuring that students have received English instruction for at least 3 years before being tested in English. Students who have not had 3 years of English instruction must also receive appropriate accommodations. Students with limited English proficiency must have received English instruction for at least 3 years before being assessed. Spanish-speaking students may be assessed in Spanish if it is more likely to provide accurate information. The test cannot be used for decisions on promotion or special education placement for children under age 8 or grade 3. State educational agencies receiving funds under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 must evaluate the impact of standardized tests on students' education and outcomes, considering individual students and subgroups based on socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, English proficiency, disability, and gender. Results of the evaluation must be made public with clear information on the test's nature, use, and interpretation. Local educational agencies that use standardized tests for high stakes decisions must conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the test's impact on students' education and outcomes, especially for individual students and subgroups based on various factors. Results of the evaluation must be made public and easily understandable. The Secretary of Education must evaluate standardized tests used by local educational agencies, report the results to Congress, and make them public. Standardized tests are defined as tests administered and scored uniformly for all students to ensure comparability of scores."
