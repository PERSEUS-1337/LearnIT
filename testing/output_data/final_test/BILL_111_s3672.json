    "content": "The Act titled \"Coordination of Wind and Flood Perils Act of 2010\" amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to include a new section for the payment of multiperil claims. The section aims to expedite repairs and business operations after a natural disaster, shifting the burden of determining flood and wind loss allocation to responsible entities. In the event of combined flood and wind damage in the US, the Administrator and insurers are responsible for multiperil claims. The Administrator and insurers must negotiate the method for adjusting and paying multiperil claims, as well as the allocation of payments. If they cannot agree on the distribution of perils causing a loss, the Administrator will pay 50% of the disputed claim until it is resolved. The terms of any agreement or negotiations entered into shall require that an insurer pay 50% of any disputed claim until it can be settled, ensuring no overcompensation for the insured's actual loss. The section clarifies that policy limits in flood insurance policies are not affected by the agreement on loss allocation. If insurers and the Administrator cannot agree on multiperil losses, disputes will be resolved by an arbitration panel established under subsection (d). The Administrator of FEMA will establish an arbitration panel within 90 days to resolve multiperil loss disputes with insurers. The panel will consist of 5 members, including one with administrative law expertise. The arbitration panel established by the FEMA Administrator will include members with expertise in water resources and hurricane modeling. Panel members cannot be FEMA employees and must be independent and neutral."
