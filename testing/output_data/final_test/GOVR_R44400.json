    "content": "On February 13, 2016, Justice Antonin Scalia passed away at 79, leaving a vacancy on the Supreme Court. Vacancies during presidential election years are rare, with the last one in 1968. The last time a vacancy in an election year was filled in the same year was in 1932. Scalia's successor may not be confirmed before the fall election. The possibility exists that Justice Scalia's seat on the High Court may remain open for an extended period of time, including throughout the remainder of the 2015 Supreme Court term. This report provides an overview of the Supreme Court's procedural rules and requirements when the Court is staffed with less than nine members, including quorum requirements, rehearing procedures, and vote count practices. The report highlights cases from the current term that could result in an evenly divided Supreme Court. Congress has historically defined the makeup of the Supreme Court through statutes. The Court's size varied in the 19th century but was set at nine judges in 1869, a number that remains today. Unlike federal appellate courts, the Supreme Court has always functioned as a single body without dividing into panels. The Supreme Court operates as a single body with nine Justices, but only six are needed to constitute a quorum. A majority of the quorum is required to act for the Court, and recusals are rare. In recent years, there have been few instances of an eight-member Court issuing opinions, and none with fewer than six members present. If the Supreme Court lacks a quorum, procedures outlined by Congress dictate how cases are handled. Cases on direct appeal from a district court may be remitted to the court of appeals if the High Court cannot convene to rule. The Chief Justice can remit cases to the court of appeals if the Supreme Court lacks a quorum. The appellate court then hears the case and makes a final decision. If a majority of Justices determine a case cannot be heard, the lower court's judgment is affirmed. A divided Supreme Court may result in an equal outcome. When the Supreme Court is evenly divided, it may affirm the lower court judgment without issuing an opinion. This practice, known as summary affirmance, does not set a precedent. In cases of a tie, the rule is to favor the respondent. This was last seen in the 2010 term when the Court split 4-4 on two cases. In cases of a tie, the Supreme Court may order reargument instead of issuing a summary affirmance. The Court can do this to address additional issues or allow a new Justice to cast the deciding vote. This practice was last seen in 2010 when the Court split 4-4 on two cases. Abe Fortas created a vacancy on the Court in 1969, leading to reargument of cases in 1970. Justice Kennedy's confirmation also resulted in reargument of cases. Even short vacancies on the Court have led to reargument in closely divided cases. For example, a case in 1991 was reargued for Justice Clarence Thomas to cast the deciding vote. In 2005, the Court initiated reargument in certain cases. In 2005, the Court ordered reargument in three cases after the death of Chief Justice Rehnquist and the swearing-in of Justice Alito. This decision was not unprecedented, as in 1971, Justices Black and Harlan's retirement led to reargument in Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton to allow new Justices to participate in the decision. Justice Blackmun emphasized the importance of a nine-member court in such sensitive cases. The Court heard reargument in cases of special significance in 1972, resulting in a 7-2 decision in favor of abortion rights. Even in cases of tie votes, reargument to allow a new Justice to participate is possible. A petitioner can request a rehearing within 25 days of an adverse decision. The Supreme Court rarely grants rehearing requests from losing parties, even in cases of tie votes or changes in the Court's composition. This is likely because the Court thoroughly considers each case before issuing a decision, making it unlikely that reargument would change the outcome. Petitions for rehearing must be submitted within 25 days of an adverse decision. The Supreme Court rarely grants rehearing requests from losing parties, even in cases of tie votes or changes in the Court's composition. Rehearing will only be granted if a Justice who agreed with the decision now thinks it is appropriate, and if a majority of the Court agrees. The Court generally grants rehearing only in exceptional situations where there are substantial doubts about the correctness of the decision or unanticipated consequences. Petitions for rehearing must be submitted within 25 days of an adverse decision.

Petitions for rehearing must be submitted within 25 days of an adverse decision. The question remains on how the Supreme Court will resolve pending cases without Justice Scalia, especially controversial ones on public employee unions, abortion, immigration, and affirmative action. Predicting the outcome of these cases is challenging, but based on the current eight Justices' past voting practices and opinions, some cases have been widely discussed. Based on the current eight Justices' past voting practices and opinions, several cases could result in 4-4 ties at the Supreme Court in the absence of Justice Scalia. Fisher v. University of Texas, a case challenging racial preferences in college admissions, is not on the list of potential ties. Justice Kagan's recusal in the case will result in a seven-member Court deciding Fisher. The Court's approach to similar cases in the past may suggest holding Fisher for reargument until a new Justice is appointed. The Supreme Court may issue rulings on pending cases with a seven-member Court due to Justice Scalia's absence. If cases result in a tie, the Court must decide whether to affirm the lower court ruling or reargue the case with a new appointee. With many pending cases, a split vote among current Justices is likely. If this happens, the Court will follow statutes, rules, and practices governing such situations. The Supreme Court has significant authority to decide whether to affirm lower court rulings or reargue cases with a new Justice to settle split decisions. Justice Scalia's death has highlighted the importance of his successor in resolving pending cases."
