Power outages are often due to trees falling on distribution lines, while major outages result from damage to transmission lines. These outages can last from hours to days, impacting businesses and manufacturers economically. Congress may need to address the resilience of the power system and the economic effects of storm-related outages. The report will focus on the economic impacts of storm-related power outages and whether the federal government should take additional measures to mitigate these outages. Power is generated, transmitted, and distributed to customers through a network of cables exposed to the elements. The reliability of the power system is crucial, and Congress has already recognized this with the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Power outages in an above-ground environment can result from severe weather events like storms, causing damage to electric power infrastructure. Data on storm-related outages are incomplete, with 90% of outages affecting local distribution systems and 10% from generation and transmission issues. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation requires utilities to report events causing service interruptions. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation requires electric utilities to report events causing service interruptions of more than 300 megawatts or affecting 50,000 customers. A University of Vermont analysis found that almost 44% of outages from 1984 to 2006 were weather-related, with some events having multiple causes like lightning triggering other outages. The study found that power outages caused by weather-related events can vary in duration, with sustained disruptions lasting hours or days. An analysis of the DOE database showed an increasing number of outages from 1992 to 2010, with approximately 78% of disruptions being weather-related, affecting 178 million metered customers. The number of observed outages from weather-related incidents is increasing, affecting 178 million metered customers. The trend in outages may be due to power grid deterioration and an increase in extreme weather events. The U.S. electric power system is considered reliable but statistically does not meet expectations compared to other nations. Key reliability indices include SAIDI and SAIFI, measuring interruption duration and frequency per customer per year. The reliability of the power grid is measured by indices like SAIDI and SAIFI, which track the frequency and duration of interruptions per customer per year. However, there is inconsistency in how these indices are calculated, especially regarding storm-related outages. Different regions have varying definitions of what constitutes an extreme weather event, leading to discrepancies in outage statistics. Weather conditions that are common in one area may be considered exceptional in another, highlighting the need for standardized measurement criteria. The United States has the highest average annual outage time per customer and the third-highest average annual number of supply outages per customer among nine industrial countries. European countries often define extended outages as longer than three minutes, compared to the five-minute standard in the United States. These countries typically have a single regulatory body responsible for the reliability of the entire nation's power system, authorizing expenditures for improving service reliability. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) oversees the reliability of the bulk power system in the United States, while state and local regulatory bodies are responsible for maintaining the reliability of electricity distribution systems. The U.S. electric grid's infrastructure is in a generally degraded condition, labeled as a \"patchwork system\" by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). ASCE estimates a need for a massive investment of $673 billion by 2020 to prevent a breakdown. Power outages can impact electricity consumers through property loss, business disruption, lost orders, damage to perishable goods, and manufacturing downtime. The Electric Power Research Institute estimated the economic costs of power disturbances in 2001. The study identified three sectors vulnerable to power outages: the digital economy, continuous process manufacturing, and fabrication and essential services. These sectors include industries such as telecommunications, biotechnology, paper manufacturing, and utilities. The digital economy, continuous process manufacturing, and essential services sectors, including industries like telecommunications and utilities, accounted for nearly 40% of the US GDP in 2001. Power outages in these sectors can have significant economic costs, with an average cost of $7,795 per firm for a one-hour outage. While most companies experience smaller losses, a few companies bear much larger costs. In 2001, power outages in key sectors like telecommunications and utilities incurred costs ranging from $20,000 to $1.5 million per establishment. The annual economic cost of outages across all US business sectors was estimated to be between $104 billion to $164 billion. Weather-related outages were estimated to cost between $20 billion to $31 billion on the lower end and $35 billion to $55 billion on the higher end. The 2004 LBL report estimated economic costs of sustained power interruptions at $26 billion. The economic costs of sustained power outages, including weather-related ones, could be tens of billions of dollars higher or lower. Storms can damage power delivery systems, leading to outages, often caused by trees contacting power lines. Utilities typically trim tree branches to prevent such disruptions. To maintain reliability of high-voltage transmission lines, NERC has a vegetation management standard with minimum clearance distances calculated by formula. This standard does not apply to low-voltage distribution lines, which are under state jurisdiction. Some utilities are extending the time between tree-trimming operations. Some utilities are extending the time between tree-trimming operations to reduce maintenance costs. State and local jurisdictions have laws for vegetation management, with some states requiring utilities to submit plans for approval. These plans typically include maintaining clearances around power lines and trimming cycles every four to seven years. Vigilant maintenance of vegetation clearances is seen as a good practice to minimize storm-related outages. Undergrounding electricity distribution lines is a common practice in urban and suburban areas for new construction or redevelopment to improve aesthetics and reliability. It is used in areas susceptible to storm damage or where overhead transmission lines are challenging, undesirable, or face regulatory obstacles. Examples include difficult overland routes, natural obstacles, and environmentally sensitive areas. Burying power lines is more expensive than overhead cables due to factors like topography and subsurface conditions. While underground lines are safer for wildlife and have fewer visual impacts, maintenance costs may be higher, especially in flood-prone areas. The costs are usually passed on to electricity customers over a 25-year service life. The aging infrastructure of the U.S. power grid includes power plants over 30 years old and transmission components like power transformers and lines, with many exceeding 25 years. As components are replaced, newer ones are integrated with modern communication and automation systems to upgrade the grid. Regulatory bodies may not always approve plans to underground power lines due to cost considerations, with utilities sometimes sharing costs with communities. The modernization of the power grid involves incorporating information processing capabilities for controls and operations monitoring, known as the \"Smart Grid.\" Despite potential benefits like improved reliability and outage prevention, some customers remain unconvinced. Privacy concerns regarding customer information have also been raised. Smart meters raise privacy concerns with customer information relayed to electric utilities. Rate increases accompany Smart Grid projects, with costs passed on to customers. Some states require cost-benefit analyses before approving Smart Grid expenditures. Performance metrics for reliability are crucial for Smart Grid programs. Distributed generation feeds into the distribution grid, providing backup power sources. Distributed generation, including back-up power sources, combined heat and power facilities, and renewable electricity systems, are less vulnerable to weather-related service interruptions compared to utility power systems. The Department of Energy estimated over 12 million distributed generation units in the US with a total capacity of 200 GW in 2007. Weather is a primary cause of reliability issues, with lightning strikes, high winds, snowfall, ice, and hot weather being factors. The goal is to have a resilient system that can adjust to these challenges. The goal of planners and operators is to have a resilient system that can adjust to problems without major consequences. Distributed generation offers benefits to system reliability, such as financial incentives for emergency power units and demand response programs. It can add diversity to power supply. The Department of Energy (DOE) noted that distributed generation improves system adequacy and reduces outages caused by overloaded utility equipment. A 2005 study by Davies Consulting for the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) found that utility performance and infrastructure are resilient, with adequate funds for maintenance and reliability. Restoration strategies meet standard practices, but more effective resource acquisition practices are needed. The EEI-sponsored study suggested that reliability-centered maintenance practices could prevent storm-related outages and expedite recovery. State utility regulators were encouraged to consider approving this cost-effective approach. Regulatory efforts focus on time-based maintenance intervals and compliance reporting. Communication processes with stakeholders and customers need improvement before, during, and after events. Restoration and emergency management structures should be aligned for better efficiency. The study recommended reliability-centered maintenance practices to prevent outages and improve recovery after storms. Regulators need to consider this cost-effective approach, which may not be effective for all assets. If not accepted, utilities may be forced to continue using time-based maintenance, leading to a need for large-scale asset replacements. Some states have implemented quality-of-service benchmarks for electric utilities to ensure reliability performance targets are met. The study recommended penalties for utilities not meeting reliability targets, as regulators believe rewards are unnecessary. Customers willing to pay for reliability may use backup generation. Mutual assistance agreements help utilities restore services after storms, reducing outage duration. Mutual Assistance in the electric power industry involves utilities borrowing crews and equipment from each other to aid in service restoration after major outages. Contingency plans are developed by Regional Mutual Assistance Groups to ensure minimal impact on a regional area during resource transfers. Mutual Assistance Agreements (MAAs) in the electric power industry involve utilities voluntarily arranging help with other companies in different regions. This assistance may take time to arrive due to travel distances, road conditions, and safety considerations for specialized vehicles. EEI offers guidance on structuring MAAs for member utilities. While not regulated, MAAs have faced scrutiny during longer outages. Damage extent can delay response times, but effective MAAs are crucial for recovery efforts. Effective Mutual Assistance Agreements (MAAs) are essential for recovery efforts after storm-related power outages. Preparation and recovery are key themes in addressing outages caused by severe weather events. Utilities must make timely preparations for restoration, and following good maintenance, restoration, organization, and communication strategies can minimize damage to electric power infrastructure. Awareness of local weather patterns and collaboration with regulatory authorities are also important for efficient response to weather-related events. Electric utilities need to work with regulatory authorities to reduce vulnerabilities in the power infrastructure. Aging parts of the system have already been paid for, but new investments may be necessary for future grid uses. Power delivery systems are most at risk during storms and extreme weather. Improving system efficiency can enhance resilience and speed up recovery from outages. Utilities are responsible for maintaining the infrastructure to ensure uninterrupted electricity sales. Inconsistent outage reporting data complicates quantifying storm impacts. Inconsistent outage reporting data complicates quantifying storm impacts. Congress could empower federal agencies to develop standards for power outage data reporting. Bringing distribution systems under ERO for reliability may require changes in the Federal Power Act. Formalizing review or coordinating MAAs under federal agencies like FEMA or DHS could enhance cooperative coordination of resources. The aged electrical grid in the US needs upgrades to improve recovery efforts during wide-scale weather events. Despite discussions on transmission system issues, distribution systems also require repairs. The cost of grid modernization is high, but crucial for economic performance. Limited federal funding has been allocated for specific projects, but a comprehensive effort is needed for overall modernization. To modernize the U.S. grid, targeted federal funding is needed as part of a long-term national energy strategy, requiring decisions on government and private sector roles."
