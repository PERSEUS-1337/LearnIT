    "content": "The \"Fair Play Act\" may be cited as the official title of this legislation. Since its enactment in 1972, title IX has significantly increased athletic opportunities for women in the United States. Before title IX, only 32,000 women participated in intercollegiate athletics, received minimal athletic budgets, and had few scholarships. By 1997, over 110,000 women were involved in college sports, representing 37% of varsity athletes. According to a 1997 study by the National Collegiate Athletic Association, female college athletes receive only 23 percent of athletic operating budgets, 38 percent of athletic scholarship dollars, and 27 percent of the money spent to recruit new athletes. Women represent 53 percent of students but only 37 percent of athletes in higher education. Women and girls who participate in athletics have better physical and emotional health compared to those who do not. Participation in athletics can improve academic achievement and overall health for women and girls. Accessible information on expenditures for women's and men's athletic programs at higher education institutions can help students make informed decisions about athletic opportunities. The purposes of this Act are to provide easily accessible information on men's and women's athletic programs at higher education institutions and to increase athletic opportunities for women. Section 485(g) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to require institutions of higher education to submit information to the Secretary within 15 days of making it available, with the Secretary preparing a report summarizing the information and identifying trends by April 1 of each year. The Secretary will aggregate information on NCAA divisions and individual higher education institutions, ensuring the report is available online promptly. Additionally, a toll-free telephone service will be established to provide information on the reports and Title IX inquiries from the public. The Secretary will use information from higher education institutions to ensure compliance with Title IX. They will also notify secondary schools about the availability of this information within 180 days."
