    "content": "The \"Pipeline Modernization and Consumer Protection Act\" may be cited as the short title. It includes replacement programs for high-risk natural gas pipelines. Congress finds that Federal requirements for repairing pipeline leaks are limited to hazardous leaks, leaving slower or less hazardous leaks unaddressed. In states without a standard definition for unaccounted-for gas, data inconsistencies hinder regulators' ability to monitor gas system performance. The distribution system passes on the cost of leaked natural gas to ratepayers, removing utilities' incentive to minimize leaks. Methane in natural gas is a potent greenhouse gas. The US natural gas distribution system still has miles of old, vulnerable pipes. Recent pipeline explosions have caused human fatalities. Fatalities in Austin, Texas, Philadelphia, and Allentown, Pennsylvania have been linked to aging and leaking pipelines. Natural gas distribution utilities may hesitate to replace failing pipelines due to limitations in traditional ratemaking structures. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration highlights the importance of natural gas pipeline replacement programs in enhancing public safety. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration emphasizes the need for replacement programs for high-risk natural gas pipelines to enhance public safety. Gas pipeline facilities must accelerate the repair, rehabilitation, and replacement of leaking or high-risk gas piping or equipment. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration stresses the importance of replacing high-risk natural gas pipelines for public safety. States and gas utilities should develop timelines to repair leaks or replace faulty piping based on severity, and consider cost-recovery programs. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration emphasizes the need for a cost-recovery program for replacing leaking or high-risk gas pipelines. This program should include replacement plans with targets, benchmarks, and reporting on reductions in lost gas. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration emphasizes the need for a cost-recovery program for replacing leaking or high-risk gas pipelines, including adopting limits on cost recovery for lost and unaccounted-for gas, and requiring the use of best available technology to detect gas leaks. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration will issue non-binding guidelines for identifying and classifying high-risk pipeline infrastructure within a year of the enactment of the Act. This includes consultation with various federal agencies and state regulatory authorities to establish best practices under section 60112A of title 49, United States Code. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration will issue guidelines for identifying and repairing high-risk pipeline infrastructure, taking into account actions by state regulatory authorities. The guidelines will be reviewed and revised at least once every 7 years. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration will revise guidelines to reflect changes in pipeline infrastructure composition and safety performance in the United States. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration will revise guidelines to reflect changes in pipeline infrastructure composition and safety performance in the United States, including data standardization. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, along with other Federal agencies, will establish standardized forms for reporting unaccounted-for gas within a year of the Act's enactment. This includes defining methodologies and causes of unaccounted-for gas. An interagency working group may be established for this purpose. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, along with other Federal agencies, will establish standardized forms for reporting unaccounted-for gas. This includes defining methodologies and causes of unaccounted-for gas. Federal, State, and local governments will work together to adopt a standard definition and methodology for calculating and reporting unaccounted-for gas."
