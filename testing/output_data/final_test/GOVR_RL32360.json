    "content": "The SCRA aims to protect servicemembers by suspending certain legal proceedings during their military service. It defines \"servicemember\" as individuals in the uniformed services, including the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and others. The SCRA defines \"military service\" to include various types of active duty for armed services, National Guard service, service for officers of specific agencies, and periods of absence due to sickness, wounds, leave, or other lawful reasons. The SCRA defines \"military service\" broadly to include different types of active duty and periods of absence for various reasons. The definition of \"active military service\" under 10 U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 101(d) is not clearly defined, leaving uncertainty regarding coverage for individuals attending service schools or training programs before entering active duty. The SCRA defines \"period of military service\" as the time a servicemember is in military service until release or death. It differs from \"discharge\" as it refers to the end of active-duty status. The term is used to determine benefits availability. The Act also defines \"dependent\" as a servicemember's spouse. The SCRA defines \"dependent\" as a servicemember's spouse, child, or another individual for whom the servicemember provided more than half of the support in the 180 days prior to an application for relief. Courts obligated to honor SCRA protections include federal or State courts, as well as administrative agencies. The Act defines \"state\" as a commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States and the District of Columbia. The SCRA defines \"Secretary concerned\" and \"motor vehicle\" and applies nationwide, including the District of Columbia and territories under US jurisdiction. It covers civil judicial matters for servicemembers.

This codifies courts' interpretations of the SCRA but does not explicitly adopt tests used to determine stay appropriateness. The SCRA provides protection to persons with secondary liability in civil proceedings, allowing for a stay based on equitable considerations. Criminal bail bond sureties are protected under subsection 103(c), with courts having discretion to return bail if the accused is on active duty. Waiver of protection is possible under subsection 103(d) for those liable on the obligation of a person in military service. The SCRA allows for waiver of benefits for individuals with secondary liability in civil proceedings if they are in military service. The Act extends benefits to U.S. citizens serving in allied forces during war, and eliminates protection revocation for dishonorably discharged individuals. Military authorities are required to notify individuals of their benefits. Sec. 105 (50 U.S.C. app. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 515) requires military authorities to provide servicemembers with written information about their rights and benefits under the SCRA.

The judgment against the defendant can be set aside if the servicemember files a motion within 60 days after leaving active military service and can demonstrate that military service prejudiced their availability to appear in court. This change from the previous SSCRA allows for a longer timeframe to file the motion. This section does not apply to judgments where the servicemember appeared before the court. An appearance in court by a servicemember regarding their military status under the SCRA can waive certain defenses and rights, such as lack of jurisdiction or petitioning to overturn a judgment.

The SCRA allows servicemembers to redeem real estate that has been sold or forfeited, pay obligations or assessments, and caps the maximum interest on debts incurred prior to active duty at 6% per year.
