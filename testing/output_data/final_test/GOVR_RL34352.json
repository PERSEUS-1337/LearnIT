    "content": "The USDA is responsible for agricultural research and supporting education programs at the federal and state levels through the Research, Education, and Economics (REE) mission area. This includes research in biological sciences, economic data analysis, and partnerships with land grant universities, historically black colleges, and Native American colleges. The USDA supports agricultural education at tribal colleges and Hispanic-serving institutions through small grant programs. The omnibus farm bill of 2008 expanded eligibility for research and education programs to non-land grant institutions offering agriculture degrees. USDA allocates most of its research funds to in-house research, unlike other federal agencies that primarily fund extramural research through competitive grants. The National Academy of Sciences has recommended that at least 35% of USDA research funding be distributed competitively. In FY2006, less than 6% of USDA's research funding was competitively awarded, increasing from approximately 14% according to CRS calculations. The Hatch Act of 1887 and the Smith-Lever Act of 1914 distribute federal appropriations to state land grant universities for research and extension activities. State-level programs receive funding from state appropriations, competitive grants, and private industry, with states matching federal funds. Federal formula funds, though a small percentage of total state funding, have been traditionally important. The USDA's research funding is primarily distributed through the Hatch Act of 1887 and the Smith-Lever Act of 1914 to state land grant universities. While federal formula funds make up a small percentage of total state funding, they are considered crucial for state-level programs. Proposed changes in agricultural grant programs aim to increase competitiveness and efficiency by restructuring ARS and CSREES. The proposal aims to merge ARS and CSREES into a single agency under the Office of Science, led by a Chief Scientist, while retaining current formula-funded authorities. This integration of budgets and programs is expected to improve efficiency and resource allocation. Congress also commissioned a task force to evaluate the establishment of National Institutes focused on food and agricultural sciences. The task force recommendations in July 2004 proposed the formation of a National Institute for Food and Agriculture (NIFA) within USDA to award competitive grants, with a budget reaching $1 billion over five years. Congressional bills were introduced to provide mandatory funding for NIFA, starting at $245 million in FY2008 and increasing to $966 million by FY2012. The National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges (NASULGC) also recommended reorganizing the REE system. The NASULGC proposed reorganizing the REE system by putting all USDA research, education, and extension agencies under one body with a unified budget. They recommended providing $200 million annually in mandatory funds and increasing appropriated funds to 171.5% of the current level. The proposal also aimed to expand opportunities for minority and smaller schools to enhance their capacity for agricultural research, education, and extension. The plan, known as CREATE-21, received widespread but not unanimous support from land grant universities. In June 2008, the 110th Congress passed the 2008 omnibus farm bill, which included proposed changes to the research title. The bill drew heavily on recommendations from USDA and NASULGC, calling for the creation of the National Agricultural Research Program Office (NARPO) within the Office of the Under Secretary for Research. NARPO would have six specialized directors to coordinate and plan research programs. The 2008 omnibus farm bill proposed creating the National Agricultural Research Program Office (NARPO) to oversee research programs. NARPO would be led by directors from NARPO, merging ARS and CSREES staff duties. A National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) would be established within CSREES to manage competitive research grants, merging NRI and IFAFS programs. NRI would focus on basic research with 60% funding, while IFAFS would focus on applied research with 40% funding. NRI would receive $500 million annually through FY2012. The House bill proposed a centralized administration of agencies with a unified annual budget for capacity-building and competitive programs. It included $865 million in mandatory research funding over five years, with $25 million allocated to the Organic Research and Extension Initiative. The farm bill allocated funds for various research initiatives, including $25 million for the Organic Research and Extension Initiative, $215 million for the Specialty Crop Research Initiative, and $25 million for fresh cut produce safety. The bill also maintained $200 million for IFAFS and proposed restructuring CSREES into the National Institute of Food and Agriculture. Discretionary programs were largely unchanged. The National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) was established to manage USDA research funds, with the director reporting directly to the Secretary of Agriculture. The farm bill allocated $160 million for research funding over five years, reauthorized the Organic Research and Extension Initiative with $16 million annually, and created a new Specialty Crop Research Initiative with the same funding. Mandatory funds for the Initiative for Future Agricultural and Food Systems (IFAFS) were eliminated. The 2008 farm bill replaced the Initiative for Future Agricultural and Food Systems with annual appropriations as necessary. New provisions included a grant program for non-land grant public colleges, an endowment fund for Hispanic-serving agricultural colleges, capacity-building programs, and a focus on bioenergy and biobased products. The 2008 farm bill reorganized the Department's Research, Education, and Economics mission area, creating capacity and competitive programs under Title VII. It established the Research, Education, and Extension Office (REEO) to coordinate programs and designated the Under Secretary as the Chief Scientist of USDA. The 2008 farm bill reorganized USDA's Research, Education, and Economics mission area, transferring extramural programs to a new National Institute for Food and Agriculture (NIFA). The bill also expanded the National Research Initiative Competitive Grants Program into the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) and emphasized the need for a competitive bid process in awarding research contracts and grants. The 2008 farm bill reorganized USDA's Research, Education, and Economics mission area, transferring extramural programs to a new National Institute for Food and Agriculture (NIFA). The bill also increased funding for competitive research programs, such as specialty crops, biomass, and organic production, reflecting the benefits of competitive research programs highlighted in the manager's report. The bill encourages the Department to prioritize support for competitive programs while maintaining capacity and infrastructure programs. The Appendix compares agricultural research, extension, and education policies in the 2002 farm bill with provisions in the current bill.
