    "content": "Insurance is primarily regulated at the state level, with the power devolved to individual states by the 1945 McCarran-Ferguson Act. This was reaffirmed in the 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Some uniformity in insurance regulation is desirable for greater efficiencies in the market, especially as insurers compete with banks and securities firms. Insurers rely on global capital markets for investment and funding, particularly after large losses. The regulation of insurance is primarily done at the state level, with model rules developed by the NAIC and NCOIL. However, there is significant variation in state regulations due to the voluntary nature of these organizations. Calls for federal intervention have increased, especially after the financial crisis and the failure of AIG. The regulation of insurance, particularly with the failure of AIG, the largest surplus lines insurer in the US, differs from regular insurance regulation. States focus on insurer solvency, requirements for capital, investment, and guaranty funds for insolvency cases. States also regulate policy substance, price, and require state approval for changes. In surplus lines insurance, states oversee insurer solvency and financial aspects. States oversee the solvency of surplus lines insurers by requiring financial filings, but do not participate in guaranty funds or regulate policy terms and prices. Intermediaries, like insurance brokers, play a key role in surplus lines transactions. Surplus lines brokers need an additional license and must follow specific steps for these transactions. Surplus lines transactions involve a diligent search for coverage in the regular insurance marketplace. Once eligibility is established, brokers approach surplus lines insurers for desired coverage. Some states establish standards to protect consumers against surplus lines insurers who may not be able to pay claims. They may have a list of eligible or ineligible insurers for state-licensed brokers to transact with. Brokers may be held responsible if a surplus lines insurer fails to pay legitimate claims, leading to more cautious selection of insurance companies. Specific disclosure statements are required for clients purchasing surplus lines insurance. The purchase of surplus lines insurance comes with the caveat that it is not subject to the same regulatory oversight as insurance from state-licensed insurers. State laws vary on premium taxes, with the burden of remitting taxes falling on the state-licensed broker in multi-state situations. Apportioning taxes among different states can be complex due to differing laws on what is taxed and how it should be divided. The property/casualty insurance market experiences cycles of high prices and short supply (\"hard markets\") and low prices and plentiful supply (\"soft markets\"). Surplus lines market growth is impacted by these cycles, growing faster in hard markets and slower in soft markets. In the past 30 years, there have been four periods of generally hard markets. In 2008, surplus lines direct premiums totaled $34.4 billion, accounting for 13.8% of total commercial lines premiums in the United States. The surplus lines market in the United States is dominated by two large groups, AIG and Lloyd's of London, with Zurich Financial following behind. Senators John Sununu and Tim Johnson introduced S. 2509 in 2006, aiming to create a federal charter for insurers and insurance intermediaries, potentially impacting the surplus lines market. The National Insurance Act proposed a federal charter for insurers and insurance intermediaries, allowing them to operate nationwide without state licenses. This would offer similar freedoms to surplus lines insurers, with product and rate flexibility. H.R. 6225 was introduced by Representative Ed Royce in 2006 to address conflicting state regulatory systems. H.R. 6225, introduced by Ed Royce in 2006, aimed to create a dual regulatory system for insurers and insurance intermediaries with federal and state charters. The bill did not have committee hearings and would have required federally chartered insurers to participate in state guaranty funds. It was uncertain if surplus lines insurers would opt for a federal charter due to more stringent financial oversight. The potential impact of a federal chartering system on surplus lines insurers remains uncertain. AIG, the largest surplus lines insurer, expressed support for a national insurer under an optional federal charter. Despite this, a 2006 survey suggested that surplus lines insurers would continue to play a significant role in providing specialty coverage. H.R. 5637 was introduced in 2006 by Representative Ginny Brown-Waite, aiming to address these issues through the House Financial Services Committee and the House Judiciary Committee. H.R. 5637 aimed to streamline state regulation in the surplus lines insurance market by preempting various state laws. It focused on giving regulatory and tax authority to the home state of the insured, without replacing preempted state laws with federal standards. The bill passed in the House but did not progress in the Senate. The bill aimed to streamline surplus lines insurance regulation by giving tax authority to the home state of the insured, preempting other state laws. It also encouraged an interstate compact for tax allocation and preempted state laws on eligibility requirements.

It also encouraged an interstate compact for tax allocation and preempted state laws on eligibility requirements. H.R. 5637 addressed reinsurance as well, with a \"home state\" approach to regulating credit for reinsurance and solvency of reinsurers based on NAIC standards. The bill, H.R. 1065, introduced by Representative Dennis Moore and cosponsored by 43 others, aimed to align the home state with NAIC standards for reinsurance credit and reinsurer solvency. It passed the House on June 25, 2007. A similar bill, S. 929, titled the Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act of 2007, was introduced in the Senate by Senators Mel Martinez and Bill Nelson on March 20, 2007. S. 929 and H.R. 5637 were introduced in the Senate and House during the 109th Congress but were not acted on in the 110th Congress. S. 40 and H.R. 3200, introduced in 2007, aimed to create an optional federal charter for the insurance industry, including provisions for surplus lines insurance. H.R. 3200 included provisions for surplus lines insurance, allowing national licensing for surplus lines brokers and agencies. It would have exempted them from state requirements and taxation, as well as from a national guaranty fund. However, no action was taken on this bill. Moore introduced H.R. 2571 on May 21, 2009, with 20 cosponsors, including lead cosponsor Representative Scott Garrett. The bill, similar to H.R. 1065, was passed by the House in the 110th Congress. It was referred to the House Financial Services Committee and Judiciary Committee. The House passed H.R. 2571 on September 9, 2009, and the language was included in an amendment to the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2009. S. 1363, identical to H.R. 2571, was introduced in the Senate on June 25, 2009. The bill H.R. 2571, introduced by Senator Mel Martinez in the Senate, was included in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act as Title V, Subtitle B after being passed by the House and Senate. H.R. 1880, introduced by Representatives Melissa Bean and Edward Royce, was signed into law as P.L. 111-203 on July 21, 2010. The bill includes provisions for surplus lines insurance and federal chartering of insurers and insurance producers. H.R. 1880 allows federal chartering of insurers and insurance producers, impacting surplus lines insurance. It includes provisions for systemic risk regulation and potential mandatory federal chartering for systemically significant insurers."
