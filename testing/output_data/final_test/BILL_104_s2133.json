    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Center for American Cultural Heritage Act\". The history of the United States is defined by its population, with various groups making unique contributions to American culture. The diversity of the population has enriched the country's spiritual, intellectual, cultural, political, and economic vitality. The Smithsonian Institution operates multiple museums, galleries, a zoological park, and research facilities. The absence of a national facility dedicated solely to presenting the history of the peopling of the United States restricts the citizens' ability to fully understand the diverse heritage derived from the unique histories of many peoples. The establishment of a Center for American Cultural Heritage aims to educate citizens about the diverse cultural heritage of the United States, derived from the unique histories of many peoples.

Additionally, it develops a standardized index of collections held by the Smithsonian Institution and provides information to researchers and scholars. The Smithsonian Institution offers various resources to researchers, scholars, and the public through non-Smithsonian collections, including documents, artifacts, and artworks held by other institutions. This includes a folklife center, a center for promoting mutual understanding among different groups, an oral history library, and a visitor center with tailored orientation guides. The Smithsonian Institution facilities serve as a training location for museum professionals and a hub for developing new museum-related technologies to enhance accessibility and operations.
