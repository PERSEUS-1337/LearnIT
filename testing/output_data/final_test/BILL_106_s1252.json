    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Standardized School Report Card Act\". Congress finds that the content of school report cards varies widely, with most not providing parents the necessary information to compare school performance. Taxpayers believe that publishing school information would motivate educators to improve, yet many have not seen report cards for their area schools. Dissemination of school information is crucial for parents and taxpayers to assess school quality and hold them accountable for performance improvement. The purpose of this Act is to provide parents, taxpayers, and educators with understandable school report cards. Each State educational agency must produce and distribute an annual report card on elementary and secondary education, including student performance, attendance, graduation rates, and teacher qualifications. The annual report card on elementary and secondary education must include information on teachers teaching out of field, emergency certification, average class size, school safety, parental involvement, and school dropout rates. The annual report card for elementary and secondary education must include statistics on student access to technology, school performance indicators, and student performance in language arts and mathematics. The annual report card for elementary and secondary education must include statistics on student access to technology, school performance indicators, student performance in language arts and mathematics, attendance and graduation rates, teacher qualifications, class sizes, school safety, and parental involvement. The model school report card developed by the Secretary of Education includes indicators such as parental involvement, dropout rates, student access to technology, and other measures of school performance and quality. Each State educational agency or school must disaggregate student performance data in their annual report card as required by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965."
