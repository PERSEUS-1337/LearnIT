The IMF predicts it will be the worst recession since the Great Depression, prompting governments to implement fiscal and monetary measures. Low- and middle-income countries are particularly vulnerable to the economic impact. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a global economic crisis, causing stock market turmoil, mass unemployment, disrupted trade, and shortages of supplies. Low- and middle-income countries are especially vulnerable. Developing and emerging-market countries could contract by at least 1% in 2020, with capital flight exacerbating fiscal challenges. Many countries are seeking financial support from international financial institutions like the IMF and World Bank, which are mobilizing resources to provide assistance. The MDBs pledged $240 billion over the next 15 months. Congress accelerated authorizations to increase funding to IMF, World Bank, and African Development Bank lending facilities. Multilateral discussions are ongoing to enhance IFI's support for pandemic response. IMF and World Bank called for debt standstill for low-income countries, G-20 agreed to debt standstill through 2020. Calls for additional debt relief in developing countries. Some policy experts and policymakers in developing countries are advocating for more debt relief due to the severity of the crisis for low-income countries. Congressional action would be needed for permanent U.S. debt relief or contributions to finance debt relief by the World Bank or other MDBs. The IMF's main mission is to promote international monetary stability by providing emergency loans to countries in economic crises. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in demand for IMF financial assistance, with over 100 member countries requesting IMF programs. IMF's lending capacity of approximately $1 trillion is ready for deployment in response to the pandemic and economic crises. The IMF's maximum lending capacity is estimated at around $787 billion, with more resources likely needed. The IMF is discussing unprecedented levels of financial assistance, surpassing the previous highest funding of $165 billion in 2010 during the Eurozone crisis. The IMF has various financing options available for COVID-19 response, including rapid one-off assistance and debt relief for the poorest countries. The IMF is providing assistance to countries responding to health disasters, granting debt relief for vulnerable countries, increasing IMF loans, and approving new loans. The IMF has increased flexibility in responding to crises, doubling access to emergency assistance. Some experts question the conditionality of IMF loans for governments facing economic crises due to external shocks. The IMF has approved COVID-related programs for several countries, including Bolivia, Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kyrgyz Republic, Nigeria, Niger, Rwanda, Madagascar, Mozambique, Pakistan, and Togo. Iran and Venezuela, facing U.S. sanctions, have publicized their controversial requests for IMF assistance. Governments usually keep their IMF program requests confidential until finalized to avoid undermining investor confidence. Sudan, seeking emergency support from IFIs due to the pandemic exacerbating economic and humanitarian crises, faces obstacles accessing financing due to arrears and SST designation. IMF provided debt relief to low-income countries, including Sudan, amid COVID-19. The IMF provided debt service relief to 29 countries using the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust (CCRT), funded by donor countries. They are seeking to increase the fund by $1.4 billion and triple the size of the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust Fund (PRGT) to $17 billion. Additionally, a new Short-term Liquidity Line was approved in April 2020. The World Bank is providing financial support to developing countries during the COVID-19 pandemic, with approved projects totaling $9 billion in 78 countries. Projects include funding for containment strategies, medical staff training, and diagnostic testing equipment. The World Bank is allocating funds to support COVID-19 response efforts in various countries, including $11.3 million for Tajikistan, $20 million for Haiti, and $1 billion for India. The total commitment for pandemic response could reach $160 billion over the next 15 months, with the funding aimed at expanding intensive care capacity, diagnostic testing, rapid response teams, and procurement of personal protective equipment. It is unclear whether the funds will be concessional or nonconcessional financing. The World Bank's $160 billion commitment includes $50 billion in net transfers to low-income countries eligible for concessional lending, $8 billion in financial support through the IFC for private companies affected by COVID-19, and a $6.5 billion facility to support private sector investors in tackling the pandemic. Additionally, a new multi-donor trust fund will be established to help countries prepare for disease outbreaks. A new trust fund, the Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Multi-Donor Fund (HEPRF), has been established to complement the World Bank's $160 billion financing. Japan is the first founding donor, aiming to boost health security investments for disease outbreaks. The fund will incentivize IDA-eligible countries to invest in health emergency preparedness and enable quick responses to major outbreaks. Other MDBs are also mobilizing resources in response to COVID-19. The United States is a member of several MDBs focused on economic development in specific regions, including the Asian Development Bank, the African Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. It is not a member of newer MDBs led by emerging markets like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the New Development Bank. Specialized MDBs are responding to the crisis by reallocating funds, creating lending facilities for COVID-19, and expediting approval processes. Multilateral development banks, including the World Bank, have committed $80 billion over the next 15 months for COVID-19 response. In total, $240 billion in financing will be available to developing countries from MDBs. Specific measures taken by MDBs are detailed in the Appendix. The suspension of debt payments for IDA countries took time to gain momentum. Donors prefer coordinated debt relief efforts to benefit developing countries. Debt relief is traditionally organized by the Paris Club, excluding China, a major creditor with opaque lending terms. China resists debt transparency efforts and widespread forgiveness. G-20 leaders discussed debt issues at an emergency summit on March 26. The G-20 leaders, at their emergency summit on March 26, did not provide debt relief but pledged to address debt vulnerabilities in low-income countries due to the pandemic. On April 15, 2020, the G-20 finance ministers announced the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI), temporarily suspending debt payments until the end of the year for the world's poorest countries. Private creditors, represented by the Institute of International Finance (IIF), also joined the debt relief effort on a voluntary basis, potentially freeing up over $20 billion for these countries to combat the pandemic. The G-20 leaders announced the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) on April 15, 2020, suspending debt payments for the poorest countries until the end of the year. This includes $12 billion to official creditors and $8 billion to private creditors. The DSSI applies to 76 World Bank designated countries and Angola, with an estimated total external debt exceeding $750 billion. China and other creditors do not disclose their lending scale. United States holds approximately $7.7 billion in debt from DSSI countries. Repayment schedules are to be rescheduled without debt write-offs. The current proposal for debt rescheduling for DSSI countries does not require U.S. legislation, but some are advocating for debt forgiveness, which would need authorizations and appropriations. The budgeting and accounting for U.S. debt relief is based on the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, requiring Congress to appropriate the estimated amount of debt relief in advance. Prior to this act, no budget authority or appropriations were needed for official debt relief. In FY2021, the Administration requested authorizations to increase funding for several IFIs, which were enacted by Congress in the CARES Act. This included funding for the IMF, World Bank, African Development Bank, and African Development Fund to address the financing needs of developing and emerging economies. Policy experts and policymakers are considering unusual options to address the financing needs of developing and emerging economies, such as stretching MDB lending, IMF gold sales, policies to boost global liquidity, and multilateral debt relief. Some analysts believe MDBs can lend larger amounts than they currently do due to their conservative approach to capital adequacy. MDBs can potentially expand lending by $750 billion to $1.3 trillion by adjusting their equity-to-loan ratio and considering callable capital from member countries. This could be done while maintaining an AAA rating or risking a downgrade to AA+. MDBs can increase lending by including callable capital from member countries without risking a downgrade in their AAA rating. Congressional legislation is not required for MDBs to adjust their capital adequacy rules. Advocates suggest the IMF sell gold reserves to finance debt relief for the poorest countries. The IMF holds 90.5 million ounces of gold in reserves, valued at around $153 billion at current market prices. IMF's total gold holdings are valued at about $4.9 billion on its balance sheet. IMF acquired this gold through various transactions, including an amendment in 1978 that severed the link between currency and gold. Countries were prohibited from defining their currency value in terms of gold, and IMF from lending or defining assets in gold. Oxfam's Nadia Daar suggests using windfall profits from gold sales for debt cancellation in developing countries to prevent loss of life. Since the 1978 amendment, the IMF's use of gold has been limited. IMF members have supported limited gold sales, requiring an 85% majority vote. In 2000, gold sales funded debt relief for developing countries. In 2009, the IMF approved the sale of 403.3 metric tons of gold to strengthen finances, with profits used for concessional lending. U.S. congressional authorization is required for IMF gold sales. In 1999, Congress authorized the United States to support a limited sale of IMF gold for poor country debt cancellation. Subsequent gold sales have all been approved by Congress. The U.S. Federal Reserve has provided major central banks with uninterrupted access to U.S. dollars through emergency swap lines. The Fed has created swap lines and a repo facility for foreign central banks to exchange currency for dollars. However, access to these facilities is limited to advanced and some emerging market countries, leaving less-developed economies struggling with depleting reserves. One proposed solution is a global allocation of IMF special drawing rights. The IMF has the authority to create Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) as an international reserve asset to supplement member countries' foreign exchange reserves. SDRs are not a currency but can be exchanged for hard convertible currency among IMF members. They are allocated based on IMF quotas and are proposed to be increased by $500 billion to help least developed countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Robust International Response to Pandemic Act (H.R. 6581) proposes allocating $3 trillion SDRs to support countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, concerns exist about the inefficiency of SDRs, as they would mainly benefit advanced economies. Additionally, there are worries about including countries under U.S. sanctions in the SDR allocation. The U.S. Treasury opposed a broad SDR allocation in spring 2020 due to concerns about including countries under sanctions like Iran and Venezuela. U.S. support is necessary for any SDR allocation, as the U.S. has veto power over allocations at the IMF. Congressional support is also required for SDR increases equal to or larger than the U.S. share of the total IMF quota. The Special Drawing Rights Act of 1968 gave the Executive Branch authority to vote for the First Amendment to the IMF's Articles of Agreement creating the SDR. The Act also outlines guidelines for U.S. participation in the SDR Department, including consultation requirements with Congress for new SDR allocations. The U.S. quota is currently $113.3 billion, and the Administration could support an SDR allocation of less than $649 billion without legislation. Calls are increasing for the G-20 DSSI to take further action. Nigerian finance minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, a special envoy of the African Union seeking G-20 support for Africa during COVID-19, calls for a two-year extension of debt service relief. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) urges canceling around $1 trillion in debts owed by developing countries to alleviate their debt burden. Debt restructuring, involving lengthening maturities, lowering interest rates, and writing off principle, is seen as a solution, but negotiations are complex and can take years. Divisions between western creditor governments and China over debt relief complicate the process. Many developing countries, including low-income and middle-income countries, may face default before debt restructurings can be completed. African countries are seeking debt relief from China, offering collateral in exchange. The Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) does not cover $12 billion in payments due to multilateral lenders like the IMF and World Bank. Discussions are ongoing on how to handle these debts. The IFIs have historically been lenders of last resort during financial crises, arguing for preferred creditor status. However, there have been instances of debt reductions, such as the MDRI in 2005. If a new multilateral debt relief agreement is pursued, congressional action may be necessary. The IFIs are mobilizing resources on an unprecedented scale to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and economic crisis, with calls for additional policies and multilateral coordination on debt relief for low-income countries. Policy questions for Congress include IFIs' resource sufficiency and the United States' support for mobilizing additional resources. Developing countries have various financing needs. Developing countries have diverse financing needs, including public health response, budgetary support, and liquidity. IFIs must prioritize financial assistance allocation and coordinate COVID-19 responses. Streamlining approval processes while ensuring due diligence is crucial to protect IFI resources. Oversight of debt relief resource usage and staffing for high volumes of assistance processing are essential. Access to information on financing needs in developing countries and emerging markets, including China's opaque lending terms, is a concern for IFIs. The IMF is concerned about the increasing debt/GDP ratios in many countries and is questioning the need for a new round of multilateral debt forgiveness. The Administration's approach to developing-country debt, engagement with official institutions and the private sector, and plan for debt relief negotiations with creditor governments outside the Paris Club group are under scrutiny. The balance between IFI financing and debt relief in the COVID-19 response is being debated, along with the impact of an inability to reach multilateral agreement on debt relief on the disbursement of IFI financial assistance to developing and emerging economies. The IMF is concerned about increasing debt/GDP ratios in many countries and questions the need for multilateral debt forgiveness. Developing and emerging economies need immediate financing to address COVID-19 impacts, and the recovery may take years. IFIs need to assess countries' repayment capacity amidst short-, medium-, and long-term pandemic effects."
