    "content": "Section 1 introduces qualified stock distributions to employees under a new section 139B in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. In general, gross income excludes shares of stock received in a qualified employee stock distribution, gains on such stock held for at least 10 years, and gains on stock acquired within 60 days of a qualified disposition. Definitions and special rules apply for this section. The curr_chunk discusses definitions and special rules related to qualified employee stock distribution, including terms like qualified employee stock distribution, maximum stock amount, and qualified disposition. The curr_chunk explains the calculation for the disposition of a limited number of shares of stock received in a calendar year, based on the applicable percentage determined from a table for subsequent years. The applicable percentage for the disposition of shares received in each calendar year is determined as follows: 0 percent for the first through tenth year, increasing by 10 percent each subsequent year up to 100 percent. The applicable percentage for the disposition of shares received in each calendar year increases by 10 percent each subsequent year up to 100 percent. Amounts excluded from gross income under subsection (a)(1) are not considered as wages for employment tax purposes. If stock is disposed of before the required holding period, the excluded amount is recaptured in the individual's gross income and the tax imposed is increased. The Secretary will issue regulations to implement this section, including its application to stock options. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections. The amendments made by this section apply to stock received by employees after the enactment of this Act."
