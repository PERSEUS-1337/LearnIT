    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Volunteer Protection Act of 1997\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2 as findings and purpose. The Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 acknowledges that the fear of liability lawsuits deters volunteers from offering their services, leading to a decline in participation in nonprofit organizations and government programs. This results in diminished community contributions and higher program costs, despite the effectiveness of these social service programs funded by the federal government. The Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 aims to protect volunteers from personal liability risks when participating in social service programs, promoting the interests of beneficiaries and sustaining the availability of nonprofit organizations and government entities that rely on volunteer contributions. Federal legislation is needed to clarify and limit the personal liability risks assumed by volunteers, ensuring their continued participation in these programs. The Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 preempts state laws inconsistent with it, but does not override laws providing extra protections for volunteers from personal liability. It also limits liability for volunteers. Liability protection for volunteers under the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 exempts them from liability for harm caused while acting within their responsibilities, as long as they were properly licensed and the harm was not due to willful misconduct. The Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 provides liability protection for volunteers, exempting them from liability for harm caused while acting within their responsibilities, unless the harm was due to willful misconduct or conscious indifference to the rights or safety of the individual harmed. This section does not affect civil actions brought by nonprofit organizations or governmental entities against volunteers, and does not affect the liability of organizations or entities, except that punitive damages may not be awarded unless the harm was caused by willful or criminal actions of a volunteer. Exceptions to Volunteer Liability Protection include state laws that require risk management procedures and training for volunteers, hold organizations liable for volunteer actions like employer-employee relationships, and remove liability limitations if a volunteer is operating a vehicle requiring a license. State laws may require operators or vehicle owners to have a license or insurance. Additionally, laws may limit liability exceptions for civil actions brought by government officers or require nonprofits or government entities to provide a financially secure source of recovery for harm caused by volunteers. This source can be insurance, risk pooling, assets, or other arrangements approved by the state. The entity can pay for losses up to a specified amount with separate standards for different types of liability exposure. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.

Section 4 of the Act applies to any claim for harm caused by a volunteer's act or omission filed after the enactment date, regardless of when the harm or conduct occurred."
