    "content": "The U.S. Coast Guard has faced challenges in maintaining experienced marine safety personnel, highlighted by incidents like the 2015 sinking of the U.S.-flag cargo ship El Faro. Congress has raised concerns about the agency's ability to hire and train a competent marine safety workforce, leading to the Hamm Alert Maritime Safety Act of 2018 directing the Coast Guard to enhance its marine inspections staff. The Coast Guard is responsible for ensuring vessels meet safety standards. Congress requested a report detailing the training marine inspectors must complete. The Coast Guard faces staffing challenges in marine safety as its responsibilities increase. They have 671 marine inspectors inspecting various vessels. The Coast Guard employs accident investigators to conduct casualty investigations of U.S. and foreign-flag vessels, detect safety hazards, and recommend enforcement action. This falls under the prevention policy workforce headed by the Assistant Commandant for Prevention Policy. Reporting to the Assistant Commandant is the Director of Inspections and Compliance, overseeing safety-related offices. The U.S.-flag fleet, particularly the older vessels, requires more frequent inspection due to their age. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) raised concerns about the quality of Coast Guard inspections after the El Faro sinking, leading to the revocation of safety certificates for similar vessels. Older vessels in the U.S.-flag fleet, including passenger and ferry ships, are over 20 years old and require increased scrutiny. The U.S.-flag fleet, especially older vessels, undergo more frequent inspections due to age. Vessels carrying passengers or hazardous cargo are inspected more often than general-cargo or newer vessels. U.S.-built vessels are required for domestic transport under the Jones Act, but their high cost can hinder replacement. The fleet for international voyages is younger and not subject to the U.S.-built requirement. Congress is seeking information on Coast Guard inspection staff as the number of vessels needing inspection is rising, including towing vessels. Fishing vessel safety is also becoming a focus for Congress, adding to the agency's responsibilities. The Coast Guard's safety responsibilities include overseeing LNG export terminals and the use of LNG as ship fuel. The marine inspector workforce consists of commissioned officers, chief warrant officers, and civilians, who enter through various accession sources. CWOs are divided into two specialties: Marine Safety Specialty Deck and Marine Safety Specialty Engineer, selected through an accession panel. An emphasis is placed on past maritime experience. The Coast Guard's marine inspector workforce includes commissioned officers, chief warrant officers, and civilians. Civilian marine inspectors are hired based on past maritime and inspection experience or through an apprenticeship program. They typically remain at a single location for their entire careers, while officers rotate every three years and may be promoted to leadership positions. Marine inspectors in the Coast Guard, including commissioned officers, chief warrant officers, and civilians, work in this capacity for an average of 8.7 years. Pay scales range from approximately $90,000 to $124,000 for CWOs and $64,000 to $152,000 for officers. Investigators, who may have prior experience as inspectors, earn approximately $106,000 to $124,000 as CWOs and $83,000 to $130,000 as officers. The Coast Guard recognizes the importance of training for marine inspectors, with Rear Admiral John Nadeau emphasizing the need for highly trained and proficient staff. He highlighted that simply increasing the number of inspectors would not solve the problem, as training, information, policies, and procedures are crucial. Nadeau stressed the necessity of a small, focused group of individuals dedicated to improving marine inspections. The Coast Guard is enhancing the quality of its safety inspection workforce by prioritizing marine inspector training, establishing new staff for third party oversight, and hiring civilian marine inspectors. A comprehensive training architecture is being developed to ensure consistent training levels that keep pace with industry changes. This effort is part of the agency's ongoing plans to improve the quality of its inspection workforce. The Coast Guard is prioritizing marine inspector training and enhancing the quality of its safety inspection workforce in response to congressional scrutiny following a major marine casualty. Marine Safety program is typically low profile until visibility is raised by incidents, with budget constraints and competing needs within the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard is focusing on improving marine inspector training and workforce quality in response to congressional scrutiny after a major marine incident. Personnel rotation and geographic reassignments hinder the development of proficient marine inspectors, leading to a lack of confidence in interacting with industry personnel. Vessel technology complexity and extensive safety regulations further challenge inspectors. The Coast Guard is addressing marine inspection issues by aiming to enhance the civilian inspector workforce and create better career paths. Efforts to improve marine safety may be hindered by a perception that it hinders promotion opportunities within the agency. The Coast Guard faces challenges in managing marine safety officers within a military promotion system. Officers in the marine safety career path feel disadvantaged as they advance in rank. The perception of disadvantage persists, dating back to a government reorganization during World War II. President Truman proposed keeping the marine inspection function under the Coast Guard after the war, citing their adequate performance during wartime and synergies with other missions. The maritime industry opposed this, arguing for a separate bureau to oversee marine inspections. The Coast Guard was given the permanent assignment of marine inspections as part of a government reorganization plan by the Truman Administration in 1946. The role of the Coast Guard in marine inspections remained contentious, with ship captains' union representatives testifying about the qualifications required for inspectors. The Coast Guard's marine inspection program was staffed by experienced professionals, with inspectors typically being mature and respected individuals. Concerns arose about replacing the expertise of retiring inspectors, leading to an audit by the General Accounting Office in 1979 after tanker accidents. The report highlighted the need for trained and experienced personnel in the program. The GAO report raised concerns about the training and qualifications of marine inspectors in the Coast Guard's marine inspection program. Inspectors had sea experience but lacked uniform criteria for qualification, timely training, and specialized job classifications, leading to difficulty in maintaining expertise in marine inspection. The GAO report highlighted challenges in maintaining expertise in marine inspection within the Coast Guard. Inspectors lacked consistent qualification criteria and specialized training, leading to a lack of experienced staff in vessel inspection roles. Rotation among duty stations hindered inspectors from gaining proficiency in specific areas, impacting their credibility in the maritime industry. The Coast Guard faced challenges in maintaining expertise in marine inspection, with inspectors lacking consistent qualification criteria and specialized training. In response to a 1979 GAO report, the Coast Guard considered establishing an inspection specialty career classification. In 1980, the U.S.-flag ship Poet disappeared in the Atlantic, suspected to be due to heavy weather and structural integrity issues. The Coast Guard's Marine Board of Investigation found deficiencies in the inspections conducted prior to the ship's disappearance. The Marine Electric, a 40-year-old Jones Act ship, sank in heavy weather due to poor cargo hatches and deck plating, leading to the death of 31 crew members. Coast Guard inspectors lacked experience in conducting safety examinations for vessels like the Marine Electric, which raised concerns about undetected structural defects. The lack of training and experience of Coast Guard inspectors on the Marine Electric raised doubts about their capabilities to enforce safety laws. A ship engineers' union representative highlighted the disparity in experience between Coast Guard officers and merchant marine officers, emphasizing the need for inspectors to have a thorough understanding of ship safety to effectively condemn dangerous vessels. The witness urged Congress to transfer ship inspection responsibilities to civilian career professionals, citing the age of the U.S. fleet as a major concern. Industry experts recommend retiring ships at 20 years old, as 75% of the worst U.S. marine tragedies involved ships aged 20 or older. The witness emphasized the importance of addressing the issue of old and dangerous ships in the U.S. fleet. The witness urged Congress to transfer ship inspection responsibilities to civilian career professionals due to the age of the U.S. fleet being a major concern. Industry experts recommend retiring ships at 20 years old, as most of the worst U.S. marine tragedies involved ships aged 20 or older. The core problem of maritime safety lies in old ships, and the solution requires a dedicated team of professional inspectors. The Coast Guard made changes in its marine safety training program in 1985, including standardized on-the-job training and selection of \"training ports\" for intensive training. On March 24, 1989, the U.S.-flag tanker Exxon Valdez spilled about 11 million gallons of oil after grounding on Bligh Reef. The ship captain, impaired by alcohol, turned over operation to a third mate. Congress increased funding for Coast Guard safety personnel in response. In the 1990s, Coast Guard inspections were scrutinized after two fatal passenger vessel incidents. In December 1993, the wooden vessel El Toro II sank in the Chesapeake Bay due to water seepage, resulting in three fatalities. The Coast Guard's investigation revealed deficiencies in the inspector's knowledge and lack of awareness of previous inspection reports. Another incident in May 1999 involved the sinking of the Miss Majestic, an amphibious \"duckboat\" turned tour boat, leading to the drowning of 13 passengers out of 20. The Coast Guard's Marine Board of Investigation found that a critical part was missing from the rear shaft of the Miss Majestic, leading to the drowning of 13 passengers. The inspector lacked awareness of the vessel's design components, and inadequate inspection records were kept by the local Coast Guard office. The NTSB concluded that Coast Guard inspections were inadequate and cursory, with deficiencies being missed over the preceding five years. The Coast Guard's deficiencies in vessel inspections led to marine casualties in the 1990s, prompting a reevaluation of the agency's marine safety mission. An internal study in 1995 recommended developing an investigations career path to improve the quality of accident investigations. In 1996, the GAO reviewed the Coast Guard's utilization of additional funding to add positions to its Marine Safety Program. In the early 1990s, the Coast Guard added 875 positions to its Marine Safety Program. A 1997 congressional hearing highlighted concerns from the passenger vessel industry about the complexity of vessel inspection regulations and the lack of training for Coast Guard inspectors. After 9/11, Congress increased resources for maritime security. In a 2007 hearing, the maritime industry expressed reactions to the Coast Guard's new security responsibilities following its transfer to the Department of Homeland Security. The 2007 hearing focused on transferring the Coast Guard's marine safety inspection function to a civilian agency to address concerns about the agency's shift towards security matters over safety. Industry witnesses expressed a shift in their relationship with Coast Guard inspectors from safety partners to security risks. The proposal aimed to undo the World War II-era reorganization and improve the expertise and consistency of personnel conducting marine inspections. In foreign countries like the Netherlands, Germany, or Norway, marine inspections are conducted by retired ship captains who have expertise and respect for the officers on the ship. This civilian force is effective due to their competence, motivation, and love for the maritime industry. This system is seen as a successful model for marine inspection. In countries like Germany and the Netherlands, retired ship captains conduct marine inspections, a successful model for maritime inspection. The Coast Guard faces a dilemma in sending civilian inspectors instead of officers to enforce international conventions on foreign ships, causing offense to foreign masters. The Coast Guard needs specialists but also requires them to have broadened experiences to be promotable. This concept of \"broadened specialists\" aims to maintain subject matter expertise while preparing individuals for executive roles within the organization. The Commandant outlined actions taken to improve the inspection workforce, including changes in training and qualifications to keep pace with technological advancements in the maritime industry. Additionally, adjustments were made to the warrant officer selection system to bring in more talented enlisted personnel. Valuable lessons were learned from joint military and civilian staffing in sector command centers and vessel traffic services. The Commandant emphasized the importance of civilian personnel in vessel traffic services for continuity and training. He advocated for more civilian positions in marine inspection to maintain critical job skills and provide military members with valuable experience. The Commandant highlighted the need to leverage a dual staffing model for maritime safety and security, viewing them as synergistic missions. His top priority is ensuring the inspection program is right in terms of training, qualifications, and staffing. The Coast Guard revamped its safety program after an internal study highlighted issues with rotating staff and sending unqualified personnel for inspections. The report also mentioned challenges in getting the DHS to embrace the Marine Safety program. The Coast Guard revamped its safety program by creating additional civilian safety positions and converting military positions into civilian ones. A 2008 audit by the DHS Inspector General confirmed the need for more qualified personnel in accident investigations. The Coast Guard revamped its safety program by hiring more civilians for accident investigations. The qualification standard for investigators was lowered in 2007, which raised concerns as experience in hull or machinery inspection is crucial. The IG report highlighted issues with rotating assignments and promotion potential in the marine safety area. The Coast Guard's safety program was revamped by hiring more civilians for accident investigations, but potential candidates may be deterred by the lack of career advancement opportunities in marine casualty investigation due to rotating assignments and limited time in positions. Civilian investigators have the advantage of gaining specialized knowledge over time. The Homeland Security Institute study recommended increasing tour lengths and relying more on civilians for marine safety functions due to frequent rotations hindering proficiency in inspection and investigation. The Coast Guard's workforce database lacked information on years of service and expertise for marine safety personnel. The Coast Guard lacked central management for marine safety workforce, leading to a lack of agency-wide standards for qualifications. After the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010, which resulted in 11 deaths and a massive oil spill, it was revealed that the Coast Guard was responsible for safety inspections on the rig. The Coast Guard was responsible for safety inspections on the rig, but regulations had not been updated for rigs moving farther offshore. After the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010, Congress required the Coast Guard to improve its marine inspection workforce. The Coast Guard was required to enhance its marine inspection workforce following the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010. Initiatives in the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2010 aimed at workforce expertise included career path management improvements, apprenticeships, workforce quality measurement, marine industry training, and a marine safety curriculum at the Coast Guard Academy. A 2011 audit found that 99% of vessel inspections in the offshore oil and gas industry were conducted by fully qualified Coast Guard inspectors, but deficiencies were noted in inspection guidance and recording procedures. The DHS Inspector General found deficiencies in the USCG's marine accident reporting system, attributing it to issues with personnel qualifications and rotation. This has led to delays in identifying accident causes, implementing corrective actions, and sharing findings with stakeholders. The DHS Inspector General found deficiencies in the USCG's marine accident reporting system due to issues with personnel qualifications and rotation. This has led to delays in identifying accident causes, implementing corrective actions, and sharing findings with stakeholders. The Director of Prevention Policy provides career guidance suggesting personnel leave the marine safety program for better promotion potential, causing a shortage of qualified personnel for investigations and inspections. The IG found that two-thirds of accident inspectors and investigators did not meet Coast Guard qualification standards at visited sites, which will be further compounded by the new towing vessel safety regime increasing inspection workload by 50%. Commandant Zukunft emphasized the need for more specialization in the marine safety workforce to handle the complexity of vessel systems and new technologies like LNG fuel. He called for increasing proficiency through specialization and extending job rotations to lead the industry on safety. The Vice Commandant was directed to revitalize the marine safety enterprise, focusing on marine inspection and regulatory framework. Efforts will include increasing proficiency of the workforce, training new marine inspectors, and reviewing civilian career management processes to improve upward mobility. The sinking of the El Faro in October 2015 has highlighted the need for a closer look at the condition of vessels in the U.S.-flag fleet beyond this incident. The findings indicate that many ships, including the El Faro, are in substandard condition due to aging fleets. Shifting marine safety personnel to a civilian workforce is a proposed solution, but may not completely solve the issue. The Federal Aviation Administration and other civilian agencies struggle to retain experienced inspection staff due to the rapid pace of technological advancements in industries like aviation and pipeline safety. This has led to an increased reliance on private-sector inspectors, raising concerns about the effectiveness of in-house inspection workforces. The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement faces challenges in retaining vessel inspectors, who are in demand by private industry for ensuring ships meet safety standards. Realignment of the government's marine safety function could benefit from consolidating maritime-related missions in a single agency, as there are synergies among these missions. Inspectors' knowledge of vessels and crews provides valuable risk intelligence relevant to security and search and rescue missions. The Coast Guard's vessel safety inspection function has synergies with environmental inspections related to oil pollution, ballast water, and emissions. There are human resource and capital equipment synergies among missions such as search and rescue, fisheries enforcement, and fishing safety. Despite this, there is a possibility of dismantling parts of the Coast Guard and reorganizing them under other agencies due to its close relationship with the Navy. In 1982, proposals were made to transfer the Coast Guard to the Navy or Department of Defense in response to budget cuts. Calls for this transfer were renewed during the 2019 government shutdown. Supporters believe it could increase the Coast Guard's budget, but critics argue non-defense missions would suffer. The transfer of navigation-related functions from the Army Corps of Engineers to the Department of Transportation has been proposed by Congress and the Trump Administration as part of a larger reorganization plan. This transfer could potentially combine navigation infrastructure functions with marine safety inspection and accident investigation within the Department of Transportation. The Coast Guard's missions were transferred to the Department of Transportation in 1967 and then to the Department of Homeland Security in 2003 as a distinct entity, despite Congress's reluctance to eliminate any of its missions."
