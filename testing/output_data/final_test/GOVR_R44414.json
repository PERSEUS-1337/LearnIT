    "content": "The ACA established the CO-OP program, with final regulations issued in December 2011. Loans were awarded by July 1, 2013, prioritizing applicants offering statewide plans and having private sector support. The HHS Secretary could award grants if no CO-OP applied in a state. The Comptroller General established the CO-OP advisory board and made board appointments by June 23, 2010. The advisory board provided recommendations about the criteria for awarding CO-OP loans. CMS issued a CO-OP loan funding opportunity announcement in July 2011 and began awarding loans in 2012. Entities eligible for CO-OP loans had to be organized as nonprofit member organizations. Certain entities were ineligible for CO-OP loans. Entities seeking CO-OP loans must meet specific eligibility criteria, including not receiving 25% or more of their funding from certain entities and not being sponsored by a government entity. CO-OPs must also comply with state regulations and governance standards to maintain eligibility for the program. CO-OPs must adhere to governance standards, including member control, conflict-of-interest policies, and ethics standards. Health plans offered by CO-OPs must focus on non-group and small-group markets, meeting requirements for offering plans through health insurance exchanges. Profit usage is also regulated. CO-OPs must use profits to reduce premiums, enhance benefits, or improve healthcare for members. They must comply with loan agreement terms, including reporting requirements and milestones. CO-OPs qualify for federal tax exemption under Section 501(c)(29) of the IRC. State tax-exempt status is determined at the state level. CO-OPs must offer plans through health insurance exchanges within three years. CO-OPs must offer non-group health plans at silver and gold benefit levels through health insurance exchanges within three years. They must also offer small-group plans at the same benefit levels through SHOP exchanges. CMS will certify CO-OP health plans for exchanges if they meet all requirements. Exchanges have the authority to determine which plans to offer, but must include all CMS-certified CO-OP health plans. According to the Government Accountability Office, most CO-OPs offered health plans through exchanges in multiple states in 2014 and 2015. By 2016, the number of CO-OPs offering plans through exchanges decreased to 11 in 13 states. The ACA allocated $6.0 billion for the CO-OP program, with $2.6 billion rescinded in subsequent legislation. In CY2012, CMS awarded about $2.0 billion in loans to CO-OPs. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 rescinded $4.9 billion from the CO-OP program, leaving about $1.1 billion of the original $6.0 billion appropriation. The remaining 10% of unobligated funds were put in a contingency fund for assistance and oversight to CO-OPs. The contingency fund for CO-OPs can be used for additional loan funds and administrative costs. The total expected cost to the government for CO-OP loans is based on subsidy costs, which consider future receipts and expenditures. Default risk affects subsidy costs, with lower default likelihood allowing for more loans to be issued. The budgetary cost of CO-OP loans totaled $979 million from FY2012 through FY2015, with $2.085 billion in loan disbursements made to CO-OPs in the FY2017 President's budget. Estimating the budgetary cost of federal credit programs over the life of the loans is dependent on various factors, including changes in interest rates and projected default rates. The CO-OP program's budgetary cost is reestimated annually due to economic changes and market conditions. Default rate estimates are uncertain for new programs like CO-OP. Revisions increased the estimated budgetary cost by $601 million. CO-OP provides start-up and solvency loans to nonprofit issuers, with repayment expected according to loan terms. The CO-OP program provides start-up and solvency loans to nonprofit issuers for setting up a health insurance issuer and meeting state solvency requirements. Loans must be repaid with interest as per the loan agreement terms. Funds are not to be used for brick-and-mortar construction, clinical costs, propaganda, influencing legislation, or marketing. The CO-OP program provides start-up and solvency loans to nonprofit issuers for setting up a health insurance issuer and meeting state solvency requirements. Loans must be repaid with interest as per the loan agreement terms. Funds are not to be used for meeting matching requirements of other federal programs, providing excessive executive compensation, funding unrelated activities, staff retreats, or promotional giveaways. Loan awards are disbursed according to the terms of the loan agreement, with milestones and drawdown plans finalized in the agreement. Repayment of start-up and solvency loans is required. The CO-OP program provides start-up and solvency loans to nonprofit issuers for setting up a health insurance issuer. Loans must be repaid with interest as per the loan agreement terms. CMS may terminate a loan agreement if the CO-OP is not in compliance with program requirements or engages in criminal activities. If terminated, the CO-OP must repay 110% of the loans received and face increased interest rates. Loan agreements can be terminated by either party. In case of termination, a CO-OP must comply with outlined terms, including state regulations, repayment of unused funds, and no further disbursements. CO-OPs can appeal CMS-initiated terminations within 30 days. 24 CO-OPs received loans totaling $2.4 billion, with one CO-OP dropped from the program for lack of state licensure. As of the report date, seven out of 23 CO-OP issuers are operational, offering health plans in nine states for the 2016 plan year. The remaining 16 CO-OPs are considered non-operational, either not offering health plans in 2016 or indicating they will not renew or offer plans in the future. State insurance commissioners regulate CO-OPs as state-licensed health insurance issuers. State-licensed health insurance issuers, including CO-OPs, must comply with state requirements. State insurance commissioners oversee the financial health of issuers and can take action if an issuer is undercapitalized or insolvent. The 16 non-operational CO-OPs are facing financial challenges, with some struggling due to being new entrants in the health insurance market. The challenges faced by new entrants in health insurance markets, including CO-OPs, have led to 16 out of 23 CO-OPs winding down their operations. Questions arise about coverage for individuals, payments to healthcare providers, and federal money lent to failed CO-OPs, with answers varying based on state laws and regulations. When a health insurance issuer, including a CO-OP, fails, the state insurance commissioner is typically appointed as a receiver to liquidate the issuer. Policies may be transferred to a different solvent issuer or to a state guaranty association, which protects customer policies subject to certain limits and exclusions specified by state law. Health insurance guaranty associations (GAs) protect policyholders and healthcare providers in the event of an insurer's insolvency. GAs may maintain policies or issue new ones to replace failed issuer policies. While all states have health GAs, coverage varies for different types of issuers and plans. GAs also help cover medical services for policyholders of failed CO-OPs, but the amount providers recover depends on the GA's design and application. Providers, like other creditors, can file claims against a failed CO-OP's estate. Providers can file claims against a failed CO-OP's estate, but the amount they recover depends on the CO-OP's financial condition, liquidation value of assets, and state law. CMS may use legal remedies to collect owed monies, but the process is complicated by state insurance receivership proceedings. Recovery amounts from failed CO-OPs are uncertain."
