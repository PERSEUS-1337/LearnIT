This includes protection from external threats, homeland security, economic opportunities, and building relationships with other countries. The economy plays a significant role in national security by impacting various aspects such as the defense industrial base, international economic sanctions, and budget deficit reduction. This report examines the macroeconomic and microeconomic factors that contribute to economic security and long-term growth. The economy's role in national security is crucial, impacting defense, sanctions, and budget deficit reduction. This report focuses on economic contributors to national security, including policies, coordination among nations, and foreign policies affecting human rights and democracy. The economy is both an enabler and constraint in national security, with complex issues that are addressed based on the President's 2010 National Security Strategy. The report provides an overview of economic contributors to national security, including issues like reducing the federal budget deficit, immigration, international trade, and innovation. The renewed public debate on national security is driven by global changes such as the rise of terrorism, the aftermath of the global financial crisis, and the growing economic power of emerging nations like China, India, and Brazil. The debate over national security in America is influenced by global economic changes, such as the rise of emerging nations like China, India, and Brazil. The weakened U.S. economy has intensified this debate, with concerns about job loss and terrorism. The focus now is on returning the economy to long-term growth and bridging the gap between potential and actual GDP levels. The Keynesian and supply side approaches to economic growth in the U.S. differ on how to address the federal budget deficit. Keynesians advocate for deficit spending during recession to stimulate consumption and investment, while supply siders believe in cutting deficits to encourage investment and job creation. Both approaches aim to maintain a vibrant and growing economy for long-term national security. The long-term security of the nation relies on a vibrant economy, with Congress playing a crucial role in national security through policies on military, economy, budget, education, and international relations. Congress allocates resources to respond to security threats and determines the strength of power options. The Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 mandated the President to provide a National Security Strategy to Congress. The President provides a National Security Strategy (NSS) to Congress outlining major security concerns and the administration's plans. The 2010 NSS highlighted global conditions, set economic goals, and emphasized the need for a strong military to address threats from various sources. The 2010 National Security Strategy (NSS) emphasized the need for a strong military and economic goals to ensure a safe and secure United States. Economic goals included fostering growth, reducing the budget deficit, promoting clean energy, advancing human rights, and cooperating with other nations on global issues like climate change and nuclear proliferation. The United States will advocate for human rights, economic development, and democracy as a defense against aggression and injustice in the changing world of the twenty-first century. Traditional perceptions that shaped U.S. security policy in the past included the preference for peaceful resolutions over war, U.S. hegemony being tolerated for peace, U.S. and Europe determining international policy, assisting countries in democratization, and the value of Western culture. The fundamental ideas that shaped U.S. national security in a changing world included the preference for peaceful resolutions, the appeal of Western culture, and the belief in market capitalism over socialism. These ideas have eroded in the twenty-first century as new economic powers like China bring different values to the table. Considerations trumped economics in various situations, such as wars taking precedence over economic costs and the need to balance U.S. retaliation in trade disputes with its impact on alliance relationships. Economic growth and employment were seen as best fostered by monetary and fiscal policy rather than industrial policies. Imbalances in trade and capital flows were believed to be self-correcting through foreign exchange rates determined by capital markets and appropriate government policies. However, these traditional economic precepts are now being challenged by the rise of the Asian model of development, which includes mixed market and socialist economies, large state-owned enterprises, government intervention in foreign exchange markets, and overt protection measures. In today's globalized world, government intervention in foreign exchange markets and protection of domestic industries have raised questions about traditional economic ideas. The United States may need a more nuanced approach to ensure long-term security. Following World War II, national security was maintained through military strength and economic leadership. The rise of the Asian development model challenges traditional economic beliefs. The United States has historically focused on military strength and economic leadership to ensure national security. In the 21st century, the country is reevaluating its approach, considering the importance of the economy in security strategy. The US has a strong military, large economy, and democratic values, but now recognizes the need to integrate economic power into its security strategy. The economy plays a crucial role in U.S. national security by providing funds, resources, and personnel for the military, ensuring economic security for Americans, and influencing international relations through trade and wealth flow. The U.S. economic policy debate focuses on how to allocate resources among competing interests, including national defense and social programs. The deficit issue involves the size of the budget, opportunity cost, and whether current costs should be shifted to future generations. The U.S. economic policy debate focuses on allocating resources between national defense and social programs, with concerns about the federal budget deficit and future debt repayment. Increasing economic growth and productivity is crucial for generating more resources. National security is supported by a combination of hard power, soft power, and economic opportunity, with the economy providing funding, resources, and a strong economic model. The economy relies on various factors such as government policies, human resources, science and technology, and global trade. Economic tools play a role in national security through sanctions, export controls, incentives, and as a cause of conflict. Economic incentives can complement or replace military power. The use of hard power by the military is often supported by economic tools like financial sanctions and incentives to influence the behavior of potential enemies. Sanctions, such as those on Iran and North Korea, are a coercive but non-lethal way to avoid open warfare and depend on cooperation from neighboring countries. The trade and financial sanctions on North Korea rely on China's cooperation. Export controls under the Export Administration Act regulate exports of sensitive goods with military applications. There are debates on liberalizing controls to promote exports, despite concerns about national security. Some argue that strict export controls hinder U.S. businesses from competing globally, leading to market share and job losses that harm the economy and national security. Others believe that liberalizing controls may compromise national security by giving sensitive products to potential adversaries. Financial incentives have historically been used in warfare to buy loyalties and fund security forces. Financial incentives, such as paying potential enemies not to fight or funding local security forces, can complement military campaigns by creating a reward-based system. The U.S. Marine Corps emphasizes the importance of social, economic, and political development in addition to destruction. In Iraq, financial incentives and funding armed Sunni militias played a key role in the Awakening in Anbar province. An emerging field of economics focuses on re-establishing a viable economy during or after an invasion or counter-insurgency. Expeditionary economics addresses re-establishing a viable economy during or after conflict, focusing on setting up markets, allocating resources, and building a self-sustaining economy. This involves creating jobs, providing basic services, improving infrastructure, and achieving fiscal sustainability. Economics plays a crucial role in national security by contributing to conflicts over resources like oil, diamonds, and territory, leading to tensions and potential hostilities between countries or within nations. Sharing resources, such as river water between India and Pakistan, can require cooperation but also holds the potential for conflict. The U.S. budget deficit has deepened due to the recession of 2008-2009, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and rising costs for social programs. Congress faces challenges in slowing deficit growth without compromising national security, balancing military and civilian expenditures, and anticipating a \"peace dividend\" as war expenditures decrease. Economic growth requires sufficient demand and increased productivity, with microeconomic policies combining with monetary and fiscal policies to expand the economy. The macroeconomic debate focuses on the federal government's budget, including military expenditures. The national debt is seen as unsustainable, leading to potential austerity measures and budget cuts. Admiral Mike Mullen has highlighted the national debt as a significant threat to national security, raising questions about the extent of budget cuts, including for the Pentagon. In the context of the national debt and potential budget cuts, there is considerable disagreement on the optimal size of the military budget and how to address foreign threats and ongoing wars. The public debate revolves around whether the military budget is too large or too small relative to what the country can afford, past expenditures, the overall federal budget, spending on other programs, and what other nations spend. The military budget is a topic of extensive debate, with concerns about its size relative to war fighting needs, threats from non-state actors and states with nuclear programs, and participation in disaster relief efforts. U.S. defense expenditures exceed $700 billion annually, with a significant impact on the GDP. Defense spending accounts for about 20% of the federal budget and roughly 4.9% of the GDP, equal to the combined budgets of the next 14 countries. The Secretary of Defense's statement is cited in the report. In 2010, Defense Secretary Robert Gates called for significant cuts in defense spending, outlining plans to save $100 billion over five years through various measures. However, Gates warned against sharp reductions in military spending, stating that such cuts would be \"catastrophic\" to national security. The Heritage Foundation, American Enterprise Institute, and the Foreign Policy Initiative also presented studies advocating for both increasing or maintaining defense expenditures and considering cuts. In 2010, the Heritage Foundation, American Enterprise Institute, and the Foreign Policy Initiative argued that Pentagon spending cuts are false, as the military is underfunded for modernization and future wars. They highlighted the need to update military hardware and noted that even eliminating Pentagon spending would only halve the fiscal deficit. The organizations emphasized the importance of a strong military for maintaining peace. The Sustainable Defense Task Force issued a report in 2010 suggesting that careful scrutiny of the Pentagon budget is essential to address federal deficits. They proposed options that could save up to $960 billion between 2011 and 2020 by cutting programs with poor cost-benefit relationships and implementing management reforms. This report influenced a group of 57 Members of Congress to send a letter regarding military spending. The Sustainable Defense Task Force report in 2010 highlighted the need for scrutiny of the Pentagon budget to address federal deficits. A group of 57 Members of Congress called for military spending to undergo rigorous scrutiny without compromising national security. The Commission on Fiscal Responsibility proposed $828 billion in deficit reduction through various measures, including equal percentage cuts to security and non-security discretionary spending. Since 1980, national defense spending has decreased, with defense now accounting for around 20% of the budget. Human resources command a larger share (67% in 2010). Federal government budget outlays and receipts show the impact of the global financial crisis on revenues from 2008, with a gradual recovery expected through 2015. The budget has steadily increased since 2000, making it difficult to reduce the deficit significantly without changes to entitlements like Health, Medicare, Social Security, and Income Security. The government budget includes categories like Health, Medicare, Social Security, Income Security, and National Defense. Government outlays are projected to rise, while total receipts are expected to recover as the economy improves. The gross federal debt in 2009 was $11.9 trillion, equivalent to 83% of the annual GDP. Treasury securities are in high demand for funding the debt. In late October 2010, investors accepted negative interest rates for Treasury securities due to high demand. China and Japan hold $1.6 trillion in U.S. debt, facing pressure to reduce trade surpluses. Short-term deficit financing is not a problem, but interest payments may strain the budget in the long term. Rising interest rates could impact the economy and reduce investments in U.S. manufacturing. The national debt crises in other countries have raised concerns about the large U.S. debt and potential adverse actions by markets. The federal budget is on an unsustainable path due to factors like the retirement of baby boomers and rising healthcare costs, leading to long-term budget deficits and projected debt growth. The federal debt is projected to grow to threatening levels due to persistent budget deficits. The President aims to achieve long-term fiscal sustainability by creating a responsible federal budget that reduces the deficit through various measures like a freeze on non-security discretionary spending and eliminating tax loopholes. The Administration aims to cut the deficit in half by the end of the President's current term through measures like eliminating tax loopholes and subsidies. The economic climate poses challenges to achieving deficit reduction goals, with actions taken in FY2008 and FY2009 impacting the budget deficit. Legislation like economic stimulus measures and health care reform will affect deficit levels in FY2010 and beyond. The final costs of federal responses to economic turmoil in FY2010 and beyond will depend on economic recovery pace, firm resilience with federal credit guarantees, and government gains or losses on asset purchases. Deficit reduction is crucial for long-term economic stability and sound fiscal policy. The challenge in the short to medium-term is balancing economic recovery continuation with demonstrating commitment to improving the long-term budget outlook. Failure to achieve a sustainable fiscal path could limit the government's flexibility in meeting obligations and responding to national needs. Failure to address the projected growth in debt could lead to insolvency or government default. Microeconomics focuses on individuals, households, businesses, and sectors within the economy. Economic security, crucial for national security, involves stable income and employment to maintain a desired standard of living, especially during recessions or high unemployment periods. Economic security relies on factors like low unemployment, competitive industries, and leadership in technology. Microeconomic issues related to defense spending, such as the sufficiency of the defense industry, have sparked political debates. The curr_chunk discusses microeconomic issues related to defense spending, including the need for new capabilities in cyber warfare, ensuring the integrity of the defense supply chain, and the impact of defense spending on local communities. It also addresses factors contributing to economic growth and soft power issues in the international economy and foreign economic assistance. The curr_chunk provides an overview of the historical development of the defense industry in the United States, highlighting the transition from federal government ownership to the emergence of the \"military-industrial complex\" in the mid-20th century. The United States' defense system, supported by purchases from foreign suppliers and private contractors, met the nation's defense needs. Industrialization and mass mobilization for war, influenced by the Civil War experience, led to a shift in how the U.S. acquired weapons. The Army's Ordnance Department and Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair were not leaders in innovative military technologies in the late 19th century. External forces like the President and congressional committees often had to push for the development of a significant domestic war production capacity. Industrialization efforts in the early 20th century were primarily focused on commercial markets. During World War I, the American industrialization efforts focused on meeting the expanding commercial market and national defense needs. Military hardware was procured from foreign arms makers, leading to challenges in mobilizing industry efficiently. The sudden increase in material needs overwhelmed existing procurement bureaucracies and production facilities, causing disruptions in the transportation system and distribution network. This resulted in American soldiers using weapons and aircraft from French, Italian, and British sources due to inadequacies in Army procurement. The impact of World War I on American industry was mixed, with military contracts proving profitable but procurement being overestimated and uncoordinated. The level of technology in weapon designs was low compared to European arms, leading to challenges in defense appropriations between the wars. The abrupt declaration of the Armistice in 1918 caused the termination of many contracts and court claims against the government. During the interwar period, defense appropriations decreased significantly, leading to industry focusing on civilian demand. The Great Depression contributed to the establishment of a dedicated defense industry, with military funding going towards basic procurement rather than innovation. The U.S. government showed little response to European rearmament and Japanese aggression in China until the late 1930s, when defense appropriations increased and procurement contracts were expanded domestically. During the interwar period, defense appropriations decreased significantly, leading to industry focusing on civilian demand. Private enterprise was hesitant to invest in war-specific production despite the potential demand due to past industrial dislocations. However, with preparations for potential military conflict, industry had to negotiate plans for war mobilization, focusing on subcontracting, temporary conversion of civilian production to war manufacturing, and government-financed plant construction. During World War II, the government financed the expansion of private factories and built contractor-operated facilities to meet the increased production needs. New civilian players, like the Office of Scientific Research and Development, were contracted for military research and production of innovative weapons. During World War II, the government encouraged industrial development by financing private factories and building contractor-operated facilities. The Defense Plant Corporation purchased or built production facilities, while the Office of Production Management prioritized war material deliveries. As the war ended, procurement decreased, contracts were terminated, and government controls on labor, finance, and industry were eased. Defense appropriations dropped, and manufacturing capacity shifted back to civilian production to meet consumer demand. The U.S. shifted back to civilian production after World War II, facing the challenge of meeting consumer demand while also assuming global defense responsibilities. Both Truman and Eisenhower administrations focused on using technology to create a global defense strategy against the Soviet Union without crippling the domestic economy. The U.S. shifted to civilian production after World War II to meet consumer demand and global defense responsibilities. The strategy against Soviet expansion involved immediate atomic and later thermonuclear attacks delivered by new military technology. This led to a civilian industry dedicated to providing high-tech military systems, sparking competition among military services for nuclear missions. The late 1940s and 1950s saw the creation of the Air Force's Strategic Air Command and development of intercontinental bombers. The U.S. military developed intercontinental bombers and missiles capable of carrying nuclear bombs to the Soviet Union, while the Navy and Army also increased their nuclear capabilities. The military aimed to maximize firepower and effectiveness while minimizing manpower and cost. During the Cold War, the U.S. military focused on developing advanced weapons systems to counter the Soviet Union. This led to a centralized budgeting process within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, where military departments competed for resources to plan for potential conflicts. Private corporations like Lockheed and General Dynamics played a significant role in meeting the military's demands for sophisticated weapons systems. During the Cold War, private corporations like General Dynamics and Raytheon specialized in defense projects, with Grumman Aerospace Corporation known for building Navy aircraft. President Eisenhower highlighted the growth of the permanent armaments industry in his farewell address in 1961, emphasizing the need for a strong defense establishment. In his 1961 farewell address, President Eisenhower warned about the dangers of the military-industrial complex, emphasizing the need to guard against its unwarranted influence on government and society. The Obama Administration expressed concern over lack of oversight in Department of Defense procurement spending, aiming to save $40 billion annually. Secretary of Defense Gates addressed issues of high defense budget, contracting costs, and workforce decline. Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates announced plans to rebalance the defense workforce by reducing contractors, increasing organic workforce size, and improving oversight of critical services in 2010. This included shifting overhead costs, seeking efficiency suggestions from experts, and conducting front end assessments. The Secretary of Defense announced initiatives to increase efficiency by reducing contractors, freezing positions at FY2010 levels, and implementing budget-cutting measures across the DOD. After announcing initiatives to increase efficiency by reducing contractors and freezing positions at FY2010 levels, the Secretary of Defense implemented budget-cutting measures across the DOD. This included creating more full-time positions in organizations to replace contractors, exceptions for critical areas, assessing senior positions, recommending cuts in General and Flag-officer positions and senior civilian executive positions, authorizing consolidation or closure of excess bases, freezing the overall number of oversight reports, and cutting advisory study dollars by 25%. The Secretary of Defense implemented budget-cutting measures across the DOD, including reducing funding for intelligence advisory contracts, freezing senior executive positions, and conducting a zero-based review of intelligence missions and organizations. This involved eliminating duplicative functions and organizations like the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and Information Integration and the Business Transformation Agency. The NSS objective for procurement reform aims to increase fiscal accountability in the federal government by reducing overhead, eliminating wasteful programs, and increasing efficiency. Despite the increased use of private sector contractors, a detailed analysis of their costs and services has not been conducted. This objective aligns with the Obama Administration's goal of identifying ways to economize and streamline operations within the Department of Defense and the federal government as a whole. The Secretary's planned budget reductions aim to restructure and increase efficiency in DOD business operations. These reductions target wasteful programs and contracted services, including a 25% cut in funding for advisory studies and a 10% reduction for intelligence contractors. However, the lack of specifics on how these decisions were made raises uncertainty about their impact on DOD operations. The impact of reductions on DOD business operations is uncertain, raising questions about budget savings and operational improvements. Eliminating agencies and components may lead to personnel reductions, with critical functions shifting to other areas. A 10% cut in service support contractors could reveal the true extent of services provided. The long-term costs of DOD personnel, including contractors, civilians, and military, remain unclear. The Secretary's proposed reductions in personnel costs and future performance of the Department of Defense could lead to deeper cuts and restructuring. These initiatives may take months or years to develop and implement, impacting local communities when bases are closed or contracts are cancelled. The Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission submitted its final report in September 2005, with Congress having the ability to override recommendations for base closures. The economic impact of base closures and loss of defense contracts is often more about protecting local economies than national security. The size of the facility or contract, the skills of the workers, and the loss of household expenditures all play a role in the economic impact on local communities. Economic impact studies of base closures and loss of defense contracts focus on the multiplier effects, which measure the number of jobs and economic activity generated in local communities. The employment multiplier creates indirect jobs in supporting industries, while the income multiplier shows how local spending circulates through the supply chain. The impact is influenced by the size of the facility or contract, worker skills, and loss of household expenditures. The multiplier effect of military expenditure can range from less than 1 to as much as 2.5 or 3.0, depending on economic conditions. Base closures or loss of procurement programs impact local communities, with the adjustment period for securing new jobs lasting up to 20 years. The quicker bases are converted to civilian use, the lower the impact on local economies. Base closures or program cuts have a fiscal effect on local governments, with an adjustment period lasting up to 20 years. The Government Accountability Office found that job recovery in affected communities varied widely. The Office of Economic Adjustment provides assistance to communities impacted by Defense program changes. Economic growth is a key issue that impacts the entire economy. Economic growth is influenced by both demand and supply factors, with macroeconomic policies affecting household consumption, business investment, government spending, and trade balance on the demand side. On the supply side, microeconomic policies impact labor productivity, innovation, and efficient use of labor and capital. Government policies such as taxes, education, research, and immigration also play a role in shaping the economy. Tax policy, although important for industrial competitiveness, is not discussed in this analysis. The 2010 National Security Strategy of the United States emphasizes the importance of economic growth to national security, as demonstrated during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. Director of National Intelligence Dennis C. Blair highlighted that the global economic crisis posed a significant security threat due to instability in countries, impacting U.S. allies and friends' ability to meet defense and humanitarian obligations. This report focuses on U.S. economic growth sources, which also promote growth in other countries. Economic growth is crucial for national security, as seen during the global financial crisis. Increasing worker productivity through education and training is key. Knowledge is a valuable tool for economic and security benefits, relying on skilled and educated workers. Education also impacts national security by enhancing understanding of foreign countries and cultures. Technical and engineering education provides workers who can contribute to security through technology. The United States aims to improve education at all levels to enhance national security, focusing on technological innovation, engineering skills, and a comprehensive approach to education. The goal is to lead in higher education with the highest proportion of college graduates by 2020, supported by federal programs from early childhood to adulthood. Congressional efforts are underway to enact legislation and support education initiatives. Federal support for education in the United States spans from early childhood to adulthood, with legislation enacted by Congress in the 1960s. This support includes programs for early childhood education, elementary and secondary education, career and technical education, postsecondary education, and adult education and job training. Various forms of support, such as grant programs and tax provisions, are provided for early childhood programs, including dedicated funding sources for child care services. Support for early childhood education has traditionally been separate from general education programs for older children and youth. Federal support for education in the United States includes programs for early childhood education, elementary and secondary education, and adult education. The largest federal funding source for early childhood education is the Head Start program. Congress has shown interest in integrating early childhood education programs into traditional elementary schools. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) and the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) support elementary and secondary education through various strategies, such as compensatory education programs and civil rights statutes. The Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 1998 (Perkins Act; P.L. 105-332) provides federal funding for vocational education programs at the high school and postsecondary levels. Vocational courses at the high school level can be categorized into consumer and homemaking education, general labor market preparation, and occupational preparation. At the postsecondary level, community colleges offer vocational courses in areas like computer programming and engineering technology. Federal postsecondary education programs include federal student aid programs, federal tax benefits, and veterans' education assistance programs. The federal government also supports postsecondary education through targeted programs, providing direct assistance to institutions serving low-income and minority populations. The Higher Education Act (HEA) supports low-income and minority individuals in increasing their educational attainment. It also provides support for workforce training in fields like teaching and science. The Workforce Investment Act (WIA) aims to coordinate federal workforce development programs and funds job training programs to prepare individuals for the labor market. WIA also supports literacy programs through the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA). The National Security Strategy (NSS) aims to ensure national security by providing a \"complete and competitive\" education for all Americans, focusing on supporting early childhood, elementary, secondary, and postsecondary education. The NSS sets a measurable goal to restore U.S. leadership in higher education by leading the world in the proportion of college graduates by 2020. The National Security Strategy (NSS) aims to improve education from early childhood to postsecondary level, with a goal to increase the proportion of college graduates by 2020. However, there is concern that focusing solely on college readiness may neglect job training and worker retraining programs needed for high-demand skills in the workforce. The National Security Strategy emphasizes the importance of job training programs and high-demand skills in emerging industries for national security. However, there is a lack of clear measurable objectives for these programs. The 2010 NSS includes STEM education provisions, but policymakers are still debating how to ensure a capable scientific and technological workforce. Various CRS reports delve into these issues in more detail. American innovations in science and technology have been crucial for national prosperity and power. However, concerns have been raised about the nation's historic edge in these fields due to weaknesses in STEM education and increasing competition from other countries. The U.S. STEM education system faces challenges with student achievement in science and mathematics, as well as lower STEM degree attainment compared to other nations. Concerns also arise from achievement gaps among demographic groups, indicating potential issues for the future workforce and innovation capacity. The 2008 nationwide mathematics test showed a 21-point difference between white and Hispanic 17-year-olds. President Obama's 2010 National Security Strategy emphasizes investing in STEM education to strengthen national security and prosperity, particularly for underrepresented groups. This shift in policy marks a departure from previous administrations. The STEM education provisions in the President's 2010 National Security Strategy align with existing federal policies aimed at improving U.S. economic competitiveness through STEM education. Congressional support for the America COMPETES Act reflects a similar position, although federal STEM education policies remain contentious. The STEM education provisions in the President's 2010 National Security Strategy align with existing federal policies aimed at improving U.S. economic competitiveness. However, opinions vary on how to implement these objectives, with disagreements on whether the issue lies on the supply or demand side of the U.S. scientific and technological workforce. Policymakers focus on increasing the supply of STEM-trained workers through reforms in STEM teaching and financial aid for college students. Some analysts argue that the U.S. STEM education system may produce too many scientists, leading to surpluses in some fields and shortages in others. They suggest policies to address demand side factors, such as increasing tenure-track jobs and grants for early-career scientists. There are debates on the value of STEM education data and its interpretation for policymaking. Reformers call for an overhaul of the system based on poor student performance in math and science tests, while others argue that the U.S. produces both high- and low-scoring students. The U.S. is a top producer of high- and low-scoring students in STEM education. Policy responses target low-performing students, with debates on reform within general education. Coordination and scale of federal STEM programs are questioned, with various policy options proposed. However, uncertainty exists due to a lack of definitive research on underlying assumptions. The United States aims to enhance international education and exchange to succeed in the global economy. The Administration proposes supporting programs that promote foreign language study and intercultural affairs, as well as welcoming more foreign students. The federal investment in international exchange and training was over $1.5 billion in FY2008, with 250 programs administered by various government agencies. In FY2008, over 2.4 million people participated in international exchange programs, with 45% of U.S. participants in programs administered by the State Department. The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs oversees these programs, including the Citizen Exchange and Fulbright Programs. Despite federally sponsored programs, the number of Americans studying abroad independently is significantly higher, with 262,416 U.S. students studying abroad in the 2007-2008 school year. The number of students studying abroad has significantly increased over the years, with federal programs supporting foreign language and area studies at U.S. colleges and universities. The growth in foreign language bachelor's degrees awarded since the 1960s is attributed to federal assistance. Bachelor's degrees in foreign languages increased from 4,527 in 1959-1960 to 20,977 in 2007-2008, while area studies degrees also saw an increase. Since the Immigration Act of 1924, the U.S. has allowed foreign students to study in its institutions through F, M, and J visas. The number of non-immigrants admitted has more than doubled in the past two decades, with 654,835 visas issued in FY2009. These proposals in the NSS prioritize international education and exchange for deeper ties with foreign publics and understanding of American society. The National Security Strategy (NSS) emphasizes the importance of international education and exchange for building deeper ties with foreign publics and understanding American society. The NSS does not provide specific policy recommendations but supports current federal programs in this area. Concerns about program coordination and duplication of efforts have led to the establishment of the IAWG to conduct a \"duplication assessment.\" The analysis by the IAWG found that federal international exchange and training programs are specific in theme, geography, and target audience, reducing the risk of duplication. Interagency funding transfers promote transparency and coordination. U.S. students studying abroad have increased, with over half going to Europe, followed by Latin America and Asia. In 2007-2008, Europe was the second largest destination for U.S. students at 15.3%, followed by Asia at 11.1%. Study in Europe decreased by six percentage points since 1988-89, replaced by a five percentage point increase in travel to Asia. Meanwhile, study in the Middle East dropped from 2.8% to 1.3% in 2007-2008. Concerns have been raised about influencing students' study destinations and language choices for national security reasons. The number of bachelor's degrees awarded in major European languages has declined, with Spanish experiencing the most growth. Non-European languages like Chinese and Arabic have seen notable gains. Despite this, the total number of degrees in European languages still surpasses all other world languages combined. There is a call for more federal support to build capacity in non-European languages due to current security concerns. The United States has seen an increase in foreign students entering the country for academic and cultural exchange programs. The United States is attracting more foreign students, with the largest number of F-1 visas in 2008 going to students from China, South Korea, and India. Some believe that foreign students limit opportunities for American students, while others argue that they fill high-demand slots and contribute to U.S. competitiveness. The 2010 NSS emphasizes the importance of welcoming skilled professionals through comprehensive immigration reform to balance security and openness. There is a consensus that the U.S. immigration system is broken, but efforts to reform it have failed in the past. The challenge of reforming legal immigration in the U.S. involves balancing the needs of employers for foreign workers, families wanting to reunite, and stakeholders seeking policy improvements. Current U.S. immigration policy is based on principles such as family reunification, skilled immigrant admission, refugee protection, and diversity in admissions. The Immigration and Nationality Act sets limits and preferences for permanent immigration. Legal permanent residents are foreign nationals living permanently in the U.S. In FY2009, 1.1 million immigrants were admitted. In FY2009, 1.1 million aliens became Legal Permanent Residents (LPRs) of the United States, with employment-based LPRs accounting for 12.7%. Most LPRs entered based on family ties, and annual admission of employment-based preference immigrants is limited to 140,000. LPR admissions for employment-based preferences have exceeded ceilings in recent years, with a rise in extraordinary and exceptional categories in FY2008. In FY2008, employment-based LPRs in extraordinary and exceptional categories increased, especially among those with advanced degrees. Despite a decrease to 126,874 employment-based LPRs in FY2009, the first preference extraordinary category saw a slight rise. The number of skilled and unskilled LPRs in FY2009 was the lowest since FY1999. The INA allows for the temporary admission of nonimmigrants for specific purposes, including tourists, students, and temporary workers. Various visas like H-1B, H-2A, and H-2B are available for temporary workers, while O visas are for individuals with extraordinary abilities in specific fields. Foreign nationals can enter the United States on various temporary employment-based visas such as O, P, R, B-1, E, J, Q, and L visas. The number of temporary employment-based visas issued peaked in FY2007 at 1.3 million but dropped to 1.1 million in FY2009. Visas for H and NAFTA workers decreased by 33.4%, E and L visas by 18.7%, and J and Q visas by 8.1% during this period. The Congress is considering whether to continue incremental reforms in immigration, focusing on skilled migration and temporary worker visas, or to comprehensively reform the law. There are calls for a shift from family-based to employment-based visas or an increase in legal immigration. Some suggest limiting employment-based LPRs to exceptional individuals. Concerns are raised about labor shortages in certain sectors affecting the pace of immigration. Business people are concerned about labor scarcity potentially hindering economic growth. A legislative response includes increasing temporary foreign workers, both skilled and unskilled. Opponents argue against this, citing lack of evidence for labor shortages and negative effects on U.S. workers during economic downturns. Some suggest scaling back temporary foreign worker visas during economic recessions. Attention is on recruiting skilled foreign workers to the U.S., with proposals for expedited pathways for STEM students to become permanent residents. Michael Teitelbaum of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation raises concerns about labor market needs. The vice president of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation has highlighted an oversupply of scientists and engineers graduating from U.S. universities. Different perspectives exist on the effectiveness of current labor market tests for hiring foreign workers. Some advocate for more flexible approaches based on national economic needs, while others focus on individual employer preferences. The OECD states that immigration laws and labor market protections are not the main factors for talented migrants. Highly skilled individuals are attracted by economic incentives, research infrastructure, working with top scientists, and freedom to debate. The US excels in these areas. Labor market tests for hiring foreign workers aim to prevent employer abuses rather than influence migration decisions. Despite having enough educated individuals, the US still faces challenges in meeting its 21st-century needs. Investing in research and expanding international science partnerships are crucial for economic growth and national security. President Obama's National Security Strategy emphasizes the importance of research and development (R&D) in addressing national challenges and securing economic advantages for the United States. Key national security issues such as energy independence and space capabilities rely on innovation and development in these areas. The President emphasizes the need to reverse the decline in federal funding for research and highlights the importance of maintaining the nation's strength in science and technology. Private initiatives are encouraged to support technological innovation for economic growth and job creation. Governments worldwide have increased funding for research and development (R&D) to stimulate economic growth and improve standards of living. OECD member countries saw a 79% increase in R&D funding between 1997 and 2007, with developing countries experiencing even higher growth rates. The United States leads in both total national R&D and government R&D funding. The United States leads in government-funded R&D, accounting for one-third of global funding. In 2007, U.S. government funding for R&D was $105.6 billion. The federal government plays a significant role in funding basic research (57%) and applied research (32%), supporting technological innovation and the development of new products and services across various scientific and engineering fields. The Federal government plays a significant role in funding R&D, supporting missions of agencies like Department of Defense, NIH, NASA, and Department of Energy. There is bipartisan support for federal funding for research and innovation, with Vannevar Bush's report shaping post-WWII research investment. Federal R&D was mainly focused on national defense after the war. Vannevar Bush's report in response to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's inquiry outlined the importance of scientific progress in meeting economic, national security, and social needs. It recommended the Federal Government take on new responsibilities to promote scientific knowledge and talent, leading to the establishment of the National Science Foundation in 1950. This initiative aimed to utilize research infrastructure established during wartime for peacetime benefits. The federal R&D budget has evolved over time in response to national challenges like World War II, the Cold War, Space Race, and more recently, competition from countries like Japan, China, and India. \"Investing in research\" has been a long-standing federal policy with widespread support. The federal R&D budget has seen significant growth over the past 60 years, with federal outlays for R&D increasing more than 20 times in constant dollars. There is a consensus for increased investment, with President Obama, President George W. Bush, and Congress all seeking to double funding for selected agencies conducting research. President Obama has set a national goal for R&D investment of 3% of the nation's GDP, requiring substantial increases in both government and industrial funding. Some support increased government and industrial funding for R&D, but concerns exist about rapid development in emerging technologies like nanotechnology and biotechnology. Divergent views include allocation of funds, pace of research, and potential societal effects. Disagreements in research funding include disciplines, project sizes, types of organizations involved, risk levels, mission focus, geographical balance, controversial issues, international coordination, and technology commercialization. President Obama's R&D funding record has faced opposition due to concerns about government inefficiency, market interference, and taxpayer subsidies for profitable companies. The funding approach has been criticized as \"corporate welfare\" and for favoring certain technologies and industries. President Obama's R&D funding record has faced opposition due to concerns about government inefficiency, market interference, and taxpayer subsidies for profitable companies. The President's FY2010 and FY2011 R&D requests saw small increases, but analysis is complicated by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) providing billions of dollars in R&D funding. The President's National Security Strategy claims the largest infusion to basic science research in American history, possibly referring to the $13.3 billion in FY2009 ARRA funding. The President's National Security Strategy emphasizes the need to reverse the decline in federal funding for research. Data from the National Science Foundation and the Office of Management and Budget does not support this trend. Concerns about flat or declining funding for physical science and engineering research have led to calls for increased funding. President Bush initiated efforts to bolster funding in 2006. President Bush initiated efforts in 2006 to double research funding for key agencies focused on physical science and engineering disciplines. President Obama also aimed to double funding by 2017, but actual increases fell short of the required rate. Concerns remain about the effectiveness of federal research funding in stimulating economic growth and job creation. Federal research funding plays a crucial role in stimulating U.S. economic growth and job creation. Historically, the time required for research to translate into new products has been lengthy. The U.S. dominance in global R&D has decreased over time, with federal funding no longer driving global technology development pathways as it once did. Today, concerns persist about the effectiveness of federal research funding in generating near-term commercial results. The U.S. federal research investment has declined in global significance as other investors have grown rapidly. Global competitors are accessing and benefiting from U.S. research results, leading to increased options for U.S. companies to conduct work outside the country. The decline in U.S. federal research investment has led to global competitors benefiting from U.S. research results, allowing U.S. companies to conduct work outside the country. The 2010 National Security Strategy emphasizes the need for the U.S. to transition to clean energy technologies to avoid energy dependence and enhance national security and economic prosperity. The United States aims to become a global leader in clean energy technologies and production to avoid importing these technologies later. The National Security Strategy highlights the benefits of clean energy, such as economic growth, job creation, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Transitioning to clean energy will take time, but using transitional fuels is encouraged as investment in next-generation technologies progresses. The current economic infrastructure relies heavily on fossil fuels for transportation. The United States heavily relies on fossil fuels for transportation, electricity generation, home heating, and industrial processes. The infrastructure to produce and deliver these fuels represents a significant capital investment. Volatility in fuel prices or availability can impact macroeconomic activity and external costs like climate change. Crude oil prices have been volatile in recent years. Oil prices were volatile from 2008-2010, reaching a peak of over $142 per barrel in July 2008 and dropping to less than $40 per barrel by January 2009. In 2010, prices ranged from $70 to $85 per barrel. The U.S. consumed over 19 million barrels of crude oil per day in 2010, with 30% produced domestically. Despite no supply disruptions in the U.S., economic growth in China and India led to tight market conditions. High oil prices and large import requirements impacted U.S. international trade. Since the 1970s, potential supply disruptions in oil markets due to international political issues have impacted the U.S. trade deficit. Nigerian rebels disrupt oil shipments, Iran's nuclear weapons development threatens Persian Gulf supplies, and Iraq's security issues hinder oil exports. Coal production in the U.S. is mostly domestic, with stable prices but concerns over carbon emissions and climate change. The natural gas market is facing economic uncertainty for producers despite favorable conditions for consumers. New discoveries of shale gas and other non-conventional sources have increased domestic production and reserves. Producers are experiencing weakening prices due to oversupply, leading to cycles of low and high prices. The transition to a clean energy economy will require significant investments and may result in economic gains and losses. The transition to a clean energy economy will require significant investments and a fundamental reassessment of products and infrastructure. Government-financed research and technology development will play a role, but the ultimate test will be the economic viability of new energy sources compared to fossil fuels. The substitutability of energy sources in various final uses will be a key factor in the success of the transition. The transition to a clean energy economy will require significant investments and a reassessment of products and infrastructure. The cost and time of transitioning to a new energy source depend on the ability to use existing infrastructure. For example, replacing gasoline with a new fuel would require a new distribution system parallel to the existing one. Eventually, transitioning to an electricity-based system would make the oil-based infrastructure obsolete. The transition to renewable energy will render existing oil-based infrastructure obsolete, impacting vehicle fleets and electricity generation. National policy choices will determine the use of coal reserves and employment implications. A decentralized electric system, possibly based on solar energy, could make current generating facilities redundant. The transition to renewable energy will make current generating facilities redundant, impacting jobs in traditional energy industries. It is uncertain whether new jobs in clean energy will offset job losses, and the skill requirements may differ. Domestic sourcing of clean energy sources could lower costs, reducing reliance on imported oil and petroleum products. The U.S. defense budget may be tied to securing oil supplies, with potential savings exceeding reduced oil import costs. Transitioning to cleaner fuels can reduce carbon emissions more directly than capturing and treating pollutants from fossil fuels. Past government leadership in energy transition has not been successful in achieving desired results. The leadership in energy transition has not been successful in achieving desired results. Subsidies for shale oil, solar energy, and other alternatives have not met the market test. The 2010 NSS emphasizes the importance of U.S. space capabilities in global commerce, scientific achievements, and national security. Investments in space technology R&D, strengthening the space industrial base, and collaboration with universities are needed to maintain these benefits. The National Space Policy (NSP) aims to strengthen U.S. leadership in space-related science, technology, and industry by promoting technology development, improving industrial capacity, and maintaining a robust supplier base. This includes encouraging the commercial space sector and collaborating with universities to encourage students to pursue space-related careers. The NSP also directs federal departments and agencies to invest in technology R&D and strengthen the space industrial base. The National Space Policy (NSP) focuses on increasing NASA funding for space technology development and supporting the commercial space sector. Concerns have been raised about the state of the U.S. space launch industry and access to space for commercial satellites. The NSP lacks an \"executable strategy\" to address these issues, with critics noting similarities to previous administrations' policies. The National Space Policy aims to increase NASA funding for space technology and support the commercial space sector. However, concerns have been raised about the lack of a clear strategy to address issues in the U.S. space launch industry and access to space for commercial satellites. Congressional attention is focused on the end of the space shuttle program and the proposed termination of NASA's Constellation program. An Administration budget amendment in June 2010 proposed transferring $100 million from NASA to the Departments of Commerce and Labor to stimulate economic growth and job creation in the Florida Space Coast and other affected areas. The National Space Policy focuses on increasing NASA funding for space technology and supporting the commercial space sector. Concerns have been raised about the lack of a clear strategy for the U.S. space launch industry and access to space for commercial satellites. The policy also emphasizes the importance of U.S. space capabilities for national security interests and promoting security and stability in space through cooperation with allies and pursuing peaceful uses of space. The Obama Administration's approach stresses greater international cooperation compared to previous administrations. The Obama Administration's National Space Policy emphasizes international cooperation to ensure the use of space for all responsible parties and protect U.S. assets in space for national security interests. Efforts include promoting safe operations, improving information sharing to avoid collisions, enhancing protection of critical space systems, and mitigating orbital debris. These measures are already in place or underway in the U.S. national security space environment. The Obama Administration's National Space Policy focuses on international cooperation to minimize orbital debris and protect U.S. national security assets in space. Efforts include developing industry standards, conducting research, and enhancing collaboration between various U.S. agencies and foreign nations. The Administration also aims to explore space-related arms control measures for national security enhancement. The Obama Administration's National Space Policy aims to enhance national security through international cooperation, industry standards, and research to minimize orbital debris. While some arms control measures have been considered, there is no broad agreement in place. The Administration has not shown clear support for specific arms control treaties proposed by other countries. The 2008 Conference on Disarmament highlighted the importance of international agreements like 'codes of conduct' or 'rules of the road' in the current interconnected global economy. The U.S. economy and national security are heavily influenced by global financial markets, trade imbalances, exchange rates, and government interventions. Perceptions of the United States in other countries also impact national security. The impact of perceptions of the United States in other countries and global ideologies on national security is significant. Analysts point to the clash of civilizations and the threat of non-state militant Islam terrorists as key sources of conflict. Addressing causes of unrest abroad, such as poverty and human rights abuses, can enhance U.S. security. Improving human rights, especially for women, is linked to democracy development. Democracy and peace are interconnected, but require cultural and political support. U.S. economic assistance and diplomatic efforts play a role in addressing these issues. In this section of the report, the focus is on international economic aspects of national security, addressing issues like instability in the global economy, savings and exports, opening markets abroad, increasing domestic demand in China, building cooperative arrangements with international partners, deterring threats to the international financial system, and human rights and democracy. The global financial crisis of 2008-2009 emphasized the interconnectedness of world financial markets, national economies, and the importance of regulations to prevent systemic failures. The global financial crisis of 2008-2009 highlighted the risks of inadequate regulations for new financial instruments and practices, as well as the dangers of trading risky assets without sufficient capital reserves. The crisis led to a global recession, increased unemployment, loss of wealth, home foreclosures, bankruptcies, and deficits in government budgets. Dennis Blair, the Director of U.S. National Intelligence, warned about the security implications of the crisis. The global financial crisis and its geopolitical implications are the primary near-term security concern for the United States. The longer the recovery takes to begin, the greater the risk of serious damage to U.S. strategic interests. Despite measures taken to reform financial sectors and strengthen international institutions, industrialized economies still face low growth rates and high unemployment. Debt crises in Greece and Ireland in 2010 exposed the fragility of the economic recovery. The financial crisis in the fall of 2010 exposed the fragility of the economic recovery in industrialized countries due to a housing bubble, excessive borrowing, and lack of regulation. Countries globally intervened to contain the contagion and restore confidence in the system. The financial crisis in 2010 highlighted the effects of the global recession and flight of capital from emerging markets. Changes were made to the financial system to reduce risk and prevent future crises. The fear for Europe is the sovereign debt crises in Greece and Ireland. Congress plays a multifaceted role in responding to the crisis, focusing on ensuring the smooth functioning of financial markets while protecting taxpayer interests and facilitating business operations. In 2010, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and other measures to address systemic risk, Federal Reserve emergency authority, resolution regime for failing firms, securitization, and shadow banking. Congress also plays a role in reforming the international financial system and providing economic and humanitarian assistance to countries in need. In 2010, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to address systemic risk, Federal Reserve emergency authority, resolution regime for failing firms, securitization, shadow banking, consolidation of bank supervision, consumer financial protection, derivatives, credit rating agencies, investor protection, hedge funds, executive compensation, insurance, extension of unemployment benefits, cash for clunkers, mortgages, and international financial institutions. The G-20 and Financial Stability Board coordinate reforms at the international level, while the IMF focuses on global systemic stability and the World Bank works on poverty alleviation, trade, microfinance, and governance reform. The representation for emerging market economies includes issues such as political turmoil, protectionist measures, and fiscal restraints. China's growing presence in the global economy poses a potential threat to U.S. national security. China, with a strong economy and confidence in its development model, has become more assertive in international affairs and military activities. The 2010 NSS emphasizes the importance of increasing exports through saving more, spending less, and reforming the financial system to reduce the budget deficit. The goal is to double U.S. exports. The NSS emphasizes the goal of doubling U.S. exports by 2014 as an employment strategy to support American jobs. Advanced economies adopted fiscal stimulus measures after the 2008-2009 financial crisis, leading to increased government debts and calls for rebalancing saving and consumption. Financial turmoil in European countries has pressured governments to adopt austerity measures. Some governments are promoting exports to spur their economies instead of relying on fiscal stimulus measures to boost domestic consumption. However, increasing exports can lead to pressure on exchange rates and concerns about competitive devaluations. The relationship between exports, employment, and national savings is complex and generates debate. Trade is a topic of debate in the economy, with some advocating for free trade while others argue that imports can harm jobs and communities. Trade allows nations to maximize goods and services for their citizens, enhancing their standard of living. Nations specialize in certain goods and trade to serve their national interests. Nations specialize in producing certain goods and trade with others to obtain goods they do not produce efficiently. Trade is believed to increase welfare by improving production efficiency and expanding consumer choices. However, total jobs and wages are primarily influenced by the macroeconomic environment, not just trade alone. In the current global economy, trade involves a complex set of transactions including goods, services, and financial products. Nations with surplus savings can lend to those with deficits, linking economies closely. Foreign capital inflows in the U.S. help keep interest rates low and allow for spending beyond current output, supporting trade. Capital mobility and inflows allow nations to spend beyond current output and finance trade deficits. Demand for U.S. assets affects the exchange value of the dollar, impacting prices of goods and altering the trade balance. The dollar's value reacts to economic and political events globally due to its prominent role in international economic activities. The dollar's exchange value can fluctuate due to international economic activities. A survey in 2010 showed that daily foreign exchange trading totaled $6.5 trillion, impacting the global economy significantly. The U.S. dollar plays a significant role in the global economy, with 85% of foreign exchange turnover in U.S. dollars. Increasing domestic saving in the U.S. economy could reduce reliance on foreign capital, leading to a weaker dollar in international markets. This would make U.S. exports more competitive, potentially shifting production and employment towards export goods. The 2010 National Security Strategy emphasizes the need for greater domestic demand abroad to achieve balanced global economic growth and create opportunities for U.S. producers. This rebalancing is crucial to prevent a repeat of the global economic crisis caused by imbalances in savings. The global economic crisis was largely sparked by imbalances in savings, investment, and trade flows. Nations with high savings rates, especially in Asia, need to rely more on domestic consumption than exporting for GDP growth. China, as the world's most populous nation and second largest economy, plays a central role in achieving balanced economic growth and creating new sources of external demand for the U.S. economy. Chinese economic policies are seen as a significant cause of global imbalances. The United States has low gross savings rates compared to China, with U.S. savings declining from 13.5% to 8.7% of GDP from 1990 to 2009, while China's rose from 37.8% to 50.5%. The U.S. does not save enough to fund its investment needs and must borrow from abroad, while China has excess savings. In 2008, the U.S. had the lowest ratio of gross domestic savings to gross investment among major economies at 66.9%, while China had one of the highest at 122.2%. In 2008, the United States had the world's largest current account deficit at $706 billion, while China had the largest current account surplus at $426 billion. Private consumption accounted for 70% of U.S. GDP growth, compared to 35.3% for China. Analysis by the IMF showed that fixed investment and net exports contributed over 60% to China's GDP growth from 2001 to 2008. China's GDP growth from 2001 to 2008 was significantly higher than that of G-7 countries, the euro area, and the rest of Asia. Economists argue that China's economic policies have led to over-investment in tradable goods, suppressing domestic consumption. The central bank intervenes in foreign exchange markets to keep the renminbi undervalued, making Chinese exports cheaper. China holds the world's largest foreign exchange reserves, with a large portion in U.S. dollar assets. China holds a large share of its foreign exchange reserves in U.S. dollar assets, with a significant portion invested in U.S. Treasury securities. This investment has been linked to artificially low U.S. interest rates, contributing to the U.S. housing bubble and global financial crisis. In response to the economic slowdown, China implemented a $586 billion stimulus program focused on infrastructure development and loose monetary policies. China's focus on infrastructure development and loose monetary policies boosted domestic demand and maintained healthy economic growth during the global recession. The government plans to rely more on domestic consumption for GDP growth, improve infrastructure, education, energy efficiency, and social safety nets. They pledged a $124.4 billion plan for universal healthcare by 2020. China plans to establish universal healthcare by 2020, but concerns remain about its export-oriented economic policies. The government allowed its currency to appreciate in 2010, impacting global trade. Critics argue that China's currency policy harms other economies and hinders global economic recovery. China defends its actions, stating that its imports have increased faster than its exports. China counters that its imports have risen faster than exports in the first half of 2010, contributing to global economic recovery. Chinese officials emphasize their trade policy aims to foster domestic economic stability, not favor exports. They fear rapid currency appreciation could weaken export industries and lead to layoffs, viewing economic stability as crucial for political stability. Implementing major economic reforms could stimulate domestic demand and promote healthy economic growth. Implementing major economic reforms in China could stimulate domestic demand, leading to healthy economic growth and increased demand for foreign imports. This could improve living standards in both China and the United States through increased exports. The Obama Administration aims to open foreign markets for U.S. goods and services through multilateral and bilateral trade agreements. The Obama Administration aims to maintain open U.S. markets to foreign goods and services to promote competition and innovation. They acknowledge the adjustment costs faced by some workers and firms due to increased foreign competition. The Administration's domestic agenda includes promoting innovation, infrastructure development, healthcare reform, and education reform to assist with these adjustments. The NSS objective of \"open markets to U.S. products and services\" aligns with the goal of achieving balanced and sustainable growth. It acknowledges that open markets promote economic welfare but also recognizes that benefits may not be evenly distributed. This objective reaffirms the longstanding U.S. trade policy and the efforts to liberalize trade under the World Trade Organization. The World Trade Organization (WTO) aims to liberalize trade among 153 economies, leading to the US forming free trade agreements with 17 countries. Research shows that trade blocs and FTAs reduce disputes and hostilities between members. Free trade agreements also promote the rule of law, fight corruption, and enhance democratic accountability. The Obama Administration's trade strategy focuses on gaining market access for U.S. goods and services through fulfilling commitments under WTO and FTAs, addressing concerns from previous administrations, and pursuing new initiatives. Using trade laws, they aim to open foreign markets and protect U.S. firms and workers. Notable actions include addressing unfair trade practices, such as the case of U.S. tire imports from China in 2009. Obama determined that Chinese tires were causing market disruption for U.S. producers and imposed additional duties for three years. This was the first time a President had made such a decision under section 421 of the Trade Act of 1974. Some U.S. trading partners criticized the U.S. for not complying with WTO rulings on antidumping duties and subsidies, allowing for countermeasures like increased tariffs. The Bush Administration completed negotiations on three FTAs with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea under the Trade Promotion Authority before it expired in 2007. Concerns about violence against labor union leaders in Colombia, Panamanian tax laws, and market access in South Korea have delayed congressional action on these agreements. The Obama Administration initially delayed action on pending trade agreements with South Korea, focusing on economic recovery and healthcare reform. However, in 2010, President Obama expressed the need to strengthen trade ties with Asia, including South Korea, and announced efforts to resolve issues with the KORUS FTA. President Obama announced plans to present Congress with implementing legislation for the KORUS FTA after reaching agreement on modifications with South Korea in November 2010. The Administration also expressed intentions to address pending FTAs with Colombia and Panama as issues are resolved. The Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) is a free trade agreement involving nations on both sides of the Pacific, including Brunei, Chile, New Zealand, and Singapore. The United States, Australia, Peru, and Vietnam have committed to joining. President Obama committed the U.S. to engage with TPP countries in 2009 to create a comprehensive free trade framework for the 21st century. The TPP aims to build ties with the Asian-Pacific region and serve U.S. economic interests. Views on the value of trade liberalization and trade agreements in the 21st century diverge, with some ambivalence and skepticism among the American public. While the U.S. business community generally supports trade agreements, there is a belief that trade agreements cost American jobs, especially in import-sensitive industries like textiles. The American public has mixed views on trade liberalization and trade agreements. While the U.S. business community generally supports trade agreements, some industries like textiles oppose them. Congress reflects public ambivalence on trade policy, with skepticism especially evident in the House of Representatives. Support for trade liberalization in Congress has declined over the years. The TRADE Act of 2009 calls for a review of current FTAs and a halt to future negotiations. The 2010 National Security Strategy emphasizes cooperation with international partners for balanced growth. Challenges in cooperation include ad hoc planning and little enforcement. Emerging-market countries are playing a larger role in the international financial architecture. Emerging-market countries have grown rapidly, increased participation in international trade and finance, and boosted foreign exchange reserves. The international financial architecture is slowly adapting to their rising importance. The NSS supports increasing representation of emerging markets in the global economy, aligning with changes already in progress. The G-20 process, gaining prominence post-global financial crisis, is backed by the NSS for economic discussions at the leader level. The G-7/G-8, a small group of advanced countries, expanded to include emerging-market countries in the G-20 after the global financial crisis. The G-20 has since become the premier forum for international economic cooperation, replacing the G-7/G-8's role. While some support this expansion, others have reservations about the arbitrary nature of G-20 membership. Some argue that G-20 membership is arbitrary and excludes important emerging-market countries, under-represents sub-Saharan Africa, and has a disproportionate number of European members. Concerns have been raised about expanding economic discussions to such a diverse group undermining international economic cooperation. The NSS supports increasing representation of emerging markets at the World Bank and IMF, referencing commitments made by G-20 leaders to shift voting power. IMF quota reform is facing controversy. IMF quota reform is facing controversy as experts argue for more proportional representation based on countries' relative size in the world economy. The United States, considered underrepresented, has given up quotas over the years but retains veto power. G-20 leaders have pledged to shift voting power to increase representation of emerging markets at the IMF. The G-20 leaders pledged to reform IMF quota shares and ensure transparent selection processes for international financial institution heads. This may challenge the traditional Western European and U.S. dominance in leadership roles. The focus of U.S. leadership in the G-20 is on sustainable growth, financial sector reform, global economic development, and energy security. The G-20's \"Framework for Strong, Sustainable and Balanced Growth\" aims to correct global imbalances that contributed to the financial crisis. The G-20 and IMF collaborate on policy objectives and actions, but enforcement mechanisms are questioned. Financial sector regulation reform is crucial to prevent future crises. The G-20 focuses on regulatory reform in financial markets, with the United States leading in this area. The goal is to ensure consistent regulations globally to prevent capital outflows. Additionally, there are initiatives to support economic development in emerging and developing countries. The G-20 focuses on regulatory reform in financial markets, led by the United States, to prevent capital outflows. Initiatives include creating safety nets for volatile capital flows, narrowing the development gap, and engaging the private sector. At the Pittsburgh summit, leaders committed to eliminating fossil fuel subsidies, supported by the Obama Administration. However, eliminating these subsidies may be challenging, especially in low-and middle-income countries where political reasons may hinder progress. The 2010 NSS identifies as a national security priority the goal of denying illicit actors access to the international financial system. Illicit activities include money laundering, trade fraud, financing terrorism, and looting government funds. India and Indonesia saw protests over political issues. Eliminating fossil fuel subsidies in rich countries may face obstacles like opposition from the oil industry and requiring congressional approval. Illicit actors may use the international financial system to store criminal proceeds or fund illicit activities. The volume of dirty money circulating in the system is vast, although exact estimates are unavailable. U.S. administrations have prioritized combating threats to the international financial system as a national security goal for over a decade, with policies evolving to address new financial threats while remaining consistent with past goals. U.S. efforts to protect the international financial system from illicit threats have evolved over time, with an increase in programs, resources, and personnel. The strategic context has shifted, with a focus on non-state transnational security problems like money laundering, drug trafficking, terrorism, and arms trafficking. The Clinton Administration's 1999 NSS identified transnational threats like terrorism, arms trafficking, and migrant smuggling as top security concerns. Measures included standardizing laws for financial institutions and improving international law enforcement cooperation. President George W. Bush's 2002 and 2006 NSS focused on terrorist financing post-9/11, framing threats to the financial system in that context. New counter-terrorist financing programs were developed in response. The Bush Administration expanded its focus on terrorist financing to include other threats like proliferation finance, money laundering, and corruption in 2006. The goals included identifying and blocking funding sources for terrorism, freezing terrorists' assets, and protecting legitimate charities from abuse. President Barack Obama's 2010 NSS prioritizes combating threats to the international financial system, targeting illicit financial activity by corrupt foreign politicians and countries seeking nuclear technologies through smuggling networks. This builds upon previous U.S. government strategies issued during the Bush Administration, such as the National Drug Control Strategy and the U.S. Law Enforcement Strategy to Combat International Organized Crime. The 2007 National Money Laundering Strategy, 2006 U.S. Strategy to Internationalize Efforts Against Kleptocracy, and 2006 National Strategy to Combat Terrorism focused on freezing criminal assets, expanding financial regulatory tools, and promoting international information sharing. U.S. policy enhancements include section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act allowing special banking regulatory measures. The Department is applying enhanced banking regulatory requirements, known as \"special measures,\" against designated jurisdictions, financial institutions, and international transactions involved in criminal or terrorist financing activities. This includes developing international regulatory standards and procedures through the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and expanding international law enforcement cooperation through initiatives like the Egmont Group and Trade Transparency Units. The Department is enhancing international cooperation in combating trade-based money laundering, political corruption, and bulk cash smuggling. This includes establishing task forces, supporting initiatives like the Stolen Asset Recovery (StAR) Initiative, and applying targeted financial sanctions through the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC). The Department of Treasury is providing foreign assistance to combat financial crimes, including supporting the development of legal frameworks and law enforcement capacity in other countries. They have also introduced threat finance cells in Iraq and Afghanistan to track and target financial flows associated with insurgent and terrorist activities. Additionally, the Department has reorganized offices to focus on countering the financing of terrorism, including the creation of the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence in 2005. The current Administration has not shown plans to update the 2005 money laundering threat assessment or revise the 2007 U.S. money laundering strategy. Questions arise about the balance of priorities in combating financial crimes and strengthening the international financial system. Policymakers may question how existing strategic guidance for combating financial crimes can address emerging threats and novel financing methods. Coordination of U.S. government resources across multiple agencies is crucial in protecting the international financial system. The U.S. is working to combat international financial crimes by improving coordination and aligning resources with strategic priorities. It is important to support democracy and human rights abroad for long-term national security, even if it means dealing with dictatorial governments. Economic assistance and cooperation in areas like science and technology are used to achieve U.S. goals related to political and human conditions in foreign countries. States must support democracy and human rights abroad for long-term national security, even when dealing with dictatorial governments. The NSS emphasizes the importance of promoting these values at home to strengthen them overseas, with both the U.S. government and private sector playing roles. It also highlights the need for effective partnerships with democracies and non-democracies, including key centers of influence like China, India, and Russia, to advance America's national interests. The Obama Administration is engaging with hostile nations and individuals to promote universal values, including strengthening democratic institutions and practicing principled engagement with non-democratic regimes. This includes working on counterterrorism, nonproliferation, and economic issues while seeking ways to advance U.S. interests.

The Obama Administration supports country programs promoting fair elections, voter awareness, and gender-based violence training in various countries. Critics note the absence of the word \"democracy\" in Obama's inaugural address, contrasting with past presidents. President Ronald Reagan's approach to democracy is criticized for not being strong enough, with concerns that the Obama Administration lacks a focus on promoting democracy and human rights in foreign policy. Critics worry that the administration's \"country-ownership\" philosophy could allow authoritarian governments to influence how U.S. tax dollars are spent on democracy and human rights programs. The foreign policy community is divided on the benefits of a whole-of-government approach to these activities. Some believe that having multiple agencies working on democracy and human rights activities could be confusing, while others think it would reinforce democracy's importance. Supporters of the 2010 National Security Strategy believe Obama is shifting from the previous administration's approach to repair any damage overseas. Obama takes a quieter stance on democracy promotion, mentioning it but not highlighting it as prominently as before. Supporters of Obama's approach to promoting universal values abroad believe it is more realistic and less aggressive than the previous administration. Concerns have been raised about the lack of discussion on the cost of democracy promotion and human rights programs.

The Office of the Director of Foreign Assistance (F Bureau) created by President Bush to coordinate State/USAID budget information and activities may weaken USAID. The Administration's focus is on sustainable development outcomes with economic growth, democratic governance, innovations, and meeting basic human needs. The future of the F Bureau is uncertain. The F Bureau plays a crucial role in coordinating development assistance budgets and program implementation.

Federal R&D activities can be agency-focused or initiated by the science community in response to specific requests or general solicitations. The 111th Congress examined international science and technology cooperation, with Senator Richard Lugar introducing a bill for U.S. Science Envoys. This bill aligned with the Administration's proposed guidelines and was reported out of the Senate Foreign Relations committee in May 2009. H.R. 1736, the International Science and Technology Cooperation Act of 2009, aimed to establish a committee to coordinate international science and technology cooperation. It passed the House but was not taken up in the Senate. The Obama Administration's focus on expanding international science partnerships through Science Envoys raises questions about the effectiveness of this approach and the allocation of U.S. S&T resources. This initiative aims to elevate the profile of U.S. efforts in creating scientific partnerships globally. The Obama Administration's initiative to expand international science partnerships through Science Envoys raises questions about the effective use of U.S. S&T resources and its impact on national security goals. The economy's role in national security considerations is highlighted through resource allocation and economic security measures.
