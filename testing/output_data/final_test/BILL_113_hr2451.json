    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Strengthening Entrepreneurs' Economic Development Act of 2013\" and includes a direct lending program for small business concerns. The \"Strengthening Entrepreneurs' Economic Development Act of 2013\" establishes a loan program through the Small Business Administration for eligible small businesses. Loans are capped at $150,000 with a repayment period of up to 6 years and no prepayment penalty. The maximum interest rate on loans under the program is regulated. The Administrator sets the maximum loan amount under the program at the rate prescribed by the Small Business Act plus 5 percent. Borrower fees are collected based on a formula established by the Administrator. Prudent underwriting standards must be issued within 180 days of the Act's enactment. Lenders are provided with each loan application submitted for review. The Administrator provides lenders with loan applications for originating, underwriting, closing, and servicing loans. Lenders eligible to participate in the program can receive these applications. Local lenders within 50 miles of the applicant's office are given priority, and if they decline, preferred lenders must process the application within 5 business days. The Administrator provides loan applications to lenders in the Preferred Lenders Program within 5 business days. If a lender does not agree to process the loan within 10 business days, the Administrator may consider the loan for origination. The Administrator may sell loans made under the program through public solicitation, ensuring they are not sold for less than 90% of the net present value. Unsold loans will be maintained and serviced by the Administrator. The Administrator may service loans not sold through asset sales, with definitions provided for \"Administrator,\" \"eligible small business concern,\" and \"small business concern.\" SEC. 3. FEE FOR HIGH-DOLLAR 7(A) LOANS. An amendment to Section 7(a) of the Small Business Act introduces a fee for loans exceeding $2,000,000 to cover the Administration's costs."
