    "content": "The Syrian government has accepted a Russian proposal to place its chemical weapons under international control, shifting the debate on how to respond to the chemical weapons attack and end the civil war. President Asad stated that Syria's decision was influenced by Russia, not U.S. threats. President Asad announced that Syria will send documents to join the international convention banning chemical weapons, despite U.S. threats. President Obama mentioned the positive developments, including Russia's willingness to work with the international community to persuade Assad to give up chemical weapons. The Assad regime has admitted to possessing these weapons and expressed willingness to join the Chemical Weapons Convention. The success of this initiative remains uncertain, and verification of Assad's compliance is crucial. President Assad has agreed to join the international convention banning chemical weapons, with Russia's support in persuading him. President Obama has postponed a vote on military force to pursue a diplomatic solution, sending Secretary of State Kerry to meet with Russia. A resolution at the U.N. Security Council will require Assad to give up and destroy his chemical weapons under international control. Authorization for limited military force against Assad is still being sought from Congress. The proposal for limited military force against the Assad regime is being considered by Congress, along with the potential for international control over Syria's chemical weapons. China, the UK, and France support the proposal, while Russia has rejected a binding UN resolution. US and Russian officials are set to discuss the proposal in Geneva. Some Syrian rebel leaders view the proposal as a delaying tactic and continue to call for international assistance. The Obama Administration has presented intelligence analysis on the Syrian government's chemical weapons program. President Obama presented intelligence analysis with \"high confidence\" that the Syrian government was responsible for a chemical weapons attack on civilians. He called it an assault on human dignity and requested Congress to authorize limited military operations against Syrian regime targets. The President emphasized that the operations would not involve boots on the ground. In response to a Russian disarmament proposal, he asked lawmakers to pause in their decision-making. President Obama requested lawmakers to pause in their consideration of legislation authorizing force in Syria following a Russian disarmament proposal. Debate continues among Congress members on authorization approaches and the disarmament initiative. Obama credits the threat of military action for the disarmament proposal and maintains military readiness in case diplomacy fails. The draft resolution authorizes the President to use the Armed Forces as necessary in response to chemical weapons or other mass destruction weapons in the conflict. Lawmakers in the Senate and House are considering alternative authorization proposals in response to the use of chemical weapons in Syria. Concerns have been raised about the scope and duration of potential military response. Some proposals may tie the authorization for the use of U.S. military force to criteria related to disarmament enforcement. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee debated an alternative resolution authorizing military force in Syria to deter chemical weapons use and prevent their transfer to terrorist groups. The House had not yet considered a similar proposal, but some members had introduced measures to restrict funds for military operations in Syria. The civil war in Syria continues despite ongoing government forces' actions. In Syria, the civil war persists as government forces prepare for potential U.S.-led military operations. President Bashar al Asad denies allegations of chemical weapons use and warns against external intervention. U.S. officials confirm Syrian government readiness but state that chemical weapons remain under regime control. Syrian officials seek UN Security Council action to prevent aggression. Iran's Supreme Leader also weighs in on the situation. Iran's Supreme Leader warns against U.S. attack on Syria, stating it would be a disaster for the region. Iranian leaders do not threaten retaliation but warn of reactions beyond Syria's borders. Russian, Chinese, and Arab League officials oppose U.S. proposal for military strikes and call for UN Security Council action against the Syrian regime. The Arab League supports the Russian disarmament proposal but remains focused on punishing the Syrian regime for the August 21 incident. UK leaders have no plans to seek new authorization for military action. French officials present intelligence on Syrian government's use of chemical agents. US military assets are stationed near Syria with five guided missile destroyers deployed. As of September 2, five guided missile destroyers were deployed in the eastern Mediterranean Sea: USS Stout, USS Gravely, USS Mahan, USS Barry, and USS Ramage. The USS San Antonio carried forces from the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit, and unspecified attack submarines were nearby. President Obama announced on August 31 that punitive military action was necessary without UN approval or specific congressional authorization. The debate over potential U.S. military action against the Asad regime for alleged chemical weapons use poses challenging questions for policymakers regarding Syria's civil war. Members of Congress and Administration officials are considering how to respond to the use of chemical weapons in Syria while protecting U.S. national security interests and international security principles. The Obama Administration faces challenges in responding to reported Syrian chemical weapons use, despite Obama's \"red line\" warning. Failure to act may undermine international norms and U.S. credibility. Obama prefers limited military intervention in Syria's civil conflict and seeks increased assistance to non-radical groups. The Administration has increased U.S. assistance to non-radical opposition groups and notified Congress of covert arming. President Obama proposed limited military strikes in response to alleged Syrian chemical weapons use. Concerns about exacerbating violence, regional spillover, and benefiting extremists have influenced the Administration's skepticism of direct military involvement. Other foreign policy priorities, such as maintaining international consensus on Iran's nuclear program, also play a role. Limited international consensus on Iran's nuclear program and concerns about sectarian and strategic competition in Syria potentially leading to regional conflict and threatening U.S. allies and security interests. U.S. officials condemn Asad as a thug and murderer while aiding some of his adversaries, emphasizing the need for a negotiated political solution to keep the Syrian state intact, secure chemical weapon stockpiles, and combat extremist groups. Critics argue that the risks of a military response outweigh the benefits, potentially hindering the desired political solution and prolonging the conflict. Critics argue that U.S. hesitation to intervene in Syria has prolonged the conflict, leading to deteriorating humanitarian conditions, extremist groups gaining power, and neighboring countries overwhelmed by refugees and violence. Critics argue that the United States' failure to stop the fighting in Syria is fueling sectarian tensions in the Middle East and diminishing U.S. global credibility. The Russian disarmament proposal for Syria has further complicated the situation, with debates focusing on its parameters, feasibility, risks, and rewards. Syrian opposition leaders' rejection of the proposal may strain U.S. relations with them. The U.S. faces challenges in reconciling its goals regarding the conflict in Syria, including the August 21 chemical weapons incident. Congress must consider authorizing the use of force, international disarmament proposals, and future policy implications. The U.S. intelligence community's assessment points to the Syrian government's responsibility for the chemical attack. The Syrian government carried out a chemical weapons attack in Damascus suburbs on August 21, 2013, killing 1,429 people, including 426 children. U.S. intelligence implicates Syrian chemical weapons personnel in the attack, ruling out opposition involvement. Satellite data confirms regime-controlled areas as the source of the attacks. On September 1, Secretary of State John Kerry stated that tests on blood and hair samples from Syrian first responders showed exposure to sarin nerve agent. UN inspectors have left Syria, and UN Secretary Ban Ki-moon urged expedited analysis of samples without compromising accuracy. The incident on August 21 occurred amidst Syria's ongoing civil war between the government and various opposition militias, with support from Iran. The Syrian civil war has seen momentum shift between government and rebel forces, with support from Iran and Hezbollah. The August 21 attack was part of a Syrian military bombardment of rebel-held areas near Damascus. Rebel forces have had limited successes, including the fall of a military air base near Aleppo. Extremist militia groups are vying for control in some areas amidst the ongoing conflict with regime forces. The Syrian conflict continues as militia groups battle regime forces for control of contested areas. The Supreme Military Council, supported by the United States, struggles to function as a rebel leadership. Offensives by rebels in northern Syria and foreign-trained rebels near Damascus have alarmed regime leaders. The United Nations reports over 100,000 deaths, 4.25 million displaced Syrians, and 2 million refugees in neighboring countries. The crisis has deepened economic and political challenges in the region, fueling sectarian tensions and violence in Iraq and Lebanon. The US has provided over $1 billion in humanitarian aid. The United States has provided over $1 billion in humanitarian aid in Syria and neighboring countries. President Obama called for Syrian President Bashar al Asad's resignation in 2011, but the Obama Administration has rejected calls for direct U.S. intervention in Syria. However, there is increasing pressure on the Administration to respond due to the regional costs of the crisis and reports of chemical weapons use by Syrian government forces. Secretary Kerry has indicated that the Administration may increase support to some opposition elements alongside limited military operations focused on chemical weapons. Some Members of Congress have introduced legislation, such as H.R. 1327, the Free Syria Act of 2013, to authorize expanded assistance to the opposition. The Free Syria Act of 2013 and the Syria Transition Support Act of 2013 aim to provide assistance, including lethal support, to Syrian opposition groups. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved the Syria Transition Support Act, focusing on the debate over the authorization for the use of military force in Syria. Key subjects include the purposes, targets, and type of force that may be employed. The comparison between limited and broad authorizations of the use of force by Congress involves restrictions on resources, methods, targets, and purposes for the President's use of force. Limited authorizations impose more constraints, including time limits and procedural restrictions, while broad authorizations have fewer limits and focus on identifying an enemy. Some argue that limitations on the President's military operations may interfere with their commander-in-chief powers under Article II of the Constitution. Limits on appropriations have been suggested as an effective way for Congress to assert control over military actions. For more analysis on this topic, refer to \"War Powers\" and CRS Report R41989, Congressional Authority to Limit Military Operations. The curr_chunk discusses a draft resolution authorizing the use of force in Syria to prevent the use or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The analysis is based on texts available as of September 6, 2013. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee debated and adopted a resolution to authorize the President to use the Armed Forces in a limited manner against military targets in Syria to respond to the use of weapons of mass destruction, deter Syria's use of such weapons, degrade Syria's capacity to use them in the future, and prevent their proliferation. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee proposal aims to authorize the President to use the Armed Forces in Syria to respond to the use of weapons of mass destruction, deter their use, degrade Syria's capacity for future use, and prevent their transfer to terrorist groups. The resolution does not allow for ground combat operations but may involve non-combatant roles for U.S. Armed Forces. It includes a 60-day authorization with a possible 30-day extension. Van Hollen and Gerald Connolly have proposed a draft authorization for the use of military force in Syria to prevent and deter the use of chemical weapons. The authorization would expire after each military action unless Syria is found to have used chemical weapons again. The proposal does not define \"military action\" and would completely expire after 60 days. In regards to Syria, potential considerations include targeting allies of the Syrian government like Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah who may access chemical or biological weapons. The costs, duration, and implications of U.S. military action, as well as the potential for retaliatory actions by the Syrian government and its supporters, are also important. Secretary of State Kerry has discussed hypothetical scenarios, including securing Syria's chemical weapons. The need for U.S. \"boots on the ground\" has not been confirmed in recent testimony. In recent testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Secretary of State Kerry discussed the possibility of U.S. military action in Syria to prevent the proliferation of chemical weapons to extremist groups. He emphasized the importance of considering the potential consequences and success criteria of such actions. The United States is considering military action in Syria in response to the use of chemical weapons. The attack on August 21 in Damascus resulted in the largest number of casualties from a chemical weapons attack in the conflict. The US, UK, and France have accused the Syrian government of using chemical weapons. The White House released a detailed intelligence assessment on August 30, stating that the Syrian government used a nerve agent in a large-scale attack that killed approximately 1,429 people. Experts believe the symptoms are consistent with sarin gas, a chemical weapon in Syria's arsenal. The US government has assessed that the Assad regime has used chemical weapons multiple times in the past year, primarily against the opposition. The Syrian government has used chemical weapons primarily to gain an advantage in strategic areas. President Obama and other world leaders have warned of consequences, including military force, for using chemical weapons against civilians. The U.S. has fundamental concerns about the use of chemical weapons, citing their inherent malicious qualities, targeting of civilians, and the risk of proliferation to other parties. The concerns surrounding the use of chemical weapons in Syria include the potential for proliferation to hostile parties, escalation of violence, and loss of control of these weapons. A UN team is investigating alleged attacks and collecting samples for analysis, focusing on determining the extent of weapon use rather than assigning blame. The UN team investigating alleged chemical weapon attacks in Syria aims to determine the type and extent of chemical weapons used, without assigning blame. They arrived in Syria just before the August 21 attack and are expected to issue their report soon. Media reports indicate that the Syrian military continued bombing the attack site with conventional weapons. The UN inspectors investigating chemical weapon attacks in Syria are collecting blood and tissue samples from victims to determine the chemical agent used. Delay in accessing affected sites may hinder establishing evidence. White House intelligence assessments on the April 2013 sarin attack included information on Syrian military attack planning. The sources of information included reporting on Syrian military attack planning and execution, descriptions of attacks, and physiological symptoms consistent with exposure to chemical weapons agents. The U.S. intelligence community cites Iran, North Korea, and Syria as having active chemical weapons programs. The Chemical Weapons Convention addresses the destruction of existing stocks and prevention of proliferation to new states. The Obama Administration believes that the use of chemical weapons in Syria may require a response. Iraq used chemical weapons in attacks on civilians in the past, with no significant military response from the United States. President Obama stated in August 2012 that he has no interest in open-ended conflict in Syria but emphasized the need to hold countries accountable for breaking international norms on chemical weapons. The Administration confirmed the use of sarin nerve agent in Syria and aims to deter future use of these weapons. Secretary Kerry emphasized the norm against chemical weapons in a speech on August 26. The Secretary reiterated the need for accountability for the use of chemical weapons to prevent future incidents. While there is speculation about military action, specifics have not been provided. Concerns include the risk of civilian casualties if Syrian chemical weapons facilities are targeted in a strike. The United States is concerned about the risk of chemical weapons falling into the hands of terrorist groups if the Syrian military loses control. General Martin Dempsey stated that thousands of special operations forces would be needed to secure critical sites. Efforts have focused on bolstering security near Syria's borders to prevent the proliferation of chemical weapons. Chemical weapons have been banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention since 1997. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) bans the development, production, transfer, stockpiling, and use of chemical and toxin weapons. Member states can seek assistance if attacked with chemical weapons. Some countries, including Syria, are not parties to the CWC. The 1925 Geneva Protocol prohibits the use of chemical or biological agents in warfare between states. Syria has agreed to turn over its chemical weapons to international control, with the United Nations Security Council discussing proposals for this. President Obama emphasized the need for verifiable and enforceable destruction. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons oversees the destruction of chemical weapons, and a separate disarmament mechanism may be set up for Syria if it does not join the Chemical Weapons Convention. The OPCW would likely oversee the verification and dismantlement of Syria's chemical weapons. The UN and OPCW have experience monitoring such processes in other countries. Syria would need to declare its stocks and production facilities, destroy weapons under international supervision, and allow access to suspected sites. However, the civil war in Syria poses unique challenges, including securing the chemical weapons and ensuring the safety of inspectors without a ceasefire in place. The conflict in Syria poses challenges for the verification and dismantlement of chemical weapons. Destruction of these weapons is a complex and costly process, requiring safety precautions. There are concerns about securing the weapons and ensuring access for inspectors without a ceasefire. The United States and others may set deadlines for certain steps to prevent delays. France plans to propose a UN Security Council Resolution for Syria to dismantle its chemical weapons program. France plans to propose a UN Security Council Resolution condemning the chemical weapons attack in Syria, demanding international control and dismantlement of Assad's chemical weapons program, with consequences for violations. The draft resolution would give Syria 15 days to declare its chemical weapons and facilities for inspection. The proposed draft text for a UN Security Council Resolution on Syria's chemical weapons would authorize measures under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter if Syria does not comply. The U.N. Secretary General would lead inspections in coordination with the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to avoid delays in Syria's accession to the Chemical Weapons Convention. Discussions are ongoing regarding the French proposal, with Russian officials rejecting elements. Deployment of U.S. Armed Forces in Syria raises constitutional war powers concerns. The War Powers Resolution (WPR) requires the President to consult with Congress before introducing U.S. Armed Forces into hostilities or deploying them in foreign countries. The President must report to Congress within 48 hours of such actions, including reasons and authority. The War Powers Resolution (WPR) mandates the President to report to Congress the reasons for introducing U.S. Armed Forces into hostilities, the President's authority for such actions, and the estimated scope and duration of the involvement. The WPR specifies that the President must withdraw U.S. Armed Forces 60 days after introducing them into hostilities unless Congress declares war or authorizes the use of force. The President can extend this period by 30 days for a safe withdrawal. The War Powers Resolution (WPR) requires the President to report to Congress before introducing U.S. Armed Forces into hostilities and mandates withdrawal within 60 days unless Congress declares war or authorizes force. Presidents have resisted this requirement citing constitutional concerns. The use of concurrent resolution for withdrawal is considered a legislative veto, deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Congressional declaration of war against Syria is unlikely based on historical practice since World War II. Congress may consider authorizing the use of force against Syria, with provisions specifying the purpose, objectives, and limits of such authorization. Statutory authorizations can strengthen the President's legal and political position in armed conflicts. H.J.Res. 58 introduced in 2013 proposed limiting funds for the use of force in Syria unless specifically authorized by Congress. Some argue that limiting the President's ability to conduct military operations could interfere with his commander-in-chief powers under Article II of the Constitution. Without limitations on appropriations, restrictions in an authorization to use force may not effectively constrain the President's ability to continue military operations in Syria. Congressional concerns have expanded to include the costs and funding sources for potential U.S. military actions in Syria since the President's 2013 speech on the matter. Sources would be tapped for U.S. military actions in Syria or to secure Syria's chemical weapons. Speaker of the House John Boehner questioned the need for a supplemental appropriations request if military strikes exceed initial planning. Secretary of State John Kerry stated that President Obama seeks authorization to degrade Bashar al Asad's chemical weapons capacity without boots on the ground. Secretary Hagel described the operation as limited in duration and scope. Specific military plans and cost estimates have not been publicly disclosed. Estimating the cost of potential military intervention in Syria and securing chemical weapons stocks is speculative. Some Arab countries have offered to assist with costs. The uncertainty lies in the range of costs depending on the type and length of military actions and participation in chemical disarmament efforts. The cost of military intervention in Syria and securing chemical weapons stocks is uncertain, with funding sources depending on U.S. allies' participation and timing. Congressional decision-making on costs may involve tapping into available funding for FY2013, using appropriations from FY2014, or requesting reprogrammings of existing funds. The Department of Defense is monitoring funds closely due to required sequestration cuts. Senators Levin and Inhofe, along with General Martin Dempsey, outlined the costs of various military options for intervention in Syria, estimating initial costs of $500 million to establish a safe area for opposition forces, up to $12 billion for a year-long military campaign. General Dempsey suggested that a major military campaign could cost \"billions\" and involve lethal force to strike regime targets. The cost of military intervention in Syria was estimated to range from tens of millions to billions of dollars, depending on the scope and duration of the operation. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jonathan Greenert provided insights on the potential costs of different options for a limited strike. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jonathan Greenert stated that the naval costs of the Syrian operation are not extraordinary due to pre-deployed ships, but extending the Nimitz carrier deployment and replenishing Tomahawk missiles could increase costs. Some doubt the minimal cost estimates. The resolution requires the President to report financial costs every ten days after initiation of military operations. In a letter dated July 19, 2013, General Dempsey estimated that destroying Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles could cost over $1 billion a month and require hundreds of aircraft, ships, submarines, and thousands of special operations forces. Reports suggested a military effort to seize Syrian weapons would need upwards of 75,000 troops, but this estimate may not be accurate as it assumes forcible entry by the United States, which is different from the current international effort. The potential U.S. cost of a chemical disarmament effort in Syria would depend on various factors such as force protection for inspectors, cost-sharing of inspection costs, and the extent of the effort. It is uncertain if FY2013 funds will be used for either a limited military strike or a chemical disarmament effort. Secretary of Defense Hagel noted the potential funding sources for a military intervention or chemical disarmament effort in Syria, including FY2014 funds, reprogramming of available funds, or supplemental appropriations. The United States has positioned assets, such as four DDG-51 Arleigh Burke destroyers in the Mediterranean, to support any military option chosen by the president. The cost of deploying these assets would likely be funded by FY2013 DOD appropriations. The deployment of four destroyers to the Mediterranean for potential Syrian operations is likely funded by FY2013 DOD appropriations for Military Personnel and Operation and Maintenance. This cost would be covered within the Navy's base budget for regular activities, separate from Overseas Contingency Operations or Operation Enduring Freedom funding. In 2011, brief U.S. military operations in Libya were mainly covered by existing appropriations, with estimated costs of about $800 million. The Administration estimated that the short-lived Libyan operation would not impact the Afghan or Iraq wars significantly. They did not request additional funds for Libyan operations, using available funds and existing munitions. DOD transferred OCO funds to replenish missiles used in the operation with approval from congressional defense committees. Possible military intervention in Syria could pose budget challenges for DOD if costs exceed those of the Libyan operation. The Department of Defense may face budget challenges in funding Syrian military operations due to uncertainties in FY2014 appropriations. If costs exceed expectations, DOD could use reprogramming authority to shift funds from less urgent programs. The Department of Defense may need congressional approval to transfer funds for military operations, and may require supplemental appropriations if costs increase. Congress can impose restrictions on fund usage, such as prohibiting spending on specific activities or after certain events. Funding restrictions can be imposed by Congress on military operations, requiring approval for fund transfers and supplemental appropriations. Representative Ted Poe introduced a resolution prohibiting the use of funds for military action in Syria without specific congressional authorization or in case of an attack on the US. The Manchin-Heitkamp resolution (S.J.Res. 22) proposes U.S. military action if Syria does not comply with the Chemical Weapons Convention within 45 days. Sequestration cuts may not impact current ship deployments in the Mediterranean. Administration and DOD aim to minimize effects on core readiness activities. The DOD's policy is to minimize effects on core readiness activities, with sequestration cuts focused on lower priority areas. Concerns have been raised about readiness in later years due to sequestration cuts or potential future budget cuts. Congress may need to enact supplemental appropriations for Syrian military intervention costs. Congress may need to enact supplemental appropriations for Syrian military intervention costs, as funding designated as emergency would not be subject to budget caps. If BCA caps are not met, FY2014 sequestration cuts would be imposed, potentially affecting funds for operations involving Syria. U.S. military planning information is largely speculative, and Congress may consider its role in relation to military plans and strategic objectives. The curr_chunk discusses strategic objectives, proposed military operations, potential targets in Syria, success and failure criteria, limitations on the use of military force, and the Administration's beliefs on conducting military operations outside of Syria. It also touches on the capabilities of U.S. forces to engage targets in Syria. The curr_chunk focuses on potential coalition forces, countries willing to participate in military strikes, Syrian government's response, reactions from allies like Russia and Iran, and the impact on extremist and opposition groups. The curr_chunk discusses key questions regarding potential U.S. military operations in Syria, including the involvement of armed groups, political goals, support to opposition groups, and the impact on extremist groups. The curr_chunk raises questions about the U.S. military's readiness for potential operations in Syria, including the impact of sequestration and ongoing deployments in Afghanistan. Reports suggest the U.S. is considering a military strike in response to Syria's alleged use of chemical weapons. The U.S. is considering a military strike against Syria in response to alleged chemical weapons use. Analysts question the effectiveness of limited strikes for deterrence. RAND Corporation outlined possible missions for an airpower attack in Syria. The United States is considering military action in Syria to target \"safe areas,\" defeat the regime, and prevent the use of chemical weapons. Special munitions called \"agent defeat munitions\" are designed to incinerate chemical agents, but their effectiveness may be limited by delivery methods and the need for precise targeting of chemical weapon storage locations. The United States is considering military action in Syria to target chemical weapons storage locations. Strikes on the command and control network, missile launchers, and military command centers could degrade Syria's chemical weapons capabilities without risking collateral release of chemical agents. Deterrence of further chemical weapon use by Syria depends on understanding the Syrian command's calculations. Some strike options offer significant deterrent value. Some strike options in Syria offer significant deterrent value, such as degrading the air defense network or destroying the Syrian air force. The Institute for the Study of War planned a notional strike to \"significantly degrade\" the Syrian air force, requiring 133 Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles, 24 Joint Stand-Off Weapons, and 24 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles. The benefit of using \"stand-off weapons\" like TLAMs fired from ships or aircraft in the Mediterranean is that they can be stationed beyond the range of Syrian anti-ship missiles. Other military options, such as establishing no-fly zones, may require a more extensive U.S. commitment, including thousands of ground forces to defend the zones. In evaluating a potential no-fly zone over Syria, Congress may scrutinize the U.S. military's assessment of adversary air defenses, assets, and geography. The U.S. could use F-16 aircraft in Jordan or the Air Force's base in Turkey for manned aerial strikes. Access to the British base at Akrotiri may also be available for military action against Syria. The United States may have access to the British base at Akrotiri, Cyprus, and France has access to an air base in the United Arab Emirates for potential military action against Syria. Secretary of Defense Hagel mentioned providing arms to Syrian rebels under covert action authorities, while Secretary of State Kerry noted an increase in lethal aid to the opposition in response to chemical attacks. The statute concerning covert action shapes how the Administration intervenes in Syria and engages with Congress. The National Security Act of 1947 authorizes the President to conduct covert actions to influence foreign political, economic, or military conditions. The President must provide a \"finding\" specifying foreign policy objectives to congressional intelligence committees before initiating covert action. The President is not required to provide covert action findings to Members not on intelligence committees. The \"apparent or acknowledged\" language in the statute may limit public disclosure of aid to Syria opposition. Covert action authorities may be restricted in broadening support for the opposition or taking additional action in Syria. Past covert actions have sometimes revealed U.S. involvement, but this hasn't always limited the use of covert action authorities. The more public justification needed, the harder it may be to justify activities under these authorities. The President is not required to provide covert action findings to Members not on intelligence committees. Covert action authorities may be restricted in broadening support for the opposition or taking additional action in Syria. The more public justification needed, the harder it may be to justify activities under these authorities. Executive Order 12333 states that only the CIA or the Armed Forces can conduct covert actions unless the President determines otherwise. The Administration's decision on providing support to Syria's opposition faces obstacles. The U.S. faces obstacles in providing aid to Syria due to long-standing economic sanctions against the country. Despite restrictions, the President has authority to provide humanitarian aid and support emergency response efforts in neighboring states. The President has authority to provide humanitarian aid and support emergency response efforts in neighboring states, reprogram assistance for disasters, and draw upon specific laws for unanticipated events, including the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act and the Foreign Assistance Act. The President has the authority to provide peacekeeping operations funds and assistance without regard to restrictions in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and other related laws in response to unforeseen emergencies and for the security interests of the United States. The limit for peacekeeping operations funds is $15 million in funds and $425 million in commodities and services, while assistance can be provided up to $250 million, with a maximum of $50 million to one country in a fiscal year. The Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development can also provide agricultural commodities to meet emergency needs under the Food for Peace Act. The U.S. Agency for International Development provides agricultural commodities for emergency food needs through various organizations. Most U.S. foreign aid to Syria is for humanitarian assistance, with over $1 billion in humanitarian aid and $250 million in non-humanitarian aid in FY2013. Transfer authority under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 has been crucial for providing aid to Syria since 2011. The Obama Administration has acknowledged the funding challenges posed by the Syria crisis and worked with Congress to increase global humanitarian assistance funds in FY2013. However, specific additional Syria assistance funding requests for FY2014 have not been identified, and funding for opposition efforts is expected to continue on an ad hoc basis. The Administration did request $580 million for a new Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund (MENA IF) in FY2014. The House Appropriations Committee and Senate appropriators have declined to include funds for the Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund (MENA IF) in their respective markups of H.R. 2855 and S. 1372. Instead, the Senate has proposed a $575 million Complex Foreign Crises Fund to meet region-wide assistance needs. Congress has the authority to amend restrictions on foreign aid appropriations, while the President can utilize various foreign aid authorities and enact legislation to remove restrictions. The ongoing conflict in Syria has led to a humanitarian crisis, affecting millions of people. The US government uses various departments like the State Department, Department of Commerce, and Department of the Treasury to control transactions, arms sales, visas, and financial transactions with Syria. The conflict has displaced over 4.2 million people within Syria and more than 2 million Syrians outside the country. The conflict in Syria has led to a humanitarian crisis, with over 4.2 million displaced internally and more than 2 million as refugees in neighboring countries. The United States plays a critical role in providing humanitarian assistance, allocating over $1 billion in funding to meet the immense needs in Syria and neighboring countries. The United States provides humanitarian assistance in Syria and neighboring countries using global humanitarian accounts and reprogrammed funding. The international response struggles to keep pace with urgent needs due to violence and restrictions in Syria. Two U.N. emergency appeals for $4.4 billion are underfunded at less than 47%. Possible humanitarian policy considerations for Congress regarding the Syria crisis include issues related to U.S. resources, determination of priorities, and the labeling of humanitarian aid. The impact of military action on the humanitarian situation in Syria and the region is uncertain. Refugee outflows have increased in anticipation of foreign military strikes. The U.N. Security Council is the primary mechanism for addressing international peace and security issues. The UN Security Council, with 15 members including 5 permanent (P-5) and 10 non-permanent, makes binding decisions on international peace and security. Resolutions require 9 affirmative votes, with P-5 agreement needed. China and Russia have vetoed resolutions on Syria, hindering consensus. Discussions may focus on enforcing a chemical weapons disarmament agreement with Syria. The UN Security Council is considering enforcing a chemical weapons disarmament agreement with Syria under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter. Russia has consistently supported the Asad regime in Syria and asserts its right to provide arms under existing contracts. Additionally, Russia has a naval docking facility at Tartus. Russia has vetoed three U.N. Security Council resolutions on the Syrian conflict, citing interference with domestic efforts for a peaceful solution. President Putin stated Russia will only support action against Syria for chemical weapons use with compelling evidence, questioning rebel involvement and emphasizing the need for UNSC approval for the use of force. Russia has vetoed U.N. Security Council resolutions on the Syrian conflict, emphasizing the need for UNSC approval for the use of force. They are supplying arms to the legitimate government of Syria and will not become militarily involved in the conflict. The Russian Foreign Ministry reported evidence of rebels using chemical weapons in Syria. Secretary Kerry hoped for Obama and Putin to discuss Syria at the G-20 summit. Russia denied assisting Iraq with chemical weapons development. The Russian administration denies allegations of assisting Iraq with chemical weapons and warns against U.S. military action in Syria, citing potential threats to tourists, commercial ships, and Russian warships. They also caution that supporting Syrian rebels could indirectly aid terrorist groups in the Middle East. The Foreign Ministry expresses concerns about U.S. missiles causing nuclear contamination. The Russian administration warns against U.S. military action in Syria, citing potential threats to Russian citizens. Warships are deployed to the Mediterranean for possible evacuation. Russia aims to protect national interests and prevent conflict escalation. A delegation trip to the U.S. is planned to persuade Congress against military force. Russia blocked discussion in the UNSC of a resolution condemning the gas attack in Syria, stating that military action without UNSC authorization would violate international law. They suggested the attack may have been a rebel provocation and warned against Western military action. China, as a veto-wielding member of the UN Security Council, supports Russia's proposal for Syria to place its chemical weapons under international control. China opposes military intervention in Syria and joined Russia in blocking a UK-drafted resolution in response to the 2013 chemical weapons attack. China, as a veto-wielding member of the UN Security Council, opposed military intervention in Syria and blocked a UK-drafted resolution in 2013. China's stance is rooted in its policy of non-interference in other nations' affairs, fearing foreign intervention in its own issues like Taiwan. China's non-interference policy extends to opposing international intervention in issues like Taiwan and its treatment of ethnic minorities. China's rare departure from this stance was seen in 2011 when it abstained from a UN resolution on Libya, later criticizing the military action authorized. China's Syria policy is influenced by its relationship with Russia, despite having limited economic interests in the country.

China abstained from a UN resolution on Libya in 2011, later criticizing the military action authorized. China's Syria policy is influenced by its relationship with Russia, despite having limited economic interests in the country. China has hosted visits from both Syrian government envoys and opposition groups, stating it has no selfish interests in the Syrian issue. The Syrian regime's chemical attack has created a dilemma for Iran, as Syria has been Iran's closest Arab ally since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Iran's close relationship with the Asad regime in Syria is strategic, as Iran uses Syria's position in the Arab world to pressure Israel, the United States, and Sunni Arab states. Iran has been a victim of chemical weapons use by Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war, but has also been found to have conducted some chemical attacks. The Asad regime and Iran share similar sectarian identities, with the Asads belonging to the Alawite community, which has religious beliefs distantly derived from Shiism. Iran is a party to the Chemical Weapons Convention. Iran and Syria have a strategic relationship due to their shared sectarian identities and history of supporting each other. Syria has been a key transit point for Iranian weapons shipments to Hezbollah, a resistance movement against Israel. Iran and Syria have a strategic relationship, with Syria serving as a key transit point for Iranian weapons shipments to Hezbollah. Iran supports the Syrian regime with funds, weapons, and fighters to prevent Assad's downfall. Iran also provides funding, weapons, and training to Hamas, PIJ, and PFLP-GC, despite Hamas distancing itself from Iran and the Assad regime. Iran supports the Syrian regime by providing funds, weapons, and fighters, including military advisers from the IRGC-QF and IRGC-GF. Iran also assists in recruiting irregular forces and setting up popular militia forces in Syria to support Assad's regime. Additionally, Iran played a role in persuading Hezbollah and deploying Iraqi Shiite militias in the conflict. Iran is heavily involved in supporting the Syrian regime by providing funds, weapons, and fighters, including Iraqi Shiite militias. They are also sending substantial quantities of arms to Syria, with increased resupply flights at least once per day since 2013. The exact types and quantities of arms are unknown, but heavy weapons like tanks are not reported to have been delivered. U.S. officials have urged Iraq to interdict the flights overflying their airspace en route to Syria. Iran has provided non-military support to the Asad regime in Syria, including equipment to suppress crowds and monitor the Internet. They have also offered financial aid to stabilize the Syrian economy, extending a $4 billion line of credit in 2013. U.S. officials have raised concerns about Iran's involvement in Syria and how it may impact U.S. policy towards Iran. Iran has the capability to strike targets in the region if the US attacks Syria, but experts believe direct retaliation from Iran is unlikely. Iran's Supreme Leader and other senior leaders have warned against a US attack on Syria, but there are no signs of Iran preparing for retaliation. Iran's new president has pledged to ease tensions with the international community, a goal that could be hindered by a US strike on Syria. Iran and Hezbollah have agents and cells worldwide that could conduct terrorism in response to a US attack on Syria, potentially leading Iran to break off nuclear talks with the international community. Talks have been ongoing since 2003. International negotiators are more optimistic about talks since Rouhani became Iran's president in 2013. Iran has not threatened to boycott talks, but there are concerns that a U.S. failure to respond to chemical weapons in Syria could impact Iran's nuclear decisions. The EU believes Assad is responsible for the chemical attack and calls for a strong international response, but there is disagreement on the form of action. There is disagreement on the form of response to the chemical attack in Syria, with skepticism towards offensive military action. European countries support U.S. military action, but collective military operations through NATO or the EU are unlikely. France is considering participation, while the UK government's stance is unclear. The UK government has been leading international pressure against the Asad regime in Syria, pushing for United Nations action and EU sanctions. They have provided non-lethal equipment, humanitarian aid, and training to opposition forces. Despite the National Security Council's decision against chemical weapons use, the House of Commons voted against UK participation in military action. Prime Minister Cameron has ruled out UK participation in strikes on the Asad regime, despite speculation about a potential second vote. UK involvement is expected to focus on intelligence support, diplomatic pressure, and humanitarian aid. France has been leading international efforts to pressure the Asad regime and has recognized the Syrian Opposition Coalition as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people. France believes Asad has used chemical weapons. French officials believe Asad has used chemical weapons and support military strikes against him. France has deployed military assets off the Syrian coast in anticipation of action, but would only act in support of a U.S.-led operation. President Hollande faces pressure to seek parliamentary approval for intervention, as public opposition grows. French officials believe Asad has used chemical weapons and support military strikes against him. President Hollande faces pressure to seek parliamentary approval for intervention, as public opposition grows. Hollande stated he would not authorize military action before the release of a U.N. report on chemical weapons in Syria. France intends to present a U.N. Security Council Resolution under Chapter VII to dismantle Asad's chemical weapons program and punish the perpetrators of the August 21 attack. French officials support military strikes against Asad and plan to present a U.N. Security Council Resolution to dismantle Syria's chemical weapons program. Germany strongly condemns Asad's regime for alleged chemical weapons use but is hesitant to endorse unauthorized military action without U.N. approval. Germany is unlikely to participate in any military operation in Syria, even under a U.N. or NATO mandate. The German government has agreed to resettle 5,000 Syrian refugees by the end of the year. NATO has deployed Patriot missile batteries along Turkey's border with Syria for defensive purposes. The United States, Germany, and the Netherlands each operate two Patriot batteries near population centers in Turkey. Some Members of Congress and Air Force General Philip Breedlove have suggested using NATO's Patriot batteries for offensive military operations against Asad, including a possible no-fly zone or humanitarian corridor. NATO has condemned the Asad regime but has not considered a no-fly zone, reiterating that the Patriot deployment is defensive. NATO Secretary General called the use of chemical weapons a breach of international norms that cannot go unanswered. The EU, alongside the United States, condemns the Asad regime in Syria and has imposed sanctions. They recognized the National Coalition of Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people. There was a push to lift the EU arms embargo on Syria to arm opposition forces. The EU arms embargo on Syria was allowed to expire in May 2013, allowing arms exports to the opposition on a case-by-case basis with safeguards. Despite efforts by some EU countries, there was no consensus for military operations, with European Council President stating at the G20 Summit that there is no military solution to the Syria conflict. Since late 2011, Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan has actively opposed the Asad regime in Syria, supporting U.N.-backed intervention and hosting refugees and opposition figures. Erdogan has expressed willingness for Turkey to participate in an international coalition against Syria, emphasizing the need to stop the bloodshed and weaken the regime. Erdogan's preference for a broader military response than U.S. officials, potential Turkish involvement is unclear. Turkey's large military could be constrained by political sensitivities and vulnerabilities. Erdogan mentioned Turkey's role could be opposing or providing logistical support. Turkey hosts U.S. and NATO military assets, which could be targets of Syrian retaliation. Opposition party CHP condemns possible use of force. Members of the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) in Turkey have warned against military intervention in Syria and emphasized the need for parliamentary approval for any foreign troop presence on Turkish territory. Arab countries have taken varying positions on the Syrian civil war, supporting different rebel groups and causing disorganization within the Syrian opposition. Qatar, previously supportive of Islamist groups, may be shifting its stance under new leadership. Saudi Arabia has also backed militias in the conflict. Saudi Arabia has supported militias in the Syrian conflict but has been less supportive of radical elements. Arab Gulf states continue to provide support to extremist groups in Syria. Egypt, under military rule, may be less inclined to support Sunni Islamist rebels. Arab states are hesitant to endorse Western military intervention in Syria, but the Arab League blamed the Syrian regime for a chemical weapons attack. The Arab League holds the Syrian regime responsible for a chemical weapons attack and calls for UN Security Council action. Concerns about possible military action include retaliation by Syria, Iran, Hezbollah, and Gaza-based militants against Israel and other US regional allies. The involvement of Turkey, Jordan, and Gulf Arab states in aiding the Syrian opposition and potentially serving as bases for U.S.-led military operations has led to retaliatory threats against Israel. Historical and geopolitical animosities, as well as desires among Syria and its allies to deter the United States from acting militarily, play a role in this dynamic. U.S. regional military planning has long considered the possibility of attacks on Israel triggering wider regional war, with current concerns weighing the potential consequences for Israel. The potential consequences for Israel in relation to the use of chemical weapons in Syria were discussed in a Senate hearing. Secretary Kerry emphasized that Israel's safety could be compromised if the U.S. does not take action, as Iran and Hezbollah, allies of Assad, pose a threat to Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu expressed concern about the use of chemical weapons in Syria, stating that Iran is closely watching the situation. Some Israeli officials are cautious about getting involved in the conflict, while American Jewish organizations are calling for bipartisan support for U.S. intervention. J Street issued a statement on its website expressing the complexity of the situation as world leaders consider the use of force in Syria. Syrian and Iranian officials warned of retaliation against Israel in the event of a U.S.-led attack. Hezbollah may not retaliate in case of a limited strike but would likely do so in response to a large-scale Western strike aiming to change the power balance in Syria. A potential Hezbollah retaliation against Israel for a U.S. strike would originate from Homs in Syria to avoid involving Lebanon in the conflict. Israel is preparing for possible Syrian or Syrian-allied retaliation but believes the probability is low due to the reluctance of adversaries to escalate the conflict. Syria, Iran, Hezbollah, and Gaza-based militants could threaten Israel with rockets and missiles of varying capabilities. Israel maintains multiple anti-rocket and anti-missile platforms like Iron Dome, Patriot, and Arrow II with U.S. assistance. Iron Dome has been successful against rockets under 75 km, while Patriot and Arrow II intercept Syrian SCUD missiles. It is uncertain if these systems can intercept short-range Hezbollah missiles reaching central and southern Israel. Israel has deployed Iron Dome batteries throughout the country, including Jerusalem. David's Sling system has been tested successfully against short-range missiles but won't be operational until 2014. Arrow III, designed to counter Iranian medium-range ballistic missiles, is expected to be operational by 2014-2015. Israel is preparing additional measures on the home front for possible retaliatory strikes. In previous conflicts, many Israelis sought shelter in bomb shelters and safe rooms. Concerns arise over potential casualties from more advanced missiles in retaliatory strikes. Some Israelis may lack access to shelters, and delays in distributing gas masks are possible. Speculation surrounds the possibility of a punitive U.S.-led military strike. Intense speculation surrounds potential U.S.-led military strike on Syrian government forces and Russian disarmament plan for Syria. U.S. aims for negotiated settlement to establish new government in Syria, secure chemical weapons, borders, and combat terrorism. Importance of Syrian conflict for broader U.S. national security policy objectives emphasized. The war in Syria has heightened divisions between the United States, the European Union, Russia, and China over international peace and security enforcement. Russia and China have opposed U.S. and European efforts in the UN Security Council regarding civilian protection in Syria. Concerns have also been raised about the resurgence of terrorist groups in Syria. Terrorist groups inspired by Al Qaeda in Afghanistan-Pakistan may be resurgent in Syria, potentially gaining access to advanced weapons. The Syrian government's alleged use of chemical weapons sets a dangerous precedent for countries with similar programs. The conflict in Syria has divided the United States over foreign policy visions, with concerns about military intervention and public support. This situation is closely monitored by countries like Iran and North Korea with similar programs. The analysis is based on texts available as of September 6, 2013, discussing the need for U.S. global leadership amidst uncertain public support for military operations. The texts include the Administration Draft Proposal, S.J.Res. 21, and a Draft Proposal from Representatives Van Hollen and Connolly."
