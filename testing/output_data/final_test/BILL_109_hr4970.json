    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Backcountry Landing Strip Access Act\". Congress finds that aircraft landing strips play essential safety roles as emergency landing areas, provide access to national parks and other Federal lands, support State economies, and are crucial for various activities such as search and rescue, wildlife management, and disaster relief. The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture should adopt a nationwide policy for governing. The Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior should adopt a nationwide policy for governing backcountry aviation issues related to Federal land management. Regional managers must comply with this policy. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"Administrator\" refers to the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration. The term \"aircraft landing strip\" is defined as an established strip on Federal land used for aircraft activities. \"Permanently close\" means a closure lasting more than 90 days in a calendar year. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior for land under their jurisdiction. The Secretary of Agriculture has jurisdiction over land under their control. SEC. 4. PROCEDURE FOR CONSIDERATION OF ACTIONS AFFECTING CERTAIN AIRCRAFT LANDING STRIPS. The Secretary must follow specific procedures before taking any action to permanently close, restrict, or render an aircraft landing strip unserviceable. This includes approval from the head of the aviation department of each State, publishing a notice in the Federal Register, allowing a 90-day public comment period, and considering any received comments. The Secretaries must adopt a nationwide policy for backcountry aviation issues on Federal land within 2 years of this Act's enactment. Regional managers must adhere to this policy, which cannot take effect without the Administrator's approval for aviation and airspace control. The Secretary consults with State aviation departments and interested parties for the maintenance of aircraft landing strips. Cooperative agreements may be entered into for this purpose. The Federal government cannot close or neglect landing strips as a condition of acquisition or exchange of private property. Any action that restricts use or makes a landing strip unserviceable is also prohibited. These restrictions apply to actions that are not finalized at the time of the Act's enactment and do not affect the Federal Aviation Administration's authority over aviation and airspace."
