    "content": "The growth of China and India as major energy consumers has shifted power from consumers to producers. Russia has raised natural gas prices to Europe, highlighting the ability of energy producers to exert pressure. The US and its allies are discussing energy security policies, with the Bush Administration introducing the topic at NATO in 2006. EU governments have a broad view of energy security. Most EU countries heavily rely on imported energy, with Russia being a key supplier. By 2030, EU countries are expected to import 70% of their energy needs, with 40% of gas and 45% of oil coming from Russia and the Middle East. Concerns over energy security stem from the reliance on unstable regions like the Middle East for oil. European governments are concerned about energy security, especially in relation to the Middle East. The EU proposed building interdependence with Russia for reliable energy supplies, but Russia has rejected key elements of the proposal. Moscow restricts foreign ownership of pipelines and has limited foreign companies from developing its energy reserves. Despite this, Russia has secured access to some European markets through gas agreements with countries like Hungary and France. Russia has strengthened its position in European energy markets by signing agreements with countries like Hungary and France. In December 2007, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan agreed to build a new gas pipeline around the Caspian Sea to send Central Asian natural gas to the Russian energy grid. The United States and some EU governments prefer a trans-Caspian Sea pipeline to bypass Russian control and provide cheaper gas to Europe. Russia is also exploring a connection with Algeria's gas supply grid, raising concerns about the development of an energy cartel. The EU Commission is urging new infrastructure to improve energy security and competition, including terminals for liquified natural gas, pipelines from the Caspian region and North Africa, and single European energy grids. They recommend separating energy production from distribution networks to encourage competition, which is opposed by some EU governments like France. If adopted, this proposal could hinder Russian efforts to buy parts of the European energy grid. Efforts to buy parts of the European energy grid might be set back as some EU officials believe Russia needs European firms' goodwill and investment in its energy infrastructure. Concerns arise that Germany could become too reliant on Russian energy, potentially distancing itself from EU partners and the US. East European states fear unreliable and expensive energy supplies from Gazprom. Former deals between the Schroeder government and Gazprom are cited as examples. Some governments are concerned about Russia's control over Gazprom and its pricing policies, which they see as prioritizing profits over market forces. Gazprom has raised gas prices significantly for countries like Ukraine, using its monopoly power to dictate terms. Similar tactics have been used towards Georgia, Lithuania, and Belarus. In 2003, Putin acknowledged Gazprom's political and economic influence globally. Putin's successor, Medvedev, was the president of Gazprom, hinting at a continuation of Russia's aggressive energy policy. NATO could help build international solidarity in case of energy disruptions. NATO's military capability could be compromised if Russia cuts European energy supplies. NATO may coordinate policies among member states to counter energy disruptions and provide security for infrastructure. NATO could provide security for infrastructure in energy-producing states facing unrest. Iran threatens to use energy reserves for political objectives and may cut off supplies in response to sanctions. Central Asian and Middle Eastern countries with unstable political situations need energy infrastructure investment and secure transportation systems. Some of these countries are part of NATO's Partnership for Peace program or seek closer ties with NATO. NATO member states increasingly view the alliance as a global player with global partners. NATO's role in energy security involves partnering with countries like Australia and New Zealand to bring stability in regions like Afghanistan. The focus is on diversifying energy supply through secure pipelines, with Turkey potentially playing a key role. Joint investment efforts with energy producers like Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan are seen as important steps in this direction. The development of LNG transport facilities from distant suppliers like Nigeria into Europe, along with the construction of new oil and gas pipelines, could be supported by NATO and EU members to provide security for energy infrastructure during periods of unrest. NATO governments have previously been involved in military efforts to secure energy resources, as seen in the first Gulf War involving key member states like the United States, France, Britain, and Italy. During the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, NATO states conducted Operation Earnest Will to protect tanker traffic in the Gulf. Iran and Iraq attacked neutral oil tankers to cut off financial support, leading to a coalition formed by the Reagan Administration, primarily from NATO, to safeguard tanker traffic. The offer to reflag Kuwaiti vessels under the USSR and U.S. flags was accepted after attacks on Kuwaiti and Saudi tankers. During the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, NATO states conducted Operation Earnest Will to protect tanker traffic in the Gulf. The coalition, including Britain, France, and the Netherlands, captured Iranian vessels mining shipping lanes and engaged in firefights with Iranian troops using oil platforms. NATO governments discussed potential actions to protect tanker traffic and oil platforms in case of future disruptions. The 110th Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to raise vehicle fuel efficiency standards and promote the use of alternative fuels for energy security. In November 2006, Senator Lugar emphasized the importance of energy security as a mutual security issue. NATO is evolving into a global security organization, focusing on protecting the interests of the US, Canada, and Europe, while also engaging non-member states. The role of NATO in energy security is uncertain, with some members preferring a greater role for the EU. However, a political role for NATO in energy security is likely in the near future. NATO has initiated discussions with Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, and the UAE under the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative of 2004. The allies are in discussions with Middle Eastern countries like Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, and the UAE to enhance security cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism. NATO may also consider providing security for energy infrastructure in Partnership for Peace countries like Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan to reduce Russian influence and ensure stability in the region. The EU is divided over its reliance on Russian oil and gas, with some member states advocating for increased investment in energy infrastructure. The EU is divided over its reliance on Russian oil and gas. Poland is exploring a role for NATO and the United States in ensuring energy security, potentially using U.S. leverage on Moscow. Some EU governments prefer market forces for energy access, while others advocate for a well-structured commercial partnership with Russia. The EU3 and the United States are working to curtail Iran's nuclear program before considering NATO's involvement in energy security. Some NATO partner governments in Central Asia and the Middle East may resist allied assistance in securing vital resources due to beliefs that the US invaded Iraq for oil. Popular opposition may hinder NATO efforts to protect energy infrastructure in these regions. Security challenges in Iraq raise concerns about NATO's ability to secure pipelines. Russia's influence could pressure countries like Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan to reject NATO assistance in energy security."
