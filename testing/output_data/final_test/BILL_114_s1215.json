    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Methane Hydrate Research and Development Amendments Act of 2015\" and includes amendments to the Methane Hydrate Research and Development Act of 2000. The Methane Hydrate Research and Development Act of 2000 is amended to address the exchange of methane between terrestrial reservoirs and the atmosphere, highlighting its impact on global climate change. The Act also emphasizes the environmental effects of methane release from arctic or marine reservoirs. The Methane Hydrate Research and Development Act of 2000 is amended to allow the Secretary to award grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements for research on methane hydrate as an energy source. This includes identifying and characterizing methane hydrate resources using remote sensing and seismic data. The Methane Hydrate Research and Development Amendments Act of 2015 aims to develop technologies for efficient and environmentally sound methane hydrate resource development. It includes conducting research on environmental impacts, developing drilling risk reduction technologies, and exploratory drilling activities. The Methane Hydrate Research and Development Amendments Act of 2015 authorizes exploratory drilling and production testing operations on permafrost and nonpermafrost gas hydrates in the United States Arctic region and marine environments within specified timeframes. The Methane Hydrate Research and Development Amendments Act of 2015 authorizes drilling a full-scale production test well and expanding education and training programs in methane hydrate research. The Secretary is also required to conduct long-term environmental monitoring to study the effects of production from methane hydrate reservoirs. Funding will be allocated based on competitive peer review. The Methane Hydrate Research and Development Act of 2000 is amended to require competitive peer review for research proposals and authorize appropriations for methane hydrate research. Authorization of appropriations is granted to the Secretary to carry out the Methane Hydrate Research and Development Act of 2000."
