    "content": "The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), P.L. 107-155 (H.R. 2356, 107th Congress) significantly amended federal campaign finance law. Senator Mitch McConnell and the National Rifle Association filed suits against the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) arguing that portions of BCRA violate the First Amendment and the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Eleven suits challenging the law were brought by more than 80 plaintiffs. Eleven suits challenging the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 were consolidated into one lead case, McConnell v. FEC. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia struck down many provisions of the law, but its ruling was stayed pending Supreme Court review. The Supreme Court expedited the case, heard oral arguments in September, and issued its decision in December. In McConnell v. FEC, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld key portions of BCRA, including limits on political party soft money and the prohibition on corporations and labor unions using treasury funds for electioneering communications. Ads must now be paid for with PAC funds, known as hard money. The McConnell Court upheld key parts of BCRA, including limits on political party soft money and the ban on corporations using treasury funds for election ads. The Court acknowledged that campaign finance issues will continue to arise, with corresponding legislative responses from Congress in the future. The McConnell Court upheld key parts of BCRA, including limits on political party soft money. Title I of BCRA prohibits national party committees from using soft money and restricts their involvement in federal elections. The Court upheld the constitutionality of Title I of BCRA, which prohibits state and local candidates from using soft money for advertisements promoting or attacking federal candidates. The provisions were found to satisfy the First Amendment test for limiting campaign contributions to prevent corruption. The Court applied \"closely drawn\" scrutiny in evaluating the constitutionality of Title I of BCRA, upholding restrictions on campaign expenditures to prevent corruption and maintain public confidence in the electoral process. The Court showed deference to Congress' expertise in weighing constitutional interests. The Court upheld restrictions on campaign expenditures in Title I of BCRA, citing Congress' authority and expertise in regulating in this area since 1976. It deemed irrelevant whether Congress regulated contributions on the demand or supply side, focusing instead on whether limits burden speech. The Court upheld restrictions on campaign expenditures in Title I of BCRA, citing Congress' authority and expertise in regulating in this area since 1976. It concluded that Title I only burdens speech to the extent of a contribution limit, limiting the source and individual amount of donations. The Court rejected the dissenting Justice's view that Congress' regulatory interest is limited to preventing quid pro quo corruption, emphasizing the danger of the appearance of corruption in political fundraising. Title II of BCRA introduced the concept of \"electioneering communication\" in FECA, targeting broadcast communications referring to federal candidates close to elections. It prohibits corporations and labor unions from using general treasury funds for such communications to prevent corruption in decision-making influenced by financial contributors. The Court upheld the constitutionality of FECA's provision that electioneering communications must be paid for with regulated hard money from corporate and labor union PACs. Buckley v. Valeo interpreted FECA's requirements to apply only to communications with express advocacy for or against a candidate. Lower courts have since ruled that without express advocacy, communications are considered issue advocacy protected by the First Amendment. The McConnell Court overturned lower court rulings by holding that the regulation of \"electioneering communications\" under BCRA is permissible, even if they do not contain express advocacy. The Court found that the distinction between express and issue advocacy in Buckley was a matter of statutory interpretation, not a constitutional requirement. The presence or absence of magic words does not distinguish electioneering speech from true issue advocacy. The Court found that the absence of magic words does not distinguish electioneering speech from true issue advocacy under BCRA. It concluded that the regulation is not a complete ban on expression but a regulation, allowing corporations and labor unions to use separate segregated funds for electioneering communications. The Court also determined that the regulation is not overbroad as the majority of ads during the electioneering communication time period serve an electioneering purpose. Additionally, the segregated fund requirement was not deemed under-inclusive as it applies to broadcast advertisements, not print or Internet communications. The McConnell Court upheld BCRA's extension of the prohibition on using treasury funds for financing electioneering communications to non-profit corporations, despite the absence of an express exemption for organizations meeting the criteria established in a previous Supreme Court decision. Congress was found to be permitted to address problems in a step-by-step manner, focusing on the issue of corporations and unions using soft money for televised election-related ads. In the 2007 decision FEC v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. (WRTL II), the Supreme Court ruled that Title II of BCRA was unconstitutional as applied to certain ads. The Court limited the law's application by stating that ads not explicitly advocating for or against a candidate cannot be regulated. Additionally, the Court invalidated BCRA's requirement for political parties to choose between coordinated and independent expenditures, as it was deemed to restrict parties' right to make unlimited independent expenditures. The Supreme Court invalidated BCRA's prohibition on individuals age 17 or younger making contributions, finding it burdens the right to make unlimited independent expenditures. The Court determined that minors have First Amendment protection and that contribution limits impinge on their rights."
