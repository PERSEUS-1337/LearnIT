Congress finds that significant quantities of rare earths are essential for clean energy technologies and modern defense technologies. Rare earths are also crucial for high technology applications in computing and pollution control. Rare earths are essential for various high technology applications in computing, pollution control, power generation, water treatment, oil refining, metal alloying, communications, health care, and agriculture. Despite the US and its allies having 40% of the world's rare earth reserves, the country relies on imports for almost 100% of its rare earth needs. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. ACTIONS TO PROMOTE RARE EARTH DEVELOPMENT.\" is about specific actions being taken to promote the development of rare earth minerals. Establishment of the Rare Earth Policy Task Force within the Department of the Interior, composed of key government officials to report to the President. The Rare Earth Policy Task Force, established within the Department of the Interior, includes key government officials such as the Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of State, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality. The Task Force's duties involve assisting Federal agencies in reviewing laws and policies that hinder investment in domestic rare earths. The Rare Earth Policy Task Force, established within the Department of the Interior, is responsible for reviewing laws and policies that hinder investment in domestic rare earths. The Task Force must submit an annual report identifying laws and regulations that restrict projects increasing investment in domestic rare earths. The Task Force will terminate 10 years after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 4. RARE EARTH MATERIALS PROGRAM PLAN. The Secretary of the Interior is required to prepare and submit a plan for research, development, and commercial application of rare earth materials to ensure a secure supply for national security and economic needs. The plan must include details on research activities and their expected contributions to innovative methods and technologies. The plan for research on rare earth materials aims to develop innovative methods for sustainable provision to the domestic economy and promote broad participation. The Secretary of the Interior will consult with industry and academic representatives in preparing the plan, which will support activities to better characterize virgin stocks of rare earth materials. The plan for research on rare earth materials aims to develop innovative methods for sustainable provision to the domestic economy. It includes exploring, discovering, and recovering rare earth materials using advanced science and technology, improving extraction and processing methods, testing alternative materials, and engineering applications using recycled or alternative materials. Additionally, it involves improving understanding of performance and adaptability in engineering designs and collecting information on rare earth materials. The plan for research on rare earth materials aims to support scientific and technical data generation, promote information sharing and collaboration, and improve processes and technologies in the industry. It also encourages multidisciplinary collaborations and provides opportunities for students at institutions. The plan for research on rare earth materials includes opportunities for students at higher education institutions and collaboration with foreign agencies interested in rare earth materials. It aligns with the National Materials and Minerals Policy, Research and Development Act of 1980."
