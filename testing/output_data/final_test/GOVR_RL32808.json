    "content": "The individual income tax is the primary federal revenue source, followed by Social Security and payroll taxes. Corporate income tax is a distant third. The tax is based on various earnings sources including wages, interest, dividends, capital gains, and more. Adjustments to income are made, such as contributions to retirement accounts and alimony payments, to calculate adjusted gross income (AGI). The process of calculating adjusted gross income (AGI) for federal income tax involves deductions known as \"above the line\" deductions, available to all taxpayers. These deductions include home mortgage interest, state and local taxes, charitable contributions, and medical expenses. Taxpayers can choose between standard or itemized deductions, with exemptions further reducing the tax base. Additionally, state and local sales taxes can be deducted instead of income taxes for certain years. The tax liability of a taxpayer is determined by their taxable income, which is calculated by subtracting personal and dependent exemptions from AGI. Exemptions are fixed amounts allowed for the taxpayer, spouse, and dependents. Taxable income is AGI reduced by deductions and exemptions. Tax liability varies based on filing status, with four main categories. The income tax system is progressive, with rates increasing as income rises. The individual income tax system is designed to be progressive, with marginal tax rates increasing as income rises. Currently, there are seven marginal income tax rates ranging from 10% to 39.6%. Tax credits, such as the earned income tax credit and child tax credit, are subtracted from gross tax liability to determine a taxpayer's final tax liability. The individual income tax system is progressive with marginal tax rates ranging from 10% to 39.6%. Long-term capital gains and qualified dividend income are taxed at lower rates. Net investment income is subject to an additional tax for high-income taxpayers. Income is defined using the Haig-Simons comprehensive income definitions, which include changes in a taxpayer's ability to consume. Transfer payments are also subject to taxation. In addition to labor and capital income, various forms of income are excluded from taxable income, such as contributions to employee pension and health insurance plans. Employer contributions to Social Security are also excluded. Pensions are included in income based on previously excluded contributions. Some Social Security benefits and passive capital income like capital gains, interest, and dividends are taxed. Income from various sources such as interest, dividends, and operating a business is subject to taxation. Capital gains are only taxed upon realization, while interest income is taxed annually. Tax rates vary based on the type of income, with tax-exempt securities and qualified dividends taxed at lower rates. Income from operating a business or rental property is also taxable. Income from various sources such as interest, dividends, and operating a business is subject to taxation. This income is the net of gross receipts reduced by deductible costs like labor payments, depreciation, and interest. Some small business investment income receives favorable treatment through expensing capital equipment costs. Miscellaneous income like gambling winnings and royalties are also included in the tax base. Adjustments are made to determine adjusted gross income (AGI), which is then used to calculate taxable income by subtracting deductions and exemptions. Individuals can choose between the standard deduction or itemized deductions, along with an exemption. Adjusted gross income includes standard deduction or itemized deductions, along with exemptions for family members. Personal exemptions and standard deductions were adjusted for inflation from 2006 to 2014. The phaseout of personal exemptions for high-income taxpayers was gradually reduced under EGTRRA and completely repealed in 2010. PEP was extended through 2012 under P.L. 111-312 and reinstated under ATRA. For 2014, personal exemptions phase out for single taxpayers with AGI above $254,200. For high-income taxpayers, personal exemptions and itemized deductions are phased out as adjusted gross income exceeds certain thresholds. The Pease limitation on itemized deductions was repealed in 2010 but reinstated in 2013 for certain taxpayers. In 2014, itemized deductions begin to phase out once AGI exceeds $254,200 for single filers, $279,650 for head of household filers, and $305,050 for married taxpayers filing jointly. The Pease limitation on itemized deductions applies to high-income taxpayers, starting to phase out deductions once AGI exceeds certain thresholds. The limitation reduces total deductions by 3% of AGI exceeding the threshold, capped at 80% of deductions. Certain deductions like medical expenses and investment interest are not subject to this limitation. Tax rate schedules for individuals include joint, single, and head of household returns, with married couples having the option to file separately. The 2014 income tax rate schedules were set as part of the American Taxpayer Relief Act. Tax rate schedules were set as part of the American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA; P.L. 112-240). Income from long-term capital gains and dividends is taxed at lower rates, with a maximum rate of 20%. Taxpayers in different tax brackets face varying tax rates on long-term capital gains and dividends, ranging from 0% to 20%. Various tax provisions are available depending on income levels, such as the earned income tax credit (EITC) which reduces a taxpayer's marginal tax rate as income increases. Tax credits reduce a taxpayer's marginal tax rate as income increases. Higher-income individuals may face the alternative minimum tax (AMT) with marginal rates of 26% and 28%. Tax credits offset tax liability dollar-for-dollar, with refundable and non-refundable types available. Refundable credits can result in a payment from the government if the credit exceeds tax liability. Tax credits can be refundable or non-refundable, with the child tax credit being refundable for most families. Unused credits can sometimes be carried forward to future tax years. Non-refundable credits offer limited benefits to lower-income individuals. Credits phase out as income increases, with varying phaseout points. The child tax credit allows up to $1,000 per qualifying child, with increases over the years. The child tax credit was increased to $1,000 and made partially refundable through legislation in 2001, 2003, and 2004. The credit was made permanent at $1,000 per qualifying child by the American Taxpayer Relief Act, with provisions for greater refundability extended through 2017. The credit is at least partially refundable for taxpayers with earnings over $3,000, phased out for higher income families, and covers costs of paid care for dependents. The maximum credit rate is 35% of costs, capped at $3,000 for one dependent and $6,000 for two or more dependents. The earned income tax credit (EITC) supplements wages for lower-income families and individuals. It is a major component of the federal government's poverty reduction strategy and is the largest anti-poverty cash entitlement program. The maximum credit amount for taxpayers with three or more children in 2014 is $6,143. The EITC is refundable and phases in for lower-income taxpayers, phasing out as incomes exceed certain thresholds. The EITC phases out for families with three or more children once income reaches $23,260 and is fully phased out at $52,427. The Hope credit and Lifetime Learning credit were added in 1997, with the AOTC replacing the Hope credit from 2009 to 2017. The AOTC offers a maximum credit of $2,500 per student for the first four years of college. Both credits phase out for higher-income individuals. The Lifetime Learning credit provides a 20% credit on costs up to $10,000 for qualified tuition and related expenses. The Lifetime Learning credit offers a 20% credit on costs up to $10,000 for qualified tuition and related expenses, capped at $2,000. It is nonrefundable and phases out for higher-income individuals. Taxpayers may also be subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT), which involves adding back certain tax items to regular taxable income and applying a two-tiered rate structure of 26% and 28% against AMT taxable income. The American Taxpayer Relief Act made provisions allowing most nonrefundable personal tax credits against the AMT. Table 3 shows marginal corporate tax rates for U.S. firms, with smaller firms facing a progressive tax schedule and larger firms facing higher marginal tax rates. The corporate income tax is based on net income, which is gross revenue minus deductible costs like materials, interest, and wages. Depreciation is also a deductible cost. Wages are excluded from the tax base, as they are tax deductible. The tax rates for larger corporations have \"bubble\" brackets that increase their effective tax rate. The corporate income tax is based on net income, which is gross revenue minus deductible costs like materials, interest, and wages. Depreciation is also a deductible cost. Wages are excluded from the tax base, as they are tax deductible. The return to debt capital is excluded from the corporate tax base, while the return to equity capital is included. This tax structure favors non-corporate investment over corporate investment. The corporate income tax favors non-corporate investment and owner-occupied housing over corporate investment. It also favors corporate debt over corporate equity investment. The tax burden spreads to all owners of capital, including owners of unincorporated businesses, bondholders, and homeowners. Corporate profits are subject to separate taxation due to being taxed twice, once at the corporate level and once under individual income tax. Taxes on corporate profits can steer investment away from the corporate sector. Some argue for integrating corporate and individual income taxes, while others support maintaining separate taxation to prevent tax shelters and enhance progressivity. Integration may pose administrative challenges and the corporate tax has public support. The corporate tax has public support and raises significant revenue. Various tax acts have reduced rates on corporate-source dividends and capital gains. The top rate on capital gains and dividends rose to 20% for high-income taxpayers under the American Taxpayer Relief Act. The 15% maximum rate on capital gains and dividends was permanently extended, funded by payroll taxes for programs like Social Security and Medicare. These taxes make up the largest share of federal payroll taxes, with a combined rate of 15.3% paid by both employees and employers. In 2014, Social Security tax was levied on the first $118,500 of wages, while Medicare tax applies to all wages. A temporary payroll tax cut reduced employees' share to 4.2% in 2011, scheduled to expire later. The temporary reduction in payroll tax rate was extended through 2012 before expiring. Federal estate tax is imposed on property transferred at death, with a base on the estate. The federal estate tax is applied on property transferred at death, with deductions and exemptions reducing the taxable estate. The tax rate is 40% in 2013, with a credit exempting the first $5.34 million in 2014. The estate tax was repealed in 2010 under the EGTRRA, but was scheduled to return to pre-EGTRRA rates in 2011. In 2010, the estate tax was set to return to pre-EGTRRA rates in 2011, but the Tax Relief Act established a $5 million exemption and 35% rate for 2010 and 2011. The American Taxpayer Relief Act made the exemption permanent at $5 million (adjusted for inflation) with a 40% rate. The federal gift tax complements the estate tax, allowing for a $14,000 exclusion per individual in 2014. The estate and gift taxes are unified with the same rates and unified credit amount applying to cumulative taxable transfers over an individual's lifetime and at death. The estate tax accounts for less than 1% of federal revenues, with roughly 0.2% of decedents facing it over the next decade. The tax is concentrated among high-income taxpayers, with 72% in the top 1%. It is defended as a way to increase the overall progressivity of the tax system by targeting those with the greatest wealth. The estate tax falls on those with the greatest wealth, but its impact on the economy is unclear. Some argue it hinders lifetime saving and capital formation. There are special rules to ease its burden on farms and small businesses, but larger estates are more likely to dispose of assets to pay the tax. Excise taxes are consumption taxes on goods and services, not income. Excise taxes are a form of consumption tax, levied on specific goods and services rather than income. Federal excise taxes are small compared to other federal taxes, amounting to 3.0% of total federal receipts in 2013. They are collected on various products at different points, with gasoline being the largest source of excise tax revenue. Other notable excise taxes include those on diesel fuel, air passengers, distilled spirits, beer, cigarettes, and telephone services. Excise taxes are paid into trust funds for various federal activities, with the largest amount going into the Highway Trust Fund. They serve fiscal purposes, raising revenue and funding expenditure programs. Some excise taxes adjust for negative externalities, ensuring that the price of products reflects their true cost to society. Excise taxes reflect the true cost of products like alcohol and tobacco to society, adjust import prices, and regulate undesirable activities. They are believed to burden consumption, especially for lower-income individuals, as producers pass on the tax through higher prices. The regressive nature of excise taxes can vary based on market conditions and consumer responses. Some argue that considering the tax's impact over an individual's lifetime reduces its regressivity. The economic efficiency effects of excise taxes vary depending on the circumstances. Excise taxes can have varying effects on economic efficiency, depending on the specific tax. While taxes targeting negative externalities may enhance efficiency, those distorting prices and consumption choices likely reduce it. In FY2013, individual income tax accounted for 47% of federal revenue, social insurance for 34%, corporate income tax for 10%, and excise taxes for 3%. Total federal revenues have ranged from 15% to 21% of GDP since the 1960s, averaging around 18% of GDP. Federal receipts as a percentage of GDP have fluctuated between 15% and 21%, with an average of approximately 18% over the years. After peaking at nearly 21% in 2000, it dropped to a low of 15% in 2009 before increasing to 16.7% in 2013. Individual income tax has been the primary source of federal revenue since the mid-1940s, but its share relative to the economy decreased from over 10% in 2000 to just over 6% in 2010, before rising to 7.9% in 2013. Corporate income tax has fallen to the third-most important revenue source over time. The U.S. public sector has a relatively small size compared to other major industrialized nations. It collects less revenue and has lower outlays relative to economic output. The U.S. public sector has a low level of outlays compared to its economic output. In 2014, the United States had the second-highest budget deficit at 5.8% of GDP. The distribution of the federal tax burden is a topic of concern and debate, with options including proportional, regressive, and progressive distributions based on income levels. The federal tax system aims for vertical equity by making higher income groups pay more taxes. Average tax rates decreased for all income groups from 2001 to 2011, with the lowest income quintile experiencing a larger decline. As a result, higher income groups contributed a larger share of federal tax liabilities in 2011 compared to 2001. Groups paid a larger share of federal tax liabilities in 2011 compared to 2001. The lowest income quintile had positive average tax rates driven by payroll taxes. The report discusses tax expenditures, capital gains, marriage tax consequences, tax deferral, and depreciation. These concepts have implications for tax liability. Tax expenditures, special tax deductions, credits, and other benefits, impact tax liability. The top 10 individual tax expenditures account for 70% of total expenditures. In 2013, individual tax expenditures totaled $1,140 billion, a significant amount compared to projected individual income tax receipts of $1,264 billion. Tax expenditures in 2013 are projected to be $1,264 billion, a significant amount compared to total income tax receipts. It is important to note that tax expenditures measure the revenue effects of provisions on a cash flow basis, which may not reflect the true benefit to the taxpayer. Capital gains or losses can result from the sale or exchange of a capital asset, with long-term assets held for more than 12 months and short-term assets held for 12 months or less. The holding period for long-term assets is 12 months or more, while short-term assets are held for less than 12 months. Capital gains on short-term assets are taxed at regular income tax rates. The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act reduced the maximum tax rate on long-term capital gains income. The tax rate on capital gains was 0% for those in the 10% and 15% tax brackets from 2008 to 2010. The maximum capital gains tax rate was reduced to 15% for taxpayers in higher income tax brackets. These changes were effective from May 6, 2003, to January 1, 2009, and extended through 2010 by subsequent legislation. The Unemployment Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended reduced rates on long-term capital gains through 2012. The top tax rate on long-term capital gains was increased to 20% for single taxpayers with income above $400,000. Taxpayers with MAGI above $200,000 will be subject to a 3.8% tax on net investment income starting in 2013. The Medicare contribution tax was enacted as part of the Heath Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. Economists argue that lowering capital gains taxes could reduce \"lock-in\" effects and allow capital to flow more efficiently. Reducing capital gains taxes could lead to more realizations, potentially offsetting some of the cost. Alternative solutions to reduce lock-in include taxing capital gains on an accrual basis or at death, but face technical challenges. Cutting capital gains taxes has been a topic of debate. Reducing capital gains taxes is debated due to its potential impact on savings rates and economic growth. While some argue it could stimulate investment, evidence suggests a limited response in savings to tax cuts. Economists believe cutting capital gains taxes may not provide immediate economic stimulus, but there could be a case for reducing taxes on corporate stock to address double taxation issues. Cutting capital gains taxes is debated for its impact on savings rates and economic growth, with concerns about tax distortions on dividends. Critics argue that reducing these taxes would mainly benefit high-income individuals due to the concentration of capital gains among them. The federal tax system's treatment of married couples can lead to either a marriage tax penalty or bonus, violating principles of marriage neutrality and horizontal equity. The structural factors affecting marriage neutrality in the income tax system include the earned income tax credit (EITC), marginal tax rate schedules, and phaseout of credits and deductions for higher-income individuals. Differences in tax rate schedules for single individuals, heads of households, and married couples create marriage tax bonuses and penalties. Couples with evenly divided earned income are more likely to face marriage tax penalties, with the largest penalties for couples where each spouse earns 50% of the total income. In 2003, the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (JGTRRA) accelerated provisions initially introduced in the Economic Growth and Tax Relief. Couples with evenly divided earned income are more likely to face marriage tax penalties, with the largest penalties for couples where each spouse earns 50% of the total income. Married couples can experience marriage tax bonuses or penalties based on their income distribution. The JGTRRA accelerated provisions from the EGTRRA to reduce the marriage tax penalty by doubling the standard deduction for married couples filing jointly and extending the 15% bracket income level. These measures were initially temporary but were extended through various acts until made permanent by the ATRA. The JGTRRA accelerated provisions from the EGTRRA to reduce the marriage tax penalty for some couples, but higher-income and low- to middle-income couples with children still face this penalty. Achieving equity in income tax involves not influencing marital status choice, being progressive, and taxing couples with equal income equally. The current tax system prioritizes progressivity and equal taxation over marriage neutrality, but there is no clear answer on which equity goal is most important. The issue of tax deferral arises when income is taxed at a later time, affecting the tax rate on the income. This can occur due to timing differences between when income is earned and when expenses are incurred. Tax deferral is beneficial for capital gains, where taxes are assessed when gains are realized, not as they accrue. The investment in an asset appreciates at a rate of 10% per annum. By the end of the second year, it is worth $121. Assuming a 15% tax rate, a tax of $3.15 would be levied on the realized appreciation, resulting in an after-tax return of $17.85. Comparatively, a $100 investment in an interest-bearing account earning a 10% rate of return with no deferral would yield an after-tax return of $17.72 over a two-year period. The investment in an asset yielding capital gains income earns a higher after-tax return than an investment in an interest-bearing account due to tax deferral benefits. Tax deferral impacts various areas of tax policy, such as retirement account contributions and foreign source income taxation. When a business purchases a tangible asset, it is simply exchanging one asset for another, not incurring a cost. The tax code allows businesses to gradually deduct the full acquisition cost of an asset over several years through depreciation. Rules govern the rate at which depreciation deductions can be claimed, including specifying a recovery period and depreciation method for different types of assets. Depreciation is a cost that reflects the decline in value of assets as they age or become outdated. Depreciation deductions are distributed over the recovery period using different methods. Straight-line method spreads equal deductions each year, while declining balance methods deduct larger shares in earlier years. Tax rules governing depreciation timing are crucial as earlier deductions provide more value due to the time value of money. Accelerated depreciation offers a tax benefit, while slower deductions result in a tax penalty. The tax treatment of depreciation can result in either a tax benefit or penalty depending on the rate at which deductions are claimed compared to the actual depreciation of assets. Bonus depreciation allowances and different forms of business organization under the Internal Revenue Code can further impact depreciation timing and tax incentives for using certain types of assets in production processes. The tax treatment of different forms of business organization varies, including C corporations, S corporations, partnerships, and sole proprietorships. C corporations are subject to corporate income tax, while S corporations pass on profits to shareholders without corporate income tax. Shareholders' liabilities in corporations are limited to their stake in the company. Limited liability companies (LLCs) have characteristics of both partnerships and corporations. LLCs can elect to be taxed as a partnership or corporation under IRS regulations. S corporations pass profits to individual shareholders without corporate income tax, while partnerships have multiple owners and some convey liability for debts not limited to partners' contributions. Limited liability companies (LLCs) can elect to be taxed as partnerships or corporations under IRS regulations. Other business entities include real estate investment trusts (REITs) and regulated investment companies (RICs), which have specific tax benefits. Sole proprietorships have only one owner and are taxed under individual income tax, not corporate income tax. Competitiveness in taxation is complex and can be defined in various ways. Tax measures may not necessarily enhance competitiveness, and some provisions aimed at improving U.S. economic performance may actually reduce welfare. Individuals and firms may view competitiveness as the ability to withstand foreign competition and may suggest tax benefits like favorable depreciation rules or tax credits to boost their industry. Such measures could lower costs and improve the targeted industry's position. The targeted tax benefit aims to improve the position of the industry by reducing costs, potentially leading to lower prices, increased market share, and more jobs. However, economic theory suggests that the effects of such targeted benefits may disrupt the overall competitiveness of the economy by reshuffling resources, leading to declines in other sectors. Market forces, not tax rules, are usually more effective in ensuring efficient resource allocation. Tax rules are the best way to ensure efficient resource allocation. A broader view of competitiveness at the national level may focus on the country's ability to sell exports. Implementing an export subsidy may initially increase exports, but exchange rate adjustments can negate any positive effects by making exports more expensive and imports cheaper. This can lead to a decrease in exports and an increase in imports, ultimately erasing any trade balance improvements. Taxes can impact trade balance by altering capital flows, not directly through exports or imports. For example, a tax cut on business investment in the US can increase foreign capital inflows, leading to a decrease in net US exports. Tax cuts that increase the federal budget deficit can raise real interest rates, attracting more foreign capital and expanding the trade deficit. Conversely, a tax increase that reduces the budget deficit can decrease the trade deficit. There are also questions about whether tax preferences on capital can enhance competitiveness for U.S. firms by making them more competitive abroad. Economic theory suggests that a neutral tax policy is more beneficial for economic performance."
