    "content": "The \"Buy American Improvement Act of 2003\" may be cited as the short title. Requirements for waivers are outlined in the Act. The Buy American Act is amended to include special rules such as a public interest waiver and preference for domestic bidders. The Buy American Act now includes a preference for companies manufacturing in the United States when submitting offers for contracts, even if their offer is similar to a non-domestic company's offer. This preference also applies when the company is the sole manufacturer in the U.S. for the requested article, material, or supply, regardless of whether the items are intended for use outside the country. Before entering into a contract for acquiring articles, materials, or supplies for use outside the United States, a cost analysis must be conducted to compare the cost of acquiring from a U.S. manufacturer versus a foreign manufacturer, including shipping costs. Before entering into a contract for acquiring articles, materials, or supplies for use outside the United States, a cost analysis must be conducted to compare the cost of acquiring from a U.S. manufacturer versus a foreign manufacturer, including shipping costs. The head of a Federal agency may not determine that an article is not domestically available unless a study shows domestic production cannot meet procurement needs and a comparable item is not available from a U.S. company. Reports must be submitted by each agency within 60 days after the fiscal year ends. Each fiscal year, Federal agencies must report to Congress on acquisitions from entities outside the United States. The report must include the dollar value of waived articles, a list of waivers granted, and details of all acquisitions. The information must be made publicly available. Federal agencies must make reports publicly available by posting them on an Internet website. The Buy American Act's definition of \"Federal agency\" is clarified to include executive agencies and certain branches of government. The Buy American Act requires that products be predominantly made in the United States, with domestic components exceeding 75 percent. Amendments to the Act include changing references from \"department or independent establishment\" to \"Federal agency.\" Amendment to the Buy American Act changes references from \"department or independent establishment\" to \"Federal agency\" in Section 633 of the National Military Establishment Appropriations Act, 1950. The Comptroller General of the United States will provide recommendations to Congress on determining unreasonable cost and inconsistency with the public interest for applying waivers under the Buy American Act. The report will also include suggestions for defining unreasonable cost and establishing consistent waiver procedures. Additionally, there will be a focus on dual-use technologies. The head of a Federal agency cannot contract with a foreign entity for dual-use technologies without approval under the Export Administration Act and Regulations."
