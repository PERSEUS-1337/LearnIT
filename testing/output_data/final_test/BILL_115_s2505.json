    "content": "The \"Worker Dividend Act of 2018\" is a new chapter in the Internal Revenue Code that addresses the failure of employers to pay worker dividends. The \"Worker Dividend Act of 2018\" imposes a tax on covered employers who fail to pay worker dividends when repurchasing securities. A worker dividend is a payment made to employees that is not less than the amount spent on repurchasing securities. The \"Worker Dividend Act of 2018\" imposes a tax on covered employers who fail to pay worker dividends when repurchasing securities. The tax is based on a percentage of the employer's earnings exceeding $250,000,000 in the United States during the taxable year. Payments must be in addition to regular compensation and equal for all employees in the U.S. The \"Worker Dividend Act of 2018\" requires covered employers to pay worker dividends based on a pro rata amount for part-time employees. Payments must be made within 60 days of the close of the taxable year. Employers have the option to increase compensation instead of paying dividends, with proper documentation required. The \"Worker Dividend Act of 2018\" mandates covered employers to pay worker dividends or increase compensation within 1 calendar year of the increase going into effect. Covered employers are entities with publicly traded stock. Regulations will be issued to ensure compliance, including determining full-time status and preventing avoidance of the law's purposes. The \"Worker Dividend Act of 2018\" requires covered employers to report worker dividends and other information to the Secretary and the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission for any taxable year in which securities are repurchased. A clerical amendment is made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Effective Date: The amendments apply to repurchases of employer securities in taxable years beginning after the enactment of this Act."
