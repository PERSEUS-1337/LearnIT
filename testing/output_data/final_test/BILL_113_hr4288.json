Congress finds that opioid overdoses have significantly increased in the United States, with deaths from drug overdose tripling among men and increasing fivefold among women in the past decade. Drug overdoses now claim more lives than car accidents nationwide. Timely administration of opioid overdose drugs can prevent deaths from heroin and other opioids, and both medical and non-medical personnel can be trained to administer these drugs effectively. Some states, like Massachusetts, have programs allowing non-medical personnel to administer opioid overdose drugs, saving lives. The purpose of this Act is to save lives by providing protections from civil liability for the emergency administration of opioid overdose drugs by medical and non-medical personnel. SEC. 3.
