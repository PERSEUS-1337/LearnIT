    "content": "The \"Grazing Improvement Act of 2011\" amends the terms of grazing permits and leases by extending the duration from 10 years to 20 years. It also introduces provisions for the renewal, transfer, and reissuance of grazing permits and leases under Title IV of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. The section defines \"environmental analysis\" as assessments required by the National Environmental Policy Act and \"Secretary concerned\" as the Agriculture or Interior Secretary. It addresses the renewal, transfer, and reissuance of grazing permits and leases issued by the Secretaries. The section outlines the renewal or reissuance of expired grazing permits or leases under specific acts, with terms and conditions continuing until completion by the concerned Secretary. Permit or lease can be cancelled, suspended, or modified. The renewal, reissuance, or transfer of grazing permits or leases can be cancelled, suspended, or modified in accordance with applicable law. Compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 may exempt certain decisions from environmental analysis if they continue current grazing management or involve minor modifications. The renewal, reissuance, or transfer of grazing permits or leases may be excluded from environmental analysis if monitoring shows current grazing management meets objectives in the land management plan and aligns with department policies on extraordinary circumstances. The Secretary has the discretion to prioritize environmental analysis for grazing allotments based on significance and available funding. This does not apply to renewals or transfers of permits that are categorically excluded from analysis. SEC. 4. APPLICABILITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT TO GRAZING APPEALS. The Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 are amended to include provisions regarding the applicability of the Administrative Procedure Act to grazing permit appeals. The Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 are amended to include provisions for grazing permit appeals, with appeals to be conducted in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act within 30 days of the decision. The Secretary's decision on a grazing permit or lease appeal is suspended until the appeal is resolved, unless there is an emergency. An applicant granted grazing use in the previous year can continue at the authorized level until the appeal is resolved."
