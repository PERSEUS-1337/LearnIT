    "content": "Activity of sensory neurons conveys stimulus information in temporal and spatial dimensions. An analytical method was developed to factorize retinal ganglion cells' spike trains into a low-dimensional representation capturing spatial and temporal information efficiently. By discounting pre-stimulus baseline activity, stimulus decoding performance was boosted in situations with strong changes in firing rate. Taking baseline into account is crucial for decoding stimulus information accurately. Our results suggest that considering the baseline is important for compactly representing neural activity. Neurons encode stimuli across time and space dimensions, requiring methods like PCA, ICA, and FA for analysis. Tensor decomposition offers a promising approach for representing neuronal activity in spatial and temporal dimensions. The method of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is used to represent single trial neuronal activity in spatial and temporal dimensions. While space-by-time NMF shows robust decoding performance, it struggles to discount baseline activity not relevant to neural responses. This approach performed well on salamander retinal ganglion cells with minimal spontaneous activity. The study proposes a variant of space-by-time NMF that discounts baseline activity by subtracting the pre-stimulus baseline from each trial. This method improves decoding performance on data from mouse and pig retinal ganglion cells. The study introduces a variant of space-by-time NMF to improve decoding performance on data from mouse and pig retinal ganglion cells. The data consists of trials of spiking activity recorded from a population of neurons in response to sensory stimuli, which are decomposed into spatial and temporal firing patterns. The study introduces tensor decomposition methods to separate spatial and temporal dimensions of neural activity. Neural activity is decomposed into spatial and temporal patterns with activation coefficients. The goal is to factorize the input signal into invariant spatial and temporal patterns across trials to minimize reconstruction. The algorithm Space-by-Time Non-negative Matrix Factorization (SbT-NMF) decomposes neural data into spatial and temporal modules with activation coefficients to capture sensory stimuli information efficiently. It provides low-dimensional data-robust representations of spike trains from salamander retinal ganglion cells. A novel decomposition algorithm, Baseline-Corrected Space-by-Time Non-negative, discounts baseline activity from neural data. The Baseline-Corrected Space-by-Time Non-negative Matrix Factorization (BC-SbT-NMF) algorithm subtracts baseline from neural activity and decomposes it into spatial, temporal modules, and activation coefficients. It addresses the challenge of factorizing signed data by using non-negative spatial and temporal modules with signed activation coefficients. The method is illustrated in Figure 1, where each trial includes spatio-temporal binned spike counts of neuron populations. The Baseline-Corrected Space-by-Time Non-negative Matrix Factorization (BC-SbT-NMF) algorithm involves subtracting the pre-stimulus firing rate baseline from neural activity and decomposing it into spatio-temporal modules representing common firing patterns. This process results in spatial modules describing coactive neurons and temporal modules representing temporal population activity patterns. The algorithm involves estimating spatial and temporal modules using iterative update rules to minimize the difference between input data and reconstructed data. It extends the derivation to a trial-based tri-factorization with non-negative and trial-independent factors, along with signed and trial-dependent factors. Regularization is included to counteract sparsity in the modules. The objective function for the algorithm involves iterative update steps for spatial and temporal modules, using a regularization parameter \u03bb. Reshaping the input data allows for matrix tri-factorization, with Lagrangian multipliers enforcing non-negativity constraints. The algorithm involves iterative update steps for spatial and temporal modules with non-negativity constraints. The update rules separate positive and negative parts of the equation to derive update steps for B spa and B tem. Reshaping input data allows for matrix tri-factorization. The algorithm involves iterative update steps for spatial and temporal modules with non-negativity constraints. The activation coefficients are updated on a trial-by-trial basis, and optimal activation coefficient matrices can be obtained by inverting the module matrices. The complete baseline-corrected space-by-time NMF algorithm includes calculating pre-stimulus firing rates and subtracting them from the data tensor elements. The algorithm involves iterative updates for spatial and temporal modules with non-negativity constraints. Activation coefficients are updated on a trial-by-trial basis, and optimal matrices can be obtained by inverting the module matrices. MATLAB code for the algorithm is available on GitHub. Performance evaluation includes using LDA on activation coefficients as predictors after separating trials into training and test sets.

Performance evaluation includes using LDA on activation coefficients as predictors after separating trials into training and test sets. The decomposition methods were applied to the training and test sets to obtain spatial and temporal modules and activation coefficients, which were then used to train LDA classifiers for decoding performance evaluation. The study involved using multi-electrode arrays to record activity from retinal ganglion cells in mouse and pig retinas under scotopic light conditions. The researchers selected optimal spatial and temporal module numbers for decoding performance, finding no improvement with non-zero regularization parameter \u03bb. All results were reported for \u03bb = 0, in accordance with international standards. The experimental procedures involved recording from retinal ganglion cells in mouse and pig retinas under scotopic light conditions. Stimulation protocols included natural movies, dance clips, and flickering screens with high and low contrast. Screen-brightness values were selected from Gaussian distributions for high and low contrast flicker stimuli. Full-field steps of light were presented with specific brightness sequences. Stimulus classes were defined by cutting continuous stimuli into 1-second intervals and randomly dividing the dataset for training and testing. The study involved training decoder modules on half of the trials and testing on the other half to evaluate decoding performance. Spike train was discretized for decoding retinal ganglion cell responses with and without considering pre-stimulus baseline firing rate. Low-dimensional representations of ganglion cell activity were obtained using NMF methods, and an LDA-classifier was used to decode visual stimuli. Both methods identified non-negative spatial and temporal modules in neural population responses. The study involved training decoder modules on half of the trials and testing on the other half to evaluate decoding performance. Spike train was discretized for decoding retinal ganglion cell responses with and without considering pre-stimulus baseline firing rate. NMF methods identified non-negative spatial and temporal modules in neural population responses. The spatial modules show simultaneous firing of groups of neurons during flicker stimulation, while the temporal modules show elongated temporal periods of population activity over 1-second intervals relative to the onset time of the stimulus class. SbT-NMF modules are sparser than BC-SbT-NMF modules but have similar shapes, forming compact dimensionality-reduced representations of the trials. In the next section, a classifier will be trained on activation coefficients to evaluate decoding performance on a separate test set. An LDA decoder was applied to single trial activation coefficients to assess the information carried about visual stimuli. Different decomposition methods were used to identify low-dimensional representations of retinal ganglion cell activity. Decoding performance was evaluated on a separate test set to avoid overfitting. Spatiotemporal PCA, ICA, and orthogonal Tucker-2 were also utilized to obtain additional representations. The study utilized various decomposition methods to obtain low-dimensional representations of retinal ganglion cell activity. Test set decoding performances of these methods were compared, with BC SbT-NMF and SbT-NMF showing higher performance for certain stimulus conditions. Both algorithms captured more information for movie and high contrast stimuli compared to step of light and low contrast stimuli. The study compared decoding performance of BC-SbT-NMF and SbT-NMF based on stimulus-elicited changes in firing rate. BC-SbT-NMF performed better for high rate changes, while SbT-NMF leaned towards better performance for low rate changes. The difference in decoding performance was significant for high rate changes. The BC-SbT-NMF method showed a significant performance increase compared to SbT-NMF for high rate changes in decoding neural population spike trains. This novel computational approach decomposes single trial spike trains into spatial and temporal firing patterns and activation coefficients, discounting pre-stimulus baseline activity. The introduction of signed activation coefficients widens the applicability of the method. The extension of the decomposition algorithm widens its applicability by allowing the decomposition of inherently signed data. This method retains the advantages of the original space-by-time NMF decomposition, providing low-dimensional representations of neural activity that carry stimulus information from both spatial and temporal dimensions. Non-negativity constraints are used for spatial and temporal modules, enabling the identification of parts-based representations of concurrent spatial and temporal firing activity. Another tensor decomposition algorithm has been introduced recently with the capacity to factorize signed data, differing from the method described. Our algorithm extends the space-by-time NMF decomposition without introducing additional constraints, allowing for comparison with the original algorithm. It relaxes the non-negativity constraint for activation coefficients, improving performance with baseline-correction. BC-SbT-NMF outperformed SbT-NMF overall, but in some cases, SbT-NMF performed better. Previous studies suggest that baseline firing rate affects neural response. In some cases, the baseline can improve neural response representation and decoding performance of SbT-NMF. Future research could explore a joint factorization-decoding framework incorporating the baseline. LDA classification was used to assess decoding performance, showing that baseline-corrected SbT-NMF enhances decoding significantly. The rate-change criterion significantly improves decoding performance by selecting the best decomposition method. A relative difference of 19.18% was observed when choosing the right method based on rate change. The requirement for a substantial rate change is crucial for effective baseline-corrected activity. The Frobenius norm emphasizes high values and is sensitive to outliers when most activity is close to zero. The new method improves decoding performance by discounting spontaneous activity levels, allowing better discrimination among different stimuli based on neural responses. The original NMF algorithm struggles to fully account for the implicit baseline, leading to lower decoding performance with additional modules. The discount of the baseline in the new method improves decoding performance by avoiding unnecessary complications. The new method improves decoding performance by discounting the baseline, leading to better results in spatial and temporal modules identified by BC-SbT-NMF regularized with different sparsity constraints."
