The United States aims to cooperate with Russia to prevent the diversion of weapons of mass destruction and related materials. The focus is on priority threat reduction and non-proliferation goals in existing cooperative programs. The United States aims to cooperate with Russia on threat reduction and non-proliferation goals through efficient and effective initiatives. Organizational and procedural changes are considered to ensure a consistent approach. The goal is for programs to work well, be focused, and well-managed. Key programs should be expanded to further cooperative efforts. Key programs should be expanded to further cooperative efforts, including the Department of Energy MPC&A program, Warhead and Fissile Material Transparency Program, ISTC, Redirection of Biotechnical Scientists program, and the Department of Defense Cooperative Threat Reduction project in Russia. Other programs should be adjusted, refocused, or reexamined. Other programs in the Russian Federation related to plutonium disposition, weapons-grade plutonium production, and nuclear warhead reduction should be adjusted and consolidated for cost-effectiveness and efficiency. Increased funding is recommended for key programs in US-Russia non-proliferation efforts, including the Highly Enriched Uranium Purchase Agreement, Second Line of Defense program, Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention, Fissile Materials Disposition program, Redirection of Biotechnical Scientists program, and Department of Energy Material Protection, Control, and Accounting program. The President must submit a report to Congress within six months of this Act's enactment, with recommendations to enhance US-Russia non-proliferation and threat reduction programs. Recommendations include improving contracting and procurement practices and identifying obstacles to program implementation. SEC. 3. Comprehensive inventories and data exchanges between the United States and the Russian Federation on weapons-grade material and nuclear weapons. Congress finds that inventories of weapons-grade material and warheads should be tracked to ensure accountability in the Russian Federation's inventory and to identify the sources of material or weapons used by foreign states or terrorist organizations. The United States policy is to establish comprehensive inventories and data exchanges with Russia on weapons-grade material and assembled warheads, focusing on tactical warheads that are likely targets for terrorist acquisition. The United States Government will work with Russia to develop comprehensive inventories of weapons-grade plutonium and highly enriched uranium programs and warheads, with a focus on tactical warheads and those removed from deployment. Data exchanges will be conducted with Russia on these materials, and a report on the inventory progress will be provided every six months. The President will submit a report to Congress annually on the progress towards creating a comprehensive inventory of weapons-grade plutonium and highly enriched uranium programs, to be exchanged between the United States and the Russian Federation. The Commission will assess the transition from Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) to Mutually Assured Security (MAS). The United States and the Russian Federation aim to put Cold War elements to rest by establishing a Joint Commission to transition from Mutual Assured Destruction to Mutual Assured Security. The United States delegation of the Commission, referred to as the \"Commission,\" consists of 13 members appointed by the President. Members are appointed after consultation with various congressional leaders and must be private U.S. citizens with expertise in U.S.-Russia strategic stability issues. The chair of the Commission is chosen by consensus from among its members. The President should encourage the Russian Federation to appoint a delegation to the Commission to discuss strategic nuclear weapons reduction, monitoring mechanisms, and preserving the benefits of the START II agreement. The President should encourage the Russian Federation to appoint a delegation to the Commission to discuss strategic nuclear weapons reduction, monitoring mechanisms, and preserving the benefits of the START II agreement. Additionally, measures should be taken to ensure the safety and dismantling of warheads, initiate a dialogue on missile defense systems, extend decision-making time on nuclear weapons operations, enhance strategic early warning efforts, and increase cooperation between the United States and Russia. The Commission should receive full cooperation from US officials for its duties, including providing necessary information. It must submit an interim report to Congress within six months of its first meeting and a final report within six months after the interim report."
