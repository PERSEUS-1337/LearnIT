Definitions include terms like applicant, Commissioner, regulatory test data, and relevant application or license. The \"Ethical Pathway Act of 2010\" establishes ethical guidelines for approving pharmaceutical and biological products. An application approved by the Secretary or relevant authority in a foreign country containing regulatory test data can be submitted as an abbreviated new drug application, a biosimilar biological product license application, or a drug marketing license application in the United States. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Ethical Pathway Act of 2010 allows for the approval of pharmaceutical products in the United States based on regulatory test data from a foreign country. The Secretary will establish a mechanism for cost-sharing arrangements to avoid conducting unethical clinical investigations for approval. The Ethical Pathway Act of 2010 allows for approval of pharmaceutical products in the US based on foreign regulatory test data. Applicants must ensure no duplication of clinical investigations violating ethical standards. Cost-sharing arrangements are established to prevent unethical clinical investigations. The Ethical Pathway Act of 2010 allows for approval of pharmaceutical products in the US based on foreign regulatory test data. Applicants must agree on a reasonable fee with holders of relevant applications or licenses to rely on regulatory test data for marketing approval. The Ethical Pathway Act of 2010 allows approval of pharmaceutical products in the US based on foreign regulatory test data. Applicants must agree on a reasonable fee with holders of relevant applications or licenses to rely on regulatory test data for marketing approval. Clause (i) applies only to regulatory test data required for the application and not covered by a license or cost-sharing agreement. If agreement is not reached, the applicant must notify the Commissioner. Upon refusal to agree on a fee for reliance on regulatory test data, the Commissioner will refer the matter to binding arbitration to determine a fair fee. The Commissioner will determine a fair fee for reliance on regulatory test data if parties refuse to participate in arbitration or fail to reach an agreement on the fee. If parties fail to agree on a fair fee for reliance on regulatory test data, the applicant must pay a determined share of costs through arbitration or by the Commissioner. The applicant must also notify the Commissioner in their application. The Commissioner shall incorporate relevant regulatory test data into the application for a fair fee. The fee will be determined based on the costs of clinical investigations and the risks involved. The Secretary shall consider various factors when determining fees for incorporating regulatory test data into applications, including probabilities of successful marketing applications, subsidies reducing net costs, expected market share, time of exclusive rights, and revenue earned from products. Additionally, procedures for public disclosure will be adopted to enhance transparency and predictability of liability for nonvoluntary reliance on regulatory test data. The Secretary will adopt procedures for public disclosure of costs and fees related to regulatory test data. Information to be disclosed includes summary data of actual costs, factors considered, and fees provided to relevant holders. Disclosure requirements do not apply if the owner does not assert exclusive rights to the test data. If the owner of the rights in the regulatory test data asserts an exclusive right, a voluntary agreement on the fee for relying upon the data must be reached. The fee paid by the applicant will be provided to the Secretary and made public."
