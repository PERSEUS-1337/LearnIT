    "content": "The Bureau of Reclamation operates the Central Valley Project in California, supplying water for agriculture, wildlife refuges, and municipal/industrial users. This report focuses on hydrologic conditions in California, especially related to the CVP, and highlights issues for Congress. The severe drought of 2012-2016 had a significant impact on water management in the state. The severe drought in California, one of the most severe in recent history, led to major reductions in water allocations for CVP contractors, causing economic and environmental impacts. Congress is concerned about these impacts and unresolved water supply controversies. Despite the end of the drought in 2017, ongoing constraints on water supplies are expected without significant changes. Proposed changes to the current water allocation system are controversial due to limited water availability. Western water issues, including federal water infrastructure, are of interest to lawmakers. Legislation in the 114th Congress (WIIN Act) addressed western water issues, focusing on maximizing water supplies for the Central Valley Project (CVP) and allowing increased pumping during high flow events. It also authorized funding for new water storage projects. The WIIN Act authorized funding for new water storage projects, with a focus on the Central Valley Project (CVP). Despite limited use of operational authorities in 2017 and 2018, funding has been allocated for CVP-related projects. Controversial proposals may alter CVP operations, including revisions to California's Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan. Proposed revisions to the Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan would increase flows from the San Joaquin and Sacramento Rivers to enhance water quality and wildlife, potentially limiting water supplies for other users. The Trump Administration is considering options to boost CVP water supplies for users in California's Central Valley, a region with diverse geography and historically significant fish and wildlife populations. The Central Valley Project (CVP) was originally a state project authorized for construction in 1933 but later taken over by the federal government. Construction on the first unit began in 1937, with the last unit completed in 1978. The CVP made significant changes to water delivery for California's Central Valley. The Central Valley Project (CVP) was completed in 1978 and began operations in 1979, making significant changes to California's natural hydrology for water supplies. The project's impact on California's hydrologic system is a key point of debate today, as it serves various purposes for agriculture, municipalities, and wildlife needs. The Central Valley Project (CVP) in California is crucial for agriculture, municipalities, and wildlife. It irrigates over 3 million acres of land, supports 7 of California's top 10 agricultural counties, and provides water for 2.5 million people annually. The CVP consists of 20 dams, 11 power plants, and 500 miles of canals, delivering 5 million acre-feet of water to farms, 600,000 acre-feet to M&I users, and water for wildlife refuges and fish and wildlife needs. The State Water Project (SWP) in California delivers 70% of its water to urban users and 30% for irrigation. It operates alongside the Central Valley Project (CVP) and exports water from Northern California to Central areas through pumping facilities in the Delta near Tracy, CA. The CVP operates pumping facilities in the Delta near Tracy, CA, exporting water from Northern California to Central and Southern California. CVP storage includes Shasta Dam, Trinity Dam, Folsom Dam, New Melones Dam, Friant Dam, and San Luis Dam. The Delta-Mendota Canal is the longest water conveyance facility at 117 miles. The Central Valley has conveyance facilities like the Delta-Mendota Canal and Friant-Kern Canal. Non-CVP water storage includes projects like Oroville Dam, Don Pedro, and local government-owned dams. California's Central Valley provides important wetland habitat for migratory birds and other species, with multiple state, federal, and private wildlife refuges receiving water from the CVP and other sources. Snowpack accounts for about 30% of the state's water supplies, influencing CVP and SWP allocations. Water from snowpack melts in spring and is stored for water needs. The Central Valley's water supply from snowpack melts in spring and is stored for summer and fall water needs. Reclamation announces estimated deliveries for its 250 CVP water contractors, but cutbacks are common due to drought and other factors. Most CVP water contracts allow for reductions in deliveries based on hydrologic conditions. The Central Valley Project (CVP) often delivers less water than contracted, especially during drought years. In dry years from 2012-2015, annual deliveries averaged 3.45 million AF, significantly lower than the normal 7 million AF. Water rights contractors have varying priority levels for deliveries based on factors like water rights. Major groups of CVP contractors include senior water rights holders, North and South of Delta water service contractors, and Central Valley refuge water users. The largest contract holders of CVP water include Sacramento River Settlement Contractors, SOD water service contractors, San Joaquin River Exchange Contractors, and Friant Division contractors. Other groups like Central Valley refuges and smaller contractor groups also play a role in water allocation discussions. In 2019, most CVP contractor groups received 100% of their maximum contracted amounts, except for SOD agricultural water service contractors who were allocated 70%. This was a significant decrease from their last full allocation in 2017, with only four full contract allocations since 1990. The SWP, another major water project in California, is operated by the state. The SWP, operated by California's Department of Water Resources, provides water to M&I and some agricultural users. It has more contracted supplies than it typically delivers, with water deliveries varying each year. The CVP and SWP are operated together under the 1986 Coordinated Operations Agreement. The 1986 Coordinated Operations Agreement governs the CVP and SWP's in-basin water needs and exports. Despite past efforts to update the agreement, it remains unchanged. Combined CVP and SWP exports have fluctuated over time, notably dropping during the 2012-2016 drought but rebounding since 2016. Exports for CVP and SWP have fluctuated, with a significant increase in 2017. CVP exports have decreased over time, while SWP exports have increased. Agricultural exports have declined due to other purposes like fish and wildlife. There have been discussions about renegotiating the Coordinated Operations Agreement, but no revisions have been agreed upon. Reclamation initiated negotiations with DWR in August 2018. In August 2018, Reclamation notified DWR of negotiations. After discussions, an addendum to the COA was agreed upon in December 2018. The revised agreement adjusted the sharing ratios based on water year types and export capacity between CVP and SWP. Additionally, the state agreed to transport up to 195,000 AF of CVP water through the California Aqueduct. Concerns persist over CVP water supply deliveries, with some contractors receiving less than 100% of their contract supplies even in high precipitation years. Allocations for users have declined over time due to environmental requirements, leading to a focus on increasing water supplies. Advocates for the San Francisco Bay and its tributaries argue for maintaining or increasing environmental protections. Advocates for maintaining or increasing environmental protections, including state water quality requirements, federal Endangered Species Act regulations, and Central Valley Project Improvement Act implementation, impact CVP water allocations. California sets water quality standards in compliance with the federal Clean Water Act. The Porter-Cologne Act in California enforces federal Clean Water Act regulations to control pollutants. The State Water Resources Control Board issues Water Quality Control Plans for the Bay-Delta, impacting water quality by regulating freshwater releases from projects like the CVP and SWP. The plans aim to maintain desired salinity levels for in-Delta water supplies and wildlife. The Bay-Delta Plan, implemented through State Water Board's Decision 1641, regulates water quality levels to protect water supplies and wildlife. Pumping restrictions due to salinity levels can reduce Delta exports to CVP and SWP water users. In 2014, water quality restrictions led to a significant reduction in pumping, while in 2016, D-1641 requirements accounted for a decrease in exports. The State Water Board released the final draft of the Bay-Delta Plan Update in mid-2018, which requires additional flows to the ocean from the San Joaquin River and its tributaries. The proposal includes a 40% unimpaired flow requirement for the San Joaquin River, aiming to reduce water available for human use. The updated version of the Bay-Delta Plan would reduce water available for human use from the San Joaquin River by 7% to 23% on average, and up to 38% during critically dry years. A more detailed plan for the Sacramento River is also expected in the future. If the plan updates are finalized and water users do not comply, the State Water Board could take actions to require implementation. Reclamation and its contractors would likely play key roles in implementing any updates to the plan. The Bay-Delta Plan Update, approved by the State Water Board, has generated controversy. Reclamation opposes the proposed standards for the San Joaquin River, arguing it would decrease water storage at New Melones Reservoir. The plan establishes a \"starting point\" for increased river flows. The Bay-Delta Plan Update, approved by the State Water Board, establishes a \"starting point\" for increased river flows and allows for reduced flows on tributaries with voluntary agreements. The plan's conditions will be enforced through water rights conditions by 2022. Legal actions have been taken against the State Water Board for non-compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act. The operations of the CVP and SWP impact species like the Delta smelt, listed as threatened under the ESA in 1993. Surveys in 2017 found only two adult Delta smelt, the lowest catch in history, despite a wet winter. Low population sizes could lead to water restrictions for users and raise concerns about the Bay-Delta ecosystem's health. Multiple anadromous salmonid species are also listed under ESA, including endangered and threatened species. Federal agencies consult with FWS or NMFS to assess the impact of federal projects. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) issue BiOps to determine if federal projects may harm species listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Consultations have concluded that changes in operations, such as increased pumping from the Delta, could jeopardize species' existence. BiOps include Reasonable and Prudent Alternatives (RPAs) to mitigate harm. The CVP and SWP BiOps have been revised over time, with new BiOps developed in 2008 and 2009 placing restrictions on water exports. These BiOps were a result of challenges by environmental groups to the agencies' 2004 BiOps, which proposed increased Delta exports. The current operation of CVP and SWP follows these BiOps to mitigate harm to endangered species. The 2008 and 2009 BiOps for the CVP and SWP aimed to prevent harm to endangered species by implementing RPAs. The ESA restrictions on pumping vary in wet and dry years, with reductions being greater in wet years. In wet years, ESA restrictions led to significant reductions in water deliveries from the CVP, with estimates of 528,000 AF in 2016. During the 2012-2016 drought, RPAs were modified with temporary urgency change orders allowing more water to be pumped. In 2014, changes to BiOps by NMFS and FWS allowed more water to be pumped based on real-time monitoring. Approximately 400,000 AF of water was made available for export. In 2016, Reclamation and DWR requested consultation on long-term operations of the CVP and SWP due to drought and species decline. In 2017, the Trump Administration announced plans to analyze potential modifications to maximize water and power supplies. The Biological Assessment (BA) proposing changes for the operation of the CVP and SWP was sent to FWS and NMFS by Reclamation on January 31, 2019. The proposed operational changes aim to maximize water supplies for users and address listed species through habitat restoration and introducing hatchery-bred Delta smelt. Operational changes include increasing flows during winter storms and higher storage levels. The Trump Administration also plans to expedite other regulatory changes. The Trump Administration aims to expedite regulatory changes under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), directing agencies to identify burdensome regulations on water infrastructure projects in California. The 1992 Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA) made significant changes to the management of the CVP, establishing fish and wildlife purposes as official project goals and calling for actions to protect and enhance these resources. The CVPIA made changes to the Central Valley Project, resulting in decreased water availability and increased costs for contractors. Some want the law repealed due to tension. Key changes included doubling fish populations, allocating water for wildlife refuges, and establishing the CVPRF for habitat restoration. The CVPIA allows for (b)(2) water allocations to be used for various purposes, including export reductions for water quality and ESA restrictions. In 2014, 44% of (b)(2) water was attributed to Bay-Delta Plan export reductions, with the rest used for anadromous fish restoration and NMFS BiOp compliance. In 2016, 793,000 AF of (b)(2) water was allocated for various purposes, including export pumping reductions under FWS and NMFS BiOps, Bay-Delta Plan requirements, and reservoir releases for fish restoration programs. The CVP development had significant impacts on California's hydrology, with ongoing restoration initiatives like TRRP and SJRRP aiming to mitigate these effects. The TRRP and SJRRP are restoration programs for the Trinity River Division and San Joaquin River, respectively, aiming to restore fisheries impacted by the CVP. TRRP, administered by DOI, focuses on mitigating impacts of the Trinity Division and restoring fisheries to pre-1955 levels. The Trinity River Division includes tunnels diverting water to the Sacramento River Basin and Whiskeytown Reservoir, leading to the near drying of the Trinity River at times. Efforts to mitigate these effects began in the 1980s, with Congress authorizing restoration activities and a fish hatchery in 1984 and 1992. Legislation directed an increase in reserved water for Trinity River flows and mandated a flow evaluation study in 2000. The 2000 record of decision (ROD) mandated completion of a flow evaluation study for the Trinity River Restoration Program (TRRP), calling for additional water for instream flows, river channel restoration, and watershed rehabilitation. TRRP has been funded at approximately $12 million per year from FY2013 to FY2018. Historically, the San Joaquin River supported large Chinook salmon populations until much of the river's water was diverted for agricultural uses after the completion of Friant Dam in the late 1940s. In 1988, environmental groups sued the Bureau of Reclamation over the impact of Friant Dam on Chinook salmon populations. A settlement was reached in 2006 and enacted by Congress in 2010, requiring new releases of water from Friant Dam to restore fisheries. The settlement reached in 2006 and enacted by Congress in 2010 requires new releases of water from Friant Dam to restore fisheries, including salmon fisheries, in the San Joaquin River. Efforts are also needed to mitigate water supply delivery losses due to these releases. The goals of the settlement involve channel and structural modifications along the river and the reintroduction of Chinook salmon, funded by federal appropriations and payments from CVP Friant water users. Increased water flows for restoring fisheries would reduce CVP diversions for off-stream purposes like irrigation and hydropower. The 2006 settlement requires new water releases from Friant Dam to restore fisheries in the San Joaquin River. The agreement aims to mitigate water supply delivery losses and reduce CVP diversions for off-stream purposes like irrigation and hydropower. The quantity of water used for restoration flows and the reduction in water deliveries to Friant contractors are related but not necessarily one-for-one due to various factors. In the driest years, no water would be released for restoration purposes, preserving deliveries to Friant contractors. Restoration flows in late winter and early spring may also allow for additional runoff storage in Millerton Lake, potentially minimizing delivery reductions later in the year. Delivery reductions to Friant water contractors depend on multiple factors each year. The San Joaquin River Restoration Program (SJRRP) will impact existing water supplies and local economies in the Friant Division service area. Construction activities are ongoing with a target completion date of 2024. The Bay-Delta Restoration Program is a cooperative effort among federal, state, and local entities to address water management and aquatic ecosystem needs in California's Central Valley. The CALFED Bay-Delta Restoration Act of 2004 provided new federal authorities for the program. The CALFED Bay-Delta Program's Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement was extended through FY2019 under the WIIN Act. The interim action plan focuses on a federal-state partnership, water supply management, habitat restoration, and drought/floodplain management. Reclamation funded Bay-Delta restoration activities at $37 million per year from FY2013 to FY2018, primarily for ecosystem projects including California WaterFix. Other agencies receiving funding for CALFED activities include U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resources Conservation Service, Army Corps of Engineers, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The CALFED program involves multiple federal agencies such as the Army Corps of Engineers, NOAA, and EPA. The annual budget for CALFED activities was $474 million in FY2019, an increase from the previous year. Stakeholders are exploring alternative methods to address water supply challenges caused by reduced water deliveries. The state and federal government officials are considering new water storage projects, including the California WaterFix and various CVP storage investigations. The WIIN Act authorized $335 million for these projects. Section 4007 of the WIIN Act authorized $335 million for new water storage projects, with $33.3 million allocated to seven projects recommended by Reclamation in 2018. Four of these projects, totaling $28.05 million, were CALFED studies focusing on water availability in the CVP, including the Shasta Dam and Reservoir Enlargement Project. Congress approved the funding allocations for these projects in FY2018. The FY2018 Energy and Water appropriations bill allocated funds for various water storage projects, including the Enlargement Project, North-of-Delta Off-Stream Storage Investigation, Upper San Joaquin River Basin Storage Investigation, and Friant-Kern Canal Subsidence Challenges Project. $134 million was designated for Section 4007 WIIN Act storage projects, with an additional $134 million set aside in the FY2019 bill. Future legislation will determine the allocation of these funds for water conservation and delivery projects in the CVP. In June 2018, California announced significant bond funding for water projects, including Sites Reservoir. The California WaterFix project aimed to address water conveyance issues in the Bay-Delta by diverting water from the Sacramento River into twin tunnels. Governor Newsom canceled the WaterFix plans in spring 2019. Funding from the State of California may impact the construction of proposed water projects in the Central Valley Project. In spring 2019, Governor Newsom of California canceled the WaterFix project and introduced a new plan for conveying water through the Delta. The new plan involves constructing a single tunnel to convey water from the Sacramento River to the existing pumps in the Bay-Delta. The goal is to protect water supplies from sea-level rise, saltwater intrusion, and earthquakes, with a focus on making water supplies climate resilient through various efforts such as strengthening levees and recharging groundwater. This project will require a new environmental review process for federal and state permits and is being led by the Delta Conveyance Design and Construction Authority. The new conveyance system project in California is overseen by a joint powers authority created by public water agencies, with DWR expected to lead the planning effort. The project's cost will be mainly covered by public water agencies, while the federal government's role is yet to be defined. Congress has previously supported CVP water management through initiatives like water banking, transfers, and storage construction. Recent legislation, such as the WIIN Act, has brought operational changes and additional funding for western drought response and new water storage projects benefiting the CVP. The WIIN Act included provisions to maximize CVP pumping, allow increased pumping during storm events, and expedite water transfers. Congress may consider amending, extending, or repealing these provisions before they expire in 2021. The WIIN Act included provisions to maximize CVP pumping, allow increased pumping during storm events, and expedite water transfers. The act established a new standard for measuring the effects of water operations on endangered species. Supporters believed the changes could provide more water to users, while opponents were concerned about potential detrimental effects on species' survival. The WIIN Act included provisions to maximize CVP pumping and expedite water transfers. Changes authorized under the act allowed for increased water supplies and relaxed restrictions on water transfers, benefiting water users but raising concerns about species' survival. The WIIN Act included provisions to maximize CVP pumping and expedite water transfers, resulting in additional exports of 50,000-60,000 AF. Hydrology has affected the implementation of some provisions, with potential impacts during drought years. Federal operational changes proposed under the WIIN Act were deemed incompatible with state requirements. Despite limitations, WIIN Act authorities remain a topic of congressional interest. Previous Congresses have considered legislation like the GROW Act, which aimed to make additional changes to CVP operations. The GROW Act aimed to loosen environmental protections and increase exports under certain scenarios but was not enacted. The Administration plans to propose administrative changes to CVP operations, including reinitiating consultation on long-term operations. A 2018 White House memorandum directed DOC and DOI to finalize new BiOps for CVP and SWP operations by June 15, 2019. The process of suspending, revising, or rescinding burdensome regulations is unclear. Congress may consider oversight, authorization, and/or funding for new water storage projects, such as the controversial Shasta Dam and Reservoir Enlargement Project. Reclamation has shown interest in the project, but the state has opposed it. The project's future is uncertain without state regulatory approvals and financial support. In early 2018, Reclamation proposed $20 million in funding for the Shasta Dam and Reservoir Enlargement Project, with an additional $75 million recommended by the Trump Administration in February 2019. Congress also approved funding for other water storage projects in California, totaling $335 million from FY2017 to FY2019 under Section 4007 of the WIIN Act. Once the appropriations ceiling is reached, Congress would need to extend funding for these projects to proceed. Legislation in the 116th Congress aims to expedite water storage studies in the Central Valley and provide mandatory funding for construction. H.R. 2473 directs completion of feasibility studies for various reservoirs and authorizes $100 million annually for new storage projects. The Central Valley Project (CVP) is a significant water storage and conveyance project, with ongoing congressional interest in its operations and allocations. The Central Valley Project (CVP) is a significant water storage and conveyance project in California. Congressional interest in CVP operations and allocations, including pumping in the Bay-Delta, has led to ongoing oversight and consideration of new water projects. The Trump Administration's efforts to increase water availability for CVP contractors, particularly those south of the Delta, have also been a focus. Future droughts may exacerbate these issues. Major contractor groups and individual contractors served by the CVP include Sacramento River Settlement Contractors and San Joaquin River Exchange Contractors. CVP water is primarily allocated to contractors with pre-existing water rights, such as the Sacramento River Settlement Contractors and the San Joaquin River Exchange Contractors. These contractors typically receive 100% of their contracted amounts in most water year types, with a maximum entitlement reduction of up to 25% during water shortages. Sacramento River Settlement Contractors consist of 145 individuals and districts that diverted natural flows from the Sacramento River before the CVP's construction and reached a settlement agreement with Reclamation for negotiated water rights allocation. The San Joaquin River Exchange Contractors have agreed to exchange their water rights for guaranteed water deliveries from the CVP. Reclamation is responsible for delivering substitute water to these users, and if unable to do so, the contractors have the right to divert water from the San Joaquin River. This may impact water availability for other San Joaquin River water service contractors. Friant Division contractors receive water from Millerton Lake behind Friant Dam through Friant-Kern and Madera Canals. They are contracted for Class 1 and Class 2 water, with Class 2 water released as uncontrolled flows for flood control. Deliveries are impacted by a 2009 settlement for fish and wildlife protection on the San Joaquin River. Friant Division contractors have converted their water service contracts to repayment contracts and repaid their capital obligation to the federal government. Exchange Contractors can make a \"call\" on water in the San Joaquin River if Reclamation is unable to make contracted deliveries, impacting releases from Friant Dam. Westlands Water District is the largest South-of-Delta water service contractor, accounting for a significant portion of the CVP's contracted water. Westlands Water District is the largest agricultural water district in the United States, covering 600,000 acres in Fresno and Kings Counties. It has a maximum contracted CVP water of over 1.2 million AF, making up more than half of the total SOD CVP water service contracts. Despite this, Westlands often receives less water than historically due to various factors. The district is involved in policy debates and a proposed settlement with Reclamation. Westlands Water District is engaged in a major proposed settlement with Reclamation, the San Luis Drainage Settlement, which would forgive Westlands' federal CVP repayment responsibilities in exchange for addressing toxic runoff from area soils. The California Central Valley hosts wildlife refuges that receive water from the CVP and other sources, with the Central Valley Project Improvement Act aiming to improve conditions for fish and wildlife in these areas. The Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA) aims to improve conditions for wildlife in the Central Valley by providing water supplies to 19 refuges. Reclamation has entered into long-term water supply contracts with managing agencies to provide approximately 555,000 AF annually. The authorized refuge water supply is divided into Level 2 and Level 4 supplies, with Level 2 supplies being the historical average of water deliveries to the refuges. Level 4 supplies, funded by the Central Valley Project Restoration Fund (CVPRF), provide additional water for optimal wetland habitat development. These supplies are funded 75% federally and 25% by the state. However, full Level 4 supplies have not always been provided due to costs exceeding available funding and a lack of willing sellers. Costs for the Refuge Water Supply Program have ranged from $11 million to $20 million in recent years."
