Section 216(k) of the Social Security Act is amended to provide alternative methods for determining valid marriages and meeting the nine-month requirement for widows, stepchildren, or widowers in certain cases.

The amended Section 216(k) of the Social Security Act allows widows, widowers, and stepchildren to provide sworn affidavits or proof of stepchild status to meet the nine-month requirement for benefits, especially for those in states recognizing same-sex marriages, civil unions, or domestic partnerships before March 26, 2014. The amended Section 216(k) of the Social Security Act allows widows, widowers, and stepchildren to provide sworn affidavits or proof of stepchild status to meet the nine-month requirement for benefits, especially for those in states recognizing same-sex marriages, civil unions, or domestic partnerships before March 26, 2014. The affidavit must confirm the marital or domestic partnership status throughout the 9-month period ending on the date of the individual's death. SEC. 4. ALTERNATIVE METHOD OF MEETING 1-YEAR REQUIREMENT FOR WIVES, STEPCHILDREN, OR HUSBANDS IN CERTAIN CASES. The requirement for spouses and stepchildren to have been married or in the relationship for at least 1 year before applying for insurance benefits is considered met if the application is filed within that 1-year period. Prior to June 26, 2013, if a spouse's marriage was not recognized for Federal law purposes, they would be considered married if domiciled in a state recognizing same-sex marriages before June 26, 2014, or in any other state before June 26, 2014. If a state recognized same-sex marriages, civil unions, or domestic partnerships within a year, an individual can provide a sworn affidavit for insurance benefits. Stepchildren can qualify if their parent marries the individual. An individual can qualify for insurance benefits if their parent is domiciled in a state that recognized same-sex marriages, civil unions, or domestic partnerships before June 26, 2014. If the parent is in a state that recognized these unions after June 26, 2013, they can qualify within a year of that recognition. To qualify for child's insurance benefits, the parent must have been married to or in a domestic partnership with the individual for at least 1 year prior to the application, as confirmed by a sworn affidavit. SEC. 5. NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES IN LAW; OUTREACH CAMPAIGN. The Commissioner of Social Security will conduct a 3-year outreach campaign to encourage newly eligible individuals for Social Security benefits due to changes in law related to same-sex marriage. Direct notifications will be sent to current beneficiaries and those approaching retirement. A report to Congress will be submitted annually starting in 2015. The report to Congress will include a description of educational and outreach activities conducted by the Commissioner of Social Security, the number of applications for benefits under title II of the Social Security Act due to changes in law related to same-sex marriage, and the number of applications resulting in entitlement to benefits."
