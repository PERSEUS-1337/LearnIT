    "content": "The Act titled \"Affordable and Reliable Gas Act of 2005\" includes a list of fuels. The \"Affordable and Reliable Gas Act of 2005\" amends the Clean Air Act by restricting the approval of new fuels in State implementation plans if it increases the total number of fuels approved before September 1, 2004. The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, will determine and publish a list of approved fuels. The \"Affordable and Reliable Gas Act of 2005\" amends the Clean Air Act by restricting the approval of new fuels in State implementation plans. The Administrator will publish a list of approved fuels and may remove or reduce fuels on the list if necessary. The Administrator retains authority to approve new fuels that completely replace those on the list. The Administrator cannot approve any fuel in a State implementation plan unless it was already approved in another State's plan. However, a fuel with a summertime Reid Vapor Pressure of 7.0 psi may be approved. States still have the authority to require the use of registered fuel additives. The Administrator must approve fuels in State implementation plans that have been approved in another State's plan. States can mandate the use of registered fuel additives. Fuel additives registered under specific regulations will remain in effect until fuel harmonization is achieved. The Administrator and the Secretary of Energy will identify and publish a list of 5 gasolines and diesel fuels for use within 12 months. The Administrator will approve a Federal Fuels List for public comment, including 5 gasolines and diesel fuels for States without a waiver under section 209(b). The list will include one Federal on-road diesel fuel, one conventional gasoline, one reformulated gasoline (RFG), and 2 additional gasolines with Reid vapor pressure (RVP) controls for ozone attainment areas. The Federal Fuels List will include gasolines and diesel fuels based on their ability to reduce ozone emissions to help States meet ozone standards. If the adoption of the list affects fuel supply or producibility, Congress will be informed and implementation may be suspended. The Administrator and Secretary will conduct a study on the Federal Fuels List's impact on supply or producibility. Upon publication of the list, the Administrator cannot approve fuels not on the list in State plans, or approve a switch between fuels on the list without consultation. The Administrator and Secretary will develop a plan to harmonize approved fuels in State implementation plans with the Federal Fuels List, ensuring no disruptions in fuel supply or distribution. The Administrator and Secretary will harmonize State implementation plans with the Federal Fuels List by December 31, 2008. A study will be conducted on the effects of State plan provisions on air quality, fuel blends, availability, fungibility, and costs. The study required under the Clean Air Act will focus on developing a Federal fuels system to maximize motor fuel fungibility, preserve air quality standards, and reduce fuel price volatility. It will recommend legislative changes to Congress and analyze the impacts on energy supply, distribution, and ozone emissions. The study under the Clean Air Act will focus on developing a Federal fuels system to maximize motor fuel fungibility, preserve air quality standards, and reduce fuel price volatility. It will recommend legislative changes to Congress and analyze impacts on energy supply, distribution, and ozone emissions. The study includes regulations for diesel and gasoline blends with RVP controls for use in ozone attainment areas. The study required by the Clean Air Act will use sound and objective science practices, consider the best available science, use data collected by accepted means, and describe the weight of the scientific evidence. The Administrator will coordinate obtaining comments from affected parties interested in the air quality impact assessment portion of the study. The study will be coordinated with other studies required by the act to avoid duplication of effort. The Secretary will coordinate obtaining comments from affected parties interested in fuel availability, blends, fungibility, and costs for the study required by the Clean Air Act. The Administrator and Secretary will jointly submit the study results to Congress within 12 months of the Act's enactment, along with any recommended regulatory and legislative changes. The Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate authorizes $500,000 for a study required under the Clean Air Act."
