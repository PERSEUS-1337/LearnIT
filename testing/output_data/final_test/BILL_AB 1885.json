    "title": "AB 1885",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 12389 of the Insurance Code is amended to allow underwritten title companies to engage in preparing title searches, reports, examinations, or certificates of title and conduct escrow services through business locations in licensed counties regardless of property location. Only domestic corporations can be licensed under this section, and underwritten title companies cannot be licensed unless they comply with Section 881. The required minimum net worth and bond or cash deposit depend on the number of documents recorded in the preceding year in the counties where the company is licensed. For domestic corporations to be licensed under this section, underwritten title companies must comply with Section 881. The minimum net worth required is based on the number of documents recorded in the previous year in licensed counties. Net worth is defined as assets exceeding liabilities and reserves, with the title plant cost not exceeding the total asset value. If a title plant of an underwritten title company is not currently maintained, its asset value shall decrease by one-tenth each year. The plant must be used in the normal conduct of title insurance business, with regular updating of title record data. Joint use of a title plant system is allowed if the owner is contractually entitled to access the data. The owner of a jointly used title plant system is entitled to receive a copy of the title record data at a cost not exceeding the actual duplication cost. An underwritten title company must maintain current assets of at least $10,000 in excess of liabilities, as defined by regulations. The company needs a license from the commissioner to operate, and must comply with all relevant laws and regulations. An underwritten title company must have a license from the commissioner, subject to insurance regulations. The license can be obtained by filing an application and paying a fee of $354. It is valid indefinitely but expires upon the company's termination, with an annual renewal fee required. An underwritten title company seeking to expand its license to additional counties must pay a $207 fee per county and provide evidence of financial ability. The company must also submit an annual audit to the commissioner by March 31 or within 90 days after the fiscal year end, with possible extensions granted for valid reasons. An annual audit must be submitted to the commissioner within 90 days after the fiscal year end. Failure to do so may result in the commissioner ordering no new business. The audit must be conducted by an independent certified public accountant or licensed public accountant and the fee for filing is $313. The commissioner has the authority to refuse or order a new audit for various reasons, including adverse outcomes in proceedings before the California Board of Accountancy. The auditor's objectivity may be compromised if they have affiliations with the title company or any of its officers. If the auditor has been convicted of fraud or deceit, or if a civil action finds them guilty of such misconduct, penalties and restrictions may apply. Failure to file required audits on time incurs a penalty fee and may result in the company being unable to accept new business until the issue is resolved. The escrow agent must keep records of all funds transactions and maintain a bond as required by the commissioner for the protection of the state and individuals. The company can maintain a deposit with the commissioner instead of a bond, in an amount specified by the commissioner. The deposit will be held in the State Treasury and serve as security for the same purposes as the bond. Interest and dividends from the deposit will be paid to the depositor if there are no claims against it. The deposit must be maintained until four years after all escrows handled by the depositor are closed. The commissioner may release the deposit early if evidence of a merger or assumption agreement is provided. The deposit will be returned to the depositor or lawful successor after four years, unless there are claims against it. The commissioner may pay valid claims until the deposit is exhausted, or release it to a conservator, trustee, or liquidator if the depositor is in financial proceedings. If not, the commissioner may interplead the deposit to a court for distribution to claimants. The licensee must comply with all rules and provisions regarding escrow services. They must honestly handle all funds and fulfill obligations. Any recovered money to restore trust deficiency is not considered an asset for liquidation assessment. The surety under the bond or issuing bank of a letter of credit may pay the full amount to the commissioner in lieu of payment to the state or other parties. Upon payment, the surety or bank is released from further liability. The conservator, liquidator, or receiver can use the proceeds for various purposes, including funding the costs of conservatorship or liquidation. The commissioner may permit a letter of credit in place of surety bonds if no market is available. The requirements for the letter of credit can be adjusted as needed. After July 1, 2016, the commissioner will release escrow deposits if the title company provides bond coverage, a deposit, or an approved letter of credit. (B) Evidence required for a merger or assumption agreement to transfer liability of escrow transactions to a licensee under the commissioner's jurisdiction. The deposit will be returned to the depositor or their trustee upon application after four years, unless there are claims against the deposit. If claims exist, the commissioner may distribute the deposit based on priority of claims stemming from escrow transactions. The commissioner has the authority to examine licensed companies' business affairs at their expense. If a company willfully fails to comply with regulations, the commissioner can order a business prohibition for up to one year. Violating this order can lead to seizure, misdemeanor charges, and potential license revocation. The commissioner has the authority to examine licensed companies' business affairs at their expense and can order a business prohibition for up to one year for non-compliance. Companies must operate under an approved name and follow specific regulations outlined in the government code. Title insurance involves insuring owners against loss due to title defects. Underwritten title companies can operate outside the state if compliant with other state laws. Effective July 1, 2016."
