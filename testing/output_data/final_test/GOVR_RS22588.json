    "content": "The attorney-client privilege and work product protection are federal evidentiary privileges that encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and clients to promote broader public interests in the observance of law and justice. It protects confidential communications made for legal advice and assistance, available to both individuals and corporations. The privilege may survive disclosure for limited selective purposes, and attorney's work product created in anticipation of litigation enjoys qualified disclosure. The attorney-client privilege and work product protection provide qualified disclosure protection for work product gathered in anticipation of litigation. The circuits are divided on whether protection can survive selective waiver, such as disclosure to a government investigator. Five Deputy Attorneys General have issued memoranda on prosecutorial discretion regarding criminal charges against corporations, addressing waiver of attorney-client and work product protection, employee legal costs, and joint defense agreements. The Holder Memorandum, signed in 1999, provides guidelines for prosecutors considering charging a corporation with criminal activity. The factors for determining corporate criminal liability are not outcome-determinative guidelines. They include the nature of the offense, pervasiveness of wrongdoing, history of similar conduct, voluntary disclosure, cooperation, compliance program, remedial actions, collateral consequences, and non-criminal remedies. The Memorandum also mentions considering cooperation in waiving attorney-client privileges and work product protections. The Holder Memorandum, which was later replaced by the Thompson Memorandum, addressed the waiver of attorney-client privileges and work product protections in joint defense agreements. The Thompson Memorandum largely mirrored its predecessor with minor additions, emphasizing the risks for corporations that fail to cooperate or disclose information early on. The Holder Memorandum, later replaced by the Thompson Memorandum, addressed risks for corporations that fail to cooperate or disclose information early on. The adoption of language from the earlier Memorandum suggested a perception that the problem was in its application. The policies in both memoranda were similar to enforcement policies of federal regulatory agencies. In May 2004, the United States Sentencing Commission amended the Commentary in the Sentencing Guidelines. In May 2004, the United States Sentencing Commission amended the Commentary in the Sentencing Guidelines regarding corporate waiver. The change caused corporate anxiety and led to the American Bar Association recommending against considering waiver as a sentencing factor. The Commission later removed the language added in 2004. In October 2005, the McCallum Memorandum addressed the implementation of the Thompson Memorandum's policy on waiver. United States Attorneys were instructed to prepare written guidelines for supervisory approval. In May 2004, the United States Sentencing Commission amended the Commentary in the Sentencing Guidelines regarding corporate waiver, causing corporate anxiety. The McCallum Memorandum in October 2005 instructed United States Attorneys to prepare guidelines for supervisory approval of requests for corporate waivers. The Federal Advisory Committee on Evidence proposed a rule amendment in May 2006 to address splits in circuits over selective waiver, but the controversial selective waiver feature was dropped from the proposed rule recommended to Congress. Congress enacted a rule with only inadvertent waiver and protective order components. In United States v. Stein in the summer of 2006, a court in the Southern District of New York addressed the Thompson Memorandum's policy on a corporation's reimbursement of attorneys' fees for employees. The corporation's reimbursement of employees' attorneys' fees and pressure to make incriminating statements violated their Fifth Amendment rights. The case stemmed from a criminal tax investigation of an accounting firm and its employees. The firm intended to cooperate with the government to protect itself, not the employees. The firm stopped covering litigation costs for employees who didn't cooperate with the government's investigation or invoked their Fifth Amendment privilege. Prosecutors would consider legal obligations for attorney fees but would scrutinize any payments not required by law. Employees were informed that attorney fees would be capped at $400,000 and cut off for those charged with criminal wrongdoing. Prosecutors were alerted when employees were uncooperative. The firm threatened to fire uncooperative employees and cut off their attorneys' fees. They entered a deferred prosecution agreement, paying a $456 million fine and providing extensive cooperation. Former officers and employees tried to have their indictments dismissed on constitutional grounds. The government declined to dismiss indictments against three former firm employees, arguing that their right to counsel had not attached before indictment and they had no Sixth Amendment right to pay for their counsel with someone else's money. The court ruled that the government's actions impeded the employees' criminal defense, leading to the dismissal of indictments. The firm's policy of limiting legal fees to defendants was a key factor in the decision. The government's influence led to the firm ceasing legal fees for defendants, violating the Sixth Amendment. Legislation was introduced to address this issue during the 109th Congress. The McNulty Memorandum, announced in 2006, replaced previous memoranda regarding waivers of attorney-client privilege and work product protection. It emphasized that waivers should be the exception rather than the rule when considering whether to charge a corporation. The McNulty Memorandum, issued in 2006, categorized attorney-client and work product material into two groups: Category I for factual information and Category II for opinion work product. Prosecutors were advised to rarely seek waiver of Category II material, with approval required from higher authorities. The Memorandum also stated that a corporation's refusal to waive privilege should not influence prosecutorial discretion and included guidelines on attorneys' fees. Senator Specter introduced the Attorney-Client Privilege Protection Act of 2007 (S. 186) in the 110th Congress, which aimed to restrict the government from advancing attorneys' fees to employees or agents under investigation and indictment, except in rare cases with approval from the Deputy Attorney General. Despite similar bills introduced in the House and Senate, no further action was taken on the proposals before the 110th Congress adjourned. The Filip Memorandum, dated August 28, 2008, revises the U.S. Attorneys Manual regarding cooperation mitigating factors for business entities. It allows corporations to disclose non-factual attorney-client communications voluntarily without prosecutors requesting waivers. The Filip Memorandum from August 28, 2008, allows corporations to gain credit for cooperation in investigations by timely disclosing information, regardless of attorney-client privilege. Payment of employees' attorney fees or joint defense agreements does not preclude cooperation credit, unless used for criminal obstruction of justice. The McNulty Memorandum allowed prosecutors to consider various impediments to cooperation, while the Attorney-Client Privilege Protection Act of 2009 was introduced in Congress to protect attorney-client privilege. The Attorney-Client Privilege Protection Act of 2009, introduced in Congress, aims to establish clear limits to protect attorney-client privilege and work product protections for organizations and their employees. It defines these privileges based on federal law and the principles of common law and Federal Rules of Evidence. The Specter bill (S. 445) defines \"attorney work product\" as materials prepared by or at the direction of an attorney in anticipation of litigation. It also includes a definition of \"organization\" which outlines the scope of the bill in relation to federal prosecutors and investigators. The Scott bill (H.R. 4326) lacks a similar definition, raising questions about its applicability to federal, state, and local entities. The Specter bill (S. 445) excludes federal and tribal governmental entities from its definition of organization, suggesting they would not be covered by the bill. It also excludes drug cartels, designated foreign terrorist organizations, and entities charged under RICO provisions. The RICO exemption may raise questions as common business organizations are not typically associated with RICO prosecutions. The bill aims to prevent federal agencies from demanding organizations to waive attorney-client privilege, decline legal expenses for employees, avoid joint defense agreements, or refrain from disclosing investigation information. The bill aims to prevent federal agencies from demanding organizations to waive attorney-client privilege, decline legal expenses for employees, avoid joint defense agreements, or refrain from disclosing investigation information. It also prohibits organizations from terminating or disciplining employees for exercising legal rights in a governmental inquiry. The Specter bill (S. 445) additionally prohibits the government from rewarding organizations for waiving attorney-client privilege or work product protection. Both bills allow the government to request information beyond attorney-client privilege or work product protection. Organizations can share internal investigation results with authorities, but the government cannot consider this waiver positively under the Specter bill. The bill (S. 445) aims to prevent federal agencies from demanding organizations to waive attorney-client privilege or work product protection. It is unclear what subsection 3014(e) intends to preserve regarding federal statutes authorizing the examination of privileged material. Few federal statutes explicitly allow inspectors to examine attorney-client or work product material, with most likely preserving privileged material against inspection."
