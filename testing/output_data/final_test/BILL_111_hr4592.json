The \"Veterans Energy-Related Employment Program\" is a pilot program under the Veteran's Workforce Investment Program to encourage the employment of eligible veterans in the energy industry. The program awards competitive grants to three states for the establishment of State Energy-Related Employment Programs, which provide training and certification classes to veterans. States must submit an application outlining how grant funds will be used to be eligible for the program. The proposal aims to use grant funds to establish a public-private partnership program for eligible veterans in the energy industry. States must demonstrate the appropriate veteran population, a strong energy industry, and the ability to carry out the program. The grant funds are to be used by states for making grants to energy employers and labor-management organizations to provide training to eligible veterans. Outreach efforts are also required to inform energy employers, labor-management organizations, and veterans of their eligibility. Grants to states are subject to repayment conditions determined by the Secretary. The State must report on grant fund usage to the Secretary. Energy employers must submit an application to the State Energy-Related Employment Program, including pay rates for eligible veterans and non-veteran employees in similar positions. The pilot program requires energy employers to submit reports quarterly with specified information. Funds cannot be used to train individuals who are not eligible veterans. The Secretary must report annually to Congress on the program's activities and evaluation. Administrative and reporting costs are also outlined. The pilot program allocates 2 percent of funds for administrative costs and reporting. The Secretary determines the maximum amount for administrative costs per grant. Definitions for covered training in the energy industry are provided. The pilot program allocates funds for administrative costs and reporting, with definitions for covered training in the energy industry. An eligible veteran is defined as a veteran employed by an energy employer and enrolled in training. An energy employer is an entity employing individuals in the energy industry. The energy industry includes energy-efficient building, construction, and related sectors. The pilot program authorizes appropriations of $10,000,000 annually from 2011 to 2015 for the Secretary to implement. It covers various industries such as energy-efficient building, renewable electric power, biofuels, energy efficiency assessment, oil and natural gas, and nuclear. The House of Representatives passed the bill on March 23, 2010."
