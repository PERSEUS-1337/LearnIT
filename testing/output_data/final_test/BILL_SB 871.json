    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 52074.5 of the Education Code mandates the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence to establish a statewide infrastructure for providing professional development training on evaluation rubrics to school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools starting from the 2016-17 fiscal year. Professional development training for local control and accountability plans should include all stakeholders like teachers, administrators, parents, and community members. The training must cover various aspects as required by specific sections of the Education Code. The evaluation rubrics are used for developing and implementing local control and accountability plans, improving pupil outcomes, utilizing statewide and local data, and establishing a system of continuous improvement. The California Collaborative for Educational Excellence will provide professional development training statewide to all school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools. They may contract with entities for this purpose. A detailed implementation plan must be submitted to relevant committees within 30 days of the evaluation rubrics' adoption, including expenditure information and a timeline to start training by October 15, 2016. During the 2017\u201318 fiscal year, the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence will conduct a survey of school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools on their use of evaluation rubrics for local control and accountability plans. They may contract with entities to develop, administer, monitor, and analyze the survey. During the 2016\u201317 and 2017\u201318 fiscal years, the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence will implement a pilot program to advise and assist school districts, county superintendents of schools, and charter schools in improving pupil outcomes. This section will only be implemented if funding is provided in the annual Budget Act or another enacted statute. The California Collaborative for Educational Excellence will implement a pilot program to advise and assist educational agencies in improving pupil outcomes. The governing board must submit a plan for the pilot program by August 15, 2016, outlining goals such as enhancing pupil outcomes related to state priorities.

A report on the program's lessons and implications will be submitted by November 1, 2018. Implementation is contingent on funding from the Budget Act or another statute."
