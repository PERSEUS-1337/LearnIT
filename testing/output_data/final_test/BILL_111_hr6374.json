    "content": "Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section on Private Education Loan Refinancing, specifically for physicians. The Secretary will implement a Physician Private Education Loan Refinancing Program, providing funds to refinance private education loans for eligible individuals. The term 'private education loan' is defined as a 'qualified education loan' excluding loans under this title or the Public Health Service Act. Eligibility for loan refinancing is based on specific criteria. Eligible individuals can receive private education loan refinancing if they are in a residency program in specific medical specialties, not enrolled in an eligible institution, and have private education loan debt. The Secretary will refinance private education loans for eligible individuals in residency programs, with terms similar to Federal Direct Consolidation Loans. Eligible loans for refinancing include those not in default and not previously refinanced. The education loan can be refinanced if incurred after July 1, 2008. The maximum amount eligible for refinancing is the sum of unpaid principal, accrued interest, and late charges. The interest rate for refinanced loans is 8.25 percent, with repayment terms similar to Federal Direct Consolidation Loans. The loan cannot be consolidated with other loans. The Secretary will develop a standard application and promissory note for refinanced loans. Loan proceeds will be paid directly to the private education loan holder for debt discharge or reduction. Loan consolidation with other loans, income-based repayment terms, and loan forgiveness/cancellation are not allowed, except in cases of death or permanent disability. The Secretary will report annually to Congress on the volume and repayment status of private education loans refinanced under this section."
