The Global Internet Freedom Act emphasizes the right to communicate freely, including on the Internet, as a tool for democratization and free exchange of ideas. Unrestricted access to news and information online serves as a check on authoritarian rule by repressive governments worldwide. Intergovernmental, nongovernmental, and media organizations report repressive foreign governments jamming, censoring, blocking, monitoring, and restricting Internet access using technologies like firewalls and filters. This includes surveillance of e-mail messages, blocking individuals from visiting certain websites, creating blacklists, and denying access to the Internet. The United States has deployed anti-jamming technologies to counter Internet censorship by repressive governments. Voice of America and Radio Free Asia have allocated funds to combat Internet jamming, particularly by the People's Republic of China. The United States has deployed anti-jamming technologies to counter Internet censorship by repressive governments, including the People's Republic of China. However, US financial support for this technology has lapsed, leading to limited support for Internet freedom in most countries. New initiatives are needed to combat totalitarian and authoritarian controls on news and information over the Internet. The purpose of the initiative is to combat totalitarian and authoritarian controls on news and information over the Internet. The Act aims to establish a global Internet freedom policy, create an office to counter Internet jamming by repressive governments, develop technologies to protect Internet freedom worldwide, allocate resources for technology implementation, and involve the private sector in technology development.

SEC. 4. DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF TECHNOLOGIES TO DEFEAT INTERNET JAMMING AND CENSORSHIP. The Office of Global Internet Freedom is established within the International Broadcasting Bureau to combat state-sponsored Internet jamming and persecution of citizens using the Internet. All US government departments must cooperate with the Office's strategy. A report to Congress is required by March 1 of the following year after the Act's enactment. The Director of the Office will submit a report to Congress on state-sponsored Internet jamming by repressive foreign governments and US efforts to counter it. The report will list countries engaging in Internet jamming, describe the government agencies involved, and detail the technological means used for jamming. The Director may include a classified annex if deemed appropriate. Nothing in the Act authorizes US interference. The Office is authorized to interfere with Internet jamming by repressive foreign governments for legitimate law enforcement aims. $50,000,000 is authorized for each of the fiscal years 2007 and 2008.
