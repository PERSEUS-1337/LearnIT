    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fair Wages for Workers with Disabilities Act of 2011\". Congress finds that advancements in vocational rehabilitation, technology, and training have provided greater opportunities for workers with disabilities, leading to a dramatic increase in their presence in the national workforce. This contrasts with the outdated practice of paying disabled workers below the Federal minimum wage, which dates back to the 1930s when mainstream employment options were limited for individuals with disabilities. Employees with disabilities can be as productive as nondisabled employees with proper rehabilitation services and training. Some employers exploit disabled workers by paying them less than the Federal minimum wage instead of preparing them for competitive employment. Many of these employers benefit from philanthropic donations and preferred status. Some employers exploit disabled workers by paying subminimum wages, claiming lack of profitability. However, other employers are now paying Federal minimum wage or higher to their employees with disabilities without reducing workforces, maintaining profitability. For example, National Industries for the Blind agencies used to exploit blind employees but now follow NIB Board policy to pay fair wages. The Wage and Hour Division oversees special wage certificates for employees with disabilities, ensuring fair pay. Government reports highlight the need for stronger federal efforts in providing employment opportunities and enforcing labor standards in sheltered workshops. The Wage and Hour Division lacks capacity, training, and resources to enforce compliance with the subminimum wage provision for disabled employees. Improving oversight would require significant appropriations better spent on enhancing employment outcomes for people with disabilities. Employers struggle to determine special wages under section 14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, leading to unfair productivity benchmarks. Disabled employees often receive less than the special minimum wage they should under the regulation. Transition to fair wages. The Secretary of Labor will stop issuing special wage certificates under section 14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act to new entities. Existing certificates will be revoked 1 year after enactment for private for-profit entities, 2 years for public or governmental entities, and 3 years for non-profit entities. Section 14(c) of the Act will be repealed 3 years after enactment. Repeal of section 14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 214(c)) will result in revocation of any remaining special wage certificates issued under that section."
