The ESA aims to identify and protect species at risk of extinction, as well as their ecosystems. Listings and actions under the ESA can impact land use and development, with various interests involved in resource issues. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) aims to protect species at risk of extinction and their ecosystems, impacting land use and development. Various interests are involved in resource issues, leading to economic and social disputes. The ESA requires decisions based on the best available science, administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service. The Information Quality Act ensures the objectivity and integrity of the science underlying agency decisions. The Information Quality Act (IQA) led to guidelines from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in 2001 regarding agency information quality. Agencies, including FWS, have implemented additional ESA-related guidelines and adopted a new Scientific Integrity Policy. Discussions have focused on the use of science in ESA processes, such as listing species, consulting on federal actions, and developing recovery plans. Hearings have addressed the need for more scientific rigor in ESA implementation and efforts to prevent political manipulation of scientific conclusions. Bills introduced in Congress have aimed to require empirical data, independent scientific reviews, and increased public involvement in decision-making. Efforts to amend the Endangered Species Act (ESA) regarding the role of science have sparked debates. Some argue for considerations beyond species conservation, while others question the need for changes, citing the balance struck by the ESA. Challenges include the costs and time needed to gather extensive data, especially for lesser-known species that are hard to study. Restrictions on activities further complicate the issue. The report discusses controversies surrounding \"sound science\" in relation to the Endangered Species Act (ESA), addressing the role of science in ESA implementation, legal and policy contexts, current requirements on information quality, and legislation to address concerns. Congressional attention has been drawn to issues like sample tampering in population surveys for Canada lynx, treatment of surplus hatchery-propagated salmon, and concerns regarding Steller sea lion. The report discusses controversies surrounding \"sound science\" in relation to the Endangered Species Act (ESA), addressing the role of science in ESA implementation, legal and policy contexts, current requirements on information quality, and legislation to address concerns. Congressional attention has been drawn to issues like sample tampering in population surveys for Canada lynx, treatment of surplus hatchery-propagated salmon, concerns regarding Steller sea lion protection, conflicts with North Pacific fishery management, and eastern gray wolves. A federal interagency group conducted a nationwide survey in 1999 to detect the presence of Canada lynx, using DNA analysis of hair samples to identify the species. Tracking surveys were conducted to verify hits in unknown lynx habitat. Controversy arose from media reports of irregularities in the collection and testing of lynx survey samples, with concerns about unplanned test samples potentially extending the known range of ESA-protected lynx and imposing additional restrictions on land owners. The controversy surrounding the listing of lynx raised concerns about media sensationalism and irregular sample collection. The difficulty of studying rare species with unknown ranges was highlighted, leading to a petition for a change in the listing. Carson Forest Watch and Sierra Club petitioned to include parts of northern New Mexico in the lynx listing. FWS determined the area warranted inclusion but assigned a low priority level. The designation of critical habitat for the species has also been contentious, leading to a lawsuit to force FWS to propose critical habitat by a specific date. On November 9, 2006, FWS designated approximately 1,841 square miles of critical habitat in Minnesota, Montana, and Washington. Environmental and scientific groups challenged the boundaries, leading to a lawsuit to expand the designated critical habitat. FWS later expanded the critical habitat to approximately 39,000 square miles in several states. The 2009 critical habitat designation for lynx was ruled invalid in parts of Maine, Minnesota, Montana, Idaho, Washington, and Wyoming due to inadequate consideration of economic impacts. Former deputy assistant secretary Julie MacDonald may have improperly reduced the designation. The court stopped the application of the critical habitat in areas with inadequate economic analysis. Another court decision found flaws in the designation but allowed it to remain while FWS assessed lynx-occupied areas in certain national forests. Natural fish are genetically diverse and more robust than hatchery fish. The NMFS issued an Interim Hatchery Listing Policy in 1993 to consider hatchery fish in listing determinations for Pacific salmon and steelhead species. A federal court later found the policy violated the ESA by listing below the species level, leading to a revision of the policy in 2005. The final Hatchery Listing Policy (HLP) requires NMFS to consider the status of hatchery and wild salmon in the same evolutionarily significant unit (ESU) without different listing status. The Hatchery Listing Policy (HLP) was released in 2005, requiring NMFS to consider the entire ESU when determining species listing. Two suits were filed challenging the HLP's impact on steelhead trout, with the court ultimately finding it invalid due to not being based on the best available scientific data and undermining the ESA's goal of preserving natural populations. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on the application of NMFS's risk assessment criteria to fish populations with hatchery and wild fish. The court invalidated the downlisting of steelhead from endangered to threatened using the HLP but upheld the decision to include both hatchery and wild fish in the same ESU. The court distinguished between defining the species and determining listing status, allowing NMFS to consider the effects of hatchery fish on wild fish during the listing phase. Discretion was given to NMFS's science, despite the lack of scientific consensus on the threat hatchery fish pose to wild fish. The appellate court reversed the lower court's decision on downlisting fish, stating that hatchery fish may not necessarily endanger wild fish. Another lawsuit focused on how the HLP impacted salmon, with the court ruling that NMFS properly considered the different extinction risks between hatchery and wild fish. The Ninth Circuit Court affirmed the decision regarding special regulations for taking salmon. Additionally, the declining population of Steller sea lions was listed as endangered in 1990 under the ESA. The intense fishing for pollock, Pacific cod, and Atka mackerel off Alaska was causing localized depletion of these fish, leading to starvation of Steller sea lions. NMFS faced criticism from commercial fishermen for making jeopardy findings on fishing levels under the ESA based on untested hypotheses. However, NMFS insisted on a higher standard of certainty for the science under the Magnuson-Stevens Act. After Steller sea lion feeding studies raised questions about the localized depletion hypothesis, NMFS took a different approach in a fourth biological opinion on fisheries authorization. Litigation on this issue was settled in 2003, and NMFS published an addendum to clarify the effects of the fisheries. In 2010, NMFS published an addendum to its 2001 biological opinion and completed a Final Programmatic Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement concerning the Alaska groundfish fishery. Restrictions on commercial fishing in the western Aleutians were imposed to protect Steller sea lions, leading to litigation and a court-ordered environmental impact statement. Wolves exhibit adaptability in behavior and presence across various ecosystems, with variations in color, size, and bone structure leading to classification as different subspecies or populations. Biologists classify wolves differently, with some recognizing multiple subspecies or populations while others see only one species with variations. Lumpers minimize differences, while splitters emphasize them, leading to debates on classification. Wolves, found in temperate and polar regions, exhibit adaptability in behavior and physical characteristics. In May 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed recognizing a third species of wolf, Canis lycaon, in addition to the gray and red wolf. This new species designation would apply to wolves primarily in the eastern United States, sparking significant academic debate in the context of the Endangered Species Act. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed recognizing a third species of wolf, Canis lycaon, in addition to the gray and red wolf. This new species designation would apply to wolves primarily in the eastern United States. However, scientific evidence for this separation is equivocal, with some experts considering it a distinct species while others view it as a subspecies of Canis lupus. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed recognizing a third species of wolf, Canis lycaon, primarily in the eastern United States. The debate over the validity of this new species considers evidence related to mitochondrial DNA, morphology, hybridization with coyotes, and population densities. A change in taxonomic status could de-list eastern wolves, with the ESA potentially used to restrict greenhouse gas emissions. The Center for Biological Diversity proposes listing animals threatened by climate change as endangered, using the ESA to restrict greenhouse gas emissions. This approach has not been tested in court, but could lead to negotiations for limiting emissions from sources like coal-fired power plants. In federal projects related to power plants, only one case involved climate change allegations, but it was unclear if they were based on the ESA. Claims were made in different cases that emissions harmed specific species near power plants, not alleging global harm. Courts did not review ESA claims due to procedural reasons. In another case, it was held that the ESA was not violated, and claims of harm to species were not based on greenhouse gases. Despite limited litigation on climate change affecting species, regulatory changes were made to limit such lawsuits. In December 2008, FWS changed regulations regarding federal project impacts on listed species, but Congress halted them. Definitions were modified to exclude consultation on greenhouse gas emissions' effects on species. Despite changes being revoked, the scope of effects remains limited. Another regulation restricts lawsuits for polar bear incidental takes to Alaska. The polar bear was listed under the act due to shrinking habitat caused by changing climate. The regulation prevents lawsuits in states other than Alaska for harming polar bears indirectly. FWS designated 187,000 square miles in Alaska as critical habitat. There have been claims of interference in scientific decisions under ESA. The DOI Inspector General found that Julie MacDonald interfered with scientific determinations regarding endangered species, leading to her resignation. Allegations of Vice President Cheney's involvement were not investigated by DOI. FWS reconsidered decisions as a result of the IG investigation and MacDonald's resignation. FWS reconsidered decisions concerning eight species after the IG investigation found that Julie MacDonald influenced outcomes without scientific basis. The Center for Biological Diversity filed a notice of intent to sue DOI for interference with decision-making on 55 listed species. Claims included FWS elimination of critical habitat, de-listing or down-listing species, and not listing others, primarily influenced by MacDonald and other DOI officials. FWS announced reviews and changes in previous ESA decisions due to interference in scientific analysis. Ms. MacDonald's influence led to adjustments in critical habitat determinations for species like bull trout. Listing determinations for species like greater sage grouse were sent back to the agency by federal courts. The importance of \"science\" or \"sound science\" is emphasized in the ESA debate, with conflicting studies supporting different actions. In the context of the ESA debate, the definition of science and its role in decision-making is crucial. Science is a way of knowing based on observations and experiments, producing explanations for phenomena. Scientific knowledge includes facts, hypotheses, laws, and theories. Scientific knowledge is dynamic, changing with new information. Science produces the best explanation of natural phenomena based on available data. Conclusions depend on the questions asked, and the scientific method involves formulating hypotheses and making predictions. The scientific method involves formulating hypotheses, making predictions, and designing experiments to test these predictions. After multiple tests validate predictions, a hypothesis becomes a scientific theory or law. This process is the basis of western science and may vary based on the objective and subject matter. It starts with casual observations, leading to a hypothesis, testable predictions, data collection, and classification to test the predictions. The scientific method involves formulating hypotheses, conducting experiments, and interpreting data to draw conclusions. Models may be developed to describe phenomena or make predictions. Results are often published after peer review, contributing to scientific knowledge. Accepted theories and laws are subject to re-examination with new information. Science gives weight to viewpoints through rigorous testing and validation processes. Scientific peer reviews evaluate analysis, interpretations, and conclusions from data, while models, such as physical models and mathematical formulas, are used to predict outcomes based on changing variables. Models are an integral part of the scientific process, allowing for confirmation, modification, or discarding as new information arises. Models are essential in the scientific process, allowing for prediction and confirmation of outcomes. Decision-makers may refer to models, facts, and scientific theories. Traditional knowledge and common sense also contribute valuable insights, such as observations from elders in Native groups or a scientist's experience with a species. Attention is now given to previously disregarded information. Common sense observations, like the impact of dry creek beds on salmon or sediment runoff from heavy rain, are also worth studying. The scientific method values transparency and updating of data to advance knowledge. Policy decisions based on science should also include a transparent process. Policy decisions based on science should involve a transparent process and a commitment to gather new information to ensure consistency with the best available science. Data-gathering speed may surpass regulatory processes, but lack of funding or transparency can hinder decision-making based on the best-available standard. Scientists focus on facts, observations, models, and hypotheses, while policy-makers ask different types of questions. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) relies heavily on scientific input for listing determinations and permit actions, with the majority of actions being non-controversial. However, the interaction between scientists and decision-makers can be challenging due to the complexity, uncertainty, and risk associated with ESA issues. The ESA specifies that listing decisions should be based solely on scientific criteria. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) relies on scientific input for listing decisions and permit actions, but lacks clear guidelines on assessing risk. Decision-makers face challenges in responding to forecasts and probabilities without specific guidance from the ESA. In addressing questions of risk, scientists provide quantitative responses. Different parties may have varying risk tolerances when determining the status of a species. The boundary between science and policy can be blurred, with decision-makers sometimes seeking certainty from science for complex policy decisions. This can lead to policy questions being framed as science questions, and scientists being asked to make policy choices. Despite efforts to maintain objectivity through peer review, science may still be influenced by subjective interpretations. Scientists may be influenced by personal values or employer policies, affecting the questions they ask, experiments conducted, and interpretation of results. This can lead to subtle biases that may be challenging for courts and policymakers to assess. The diversity indices used in forest planning favored species like ruffed grouse and pileated woodpeckers, leading to a preference for timber harvest in the chosen alternative. The discovery of the snail darter in the Little Tennessee River led to its listing as endangered and sparked controversy over the construction of the Tellico Dam. The fish's habitat was threatened by the proposed dam, highlighting the risks of unstated assumptions in scientific inquiry. The construction of a large dam in the riverine habitat led to the discovery of the snail darter in small numbers at additional locations, resulting in its reclassification as threatened in 1984. The bias in searching specific areas caused controversy and lawsuits, highlighting the importance of thorough habitat searches in scientific inquiry. Federal statutes have influenced data collection by agencies, with oversight powers located in the Office of Management and Budget through the Information Quality Act. The Information Quality Act (IQA) directs OMB to issue guidelines for federal agencies to ensure quality information dissemination, establish correction procedures, and report complaints. Departments and agencies must create their own guidelines to achieve information quality goals and allow for information correction requests. Some view the IQA positively for improving procedures and credibility of information. The OMB guidelines under the Information Quality Act (IQA) define government information, dissemination, and quality standards. The guidelines aim to review information for objectivity, utility, and integrity before public distribution. Objectivity in information presentation is crucial, ensuring accuracy, clarity, completeness, and lack of bias. The OMB guidelines emphasize peer review as a key factor in maintaining objectivity, with agency-sponsored peer reviews needing to meet specific criteria for credibility and competence. The OMB guidelines stress the importance of peer review for maintaining objectivity in information presentation. Peer reviewers should have necessary technical expertise, disclose prior positions on issues, funding sources, and conduct reviews openly and rigorously. Integrity of information is crucial to prevent unauthorized access or revision, ensuring information is not compromised through corruption or falsification, which is relevant to current ESA issues and accusations. The IQA has had little effect on ESA court cases, with examples including the U.S. Air Force challenging a FWS decision on slickspot peppergrass and a farming association claiming a FWS biological opinion on delta smelt violated the IQA. The court ruled in favor of the agencies in both cases. The ESA agencies have adopted various policies to interpret the use of science in implementing the ESA, including new policies since the enactment of the IQA. The Department of the Interior has promulgated information quality guidelines available on the FWS website. Various FWS documents addressed issues of incomplete scientific information before the IQA guidelines were issued, with the precautionary principle of \"saving all the pieces\" emphasized in the Endangered Species Consultation Handbook. The \"best information available\" language in the ESA allows FWS to issue biological opinions even with inadequate information, giving the benefit of the doubt to the species. If inadequate information is used, the federal agency must show actions won't harm the species and make efforts to gather more information. In 1994, before the IQA was enacted, FWS and NMFS developed interagency policies on information standards under the ESA. Federal biologists are required to impartially review and evaluate information for listing, consultation, recovery, and permitting actions, ensuring it is reliable and credible. They must document their evaluations and use the best scientific and commercial data available. The agencies use the best scientific and commercial data available as the basis for recommendations and decisions. They review documents to ensure the quality of the science used. Expert opinions and peer reviews are solicited to ensure the best biological and commercial information is considered in listing decisions. Independent peer reviews may be used to enhance decision-making. The agencies use the best scientific and commercial data available for decision-making, including expert opinions and peer reviews to ensure quality. OMB's Final Information Quality Bulletin for Peer Review outlines procedures based on the level of influence of the information, with agencies having some discretion in formulating peer review plans. FWS and NMFS have procedures in place that meet IQA requirements, such as soliciting independent expert reviews for listing decisions like Pacific salmon. NMFS sought technical review of proposed salmon listings from over 50 independent experts. A scientific integrity policy for DOI, including FWS, was announced by Secretary Ken Salazar in 2011. The Department of the Interior (DOI) has a policy on scientific integrity for contractors and persons working on scientific research. This policy includes provisions for the free flow of scientific information, whistleblower protections, definitions of conflict of interest and misconduct, and a code of conduct for all individuals involved in DOI activities. The Department of the Interior (DOI) has a policy on scientific integrity for contractors and persons working on scientific research, including provisions for free flow of scientific information, whistleblower protections, conflict of interest, and misconduct. The policy also includes a code of conduct for individuals involved in DOI activities, procedures for reporting and resolving allegations of misconduct, and specified corrective actions. The new department-wide code may not result in significant practical change as similar policies already exist for some DOI agencies. If scientific misconduct is alleged at FWS, the FWS Director establishes a Scientific Integrity Review Panel (SIRP) according to specified procedures. The FWS Director establishes a Scientific Integrity Review Panel (SIRP) to investigate allegations of misconduct, including fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism. The panel consists of a chair appointed by the director, three members with subject matter expertise, and the agency's human resources officer as an ad hoc member. The panel aims to reach a consensus decision, and its report is sent to the Departmental Scientific Integrity Officer (DSIO) and the FWS SIO. The FWS Director establishes a Scientific Integrity Review Panel (SIRP) to investigate misconduct allegations. Reports are sent to the DSIO, FWS SIO, and relevant manager for advice and recommendations. Investigations were conducted seven times in FY2012, with three closed due to no misconduct found. Two investigations are ongoing, and one found verifiable allegations. The DOI Inspector General investigated misconduct allegations, finding some verifiable and some not. One case of misconduct is with the DOI Solicitor. Ten queries to the FWS SIO in FY2012 led to two open cases, with no misconduct in the other eight. NOAA, including NMFS, released a Scientific Integrity Policy in 2011, outlining principles, codes of conduct, and compliance training. NOAA released a Scientific Integrity Policy in 2011, which includes compliance training, a website for employees, and procedures for resolving misconduct allegations. The policy applies to all NOAA employees, contractors, and recipients of financial assistance. Misconduct must be proven intentionally, knowingly, or in reckless disregard of the policy. NOAA's Scientific Integrity Policy outlines procedures for addressing misconduct allegations. The Deputy Undersecretary for Operations assesses the credibility of allegations and appoints an Integrity Review Panel to collect evidence. The Determining Official decides if an investigation is necessary based on the inquiry report. If misconduct is confirmed, appropriate administrative actions are taken. During the period from December 7, 2011, to September 30, 2012, NOAA received three allegations of scientific misconduct. Two cases are still ongoing, while one was dismissed. Some groups of organisms may lack experts for peer reviews, posing challenges for regulatory agencies. Compensating scientists for peer reviews is also an issue. Compensating scientists for peer reviews can be challenging, especially in contentious areas that may require extensive meetings and time away from primary research. Achieving impartial peer review may also be difficult if scientists have a personal interest in the subject being reviewed. The National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis at the University of California, Santa Barbara, reviewed 135 recovery plans for 181 species listed under the ESA. They found that recovery criteria were not always based on biological information, and plans developed with federal scientists only lacked attention to species biology. FWS responded with 10 action items to strengthen recovery planning. The debate over the application of science in ESA decisions involves various stakeholders like property rights advocates, business interests, environmentalists, scientific organizations, and federal agencies. The scarcity of information on wild and rare species raises questions about listing criteria and taxonomic status, such as the case of the Canada lynx and proposed changes to wolf protection under ESA. The debate over the application of science in ESA decisions involves various stakeholders and questions about listing criteria for species protection. Should wide-ranging species be protected under ESA, and how should the federal government regulate in the absence of complete information? Different constituencies react to ESA decisions based on factors like job loss and economic concerns. The federal government's decisions on ESA protection criteria are debated by different stakeholders. Some argue for certainty in species presence and taxonomic validity, while others advocate for a margin of safety to prevent extinction. Protecting species early on can avoid costly measures later. The precautionary principle is invoked by various interests to promote ecological balance and protect species. It involves acting to reduce harm in situations where potential harm is serious and irreversible, even without full scientific certainty. This principle is used by both scientists and those concerned about job loss to protect species and habitats. The precautionary principle raises questions about how regulations should be administered. The precautionary principle raises questions about how regulations should be administered, particularly regarding the burden of proof for protecting species in projects like dam construction that could harm habitats. The Fish and Wildlife Service may issue a jeopardy opinion based on sound science to ensure species are not jeopardized. The Fish and Wildlife Service's decision to use the precautionary principle in dam construction projects is based on sound science, as there is insufficient information to guarantee the safety of the listed fish species. Supporters of the dam may argue that the fish could survive in the new reservoir or question the validity of the science behind the decision. However, the underlying scientific information remains the same, leading to opposing views on the application of the precautionary principle in this scenario. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) does not explicitly address the balancing act between species protection and human interests, but it is implied that declining species should be given the benefit of the doubt and a margin of safety provided. Many scientists support this approach, emphasizing the importance of using the best available scientific data to save and recover species. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) requires decisions to list a species be based on the best scientific and commercial data available, taking into account efforts to protect the species. The balance between species protection and economic interests leans towards less protection, potentially denying needed protection for endangered species. The 1982 amendments to the ESA added the word \"solely\" to clarify that listing a species as endangered or threatened should be a biological decision without considering economic factors. The interpretation of relevant science can be challenging due to incomplete data and differing scientific opinions. Listing a species is likened to diagnosing cancer, where the decision should be strictly based on medical factors. Congress provided that scientific data alone should be the basis for listing decisions under the ESA, but other factors are considered in other decisions and actions. Science plays a role in post-listing decisions, such as designating critical habitat for listed species and the consultation process under Section 7 of the act. Agencies assess if proposed actions might harm listed species, and FWS or NMFS provide a biological opinion on potential impacts. The science underlying opinions and recommended alternatives to proposed agency actions must be summarized and often challenged. Judicial review can ensure sound agency decisions and use of scientific data under the Administrative Procedure Act. The Supreme Court has outlined circumstances where a rule may be considered arbitrary. The Supreme Court has outlined circumstances where a rule may be considered arbitrary and capricious, such as when the agency fails to consider important aspects of the problem or offers explanations that contradict the evidence. Courts are generally deferential to agency decisions, especially in matters involving the agency's expertise, but this presumption can be rebutted if the decision lacks reasoning and explanation. In the ESA context, APA standards may require agency decisions to be rationally related to species decline problems. Courts have discussed using science and best available data within the ESA, stating agencies must rely on current or superior biological information for listing decisions. The agency cannot ignore relevant biological data, even if uncertain, and must articulate a rational relation between facts found and decisions made. Federal agencies requesting consultation under the ESA must provide the most relevant scientific data available, even if not perfect. They cannot rely on inaccurate data or postpone listing a declining species based on uncertain future actions. The Services must use existing regulatory mechanisms in their listing determinations. The Fish and Wildlife Service must base its listings on the best scientific data available, not speculation or uncertain future actions. Court rulings emphasize the importance of conservation measures before a species is conclusively headed for extinction. Agencies must provide relevant scientific data for ESA consultations and use existing regulatory mechanisms in listing determinations. In the context of issuing Incidental Take Permits under Section 10 of the ESA, the Fish and Wildlife Service must demonstrate a species is or could be in an area before regulating it. The bar for evidence is low, but it must be cleared. One court held that a biological opinion not \"coextensive in scope\" with the agency action was arbitrary and capricious. Several bills have been introduced in the last decade regarding conservation measures for endangered species. Several bills have been introduced in the last decade to address the role of science in ESA decisions, but none have been enacted. In the 112th Congress, bills such as H.R. 909, S. 706, and S. 1720 aimed to prohibit consideration of climate change-related impacts on species. H.R. 1837 sought to prevent distinctions between natural-spawned and hatchery-spawned species under the ESA. No bills have been introduced in the 113th Congress to amend the ESA. Artificially propagated strains of a species are considered in ESA determinations for anadromous fish in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. Proponents of \"sound science\" legislation argue for ESA amendments to address perceived extremism and improve private property rights. They believe amendments would require species to be genuinely endangered for listing, prevent the use of falsified data, and enhance recreational and commercial access to public lands. Opponents of the \"sound science\" legislation argue that it would weaken the ESA by imposing unachievable requirements, potentially benefiting industry at the expense of wildlife conservation efforts. They believe it could increase costs, delays, and bureaucracy associated with implementing the nation's most important wildlife conservation law. In July 2002, over 300 scientists sent a letter to Congress expressing concerns about potential changes to the Endangered Species Act. They argued against adding requirements that could weaken the Act's provisions and increase bureaucratic procedures. The scientists emphasized the importance of following the precautionary principle to protect listed species. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) expressed concerns about proposed legislation impacting listed species, citing budgetary impacts and potential delays in decision-making. They believe existing authority allows for necessary improvements in using science. Despite occasional controversies, most science-based decisions under the Endangered Species Act are not contentious. Actions by FWS or NMFS under the Endangered Species Act can sometimes be controversial, with debates over the balance between protection and economic welfare. Scientific integrity is generally upheld, but the effectiveness of science-based decisions remains a topic of debate."
