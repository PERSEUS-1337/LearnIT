    "content": "This report focuses on remittances, which are money and capital sent by migrants and foreign immigrant communities to their home country. The number of foreign-born residents in the United States is at its highest level in history, reaching 42.4 million in 2014. Foreign migrants in the U.S. sent $56.3 billion in remittances in 2014, around 13% of the worldwide total. Worldwide remittance flows in 2015 exceeded $601 billion, with developing countries estimated to receive about $432 billion. Remittances are a significant source of foreign capital for developing countries, exceeding $601 billion globally in 2015. Developing countries are estimated to receive about $432 billion, nearly three times the amount of official development assistance. Remittances are second only to foreign direct investment as a source of foreign capital. Recent financial reform legislation has provided federal consumer protections and regulations on remittance transactions to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. The text discusses U.S. remittance flows, the regulatory regime for sending remittances, and key issues for Congress. Remittances are migrant financial transfers, with data primarily sourced from the IMF and published by the World Bank. Efforts are ongoing to improve remittance data accuracy. Remittances are defined as workers' remittances, compensation of employees, and migrants' transfers according to the IMF's Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook. Migrants living in a host country for over a year are considered residents, regardless of immigration status. Compensation of employees includes wages, salaries, and benefits of nonresident workers. Migrants' transfers are assets moved between countries during migration. Remittance transactions involve senders, recipients, intermediaries, and payment systems. Remittances can be sent through informal or formal channels. Hawala, an informal value transfer system, is a well-known method used in South Asia and the Middle East for several hundred years. These systems are less expensive and provide anonymity, reaching countries without formal banking sectors. While mostly used for legitimate purposes, they can be attractive for money laundering and terrorist financing. Formal channels involve licensed intermediaries like banks, credit unions, and money service businesses such as Western Union. The cost of sending remittances can vary significantly due to factors like transfer fees, regulatory costs, volume sent, and exchange rates. While costs have slightly decreased in recent years, more progress is needed to meet the G8 target of 5% set in 2009. Global average remittance costs have declined from 9.81% of the total transaction. The global average remittance cost has decreased from 9.81% in 2008 to 7.53% in 2016. The United States is one of the least costly countries to send money from, with an average cost of 6.04% in 2016. Banks are the most expensive providers, followed by post offices, while Money Transfer Operators like Western Union and Moneygram are the cheapest. Remittances have steadily increased over the past three decades, surpassing foreign direct investment and private capital flows to developing countries in 1990. Remittances to developing countries have surpassed foreign direct investment and private capital flows. In 2015, remittances were estimated at $432 billion, with India, China, and the Philippines being the top receiving countries. The growth of remittances has been fueled by large diaspora populations, with significant increases in East Asia, Pacific, and South Asia regions between 2000 and 2014. Remittances to developing countries have grown significantly, with a 571% increase from $17 billion in 2000 to $116 billion in 2014. Sub-Saharan Africa also saw a 608% increase in remittances, reaching $34 billion in 2014. India, China, Philippines, and Mexico are the top recipients of remittances. Remittances play a crucial role in the economies of emerging markets and middle-income countries, while for poorer nations like Tajikistan, they are essential for economic stability after conflicts. Remittances account for a significant portion of national GDP in many countries, with the United States being the largest source of global remittances. Other major sources include Saudi Arabia, Russia, Switzerland, and Germany. In 2014, the World Bank recorded $56.3 billion in official remittance outflows from the United States. The U.S. is a major source of global remittances, with significant outflows recorded by the World Bank in 2014. The World Bank estimates bilateral remittance flows between member countries, with MSBs dominating the U.S. foreign remittance market. MSBs offer various financial services and operate outside conventional banks. MSBs, such as Western Union and MoneyGram, cater to foreign remittance customers who are often unbanked. These customers can cash paychecks, send money abroad, and shop at the same location. Banks traditionally do not offer remittance services due to high costs. Banks primarily market money transfer services to corporate clients due to high costs. The median amount for consumer-initiated wire transfers is $6,500, much larger than typical remittance transactions. Many remittance recipients lack bank accounts and prefer to receive cash. International wire transfers require both sender and receiver to have deposit accounts. Banks use \"open loop\" payment systems like wire transfers, unlike MSBs which use \"closed loop\" systems. Unions and MSBs use different payment systems for remittances. MSBs have wider distribution networks than traditional financial institutions. Banks are increasingly interested in providing remittance services directly to consumers. Remittance services can help low-income migrants access financial products like savings accounts and loans. Credit unions are encouraged to participate in remittance services through networks like the World Council of Credit Unions' International Remittance Network. The World Council of Credit Unions' International Remittance Network facilitates international money transfers through the ACH system, allowing for lower prices compared to traditional wire transfers. Financial transfers are batched and sent on a fixed schedule by originating institutions to ACH operators for processing. This system is also used for various small international transfers. Since 2001, the U.S. Federal Reserve has offered \"account-to-receiver\" FedGlobal services for international ACH transfers, allowing funds to be sent from U.S. financial institutions to unbanked receivers in Europe, Mexico, Panama, and Latin America. Participation in the remittance market by banks and credit unions is growing but still limited. In 2014, the two U.S. ACH operators processed 18.3 billion ACH transactions. In 2014, the two U.S. ACH operators handled 18.3 billion ACH transactions, with only 0.3% initiated by businesses or consumers. New technologies have led to a rise in remittance services, including options like computer and mobile-based payments, pre-paid cards, directed transfers, and money transfers through social media. The World Bank's CGAP found 41 \"branchless\" remittance providers in 2013, up from 10 in 2010. Traditional providers are now offering flat fees and transparent foreign exchange rates. Remittance providers are adapting to competition by introducing flat fees and transparent foreign exchange rates. International standards for remittances are set by the FATF and BIS. In the U.S., banks and credit unions are closely regulated at state and federal levels, focusing on AML and CFT. State regulators oversee federally chartered banks and MSBs. The CFPB enforces consumer protection since October 2013. The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) enforces consumer protection measures under the Dodd-Frank Act. Global remittance standards have emerged due to concerns about unregulated money transfer services. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) develops policies to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, established by the G-7 countries in 1989. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) sets standards for member countries to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. In 2001, FATF issued special recommendations, including regulating all Money Service Businesses (MSBs). Recommendations relevant to remittance providers include wire transfers, record keeping, internal controls, and suspicious transaction reporting. In 2007, the BIS and the World Bank issued General Principles for International Remittance Services to improve operational aspects of remittance transfers. General Principle 3 emphasizes the need for a sound legal and regulatory framework, in line with FATF recommendations, for remittance services to be safe and efficient. Remittance providers in the US must comply with relevant FATF recommendations. Providers, including banks and MSBs, must comply with the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) by implementing controls to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The BSA requires financial institutions to maintain records and file reports for investigations. FinCEN administers the BSA, and MSBs are subject to its regulatory controls. Remittance providers must verify customer identities and maintain financial records. MSBs must verify customer identities and maintain financial records. They must file Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs) for transactions over $10,000 and Suspicious Activities Reports (SARs) for dubious transactions over $2,000. Remittances to certain foreign countries may be subject to sanctions by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The U.S. government restricts remittances only to countries, individuals, or companies under U.S. sanctions and embargoes. The Treasury Department does not have the authority to direct financial institutions on maintaining specific accounts. Regulations on remittance providers are seen as burdensome, leading many to stop services, especially affecting customers sending money to low-income and post-conflict countries. For example, Somalis in Minnesota send $100 million in remittances to Somalia annually. In Somalia, U.S. and international financial institutions have stopped processing payments due to concerns about funds ending up with terrorists. Minnesota-based Sunrise Community Banks ceased banking services for Somali-owned money brokers in 2011. State regulatory efforts focus on consumer protection, with most states requiring money transmitters to be licensed. Only Montana, New Mexico, and South Carolina do not require state licenses for MSBs. In response to concerns from U.S. immigrant communities, Congress created new consumer protections under the Dodd Frank Act. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau released a final rule on remittance provisions, requiring providers to disclose transfer price, currency amount, and availability date before payment. Only Montana, New Mexico, and South Carolina do not require state licenses for MSBs. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Final Rule on remittance provisions increases consumer protections by requiring providers to investigate disputes and remedy errors related to transactions. The rule provides greater flexibility for disclosing third-party fees and taxes, and exempts providers from error remedy procedures for errors made by customers. The new protections aim to improve transparency and potentially decrease the cost of remittances in the long run. While efforts to improve transparency and competition in remittance services may benefit in the long run, short-term costs may increase for providers due to maintaining updated information on exchange rates and fees. This could lead to higher costs for customers and potential litigation risks. Previous U.S. initiatives have aimed to use remittances for economic development and financial inclusion. Monthly remittances of a few hundred dollars can make a significant impact in developing countries. Monthly remittances of just a few hundred dollars can significantly reduce poverty in recipient countries by providing for food, shelter, and other goods. A study found that in Mexico, 78% of remittances were spent on household goods, 8% on savings, 7% on education, and 6% on luxury goods or investments. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) launched the Diaspora Networks Alliance in 2011 to deepen diasporas' engagement in home country development. The Building Remittance Investment for Development Growth and Entrepreneurship (BRIDGE) Initiative, announced by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2010, aims to use remittance flows as an asset for infrastructure and commercial development in Honduras and El Salvador. The USAID-supported BRIDGE Initiative aims to raise financing for infrastructure and commercial development in Honduras and El Salvador using remittance flows. Barriers to securitizing remittance flows include underdeveloped financial sectors in receiving countries. Remittances can promote financial inclusion and development by improving access to financial services. The U.S. government supports a remittance service in Mexico, increasing access to financial services. Remittances help recipients open bank accounts and use traditional financial products in the United States. U.S. law does not require citizenship for banking or remittance services. Key issues on remittances that Members of Congress may want to consider include exploring the regulatory regime for remittance providers and customers, ensuring effective and proportional regulation to reduce corruption and enhance transparency. Concerns are raised about the costs for remittance providers and consumers in navigating banking and anti-money laundering regulations. Large depository institutions may be reducing services related to remittances. Reports indicate that large depository institutions are limiting correspondent banking relationships, affecting smaller institutions' ability to offer remittance services. Nonbank payment providers are also facing account terminations, hindering their access to the financial system and ability to provide services. Recent reform proposals suggest centralizing regulation of money transmission businesses or harmonizing state and federal rules on MSBs. Recent congressional efforts have been made to harmonize state and federal rules on Money Services Businesses (MSBs). Legislation such as H.R. 4331 and the Money Remittances Improvement Act of 2014 aim to facilitate compliance with regulations and improve coordination between state and federal regulators for MSBs. The legislation aims to improve compliance with federal requirements for Money Services Businesses (MSBs) and enhance coordination between state and federal regulators. It could lead to better allocation of resources, targeting of higher risk MSBs, and improved AML/CFT compliance in the financial industry. Suggestions include prioritizing access to remittance services for communities like Somali Americans, with potential support for technical assistance in poorly regulated jurisdictions like Somalia. Congressional members may also consider the impact of current regulations on MSB development. Members of Congress may explore the impact of current regulatory regimes on emerging payments systems for remittances, such as mobile, card, or Internet-based models. There are concerns that existing money transmission laws may not be suitable for these new systems, leading to potential issues with coverage, liability, and AML/CFT compliance. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) are expected to have a growing role as mobile remittance services expand. Additionally, the implementation of consumer protections under the \"Dodd-Frank\" Act may be a focus for Congress. Some argue that new consumer protections for remittances may lower costs by increasing fee transparency, while others believe it will raise costs and deter service providers. There are differing views on whether the U.S. government should promote remittances as a development tool, with some focusing on economic impact and others on poverty alleviation. Some argue that remittances are an anti-poverty tool and policymakers should focus on reducing transaction costs and creating more labor migration opportunities. Concerns have been raised about customer identification policies not requiring documentation of legal U.S. immigration status, potentially undermining immigration law enforcement. Senator David Vitter introduced the Remittance Status Verification Act of 2015 to address this issue. The Remittance Status Verification Act of 2015 proposes a 7% fine for remittance senders unable to prove legal U.S. immigration status. Restrictions on remittances may drive transactions underground, posing AML/CFT risks and hindering financial inclusion efforts."
