    "content": "The Act titled \"Planning for American Energy Act of 2012\" includes a provision for a strategic plan for onshore domestic energy production. This plan is outlined in a new section added to the Mineral Leasing Act, focusing on federal onshore energy production strategy. The \"Planning for American Energy Act of 2012\" includes a provision for a Quadrennial Federal Onshore Energy Production Strategy developed by the Secretary of the Interior to promote energy security. The strategy considers projected energy demands for the next 30 years and aims to meet those demands through energy derived from Federal onshore lands. The Secretary of the Interior will establish a domestic strategic production objective for increasing energy independence and production from Federal onshore lands, focusing on oil and natural gas production from lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service. The best estimates, based on commercial and scientific data, of the expected increase in domestic coal production, production of strategic and critical energy minerals, and electricity production from various sources on Federal lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service. The Secretary has the authority to expand the energy development plan to include other energy production technology sources or advancements in energy on Federal lands. The Secretary shall consult with the Administrator of the Energy Information Administration regarding the methodology used to arrive at its estimates for purposes of this section. The plan includes estimates of the expected increase in unconventional energy production, domestic production of oil, natural gas, coal, and renewable sources from tribal lands for federally recognized Indian tribes. The Secretary has the authority to expand the energy development plan to include other energy production technology sources on Federal lands. Federally recognized Indian tribes may set their own production objectives as part of the Strategy. The Secretary will work with tribes that elect to participate in achieving their strategic energy objectives. The relevant Secretary has the authority to determine additional lands for production objectives unless the President deems it against national interests. The Secretary has the authority to expand energy development plans to include various sources on Federal lands. Federally recognized Indian tribes can set their own production goals. The Secretary will collaborate with participating tribes to achieve their energy objectives. The relevant Secretary can designate additional lands for production goals unless deemed against national interests. The Secretary must seek input from affected States, tribes, local governments, and the public in developing each strategy. Annual reports on progress towards production goals must be submitted to the House Committee on Natural Resources and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. The Secretary must complete a programmatic environmental impact statement within 12 months of enactment, in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act. Prior to publishing a proposed strategy, it must be submitted to Congress at least 60 days in advance. The Secretary must submit the proposed strategy to the President and Congress, along with comments from States, tribes, and local governments. The first Quadrennial Federal Onshore Energy Production Strategy must be submitted to Congress within 18 months of the Act's enactment. The term \"strategic and critical energy minerals\" in this Act refers to minerals essential for the nation's energy infrastructure and domestic manufacturing, including materials for energy generation, production, and transportation."
