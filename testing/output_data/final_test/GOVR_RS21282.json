Records can be requested online, by mail, or fax. The NPRC does not intend to destroy physical records. Veterans and their next-of-kin (NOK) can request military personnel records from the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis. The NOK is defined differently for each branch of the military. If an individual does not meet the NOK definition, they can request records via the Freedom of Information Act. A fire in 1973 destroyed millions of Army and Air Force files, but NPRC uses alternate sources to fulfill requests. The National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis uses alternate sources to respond to requests for military personnel files. More information can be found on their website or by contacting the center directly. Older military records are located at the National Archives in Washington, DC.
