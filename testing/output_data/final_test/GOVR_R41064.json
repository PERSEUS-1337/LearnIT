    "content": "Prior to the military-imposed exile of President Manuel Zelaya, Honduras enjoyed 27 years of uninterrupted elected civilian democratic rule. The Liberal (PL) and National (PN) parties have been the dominant political parties in Honduras since 1982. Zelaya, a moderate wealthy landowner, was elected president in 2005 and implemented populist policies during his term. President Zelaya implemented populist policies during his term, including a 60% increase in the minimum wage and forging closer relations with Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. However, his administration's inability to achieve concrete results on important issues weakened his public standing, with his approval rating falling to about 30% prior to his ouster. In March 2009, Zelaya issued an executive decree for a popular referendum on potential changes to the Honduran constitution. President Zelaya proposed a non-binding referendum in June 2009 to decide on a National Constituent Assembly and a new constitution. This proposal faced criticism from officials. President Zelaya's proposal for a non-binding referendum in 2009 to decide on a National Constituent Assembly and a new constitution faced immediate criticism from various officials, including the President of Congress Roberto Micheletti, the 2009 presidential nominees of the PL and the PN, the Attorney General's office, and the Honduran judiciary. Despite opposition, Zelaya argued that the law of citizen participation allowed him to consult the people of Honduras in a non-binding poll, emphasizing that the referendum did not propose specific constitutional changes and any changes would occur after he left office. His refusal to accept court rulings led to rumors of an institutional coup. The political situation in Honduras deteriorated as rumors of an institutional coup circulated due to President Zelaya's non-binding referendum proposal. The National Congress passed a law to block the referendum, leading to Zelaya's removal of key military officials who refused to support it. This resulted in further resignations within the Honduran military. The removal of Orellana and Vasquez led to the resignation of 36 other Honduran military commanders, including top army, navy, and air force heads. The Supreme Court ordered the reinstatement of the Defense Minister and Armed Forces Chief, while the National Congress debated censuring Zelaya. Zelaya accused the legislature and courts of colluding with the oligarchy in a technical coup. Honduras was deeply divided on the day of the non-binding referendum, with various political and social groups urging a boycott. On June 28, 2009, the Honduran military arrested President Zelaya and flew him to exile in Costa Rica, just before a non-binding referendum was to take place. The military also confiscated all referendum materials. The Honduran Supreme Court claimed that Zelaya's arrest was due to his noncompliance with judicial rulings declaring the referendum unconstitutional. Zelaya was charged with crimes against the form of government. Zelaya faced charges for calling an unconstitutional referendum without approval, leading to his ouster by the military. The National Congress ratified his removal and named Roberto Micheletti as the new president. Zelaya was removed from office and replaced by Roberto Micheletti as the President of Honduras. The military's actions were deemed unconstitutional, but some argued it was necessary to prevent chaos. Charges against the military for expatriating Zelaya were dismissed, with claims that it was done to preserve democracy and avoid bloodshed. Some Honduran legal observers argue that the Honduran National Congress acted unconstitutionally by removing President Zelaya. They believe only the judicial branch has the power to remove a president, and since Zelaya never resigned and the judicial process was cut short by the military, he was still the president. The Honduran Supreme Court ordered Zelaya's legal proceedings to continue but never directly ruled on Congress's actions. Roberto Micheletti took over as president after Zelaya's removal and claimed legitimacy until President Lobo's inauguration. Roberto Micheletti claimed legitimacy as the president of Honduras through a \"constitutional substitution.\" He implemented budget cuts due to the loss of international support, annulled reforms made under Zelaya's presidency, and received strong support from sectors of Honduran society. The Honduran National Congress named him a \"deputy-for-life\" before adjourning in mid-January 2010. In mid-January 2010, the Honduran National Congress named Micheletti a \"deputy-for-life\" and offered life-long security to him and other officials. Despite this, only 36% of Hondurans approved of Micheletti's job, with 59% believing he did not act in their best interests. During his government, strict measures were implemented, including a curfew and shutting down media outlets. Members of Zelaya's Administration and other leaders were detained or forced into hiding. The Micheletti government in Honduras detained social leaders, press members, and implemented curfews and restrictions on civil liberties. A state of siege was declared after Zelaya's return, suspending press freedom and allowing detention without a warrant. Criticism led to the decree being revoked three weeks later. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) monitored human rights violations in Honduras during the Micheletti government, citing serious abuses including arbitrary arrests, suppression of public demonstrations, and violations of freedom of expression and political rights. Despite the decree being revoked, repressive actions continued. The international community condemned the ouster of Honduran President Zelaya in 2009, calling for his immediate return. The Organization of American States suspended Honduras for the unconstitutional interruption of the democratic order. Diplomatic isolation followed as countries withdrew their ambassadors. The international community condemned the ouster of Honduran President Zelaya in 2009, leading to diplomatic isolation and economic pressure on Honduras. Sanctions included commercial blockades, withheld loans, budget support suspension, aid termination, and oil supply cutoff. Efforts shifted to negotiating a solution, with talks mediated by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias in July 2009. Micheletti agreed to participate in talks mediated by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, who proposed a 12-point plan known as the \"San Jos\u00e9 Accord\" for resolving the Honduran crisis in 2009. The plan included provisions for President Zelaya's reinstatement, a national unity government, amnesty for political crimes, no pursuit of constitutional reform, and a verification commission for compliance. Zelaya initially rejected the negotiation process but later indicated acceptance of the Arias proposal. Following the rejection of Arias' proposal by Micheletti's negotiators, a new agreement called the \"Tegucigalpa/San Jos\u00e9 Accord\" was signed on October 30, 2009. The accord included provisions for a national unity government, a renunciation of constitutional reform attempts, recognition of November elections with international observation, transfer of armed forces supervision to the Supreme Electoral Tribunal before the election, and a congressional vote on the agreement. The \"Tegucigalpa/San Jos\u00e9 Accord\" signed on October 30, 2009, included provisions for a national unity government, a renunciation of constitutional reform attempts, recognition of November elections with international observation, transfer of armed forces supervision to the Supreme Electoral Tribunal before the election, and a congressional vote on Zelaya's restitution to the presidency. The agreement also set a timeline for implementation, but little changed in Honduras following its signing. Despite the \"Tegucigalpa/San Jos\u00e9 Accord\" signed on October 30, 2009, which aimed to end the political crisis in Honduras, little changed in the country. A verification committee was created, but a national unity government was never formed. The National Congress did not consider Zelaya's reinstatement until December 2, 2009, reaffirming his ouster. Zelaya and his supporters boycotted the November 2009 elections, leading to a general election on November 29, 2009, to fill various government positions. In the November 2009 elections in Honduras, former President Porfirio Lobo of the National Party won the presidency with 56.6% of the vote, defeating Liberal Party candidate Elvin Santos. The National Party also secured 71 out of 128 seats in Congress, while the Liberal Party only won 45 seats. The elections were seen as a rejection of the Liberal Party due to the political crisis in the country. Many Hondurans believed the elections would help end the crisis, although there was debate over their legitimacy. The legitimacy of the November 2009 elections in Honduras was questioned by some due to the suppression of opposition media and demonstrators by the Micheletti government. This led to election boycotts and candidates withdrawing from the elections. Organizations like the OAS, EU, and the Carter Center canceled their electoral observation. Critics of the 2009 elections in Honduras claim that the low voter turnout of just under 50% signaled a rejection by the people. Supporters argue that Lobo received more votes than Zelaya in 2005 and that the electoral rolls are inflated. Despite recognition from some Hondurans and the international community, there are still those who refuse to acknowledge Lobo as the legitimate President. Lobo has taken steps to ease political polarization by calling for a government of national unity and engaging in dialogue with all sectors of Honduran society. President Lobo of Honduras has formed a government of national unity and established advisory councils with former presidents and various sectors of society. He included his rivals in his administration and granted political amnesty to former President Zelaya and his supporters. These actions have helped reduce polarization in Honduran society. Although President Lobo's actions have reduced polarization in Honduran society, analysts caution that the underlying cause of the crisis remains - the failure of the political elite to address the needs of the majority. The \"National Resistance Front Against the Coup d'\u00e9tat\" continues to advocate for constitutional reform and greater rights for marginalized sectors. Honduras risks political instability if leaders ignore the basic needs of the 70% living in poverty. President Lobo faces challenges in gaining international support. President Lobo faces challenges in gaining international support following the ouster of President Zelaya. Many nations have expressed concerns about democracy in Latin America and have not recognized the Micheletti government. Lobo seeks to end diplomatic and economic sanctions against Honduras by winning support from countries like Brazil. President Lobo faces challenges in gaining international support following the ouster of President Zelaya. Analysts believe that the international community is slowly restoring relations with Honduras, as many countries have responded positively to Lobo's reconciliation efforts. The country's faltering economy, worsened by the political crisis, is another major challenge for Lobo. President Lobo had to cut government spending due to declining revenue, leading to a 4.4% contraction in the Honduran economy in 2009. Analysts suggest he needs to secure aid to address the fiscal deficit and restore cut spending. The international community is slowly restoring relations with Honduras, but it may take years for the country to fully recover from the political crisis. The U.S. embassy urged Hondurans to resolve the impasse democratically, but failed to prevent Zelaya's removal. President Obama expressed concern, condemned the events, and recognized Zelaya as the legitimate president. The United States addressed the situation in various ways following Zelaya's ouster. Following Zelaya's forced removal in Honduras, the United States took several actions to address the situation. This included minimizing cooperation with the Honduran military, suspending non-humanitarian foreign assistance, providing security for Zelaya's family, meeting with Zelaya in Washington, DC, and supporting mediation efforts by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias. The State Department also revoked visas, suspended visa services, and threatened not to recognize the results of the 2009 general election unless the situation changed. In September 2009, the United States terminated $32.7 million in foreign assistance for Honduras, including security, economic, and social development programs. Despite this, Honduras still received $42.5 million in U.S. foreign aid in FY2009 for education, disease prevention, and democracy promotion. The U.S. government would have been legally required to terminate some foreign assistance if it had declared Zelaya's ouster. The United States terminated foreign assistance for Honduras in September 2009 due to Zelaya's ouster. Despite this, it continued to support the country through aid for education, disease prevention, and democracy promotion. The U.S. government did not declare a \"military coup\" but still terminated some assistance. After the ill-fated Tegucigalpa-San Jos\u00e9 Accord, the U.S. announced support for the 2009 elections in Honduras, emphasizing the importance of returning to democratic order. Following the elections, the U.S. commended the Honduran people for peacefully exercising their democratic rights. The United States urged Honduran officials to implement the remaining provisions of the Tegucigalpa-San Jos\u00e9 Accord, including the vote on Zelaya's restitution, the creation of a national unity government, and the formation of a truth commission. Despite disappointment over the Honduran National Congress vote against Zelaya's restitution, U.S. officials have been encouraged by President Lobo's decision to form a unity government and appoint a truth commission. The United States has offered its full support to Lobo and called on other nations to do the same. Congress has shown interest in the situation in Honduras since Zelaya's removal in 2009. Congressional delegations visited Honduras to assess the situation. Some Senators protested against the Obama Administration's policies towards Honduras. Resolutions were introduced in Congress regarding the political crisis. Several resolutions were introduced in the House regarding the political crisis in Honduras. H.Res. 619 condemned Zelaya for his actions and called for a peaceful resolution. H.Res. 620 urged the Micheletti government to end its illegal seizure of power. H.Res. 630 denounced the coup d'etat, called for Zelaya's reinstatement, and urged the suspension of non-humanitarian assistance to Honduras. H.Res. 749 called for free and fair elections in Honduras. The political crisis in Honduras led to changes in US foreign assistance laws. The US Department of State determined that Zelaya's ouster was not a military coup, so assistance was not terminated. Resolutions in the House called for Zelaya's reinstatement and free and fair elections in Honduras. The House report on the appropriations bill notes concerns about a provision's application and directs a review by the Department of State. President Zelaya's announcement of a referendum on a new constitution led to the political crisis in Honduras. President Zelaya issued executive decrees for a non-binding referendum on a new constitution, leading to a political crisis in Honduras. The referendum was suspended by a lower court judge, and President Zelaya ordered military support for it. The Appeals Court upheld the ruling against the referendum. The Honduran Supreme Court upheld the ruling against President Zelaya's proposed non-binding referendum. The Congress passed a law preventing referenda within 180 days of a general election. Zelaya asked for resignations of military officials who refused support for the referendum, but the Supreme Court ruled they should remain. Zelaya and supporters removed referendum materials from an air force base. On June 26, 2009, the OAS supported democratic institutions in Honduras and urged for social peace. The military arrested President Zelaya before a referendum, leading to his replacement by Roberto Micheletti. The US and other countries condemned the action, and Honduras was suspended from the OAS on July 1, 2009. On July 1, 2009, the OAS adopted a resolution to suspend Honduras' membership if President Zelaya was not restored within three days. The UN condemned Zelaya's ouster and called for his return, while the US State Department announced the suspension of foreign assistance programs. The Honduran National Congress also suspended constitutional rights during curfew hours. On July 5, 2009, Zelaya attempted to return to Honduras but was prevented by the Micheletti government. Zelaya then met with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Washington, DC, and agreed to negotiations mediated by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias. Zelaya and Micheletti met separately with President Arias in Costa Rica on July 9, 2009, to discuss a solution to the situation in Honduras. They designated representatives to continue negotiations and on July 18, 2009, Costa Rican President Oscar Arias proposed a seven-point plan to end the political conflict in Honduras. On July 22, 2009, Costa Rican President Oscar Arias offered a 12-point plan, the \"San Jos\u00e9 Accord,\" to resolve the Honduran political crisis. Zelaya accepted the plan, but it was later rejected by Micheletti's negotiation team. On July 24, 2009, exiled President Manuel Zelaya briefly crossed the Nicaraguan border into Honduras for the first time since his forced removal on June 28, 2009. The IACHR confirmed disproportionate use of force by police and military in Honduras. Foreign ministers failed to convince the government to accept the San Jos\u00e9 Accord. The US suspended visa services in Honduras. Zelaya met with Secretary of State Clinton. On September 21, 2009, President Manuel Zelaya returned to Honduras and sought refuge in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa. The United Nations Security Council condemned intimidation by the Honduran military at the embassy on September 25, 2009. The Micheletti government declared a state of siege on September 26, 2009. The government in Honduras declared a state of siege on September 22, 2009, suspending civil liberties such as freedom of the press and movement for 45 days. Diplomats from the OAS were expelled, and Brazil was warned to grant political asylum to Zelaya. Media outlets critical of the government were shut down, and a decree was issued to revoke licenses of any media outlet on October 7, 2009. The government in Honduras revoked licenses of media outlets \"fomenting social anarchy\" and initiated talks between Micheletti and Zelaya under OAS guidance. The state of siege was lifted on October 19, 2009, allowing Radio Globo and Channel 36 to resume broadcasting. U.S. officials Thomas Shannon and Dan Restrepo traveled to Honduras to restart dialogue between Zelaya and Micheletti. An agreement known as the \"Tegucigalpa/San Jos\u00e9 Accord\" was signed on October 30, 2009, to end the political crisis. A commission was created to ensure the implementation of an accord, with members appointed by the OAS, Zelaya, and Micheletti. The Honduran National Congress sought legal opinions on Zelaya's restitution and postponed a session to consider the matter. Micheletti formed a \"national unity and reconciliation government\" which Zelaya and his supporters rejected. The \"National Resistance Front Against the Coup d'\u00e9tat\" announced a boycott of the elections on November 29, 2009, citing unfair campaign conditions. On November 29, 2009, Porfirio Lobo of the National Party was elected president of Honduras, despite Zelaya's refusal to recognize the elections or any reinstatement deal legitimizing his ouster. Micheletti temporarily halted his public duties to focus on the electoral process. On December 2, 2009, the Honduran National Congress voted against restoring Zelaya as president. On December 9, 2009, Micheletti demanded Zelaya renounce his claim to the presidency for safe passage. Charges were filed on January 6, 2010, against six military members for expatriating Zelaya. On January 13, 2010, Micheletti was named a \"deputy-for-life\" with lifelong security approved for him and other officials.
