The \"Transferring Credits for College Completion Act of 2014\" amends the Higher Education Act to include data reporting requirements on transfer completion data for degree- or certificate-seeking undergraduate students. The \"Transferring Credits for College Completion Act of 2014\" sets a limit on the time for completion of a student's program, including undergraduate studies at other institutions. This section will take effect one year after the Act is enacted. SEC. 3. ARTICULATION AGREEMENTS. Transfer of Credit Policies under the Higher Education Act of 1965 are amended for private and public institutions, requiring disclosure of information by July 1, 2017. The Higher Education Act of 1965 requires institutions to disclose articulation agreements, general education core curriculum courses, and acceptable associate degree programs for transfer. The Higher Education Act of 1965 mandates institutions to disclose transferable associate degree programs that will count towards the first 2 years of a related baccalaureate program at public higher education institutions.

After July 1, 2017, institutions must disclose transferable courses in their course schedules for associate degree programs that can be applied towards a bachelor's degree at public higher education institutions. Definitions for terms like 'articulation agreement' and 'common general education core curriculum' are provided. Each public institution of higher education must enter into an articulation agreement by July 1, 2017, with other public institutions in the same state participating in the program. The agreement should include a common general education core curriculum of at least 30 credit hours transferable between institutions. The articulation agreement between public institutions of higher education in the State includes common course numbering for similar courses, acceptance of associate degrees towards related baccalaureate programs, and an exception for Tribal Colleges or Universities. Tribal Colleges or Universities are exempt from participating in required articulation agreements. This subsection does not authorize the Secretary or the National Advisory Committee to impose specific policies on higher education institutions regarding credit transfer. The Higher Education Act of 1965 prohibits the government from imposing specific policies on institutions of higher education regarding credit transfer or enrollment requirements. Tribal Colleges or Universities are exempt from participating in required articulation agreements. The text chunk proposes amendments to the Higher Education Act of 1965, including changes to comprehensive articulation agreements and the insertion of section 485(h)(2) in relevant paragraphs."
