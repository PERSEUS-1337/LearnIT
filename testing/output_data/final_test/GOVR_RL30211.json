    "content": "President Clinton signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000, which includes the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, FY2000. The legislation provides $15.3 billion, including $1.8 billion for the Wye River/Middle East peace accord. This amount is $900 million below the President's amended budget proposal. Additionally, $799 million was added for accounts that Congress had previously reduced. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000, signed by President Clinton, includes $799 million added for accounts previously reduced by Congress. This includes funding for the World Bank's International Development Association and the President's counter-proliferation initiative. Israel's military aid transfer is delayed to offset the new funding, with $550 million being held back. Additionally, $90 million was allocated for bilateral debt relief, bringing the total to $123 million. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 included additional funding for various accounts, such as the World Bank's International Development Association and the President's counter-proliferation initiative. In H.R. 3425, authorization was granted for the U.S. to support the IMF off-market sale of gold, but Congress did not approve additional funding for debt relief. The Administration accepted abortion-related international family planning policy restrictions in exchange for congressional approval of nearly $1 billion in U.N. arrears payments. President Clinton waived the abortion conditions for $15 million of the population aid appropriation and opposed their inclusion in future spending measures. The annual Foreign Operations appropriations bill is crucial for Congress to review and vote on the U.S. foreign assistance budget and influence executive branch foreign policy. The Foreign Operations appropriations bill is crucial for Congress to review and vote on the U.S. foreign assistance budget, containing about 70% of total international affairs spending. It funds various U.S. bilateral development assistance programs, security assistance for Israel and Egypt, and smaller security aid programs. The Foreign Operations appropriations bill funds U.S. bilateral development assistance programs, security aid for Israel and Egypt, smaller security aid programs, contributions to multilateral development banks, payments to international organizations, and appropriations for export promotion agencies. Congressional oversight of foreign aid policy has increased due to the lack of recent authorization bills. Foreign Operations spending measures have expanded beyond spending issues and played a major role in shaping foreign aid and policy initiatives. The United States has modified aid policy and resource allocation priorities through Foreign Operations appropriations since the Cold War. Congress uses legislation to apply restrictions on foreign assistance management, leading to clashes with the executive branch. President Clinton submitted funding proposals for Foreign Operations programs in his FY2000 budget request to Congress. The House and Senate Foreign Operations Subcommittees held hearings with key officials. The Senate and House approved bills, with the Senate requesting a conference on international family planning. Members resolved the final issue of disagreement on September 27 and filed a conference report. President Clinton vetoed H.R. 2606 on October 18 due to low funding levels and missing appropriations for various initiatives. The House approved a revised Foreign Operations measure (H.R. 3196) on November 5, which was acceptable to the White House. Further negotiations led to changes reflected in a third Foreign Operations appropriation measure, H.R. 3422, enacted as part of H.R. 3194. The Foreign Operations Appropriations for FY2000 were resolved through multiple bills, with H.R. 3422 enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000. The United States faced challenges in formulating effective foreign aid programs amidst declining funding levels. Foreign aid spending cuts in FY1996 saw a $1.15 billion reduction, impacting U.S. foreign policy interests. Efforts to reverse the decline led to increased funding in FY1998 and FY1999, reaching $13.8 billion, the highest in five years. In FY1999, Foreign Operations appropriations reached the highest level in five years, totaling 0.87% of the federal budget and 2.6% of the discretionary budget authority. This increase was mainly due to $2.1 billion in supplemental funding for various emergencies, including Central America hurricane relief and Kosovo humanitarian aid. During the 1980s, Foreign Operations appropriations saw three trends in real terms: growth in the early 1980s, stability at around $19.5 billion per year, and a steady decline towards the end of the Cold War. Funding peaked at $31.9 billion in FY1985, followed by a sharp cut in FY1986 due to deficit reduction measures. By FY1997, appropriations had decreased to $13 billion, the lowest since 1975. Appropriations for FY1997 were the lowest since 1975, at $13 billion. FY1999 Foreign Operations spending is 29% below the average appropriation level in the late 1980s, 17% less than FY1992, and 8% less than FY1995. House and Senate Appropriations Committees decide how to allocate funds among their subcommittees following the Section 302(a) allocation process. The Section 302(b) allocation determines the total amount available for foreign policy funds among 13 subcommittees. Foreign Operations typically receives the largest share, around 68-70%. The Appropriations Committees decide how to allocate funds among the subcommittees and programs, based on overall ceilings set in the budget resolution. The FY2000 budget resolution suggested a reduced allocation for the Foreign Operations subcommittees. The Foreign Operations subcommittees received reduced Section 302(b) allocations compared to the President's budget. H.Con.Res. 68 set a $17.7 billion target for the international affairs budget, 15% below the request. The Senate initially allocated $12.5 billion but later increased it to $12.7 billion, 12.8% less than the budget proposal. The House panel allocated $10.36 billion for Foreign Operations, 29% below the President's request. The House panel increased the Foreign Operations budget by over $2.2 billion to reach $12.625 billion, despite limitations on outlays. Congress can only influence new outlays for FY2000, with House and Senate allocations being about 11% less than the request. Funding limits constrained responses to new aid initiatives like the Wye River-Middle East peace package and debt reduction for the world's poorest nations. Secretary of State Albright warned that cuts of this magnitude would gravely imperil immediate actions. The Foreign Operations budget was increased by over $2.2 billion to $12.625 billion, despite funding limitations. Lawmakers called for revisions to budget caps to utilize surplus funds, but some argued against using social security resources. President Clinton requested $14.1 billion for Foreign Operations programs in FY2000, with an additional $1.9 billion for the Wye River/Middle East peace accord. The total proposal was $16 billion, $700 million higher than the base spending level approved for FY1999. Congress also enacted $2 billion in emergency supplementals for various foreign aid accounts in FY1999. The FY2000 Foreign Operations spending request was initially $14.1 billion, with an additional $1.9 billion for the Wye River/Middle East peace accord. The total proposal was $16 billion, $700 million higher than the FY1999 base spending level. President Clinton later amended the request to $14.38 billion, adding funds for poor country debt relief. Including the Wye River funds, the total FY2000 request came to $16.186 billion, with increases in various Foreign Operations accounts. The FY2000 Foreign Operations spending request initially included increases in non-proliferation, counter-terrorism, military training, and military aid grants. Special priorities of the Administration included increases in export promotion programs and debt reduction funds. Peace Corps funding was also set to rise to maintain the plan for an increase. Peace Corps funding would increase by $30 million (12.5%) to support the plan of expanding volunteers from 6,700 to 10,000. U.S. assistance to Russia and former Soviet states would grow by $179 million (21%) due to a new program addressing security implications of the economic crisis. The FY2000 Foreign Operations request proposed increased funding for peacekeeping missions in non-U.N. missions, including a significant boost for the OSCE Kosovo operation. Additionally, funding for the African Development Bank was sought for the first time in several years, while U.S. assistance to Eastern Europe would see a reduction, with most cuts coming in aid to Bosnia. The FY2000 Foreign Operations request included funding for peacekeeping missions and assistance to various countries. The proposal emphasized support for Middle East peace, democratic transition in the former Soviet Union, and implementation of the Dayton Peace Accord. Israel, Jordan, and the Palestinians were among the major recipients, with additional funding for countries like Peru, Haiti, Bangladesh, and Guatemala for food aid programs. The FY2000 Foreign Operations request included funding for peacekeeping missions and assistance to various countries, with a focus on Middle East peace, democratic transition in the former Soviet Union, and implementation of the Dayton Peace Accord. Israel and Egypt would continue to be the largest recipients, while Russia and Ukraine were scheduled for increases mainly due to the Expanded Threat Reduction Assistance Initiative. U.S. assistance to Israel, Jordan, and the Palestinians would rise significantly if Congress agrees to a request of $500 million to back the Wye Memorandum peace accord. The FY2000 Foreign Operations request included funding for various countries, with a focus on peacekeeping missions and democratic transition. The legislation approved $12.693 billion for foreign aid, below the President's request. Democrats opposed the measure due to significant cuts, while some Members objected to the removal of abortion restrictions and funding for the U.N. Population Fund. President Clinton vetoed H.R. 2606 on October 18 due to inadequate funding levels for various priorities, including voluntary peacekeeping activities, weapons safeguarding in Russia, multilateral development banks, HIPC debt relief program, and the Wye River Accord. A compromise package was negotiated to address funding differences, leading to the approval of a revised Foreign Operations measure (H.R. 3196) with additional funding for White House priorities. The revised Foreign Operations measure (H.R. 3196) added $799 million for White House priorities and $1.8 billion for the Wye River agreement. However, it fell short of the Administration's amended request by $900 million, including denial of $247 million for canceling poor country debt to multilateral development banks. Negotiations ensued between Congress and the President to finalize an omnibus spending package for the remaining appropriation bills. Key changes included congressional authorization for the IMF to sell gold off-market to finance the HIPC debt relief initiative (H.R. 3425) and attaching abortion restrictions to international family planning funds demanded by Republican leaders in exchange for paying U.S. arrears. The House passed a consolidated spending bill (H.R. 3194) that included references to H.R. 3422 and H.R. 3425. President Clinton signed it into law on November 29, 1999. The Senate approved the Foreign Operations request for FY2000, which was $1.9 billion less than the President's request. The recommendation was $700 million below the base foreign aid appropriation for FY1999. The House Appropriations bill for emergency relief supplementals in America and Kosovo allocated $12.624 billion in discretionary funds, which was $1.99 billion less than the FY2000 request. This amount was $777 million below the base FY1999 appropriation and $2.8 billion under the total Foreign Operations enacted amounts for the year. The Senate approved a Foreign Operations request for FY2000 that was $1.9 billion less than the President's request. On September 22, House-Senate conferees resolved differences in H.R. 2606, approving a $12.93 billion measure. The bill was $700 million below the base spending level for FY1999 and $1.9 billion less than the President's request. President Clinton and advisors argued it shirked U.S. financial responsibilities and jeopardized American interests. Following the veto of H.R. 2606, negotiations ensued between congressional leaders and White House officials. After negotiations and approval of H.R. 3196, a compromise package was reached adding funds for the Wye River peace accord and various foreign aid programs. This measure represented full funding for the Wye River agreement and addressed underfunded programs from H.R. 2606. Subsequently, H.R. 3422 was introduced with added abortion restrictions for international family planning. The addition in H.R. 3422 of abortion restrictions for international family planning programs was a key point of negotiation for congressional approval of funding to pay off U.S. arrears at the United Nations. The bill, virtually identical to H.R. 3194, was approved by both the House and Senate, with additional funding and abortion restrictions being the main differences from a previously vetoed bill. H.R. 3422 includes $535 million for Balkan reconstruction and $150 million specifically for Kosovo, following closely what the Senate had passed in S. 1234. The bill stipulates that funds for Kosovo cannot be used for large-scale infrastructure projects until the President certifies U.S. commitment does not exceed 15% of total pledges. Additionally, H.R. 3422 provides $715 million for Child Survival and Disease programs. H.R. 3422 increases funding for children and infectious disease activities to $715 million. Aid to Israel and Egypt is also increased beyond the Administration's request, with a $50 million increase to restore previous funding levels. If abortion-related family planning restrictions are waived, $12.5 million will be transferred from population aid programs to child survival and disease activities. H.R. 3422 increases funding for children and infectious disease activities to $715 million. The bill provides $2.88 billion for Israel, $2.035 billion for Egypt, and $225 million for Jordan. It also includes full funding of $1.8 billion through FY2002 for the Middle East peace pledge made by President Clinton. Congress approved $100 million for Jordan in the FY1999 Supplemental Appropriations. The Administration urged Congress to approve remaining Wye accord aid pledges during meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. H.R. 3422 includes an additional $25 million in military aid for Egypt, not linked to the Wye accords. Congress rejected the Administration's proposal for early disbursement of Egypt's military aid in H.R. 2606 due to budget limitations. The $25 million in H.R. 3422 represents the interest Egypt would have earned under the early disbursement plan. Additionally, there is a focus on aid to Russia and nuclear weapons safeguards. The Administration's focus on aid to Russia includes $241 million for nuclear weapons safeguards. H.R. 3422 adds $104 million for the counter-proliferation initiative, bringing the total to $839 million. Aid targets include $180 million for Ukraine, $95 million for Georgia, and $90 million for Armenia. Bilateral economic aid for Russia and other countries in the region may fall below requested levels. Multilateral development bank funding received significant cuts under H.R. 2606, with over $500 million reduced from the requested amount. H.R. 3422 restored $233 million to title IV, including $150 million for the World Bank's International Development Association. Congress disagreed with the World Bank's policy on a loan to China, resulting in a cut from $803 million to $625 million. The new Foreign Operations measure fully funded the African Development Fund and increased resources for the U.S. to subscribe to a new African Development Bank replenishment. Additionally, $16 million was added for the Inter-American Investment Corporation. The revised Foreign Operations bill allocated an additional $13 million for U.S. voluntary contributions to international organizations, mainly for the U.N. Development Program. The $25 million American contribution to the U.N. Population Fund remained unchanged. The Global Environment Facility still faces a resource shortfall, with only one-fourth of the requested $35.8 million allocated. Economic Support Fund assistance, which provides bilateral economic aid for political and security purposes, was significantly cut under H.R. 2606, except for Middle East recipients. H.R. 3422 restores $168.5 million to the ESF account, leaving a $95 million shortfall. Congress approved $495 million for USAID operating expenses. An additional $25 million was provided to cover costs and prevent staff reductions. H.R. 3422 adds $75 million for peacekeeping operations, bringing the total to $153 million. It also restores $10 million to the Peace Corps funding, totaling $245 million for FY2000. The third Foreign Operations bill falls short of the Administration's goal of a 10,000 volunteer Peace Corps. Funding shortfalls remain, particularly in debt relief for the world's poorest nations. The original budget request sought $120 million for debt reduction, but the conference agreement only included $33 million. The conference agreement on H.R. 2606 included only $33 million for debt cancellation for FY2001-2003. The revised H.R. 3422 increases debt relief funding by $90 million for bilateral reduction. HIPC proponents fear a funding shortfall if the U.S. does not contribute to the multilateral portion of the HIPC initiative. Congress authorized U.S. support for an IMF off-market sale of gold in H.R. 3425 to write-down poor country debts. White House accepted restrictions on international family planning policy in H.R. 3422. The White House agreed to accept restrictions on international family planning policy, prohibiting U.S. grants to organizations performing abortions or lobbying for abortion law changes. The President can waive restrictions for up to $15 million in grants, but if done, population aid funding decreases. The restrictions apply only to FY2000 and will expire on September 30, 2000. Critics are concerned about the precedent set by these restrictions. The White House reluctantly agreed to abortion restrictions in exchange for funding approval for U.S. arrears to the United Nations. Another funding reduction in H.R. 2606 is for the Inter-American Foundation, which supports projects in Latin America. The Foundation may be abolished next year due to management irregularities and funding controversies. The third Foreign Operations bill does not include funding for two foreign aid initiatives announced by the Administration. There is a gap of $300-$400 million between the amounts provided in the bill and what the executive branch wants for Balkan reconstruction. The Balkan aid package is expected to come before Congress in 2000 as part of a supplemental for additional DOD costs. H.R. 3422 increases spending by $20 million for counter-narcotics in the region, falling short of proposed $1 billion-$1.5 billion for Colombia and the Andean region over three years. Controversial policy issues regarding the School of the Americas are continued unchanged in the bill, dropping a provision to deny International Military Education and Training Funds for the school. Critics argue that the school has trained human rights violators. The School of the Americas has been criticized for training human rights violators in the past, but the Administration argues that the curriculum has been reformed to promote human rights principles. H.R. 3422 requires the President to certify the curriculum before releasing funds to the school. The Foreign Operations bill includes the Silk Road Strategy Act, which authorizes aid programs for the South Caucasus and Central Asia. Senator Brownback's amendment would have allowed the President to waive the ban on non-humanitarian aid to Azerbaijan. The House approved legislation retaining Section 907 restriction on aid to Azerbaijan. Additional funding for Foreign Operations in FY2000 is offset to stay within discretionary spending caps. The Wye River/Middle East Peace package is designated as an emergency to avoid impacting discretionary caps. H.R. 3422 limits Israel's early military aid disbursement to $1.37 billion out of $1.92 billion total. This reduces outlays and offsets funding for the Wye River accord and other foreign aid. The Foreign Operations appropriation bill includes policy provisions that often lead to disagreements between the President and Congress regarding U.S. foreign policy. These provisions place restrictions on how the President can use the allocated funds, which are opposed by the Administration for limiting his management abilities. The Foreign Operations appropriation bill includes provisions opposed by the Administration for limiting the President's ability to manage foreign policy. Key funding and policy issues include conflicting priorities in development assistance, restrictions on family planning programs, regional aid allocations, debt reduction initiatives for developing countries, and terms for providing fuel oil to North Korea. The debate post-Cold War focuses on the rationale for U.S. development aid. The Clinton Administration supports an active foreign aid policy to bolster U.S. foreign policy initiatives globally. USAID's post-Cold War development aid policy focuses on sustainable development through strategies like promoting economic growth, stabilizing global population, protecting the environment, advancing democracy, and adding a fifth strategy. Since 1994, USAID has implemented strategies to promote market economies and democratic transitions in developing nations, including education for human capacity development. However, funding reductions and congressional restrictions have forced USAID to adjust resource allocation, raising concerns about maintaining the integrative principles. Congress limited development aid for population programs in the late 1990s, impacting family planning initiatives. The State Department's Bureau of Global Affairs prioritizes environment programs and urges USAID to allocate maximum funds. Despite overall development aid cuts in FYs1996-97, Congress maintained funding for child survival, education, and disease programs at FY1995 levels. This resulted in cuts to other sustainable development elements by about 30%. Congress increased development aid appropriations for FY1999 by $20 million, exceeding the President's request. Funding targets for child survival and infectious disease activities were set at $460 million, $85 million more than proposed. As a result, USAID reduced funding for economic growth and environment projects in FY1999. Congressional proponents argue that protecting children and combating infectious diseases are core American values that should not be compromised, as they directly impact U.S. national interests. The USAID Sustainable Development Programs receive funding for various initiatives, including family planning and child survival activities. Additional funds are allocated for HIV/AIDS programs, with a budget amendment seeking more support for a presidential AIDS initiative in sub-Saharan Africa. These efforts are seen as crucial to protecting children and combating infectious diseases, aligning with core American values and national interests. USAID officials argue that child survival efforts extend beyond immunizations and health services, encompassing factors like societal stability, environmental protection, shelter access, and economic policies for future job opportunities. They believe that focusing on these areas can undermine sustainable development programs that benefit children. USAID's sustainable development funding for FY2000 either reduced or maintained current levels for congressional priorities. The FY2000 budget maintained or reduced funding for congressional priorities, with an overall increase in development aid by $59 million. Child survival programs faced a $40 million cut, while environmental funds, global climate change programs, and family planning saw increases. Other development aid priorities like microenterprise, agriculture, and basic education also received higher funding. H.R. 2606, approved by conferees and continued in revised H.R. 3422, reduces USAID development aid by $87 million but increases funds for selected activities. Key allocations include: international population aid at $385 million, HIV/AIDS at $180 million with $35 million for Africa, and maternal health. In the revised H.R. 3422, key allocations include $227 million for HIV/AIDS, $50 million for maternal health, $30 million for tuberculosis, $25 million for polio eradication, $98 million for basic education, $30 million for displaced children and orphans, $305 million for agriculture, and $152 million for microenterprise. Conferees did not set specific levels for some programs. The House measure does not specify an amount for microenterprise funding, but requires that at least 50% of loans be less than $300. The conference committee directs USAID to restore biodiversity funding to about $99 million in FY2000, after a decrease from $100 million in FY1995 to $55 million in FY1998. This reduction in development assistance funding may result in lower levels for other sustainable development activities. The discussion on U.S. development aid priorities includes potential funding cuts in economic growth, private sector programs, environmental activities, and democracy promotion under H.R. 3422. There is ongoing controversy over international family planning restrictions and abortion-related activities of foreign recipients of USAID grants. Congress has debated U.S. international family planning policy for over a decade, often as part of Foreign Operations Appropriations. Congress has faced presidential vetoes twice due to disagreements over U.S. international family planning programs. Funding for these programs saw significant growth in the 1990s but faced restrictions in the late 1990s due to deadlock over abortion-related issues. The appropriation cap for USAID family planning programs was limited to $385 million in FY1997-1999, significantly lower than the funding provided in FY1995. Congress also established a delayed timetable for releasing these funds, including monthly apportionments. The debate over population aid funding included issues such as abortion restrictions and eligibility requirements for foreign organizations. The \"Mexico City\" policy under the Reagan and Bush Administrations restricted funds for NGOs involved in abortion-related activities, leading to some groups becoming ineligible for U.S. financial support. Congress attempted to overturn this prohibition, but faced White House vetoes. President Clinton reversed the Mexico City policy in 1993, allowing the US to fund family planning organizations as long as the money wasn't used for abortion-related work. The House and Senate have conflicting views on the issue, with the House supporting restrictions on aid funds for abortion-related activities, while the Senate prefers leaving these decisions to the Administration. President Clinton vetoed bills containing Mexico City restrictions in 1998. Congress adopted interim arrangements for FY1996-1999, allowing the Foreign Operations measure to move forward. The FY1999 temporary arrangement deleted Mexico City restrictions and limited population aid funding to $385 million. In FY1999, Congress reduced population aid funding to $385 million and delayed the availability of funds. A ban on U.S. contributions to the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) was enacted due to concerns about coercive family planning practices in China. This prohibition was lifted by President Clinton in 1993 but reinstated in FY1999. The Clinton Administration sought $25 million for the UNFPA in FY2000 despite a total prohibition on U.S. contributions due to concerns about coercive family planning practices in China. Reports emerged about Peru establishing national targets for tubal ligations and vasectomies, with allegations of conditioning medical care on sterilizations. USAID maintains a policy of voluntarism for family planning programs and opposes performance-based quota systems. Peru's government has implemented reforms to ensure voluntary informed consent. In FY1999, Congress adopted an amendment to define voluntary family planning programs more precisely and set criteria for USAID projects. The Senate approved an increase in family planning funds to $425 million, with total population aid reaching about $470 million. The UNFPA was earmarked at $25 million. The House measure approved funding at $25 million for family planning assistance, with no \"metering\" of funds. An amendment by Representative Pelosi restored the $25 million request for the U.N. Population Fund, subject to reduction based on UNFPA spending in China. The House adopted conflicting amendments on international family planning policy, including one prohibiting U.S. funds to foreign NGOs involved in abortions or lobbying for abortion law changes. The House approved funding for family planning assistance at $25 million with conflicting amendments on international family planning policy. The amendments include one prohibiting U.S. funds to foreign NGOs involved in abortions or lobbying for abortion law changes. The Greenwood amendment allows U.S. grants to foreign NGOs as long as they do not use U.S. money for abortions or violate abortion laws in foreign nations. The White House threatened to veto any bill including the Smith language, which would bar grants under the Greenwood amendment from receiving U.S. population aid. The Foreign Operations conference committee could not resolve House-Senate differences on family planning. After negotiations, conferees agreed to maintain current law on population aid funding levels and abortion restrictions, deleting both the Smith and Greenwood amendments while adding a $25 million UNFPA earmark with conditions that passed both the House and Senate. The revised Foreign Operations bill (H.R. 3422) includes Mexico City restrictions for the first time, prohibiting foreign organizations that perform or lobby for abortions from receiving USAID population aid grants. The President can waive the restrictions for up to $15 million in grants, but funding decreases from $385 million to $372.5 million if waived. The aid funding declines from $385 million to $372.5 million with Mexico City restrictions in place. The President used his waiver authority, impacting U.S.-funded family planning programs minimally. Critics are concerned about the precedent set for future debates. Regional allocations of U.S. foreign aid have fluctuated, with the Middle East receiving the largest proportion historically. In the 1980s, U.S. aid to regions like the Philippines and Latin America decreased significantly, while aid to Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union grew to represent 14% of American bilateral assistance in FY1997. Africa's proportion of aid remained around 7-8%, disappointing those who argued for higher priority for the world's poorest regions. In FY1999, USAID allocated funds for Central America hurricane reconstruction, economic aid for countries around Kosovo, and assistance to Jordan. Some observers felt that regional aid allocations had shifted too much, especially in Asia and Latin America. There was a push to maintain or increase assistance to Latin America to promote economic development and counter illegal immigration to the United States. Critics argued that not enough aid had been reallocated to Africa to address the region's needs. Some in Congress argued for limits on Foreign Operations funding for the Middle East in FY1998 to ensure resources were not taken from other regions. Representative Callahan led the initiative to cap funding for selected Middle East nations and programs at $5.4 billion. Israel proposed a plan in 1998 to gradually reduce economic aid from the United States over 10-12 years, while increasing military assistance. This would result in a $60 million annual decrease in aid, with a total savings of $600 million by 2009. Congress supported this plan for FY1999. The President's FY2000 Foreign Operations request included a $60 million net reduction of aid to Israel and a $40 economic aid cut for Egypt. Congress expressed regional allocation views and recommended the creation of the Development Fund for Africa Account to increase funding slightly over FY1999 levels. The Development Fund for Africa was established to provide flexibility to USAID program managers and protect aid resources for Africa. The Development Fund for Africa (DFA) was established to provide flexibility to USAID program managers and protect aid resources for Africa. Congress ended the direct DFA appropriation in FY1996, but the Administration proposed a direct DFA appropriation account for FY2000 with a budget of $745 million for African development aid. This budget also includes funds from the Child Survival accounts and the Economic Support Fund, totaling $893 million for Africa. The FY2000 budget includes $893 million for Africa, with significant increases in assistance programs for Asia. The $424 million requested for Asia is nearly $100 million higher than FY1999 allocations, mainly for a new East Asian economic recovery initiative administered by USAID. This initiative aims to support job creation, social safety net programs, transparency, anti-corruption activities, and regional economic recovery. The Administration plans to spend about $53 million for the initiative from development aid and ESF accounts. The Administration is proposing an expansion of East and South Asian regional programs to address global climate change, forest and marine degradation, and promote democratization and governance initiatives in South Asia. Additionally, there is a new $5 million program to counter violence against women and increase women's participation in politics. Latin America programs would see modest increases in U.S. assistance for FY2000, excluding counter-narcotics aid and emergency Central American hurricane relief. The proposed budget for the region is $735 million, roughly 8% higher than previous allocations. The proposed budget for Latin America in FY2000 is $735 million, an 8% increase from previous allocations. Congress addressed hurricane relief and reconstruction in Central America and the Caribbean with a $1 billion appropriation, including a $621 million Central America and Caribbean Recovery Fund. Middle East aid was slightly reduced for FY2000, but a large supplemental package was sought for the Wye Peace Accord. The proposed budget for the Middle East in FY2000 was slightly reduced, with a $230 million cut in assistance for Israel and Egypt. The budget also included a $1.9 billion supplemental proposal to support the Wye Memorandum and the next phase of the Middle East peace process. Administration officials intend to follow a ten-year downsizing plan, but the pace of reductions has not been firmly established. The memorandum proposal includes $900 million for FY1999 and an advance appropriation of $500 million for FY2000 and FY2001. Israel would receive $1.2 billion, while the Palestinians and Jordan would receive $400 million and $300 million, respectively. Congress only approved $100 million for Jordan in FY1999, deferring the rest to future legislation. U.S. assistance to Russia and other former Soviet states would see a significant increase, with a $1.032 billion FY2000 request for the NIS account, including a rise in aid to Russia from $172 million to $295 million. The FY2000 budget includes a $241 million Expanded Threat Reduction Assistance Initiative for Russia and other NIS countries to reduce weapons proliferation risks. This initiative is part of a larger $1 billion proposal for proliferation issues in the NIS, with additional funds from the Departments of Defense and Energy. The conference agreement on H.R. 2606 made changes to the President's regional and country aid proposals, leading to the veto of the bill. The revised Foreign Operations bill, H.R. 3422, includes adjustments that address executive concerns, with increased funding for Kosovo and other Balkan reconstruction assistance, as well as a boost in funding for former Soviet states to $839 million. H.R. 3422 earmarks $241 million for the counter-proliferation Expanded Threat Reduction Initiative, with allocations for Ukraine, Armenia, and Georgia protected. Middle East assistance for Israel, Egypt, and Jordan would be funded at requested levels. The new Foreign Operations measure fully funds the Wye River accord, addressing concerns from the previous bill. Additional $168.5 million in ESF aid added in H.R. 3422 will mitigate reductions in spending in Africa, Latin America, and Asia. The $168.5 million in ESF aid added in H.R. 3422 will reduce the impact of spending cuts in Africa, Latin America, and Asia. The bill does not re-establish a separate Development Fund for Africa. The U.S.-North Korea Agreed Framework involves providing benefits to North Korea in exchange for suspending its nuclear program operations. New light water nuclear reactors will be constructed with South Korea and Japan's financing to replace shut down nuclear facilities capable of producing nuclear weapons grade material. The United States and other nations have been contributing funds to the Korean Energy Development Organization (KEDO) for the purchase of heavy fuel oil to supplement North Korea's power and electricity production. The Administration's policy of engagement with North Korea and the approach outlined in the Agreed Framework have been controversial in congressional debates. In 1998, North Korea's actions, such as missile sales to Iran and suspected construction of a new nuclear site, prompted a sharp reaction from congressional critics. In response to congressional critics, the House voted to prohibit the President's FY1999 $35 million request for KEDO. Congress agreed to provide the $35 million payment of heavy fuel oil with conditions attached. The first $15 million was made available after the President certified progress on nuclear-related agreements with North Korea, cooperation in fuel storage, no diversion of assistance, and efforts to block ballistic missiles. The remaining $20 million was released after a second certification on nuclear and missile issues. Congress limited the President's waiver authority to provide over $35 million to KEDO in FY1999 and required the appointment of a senior North Korea Policy Coordinator. Former Secretary of Defense William Perry was appointed to the position, and a review of U.S.-DPRK policy was delayed until after visits to North Korea and a suspected underground nuclear site. Inspectors found an extensive tunnel complex at the site. The inspectors found an extensive underground tunnel complex in North Korea, but work had ceased and the tunnels were empty. There was no evidence of violation of the Agreed Framework. North Korea demanded payment for a U.S. inspection, which was rejected. The United States announced multiple site visits and a pilot agricultural project to improve potato production and provide food aid to address food shortages and starvation. Some observers believe there is a link between visits to a suspected nuclear site and food aid decisions. Congress considered the Administration's $55 million request for KEDO payments in FY2000, reducing it to $35 million in H.R. 3422. The proposal is the highest since U.S. funding began in FY1995 due to past shortfalls and lower contributions from other nations. The first $15 million would be available before June 1, 2000, with $20 million after June 1, subject to Presidential certifications on North Korea's nuclear program. The bill for FY2000 allows the President to waive certification requirements for national security interests. It also includes debt relief initiatives for poor countries, with an initial request of $120 million for continuing debt reduction programs. In FY2000, new debt reduction programs and activities were introduced, influenced by international campaigns for debt relief targeting poverty reduction. The White House announced more ambitious U.S. debt reduction policies for heavily indebted poor nations, endorsed by major creditor governments. The World Bank/IMF also endorsed G-7 proposals for reforming the HIPC Initiative, resulting in the cancellation of about $14.4 billion of foreign debt over the past decade. The U.S. debt reduction policy canceled about $14.4 billion of foreign debt, with special cases for Egypt, Poland, and Jordan. Congress had to appropriate funds in advance for debt cancellation based on a complex formula. Especially poor countries with large debt overhangs may only require a small appropriation relative to the loan's face value. When introduced in 1996, the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative provided debt relief from international institutions like the World Bank and IMF. 41 countries, mainly in Africa, are eligible for HIPC, with only 29 having unsustainable debt. Eligible countries may see an 80% reduction in bilateral public debt after demonstrating strong economic performance for up to six years. Uganda, Bolivia, and Mozambique are currently the only nations benefiting from full debt reduction. Critics of the HIPC initiative argue that the debt relief terms are not sufficient, advocating for a higher percentage of debt cancellation and faster multilateral debt write-offs. They also believe that the criteria for non-sustainable debt are too strict, excluding many countries in need of relief. Some critics oppose the economic reform requirements and call for unconditional debt reduction. Organizations suggest that savings from debt relief should be used for essential services like health and education. The HIPC initiative faces criticism for insufficient debt relief terms, with calls for higher debt cancellation percentages and faster write-offs. Critics also argue for less strict criteria for non-sustainable debt and oppose economic reform requirements. Suggestions include using savings from debt relief for basic services like health and education. Legislative initiatives in 1999 aimed to improve the quality of life for the very poor through debt reduction policies, with additional costs being a concern. The President's new debt reduction policy, endorsed at the G-7 economic summit, would provide significant funding for debt reduction activities. The HIPC initiative, endorsed at the G-7 economic summit, aims to provide deeper debt relief to poor developing countries. The White House requested an $850 million budget amendment to cover anticipated U.S. costs for the enhanced HIPC initiative, with major components including bilateral debt relief agreements and contributions to the HIPC Trust Fund. The World Bank and IMF will finance their own participation in HIPC, while some multilateral organizations may also contribute. The Trust Fund, with contributions of over $450 million from 19 countries, assists international agencies in reducing debt for eligible HIPC nations. Congress enacted the Tropical Forest Conservation Act of 1998, allowing for $50 million in debt relief for countries protecting tropical forests. The $33 million appropriation for debt reduction, limited to bilateral relief, led to the President vetoing H.R. 2606. The revised Foreign Operations bill includes an additional $90 million for debt relief. The revised Foreign Operations bill adds $90 million for bilateral debt cancellation, but no U.S. contributions can be made to the HIPC Trust Fund. In separate legislation (H.R. 3425), the White House gained approval for an IMF off-market gold sale to finance HIPC participation. Congress approved $1 billion for Central American and Caribbean reconstruction aid in H.R. 1141. In late 1998, aid was provided for regions affected by hurricanes, including $100 million for Jordan as part of a $1.9 billion aid package for Israel, Jordan, and the Palestinians. Additionally, $819 million was allocated for humanitarian aid to Kosovo and surrounding countries. Congressional decisions to offset costs led to potential veto threats from the President. The administration recommended vetoing legislation that would impact callable capital used by multilateral development banks. The legislation would have cut funds for the Export-Import Bank and USAID programs. Foreign Operations offsets were mostly dropped, except for a $25 million rescission for the Global Environment Facility and $5 million in ESF funding. The curr_chunk provides a list of issue briefs on various international policy topics, including drug control, multilateral development banks, U.N. system funding, U.S. international population assistance, Africa foreign assistance issues, former Soviet Union foreign assistance, Israel foreign assistance, North Korea's nuclear weapons program. It also includes links to resources on the Export-Import Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, and International Monetary Fund. Foreign Operations Appropriations: Discretionary Budget Authority for various international organizations including Inter-American Development Bank, International Monetary Fund, Peace Corps, Trade and Development Agency, UNICEF, UNDP, USAID, U.S. Department of State, and World Bank. The FY2000 request includes amendments and account structure differences for development aid. The FY2000 foreign operations appropriations included amendments and account structure changes for development aid. The Administration requested $745 million for Africa, with $1.9 billion in ESF and FMF funds for the Wye River Accord. Congress approved $100 million for FY1999 and an additional $1.825 billion available through FY2002. The Administration amended its budget request for debt reduction, seeking additional funds for FY2000 and FY2001-2003. IMF funding occurs every five years, with no request for FY2000. Congress approved additional funds for Child Survival programs, aid to Russia, victims of embassy bombings, counter-narcotics, counter-terrorism, and Y2K upgrades. The supplemental funds approved by Congress included $1.641 billion for various purposes such as Central America hurricane relief, Kosovo humanitarian assistance, and counter-narcotics efforts. Most of the funds were designated as emergencies and did not count against the Foreign Operations FY1999 allocation limits. Additionally, funds for multilateral development bank arrearage payments and IMF funds were exempt from the FY1999 allocation limits."
