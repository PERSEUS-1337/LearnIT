    "content": "Intelligence officials and Members of Congress are discussing ways to reduce intelligence spending while protecting core capabilities. DNI James R. Clapper Jr. warned that sequestration could lead to a 7% cut, or roughly $4 billion, to the National Intelligence Program budget, resulting in reduced global coverage and intelligence collection. He also highlighted the negative impact of budget cuts in the 1990s, which led to a distorted intelligence workforce with a lack of mid-level professionals. Congress completed action on the FY2013 intelligence authorization legislation (S. 3454). The FY2013 intelligence authorization legislation (S. 3454) was completed by Congress in December 2012. The bill reflected funding above the President's request but below the $53.9 billion appropriated for FY2012. This legislation followed the significant increase in intelligence budgets and reorganization of the intelligence community after the 9/11 attacks. The Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-458) established the Director of National Intelligence to oversee the intelligence community, advise the President, and coordinate intelligence efforts. This was in response to the 9/11 Commission's findings of inadequate coordination within the intelligence community. The 9/11 Commission's report in 2004 led to the establishment of the Director of National Intelligence to improve coordination within the intelligence community. Congress debated the recommendations, focusing on the DNI's authorities and budgeting for technical collection systems. Many of the Commission's recommendations were adopted with a compromise provision to respect department heads' statutory authorities. For more details on intelligence community reform, intelligence collection disciplines, and budgeting, refer to Appendix A. The intelligence community, as defined by 50 U.S.C. 401a(4), includes various agencies such as the CIA, DIA, NSA, NRO, NGA, FBI, Army Intelligence, Navy Intelligence, Air Force Intelligence, Marine Corps Intelligence, and Coast Guard Intelligence. Other offices like the Office of Intelligence and Analysis in the Department of the Treasury and the Office of National Security Intelligence in the Department of Energy are also part of this community. The Office of Intelligence within various government departments, such as the Department of Energy and Department of Homeland Security, play a crucial role in supporting intelligence community activities. The CIA remains a key player in global intelligence analysis, producing studies for national security policymakers and conducting covert actions when directed by the President. The U.S. government conducts covert actions through intelligence agencies like the NSA, NRO, and NGA, which handle signals intelligence, reconnaissance satellites, and geospatial data for military operations. The DIA is responsible for defense attach\u00e9s. The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) is responsible for defense attach\u00e9s and providing analytical products to DOD. The State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) is known for high-quality analysis, focusing strictly on analytical functions. The FBI's key intelligence functions are in counterterrorism and counterintelligence, with a significant increase in importance post-September 2001. The FBI has grown in importance since September 2001, with new analysts hired and reorganization to prioritize intelligence functions over traditional law enforcement. Law enforcement information, including counterterrorism and counterintelligence, is now shared with other intelligence agencies. The military services and DIA provide additional analysis on military and technical issues. The Department of Homeland Security is responsible for integrating law enforcement and intelligence information on terrorist threats. The Office of Intelligence and Analysis in DHS, along with the FBI, focuses on sharing terrorist threat information with state and local law enforcement. The Coast Guard handles maritime security, the Energy Department analyzes nuclear programs, and the Treasury Department collects data on fiscal and monetary policies, including terrorist financing. Annual intelligence authorization bills guided intelligence agencies from FY1979 to FY2005. Annual intelligence authorization acts were first passed in 1978 after the establishment of congressional intelligence committees, providing specific authorizations and guidance to intelligence agencies. The absence of such acts between 2004 and 2010 led to key intelligence issues being addressed in defense legislation, resulting in misplaced priorities and wasteful spending. Congress has recently met its statutory requirement for intelligence authorization. In recent years, Congress has passed three Intelligence Authorization bills, including the Intelligence Authorization for FY2013, signed into law in January 2013. Key issues debated included DNI authorities, GAO audit authority, and measures to combat national security leaks. These bills emphasize the need for specific annual intelligence authorization legislation. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 assigns the DNI the task of eliminating waste and duplication in the intelligence community. Some believe the DNI has focused more on information sharing than on reducing redundancy, leading to the proliferation of intelligence organizations. Redundancy can be beneficial in counterterrorism efforts by ensuring thorough threat analysis and disruption of terror plots. The DNI's focus on information sharing has led to the proliferation of intelligence organizations, but redundancy can be beneficial in counterterrorism efforts by ensuring thorough threat analysis and disruption of terror plots. Competitive analysis helps avoid single points of failure and unchallenged analytic judgments, improving strategic analysis and checking biases. The 113th Congress faces the challenge of maintaining effective intelligence capacity while eliminating redundancy to prevent large-scale attacks like 9/11. Reforms post-9/11 focused on information sharing barriers, leading to the USA Patriot Act and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. The DNI was given authority to ensure maximum intelligence information availability. The 113th Congress aims to maintain effective intelligence capacity and eliminate redundancy to prevent large-scale attacks like 9/11. Reforms post-9/11 focused on information sharing barriers, leading to the USA Patriot Act and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. The DNI was given authority to ensure maximum availability of intelligence information within the intelligence community. Recent intelligence successes and failures suggest significant improvement in information sharing, with examples such as the 2009 Christmas day bombing attempt and the 2012 attack on the diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya. John Brennan noted that sharing between the intelligence community, DOD, and other partners was at an all-time high. The challenge for analysts post-9/11 is dealing with information overload rather than information sharing. Terabytes of foreign intelligence data come in daily, exceeding the Library of Congress's holdings. Analysts struggle to connect disparate data points buried in large volumes of intelligence traffic. Senators noted that analysts had difficulty searching through the vast amount of terrorism-related intelligence available to them before the Christmas day bombing attempt. The challenge for analysts post-9/11 is dealing with information overload rather than information sharing. The fusion of domestic and foreign intelligence, along with new information technologies, has exacerbated the difficulty of separating valuable intelligence from irrelevant data. Congress may need to review the technical and institutional changes made by the intelligence community since 2009. Intelligence is now deeply integrated into military operations, as seen in the Persian Gulf War. The Persian Gulf War highlighted the importance of intelligence from tactical and national systems, including satellites previously focused on Soviet facilities. Despite technical difficulties, improvements have been made with congressional support. Intelligence played a crucial role in Operation Iraqi Freedom and continued to be significant in Iraq and Afghanistan. A 2012 report by the President's Intelligence Advisory Board suggested that the CIA and the intelligence community have become too focused on tactical operations and military support, neglecting traditional roles. Some observers believe the intelligence community has neglected its traditional functions of gathering and analyzing intelligence on strategic topics. CIA Director Brennan has expressed intent to examine mission allocation within the CIA. The DNI establishes community priorities and ensures resources are allocated accordingly. The focus on counterterrorism and operational support may not accurately reflect resource allocation. Intelligence agencies collect vast amounts of information daily to locate fixed installations and moving targets. The U.S. military relies on the intelligence community to locate fixed installations and moving targets efficiently. Despite the wealth of knowledge available, there are still mysteries surrounding unforeseeable developments and foreign leaders' intentions. The emergence of international terrorist threats has challenged intelligence agencies, especially in gathering information on sophisticated terrorist groups that communicate through agents to avoid interception. There is a perceived inadequacy in human intelligence collection, particularly in counterterrorism efforts. The National Clandestine Service was established at CIA in October 2005 to manage humint operations and coordinate efforts by other intelligence agencies. Congressional concerns exist regarding major technical systems like reconnaissance satellites, with budgetary implications. Intelligence agencies and their targets now heavily rely on commercial technologies, including encryption systems. Consensus is lacking on acquisition programs for new satellites, while the ultimate goal of intelligence remains accurate analysis in a timely manner. The performance of the intelligence community's analytical offices in the past decade is debated, with some arguing for high quality analysis and others pointing to failures like the 9/11 attacks and flawed estimates of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. Congressional concerns include weaknesses in analysis, lack of language skills, and a focus on current intelligence over strategic analysis. Funding for analytical offices has increased since 9/11, with provisions in the Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 aimed at addressing analytical shortcomings. The Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 aimed to improve analysis by instituting mechanisms for alternate analyses, ensuring timely and objective intelligence products, and providing support for analysts. However, challenges remain in training analysts, particularly in fields like counterterrorism and counterproliferation. Efforts post-2004 should have developed a mature cadre of analysts, but there may be a decreased sensitivity to intelligence tradecraft and groupthink pitfalls. The quality of intelligence community analysis may be tested by emerging national security challenges, such as Iran's nuclear program. Government-wide budgetary issues and oversight of the Intelligence Reform Act implementation are concerns for the 113th Congress. Congressional interest remains in the evolving relationship between the DNI and the CIA Director, as well as the effectiveness of post-9/11 intelligence elements like the FBI and DHS Intelligence & Analysis. Future satellite procurement programs are also expected to be an important issue. Future satellite procurement programs are expected to remain an important issue, with details mostly classified. Unauthorized disclosures of classified information are a continuing concern, prompting new provisions to prevent and detect such disclosures. The CIA's role in targeted killings may face increased scrutiny as transparency and accountability are balanced with national security needs. The executive branch is urged to be vigilant in investigating and prosecuting those responsible for unauthorized disclosures. The attack in Benghazi on September 11, 2012, raised intelligence issues regarding a terrorist attack and a protest prior to the incident. The intelligence community initially assessed incorrectly that a protest had occurred, but later changed its assessment based on new information. The DNI acknowledged this change more than a week later. The DNI acknowledged the change in assessment regarding the Benghazi attack, stating it was a deliberate terrorist attack. Analysts faced challenges in making judgments based on incomplete information, with the nature of intelligence work requiring adjustments as new information emerges. The performance of the intelligence community's analytical offices was scrutinized following the lack of advance warning for the 9/11 attacks. Analytical offices faced scrutiny after failures in providing advance warning of the 9/11 attacks and inaccurate Iraqi weapons of mass destruction estimates. Congressional oversight on Benghazi aims to assess improvements in intelligence analysis. Britt Snider highlights the challenge of evaluating intelligence analysis but cites successful examples like HPSCI's report on the fall of the Shah in Iran and SSCI's evaluation of prewar assessments on Iraq. The oversight questions regarding Benghazi include the validity of the initial protest judgment, credibility of protest information, timeliness of assessment corrections, and the presence of \"anchoring bias\" in analysts. U.S. counterterrorism efforts heavily rely on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for intelligence collection and targeted strikes in various regions. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are operated remotely to launch weapons at designated targets, providing a significant advantage by avoiding the need for direct combat and diplomatic complications. They are used by military services and intelligence agencies, with concerns raised about expanded use in targeted attacks. The legal and ethical concerns surrounding targeted drone attacks, particularly in countries where the US is not officially at war, have been questioned since the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Force. The effectiveness of such strikes, especially against US citizens like Anwar al-Awlaki, and the potential negative impact on US policy goals and perceptions in countries like Pakistan have been highlighted. Former DNI Blair has expressed concerns about civilian casualties and resentment towards high-tech strikes in these regions. In the wake of the September 2001 attacks, Congress closely oversees the use of UAVs in counterterrorism efforts. FBI Director Mueller introduced reforms to improve intelligence efforts criticized for lack of focus and information sharing. Concerns persist about the effectiveness of these reforms and the FBI's IT acquisition efforts, highlighted after the 2009 Fort Hood shooting. The FBI's lack of information sharing and internal challenges were highlighted after the 2009 Fort Hood shooting. A Senate investigation found that the FBI's transformation to become intelligence-driven was incomplete, leading to cultural barriers that hindered institutional reforms. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established a Directorate for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection within the Department of Homeland Security to identify and assess terrorist threats to the homeland. The Directorate for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection was established to detect and identify terrorism threats. It was later divided into two components, with intelligence functions going to the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A). The Terrorist Threat Integration Center (TTIC) was created in 2003 and later transferred to the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) to assess terrorist threats. NCTC focuses on foreign and domestic intelligence, while I&A acts as a liaison between federal, state, and local partners with a broader mandate. The Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD(I)) was established by the Defense Authorization Act for FY2003, giving significant authorities for directing intelligence agencies within DOD. Reports suggest DOD special forces are involved in human intelligence collection not coordinated with CIA, leading to potential conflicts with the DNI's office. Stephen Cambone resigned in 2006, succeeded by retired Air Force Lieutenant General James Clapper. The Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD(I)) was succeeded by retired Air Force Lieutenant General James Clapper, who also served as DNI. Michael Vickers, nominated in January 2011, has considerable intelligence authority and works closely with the DNI. The relationship between the DNI and USD(I) is influenced by personal dynamics, raising concerns about institutional arrangements and congressional oversight. Some observers are concerned about potential interference between DOD and CIA humint collection efforts. Intelligence officials claim there is no unnecessary duplication and emphasize coordination. DOD's management of intelligence personnel has been questioned, leading to the creation of a Defense Clandestine Service in 2012. The Defense Clandestine Service was created to shift defense intelligence activities towards humint operations against national-level priorities. The Senate Armed Services Committee froze funding for civilian personnel conducting defense human intelligence to support the number as of April 20, 2012, expressing concerns about the growth of DOD's case officer ranks post-9/11. The Defense Clandestine Service was established to focus on humint operations against national-level priorities. Despite the winding down of overseas conflicts, DOD feels its needs are not being met. Statutory provisions require informing Congress of covert actions and intelligence activities. Special provisions allow limited notification of covert actions in extraordinary circumstances. The House Intelligence Committee proposed removing the Gang of Eight provisions and requiring all committee members to be briefed on intelligence activities, including covert actions, unless the committee decides otherwise. The Administration opposed this change, stating it goes against tradition. The Senate version of the FY2010 intelligence authorization bill, P.L. 111-259, addresses notification of covert actions and intelligence activities, requiring the Administration to provide information to all committee members or explain reasons for withholding information. Members have expressed frustration with lack of consultation on intelligence activities, as seen during the Senate confirmation of CIA Director John Brennan. Some Members delayed confirmation due to demands for DOJ opinions on targeted killing program. Concerns about distrust between intelligence community and oversight bodies. Recent focus on unauthorized disclosures of classified information. Senate Intelligence Authorization legislation aims to prevent leaks and define consequences. The bill aims to develop an insider threat program and allow the government to withhold pensions for illegal disclosure of classified data. It revises the definition of \"intelligence agency\" and addresses unauthorized disclosures of classified information. The effectiveness of these actions remains uncertain. The GAO has the authority to audit and investigate the use of public funds, with exceptions for intelligence activities. Some members believe the GAO should have a role in overseeing intelligence efforts, despite resistance from the Bush and Obama administrations. Provisions for an expanded GAO role in intelligence agencies were included in the FY2011 Intelligence Authorization bill, despite opposition. In FY2011, a provision sponsored by Representative Eshoo required the DNI to provide GAO with necessary information for analysis. The DNI issued a directive in May 2011 for GAO access to intelligence agency information. The DNI issued Intelligence Community Directive Number 114 on April 29, 2011, to encourage cooperation between GAO and intelligence agencies. However, the directive restricts information for GAO audits of core national intelligence capabilities. GAO expressed concerns about potential hindrances to their work. Congress may need to assess the impact and interpretation of ICD 114 on GAO access to information. The intelligence community is structured around three major disciplines: signals intelligence (sigint), imagery intelligence (imint), and human intelligence (humint). Sigint collection is handled by NSA at Fort Meade, MD, with a focus on adapting to new encryption systems used by various nations and groups. Changes in NSA's culture and operations have been initiated since the late 1990s to target terrorist groups effectively. The NSA underwent a reorganization to target terrorist groups and adapt to new technologies. Lieutenant General Michael Hayden led the initiative, which included early retirements and outsourcing. The imagery intelligence discipline, collected through satellites, aircraft, and UAVs, is also undergoing significant changes. The U.S. intelligence community's achievement in acquiring accurate intelligence on military targets, including submarines and missiles, was crucial for defense and strategic planning during the Cold War. Today, there are more collection targets, requiring additional satellites for surveillance. The use of commercial satellite imagery by federal agencies raises questions about meeting intelligence requirements. High altitude UAVs like the Global Hawk offer surveillance capabilities similar to satellites. The National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) was established in 1996 to manage imagery processing. The National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) was established in 1996 to manage imagery processing and dissemination. It was later renamed the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) in 2004. NGA's goal is to use imagery and geospatial information to describe physical features on Earth. The CIA is the primary collector of human intelligence (humint), but the Defense Department also plays a role through defense attach\u00e9s and other agents. Inadequate humint has been a systemic issue in intelligence gathering. Humint has been a systemic problem in intelligence gathering, especially in gaining prior knowledge of the 9/11 plots. The changing international environment has shifted the focus from targeting foreign government officials to seeking information from clandestine terrorist groups and narcotics traffickers. Placing U.S. intelligence officials under \"nonofficial cover\" in businesses or private capacities is a possible solution. Placing U.S. intelligence officials under \"nonofficial cover\" in businesses or private capacities presents challenges such as complex administrative mechanisms, conflicts of interest, and potential embarrassment or danger. Guidelines were established in 1995 to address concerns about CIA agents' involvement with narcotics smugglers and human rights violators in Central America. The then-Director of Central Intelligence (DCI), John Deutch, established guidelines in 1995 for recruiting informants with questionable backgrounds. The guidelines were replaced in 2002 due to concerns about a \"risk averse\" atmosphere hindering intelligence gathering efforts. A major challenge for humint collection is the lack of personnel trained in needed languages, as the intelligence community now requires experts in a wider range of obscure languages and dialects. The intelligence community faces a challenge in recruiting personnel proficient in obscure languages and dialects. Various approaches, including civilian contract personnel and military reservists, have been considered. The National Security Education Program offers scholarships for individuals pursuing careers in national security agencies. Masint, a technical discipline involving analytical refinements applied to information from sigint and imint sensors, has gained importance. The intelligence community faces challenges in recruiting personnel proficient in obscure languages and dialects. Masint, undertaken by DIA and other DOD agencies, involves analytical refinements applied to information from sigint and imint sensors. Retaining personnel with expertise in masint systems is difficult due to more lucrative opportunities in private industry. Open source information (osint) from newspapers, periodicals, books, and Internet websites is increasingly important for gathering information on various regions and topics. There are calls for intelligence agencies to be more aggressive in using osint, which may reduce the need for certain collection efforts. The Intelligence Reform Act called for an Open Source Center to coordinate open source intelligence collection and dissemination. The challenge lies in integrating data from different intelligence sources for threat analysis. Technical issues and data transmission pose obstacles in accessing timely information. The Intelligence Reform Act mandated the establishment of an Intelligence Sharing Environment (ISE) to facilitate sharing terrorism-related information. Barriers between foreign intelligence and law enforcement information have hindered collaboration due to different uses of collected data. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 allowed for sharing law enforcement information with intelligence agencies, but challenges remain in integrating information. The Homeland Security Act and subsequent creation of the National Counterterrorism Center aimed to combine intelligence from various sources. Intelligence spending is divided between the National Intelligence Program. The National Intelligence Program (NIP) and the Military Intelligence Program (MIP) divide intelligence spending. The MIP, established in 2005, includes DOD-wide intelligence programs. Most intelligence spending is hidden within the DOD budget and described in classified annexes to legislation. Intelligence spending is authorized in intelligence authorization acts, with a \"catch-all\" provision in defense appropriations acts when authorization legislation is not enacted. Efforts to disclose total intelligence spending amounts were unsuccessful, but in FY1997, DCI George Tenet revealed that $26.6 billion was appropriated for intelligence activities. In March 1998, DCI Tenet announced that the FY1998 intelligence budget was $26.7 billion. Efforts to disclose total intelligence spending amounts were unsuccessful, with subsequent years' figures not released. The Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 did not require making intelligence spending amounts public, but Section 601 of P.L. 110-53 mandated the DNI to disclose the aggregate amount of funds appropriated for the NIP, with the President having the option to waive or postpone disclosure after FY2008. The DNI announced intelligence budget amounts for FY2008 ($47.5 billion), FY2009 ($49.8 billion), and FY2010 ($53.1 billion). Total annual intelligence spending was stated as $75 billion in 2009. MIP appropriations for FY2010 were $27 billion, and for FY2011, it was $24 billion. NIP appropriations were $54.6 billion in FY2011 and $53.9 billion in FY2012. The NIP budget for FY2012 was $53.9 billion, and the requested amount for FY2013 was $52.6 billion. The FY2013 intelligence authorization bill was slightly above the President's request. Jurisdiction over intelligence programs differs between the House and Senate, with the Senate overseeing NIP and the House overseeing both NIP and MIP. Intelligence spending is mainly done by agencies within DOD, involving oversight from armed services committees in both chambers. Committees oversee intelligence agencies' appropriations, mainly included in national defense acts. Funds are allocated to CIA, DIA, NSA, NRO, NGA, State Department, FBI, and DHS. Senate proposed an Appropriations Subcommittee on Intelligence in 2004, but it was not established. House approved a select panel within the appropriations committee in 2007 to oversee intelligence program appropriations. In 2004, intelligence budgeting issues were debated, with a focus on making the new DNI responsible for the National Intelligence Program budget. Some argued that the National Intelligence Program should not be separate from the Defense budget due to the close relationship with military activities. The final version of P.L. 108-458 provides broad budgetary authorities to the DNI, with guidelines to ensure respect for statutory responsibilities. Effective working relationships among the Office of the DNI, DOD, and the White House staff are crucial for implementing the Intelligence Reform Act's budgetary provisions. Congress passed the FY2012 Intelligence Authorization bill and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012, containing provisions affecting intelligence budgeting. The Intelligence Reform Act's budgetary provisions include establishing Treasury Department accounts to receive funds from defense intelligence elements and aligning intelligence budget submissions with Defense Department formats. These provisions aim to enhance the DNI's management of intelligence accounts and strengthen congressional oversight. The Senate and House Intelligence Committees conducted a joint investigation into the September 11 attacks, known as the \"Joint Inquiry.\" The inquiry found that while there were general warnings of a possible terrorist attack in 2001, there was no specific information on the details of the attacks. The findings were published on December 11, 2002. The Joint Inquiry by the Senate and House Intelligence Committees, published on December 11, 2002, revealed a steady stream of intelligence reports warning of possible terrorist attacks in the US from 1998 to 2001. It also highlighted specific terrorists known to US officials before 9/11 and the potential use of civilian airliners as weapons. The inquiry identified systemic issues such as the intelligence community's lack of preparedness for global terrorism, budget inefficiencies, shortage of linguists and human sources, and a failure to share information among agencies. The intelligence committees recommended creating a Cabinet-level Director of National Intelligence (DNI) separate from the CIA director, with greater authority over intelligence agencies in the Defense Department. They also suggested reevaluating the FBI's focus on counterterrorism and possibly creating a new domestic surveillance agency. Provisions for an independent commission on the 2001 terrorist attacks were included in the FY2003 Intelligence Authorization Act. The 9/11 Commission was established in the FY2003 Intelligence Authorization Act to investigate the intelligence agencies' roles before the September 11, 2001 attacks. The commission's report, published in July 2004, recommended creating a National Intelligence Director (NID) to oversee the National Intelligence Program and its contributing agencies. This was in response to perceived shortcomings in the Director of Central Intelligence's (DCI) authorities. The 9/11 Commission recommended creating a National Intelligence Director (NID) to oversee the National Intelligence Program and its contributing agencies. President Bush signed executive orders to reform intelligence, including establishing a National Counterterrorism Center and providing new authorities for the DCI. The commission also suggested a single intelligence committee in each house of Congress and a separate annual appropriations act for intelligence. The Intelligence Reform Act, signed into law in December 2004, established a National Intelligence Director separate from the CIA Director. The legislation focused on the authorities of the Director of National Intelligence in relation to the budgets and operations of major intelligence agencies in the Department of Defense. The Intelligence Reform Act, signed in December 2004, established a National Intelligence Director separate from the CIA Director. Ongoing implementation of the Act will be overseen during the 113th Congress. Concerns have been raised about the need for modifications to the legislation, with suggestions for addressing difficulties through executive orders or memoranda of understanding. In December 2005, media reports of NSA electronic surveillance outside FISA parameters sparked criticism of the Administration. The Bush Administration defended the surveillance, citing constitutional authorities and the Joint Resolution on the Use of Force. In early March 2006, an agreement was reached with the intelligence committees to enhance oversight of NSA surveillance. Legislative initiatives were considered to modify FISA or establish new authorities for electronic surveillance. Differing views on the NSA effort were reflected in the House Intelligence Committee's 2006 report. The Bush Administration advised the Senate Judiciary Committee on FISC decisions in January 2007. The Administration informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that electronic surveillance under the Terrorist Surveillance Program would now require FISC approval. The Senate Intelligence Committee discussed revising FISA in May 2007. A FISC judge ruled in 2007 that surveillance of foreign communications passing through the U.S. required a FISC order. The DNI issued a statement on FISA modernization in August 2007. The DNI issued a statement on FISA modernization in August 2007, advocating for surveillance of foreign communications without court orders. The Protect America Act (PAA) was signed into law on August 5, 2007, allowing surveillance of individuals believed to be outside the United States without requiring court approval. The Protect America Act, signed into law in August 2007, permitted the DNI and the Attorney General to authorize acquisition of foreign intelligence information concerning persons believed to be outside the US for up to one year. This included U.S. persons, with the right to contest directives in court. The DNI and Attorney General had to certify that this acquisition did not constitute electronic surveillance, with oversight by the FISC. The Attorney General was required to report instances of noncompliance with directives to congressional oversight committees semiannually. The Protect America Act, signed into law in August 2007, allowed acquisition of foreign intelligence information concerning persons believed to be outside the US for up to one year. The DNI and Attorney General had to certify that this acquisition did not constitute electronic surveillance, with oversight by the FISC. The Act expired on February 1, 2008, and efforts to extend it further failed in the House. The RESTORE Act was passed in an attempt to clarify the acquisition of communications between non-U.S. persons located outside the United States. The RESTORE Act aimed to regulate the acquisition of communications involving non-U.S. persons outside the United States. It required court orders for targeting non-U.S. persons believed to be outside the U.S. and increased judicial oversight with quarterly audits by the Inspector General of the Justice Department. Some argued it could hinder intelligence agencies and counterterrorism efforts. The Senate Intelligence Committee reported a FISA amendment bill (S. 2248) on October 26, 2007, which allowed the Attorney General and DNI to authorize targeting non-U.S. persons outside the U.S. for foreign intelligence information. FISC approval was required for targeting U.S. persons outside the U.S. for electronic surveillance or acquisition of stored electronic communications. The Senate bill aimed to provide retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies for assisting the government with intelligence activities. The role of the judiciary, specifically the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), in overseeing surveillance involving U.S. persons was a central issue. FISA allowed electronic surveillance with a FISC order for U.S. persons believed to be foreign powers. The Senate bill aimed to provide retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies for assisting the government with intelligence activities. The issue of the role of the judiciary, specifically the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), in overseeing surveillance involving U.S. persons was a central concern. Changes in technologies since FISA was enacted in 1978 made case-by-case judicial review of international communication links involving U.S. persons impractical and risky to national security. The Senate and House approved amendments to H.R. 3773, with the House amendment requiring judicial review by the FISC of procedures for targeting non-U.S. persons located outside the United States. The House amendment to H.R. 3773 required FISC approval for targeting non-U.S. persons outside the U.S. and for emergency acquisitions involving U.S. persons abroad. The Bush Administration opposed the amendment, citing potential delays in intelligence collection. The House version of H.R. 3773 did not grant retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies but allowed them to present evidence in their defense to a court. It also proposed establishing a commission on warrantless electronic surveillance activities conducted between September 11, 2001, and January 17, 2007. After discussions, a new bill, H.R. 6304, was introduced on June 19, 2008, strengthening the role of the FISC in approving procedures for intelligence surveillance. H.R. 6304 was passed by the House and Senate in 2008, becoming P.L. 110-261. Several FISA provisions were extended multiple times until June 1, 2015. The curr_chunk provides information about various reports and acts related to intelligence and national security, including the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 and the Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001.
