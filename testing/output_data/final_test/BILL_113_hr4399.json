The \"Comprehensive Department of Veterans Affairs Performance Management and Accountability Reform Act of 2014\" amends Chapter 7 of title 38, United States Code, by adding a new section regarding the performance appraisal system for senior executives in the Senior Executive Service. The Secretary is responsible for implementing the performance appraisal system in line with the requirements of chapter 43 of title 5, including issuing organizational performance requirements by September 1 of each year. The Secretary must ensure that at least half of a senior executive's annual rating is based on organizational performance requirements. By December 15 each year, the Secretary must certify to Congress that all performance requirements accurately reflect the Department's organizational goals. The performance requirements for senior executives in the Department are crucial for the overall success of meeting organizational goals. The system must evaluate their contributions, ensure accountability, and assess their impact on meeting the needs of veterans and their dependents. The performance review board for senior executives in the Department must address individual and organizational performance, as well as accountability and leadership capabilities. Deficiencies identified by the Inspector General or Comptroller General must be considered in evaluating senior executives. Annual Summary Ratings: The Secretary must provide a detailed explanation of performance deficiencies to any senior executive receiving a rating lower than fully successful under section 4314(a) of title 5. If a mid-year review determines a senior executive is likely to receive a lower rating, they must be informed promptly. During a mid-year review, if a senior executive is expected to receive a rating below fully successful, the Secretary must provide a plan to address performance issues. A senior executive receiving two lower ratings will be removed from the Senior Executive Service. Those with three consecutive highest ratings can seek a different position with more responsibility. The Secretary must submit an annual report to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs. The report to Congress on the senior executive performance appraisal system includes the number of executives receiving ratings, actions taken for lower ratings, and changes in initial ratings by the performance review board. The amendment to Section 7431 of title 38, United States Code, includes performance pay criteria for physicians and dentists based on their most recent performance appraisal.
