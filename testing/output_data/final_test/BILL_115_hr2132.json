    "content": "The \"Traveler Redress Improvement Act of 2017\" implements a redress process and reviews the Transportation Security Administration's intelligence-based screening rules for aviation security. The \"Traveler Redress Improvement Act of 2017\" establishes a redress process through the Department of Homeland Security Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (DHS TRIP) for individuals who have faced enhanced screening at airport security checkpoints multiple times within a 60-day period and believe they have been wrongly identified as a threat to aviation security. The Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration must submit a report on the redress process implementation and review/update the Privacy Impact Assessment for Secure Flight programs within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Secure Flight Privacy Impact Assessment review must be published on a public webpage and submitted to specific committees. The Transportation Security Administration conducts regular rule reviews in coordination with relevant entities. The Transportation Security Administration's intelligence-based screening rules require notification within 48 hours of any changes to specific offices within the Administration. The Transportation Security Administration's intelligence-based screening rules are to be incorporated into the risk analysis conducted during the Federal Air Marshal mission scheduling process. The Transportation Security Administration will report on how intelligence-based screening rules are used in the Federal Air Marshal mission scheduling process to congressional committees. The Comptroller General will also conduct a study on Transportation Security. The Senate will conduct a study on the Transportation Security Administration's intelligence-based screening rules and their effectiveness in identifying and mitigating aviation security threats, including coordination with the Department of Homeland Security. The House of Representatives passed a bill on June 20, 2017, related to changing, updating, implementing, or suspending rules as necessary. Karen L. Haas attested to the bill."
