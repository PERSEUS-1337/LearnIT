The \"Salmon Planning Act\" acknowledges the critical status of certain salmon and steelhead species in the Columbia and Snake River basin, facing extinction due to various factors. These species hold significant economic, ecological, and cultural importance, serving as indicators of the health of Northwest river ecosystems. The Act recognizes the treaties signed by the United States Government with Indian tribes of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. The \"Salmon Planning Act\" acknowledges the critical status of salmon and steelhead populations in the Columbia and Snake River basin. Since the construction of Federal dams on the lower Snake River, salmon and steelhead populations have plummeted, with extinction looming. This could cost taxpayers billions of dollars. The federally funded group of scientists found that partially removing the 4 lower Snake River dams is the best way to protect and recover salmon and steelhead. Communities relying on the dams would be affected, and a Federal court has ruled that the dams violate water quality standards. The Northwest's energy production is tied to hydropower, linking salmon recovery and energy prospects. The Act aims to protect Columbia and Snake River salmon and steelhead while ensuring reliable energy, sustainable salmon recovery, and mitigation of economic impacts from potential dam removal. It also focuses on rapid response planning for salmon and steelhead recovery in the region. The Act focuses on protecting Columbia and Snake River salmon and steelhead, ensuring reliable energy, sustainable salmon recovery, and mitigating economic impacts from potential dam removal. Additionally, it emphasizes rapid response planning for salmon and steelhead recovery in the region. SEC. 3 addresses the peer review of NMFS biological opinion. The Act focuses on protecting Columbia and Snake River salmon and steelhead, ensuring reliable energy, sustainable salmon recovery, and mitigating economic impacts from potential dam removal. SEC. 3 addresses the peer review of NMFS biological opinion, including review of performance and recovery standards, as well as implementation plans. The National Academy of Sciences will conduct a peer review of the NMFS biological opinion and submit a report to relevant authorities within 12 months. The Secretary of Commerce will determine by December 31, 2003, if the salmon recovery measures are sufficient for achieving recovery under the Endangered Species Act. The Secretary of the Interior and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency are required to determine by December 31, 2003, if partially removing the 4 lower Snake River dams is necessary to restore salmon and steelhead populations to meet obligations under the Endangered Species Act, treaty obligations to Indian tribes or other sovereign nations, and clean water requirements. The Environmental Protection Agency will determine if partially removing the 4 lower Snake River dams is necessary to meet Federal Water Pollution Control Act requirements. The GAO will study the partial removal of the lower Snake River dams. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study on the potential effects of partially removing the 4 lower Snake River dams, including economic impacts on local communities, downstream and coastal areas, transportation by water, and alternative transportation options. The study will assess the economic benefits and costs, environmental impacts, means of mitigating harm, and development needs of alternatives for partially removing the 4 lower Snake River dams. It will also examine the effects on irrigation and energy production, including identifying alternative energy sources. The study will assess economic benefits and costs, environmental impacts, means of mitigating harm, and development needs of alternatives for partially removing the 4 lower Snake River dams. It will also examine the effects on energy production, identification of alternative energy sources, and the economic effects of the extinction of salmon and steelhead populations in the Snake River. A report will be submitted to relevant authorities within 18 months of the Act's enactment. SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION AND PLANNING OF SALMON RECOVERY. The Secretary of the Army is authorized to partially remove the 4 lower Snake River dams if necessary for salmon and steelhead population restoration, treaty obligations to Indian tribes, or to meet water pollution control requirements. Preliminary planning work will be undertaken by the Army Secretary. The Secretary of the Army is authorized to remove the 4 lower Snake River dams for salmon and steelhead population restoration, treaty obligations, or water pollution control. $4,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year after September 30, 2001, for this purpose. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions include the \"4 lower Snake River dams\" and the \"NMFS biological opinion\" regarding the Federal Columbia River power system. The term \"populations\" refers to specific salmon and steelhead units in the Columbia and Snake River basin. The NMFS biological opinion pertains to specific salmon and steelhead units in the Columbia and Snake River basin."
