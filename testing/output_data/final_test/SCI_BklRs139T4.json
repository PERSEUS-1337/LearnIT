Experimental results on Flickr30k data demonstrate high-quality image captions. Image captioning traditionally processes image and text separately, with the image features extracted by a CNN model and the text converted into one-dimensional word embedding. The SuperCaptioning method combines language and vision processing in a single CNN model, inspired by the Super Characters method. It employs two-dimensional word embedding from the Super Characters method for image captioning, where image features and word embedding vectors are used in a network like RNN, LSTM, or GRU to predict the next word sequentially. The Super Characters method, originally for text classification, involves printing text characters on a blank image and feeding it into a CNN model for classification. The SuperCaptioning method combines language and vision processing in a single CNN model, using two-dimensional word embedding from the Super Characters method. It sequentially predicts words in image captions, yielding high-quality results on Flickr30k. The method is inspired by the success of the Super Characters method in text classification tasks. The SuperCaptioning method combines language and vision processing in a single CNN model to predict the next word in an image caption sequentially. The input image is resized and the partial caption is drawn into a larger blank image, creating the SuperCaptioning image. This image is then fed into a CNN model to classify the next word in the caption until the end of the sentence or the word count limit is reached. The CNN model is fine-tuned from the ImageNet pre-trained model. The Squared English Word (SEW) method BID7 represents English words in a squared space, with each alphabet occupying a fraction of the word space based on the number of alphabets. Training data is from Flickr30k, with images having 5 captions but only the longest caption with less than 14 words is kept. After filtering, 31,333 images remain. Experimental results determined a font size of 31 and a cut-length of 14 words for accuracy. The SuperCaptioning method involves setting font size to 31, cut-length to 14 words, and resizing image size to 150x224. Training data is labeled for each image, and the model used is SE-net-154 BID2 pre-trained on ImageNet. The method captions objects, colors, and background details in images. The SuperCaptioning method involves setting font size, cut-length, and resizing image size. It captions objects, colors, and background details in images, including detailed activities like people with their arms outstretched in a ballet."
