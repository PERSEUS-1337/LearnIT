    "content": "The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) directed federal agencies to prepare evaluations of contractors' performance on new contracts over $100,000 in 1993. Congress later enacted the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA) of 1994, which required agency evaluation of past performance and established policies for information collection and maintenance. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) mandated evaluations of contractor performance on new contracts over $100,000 in 1993. This requirement was met through regulations on \"contractor performance information\" in the FAR. Evaluations are crucial for good contract administration and provide valuable information for source selection teams. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) mandated evaluations of contractor performance on contracts over $100,000 in 1993. Evaluations are crucial for good contract administration and provide valuable information for source selection teams. Under Subpart 42.15 of the FAR, agencies are required to evaluate contractors' performance on contracts valued over $150,000 annually and at the completion of the work. However, agencies have not exclusively relied on performance evaluations for source selection decisions as anticipated. The FAR was amended in August 2013 to require evaluation factors for contractor performance assessments, including technical quality, cost control, schedule/timeliness, management/business relations, small business subcontracting, and other relevant factors. This change expanded the criteria agencies must consider beyond just small business subcontracting goals. The 2013 FAR amendments standardized rating categories for contractor performance assessments and defined how each rating is to be used. Subpart 42.15 of the FAR also outlines procedures for compiling, posting, and using performance evaluations, with the contracting officer responsible for preparing the evaluation based on experiences. The evaluation of contractor performance is based on experiences of various offices and end users. Contractors have 14 calendar days to submit comments or additional information. Disagreements are reviewed at a higher level, with the contracting agency making the final decision. The evaluation and response from the contractor should be marked \"source selection information\" and submitted to CPARS, which is then automatically transmitted to PPIRS. Access to CPARS and PPIRS databases is limited to authorized government personnel or the contractor being evaluated. Access to FAPIIS includes PPIRS information and contractor-submitted data. The Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) includes contractor-submitted information and data from federal databases. Congress mandated most FAPIIS information to be publicly available, but exempted past performance information due to its protected status. Agencies are required to \"use\" recent past performance evaluations stored in the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), although the specific purpose is not specified. Consideration of agency past performance evaluations in source selection decisions is presumed, but not expressly required by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The contractors are concerned about the accuracy and bias in their past performance evaluations, as these evaluations can impact source selection decisions. Historically, contractors had limited ability to challenge their evaluations outside the agency, mainly through bid protests. This limited relief from erroneous or biased evaluations because the focus of protests was on the contracting officer's decision, not the evaluation of past performance. Disputes over performance evaluations have become potential claims under the Contract Disputes Act (CDA) of 1978, with courts giving substantial deference to contracting officer's determinations. In 2004, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims ruled on Record Steel & Construction, Inc. v. United States, where the contractor sought a corrected evaluation of its performance under the contract. The court found that Record Steel's letter to the contracting officer requesting a reevaluation of its performance rating constituted a \"claim\" under the CDA, despite the government's argument that challenges to performance evaluations were outside the court's jurisdiction. The court and the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA) both found jurisdiction over contractor challenges to performance evaluations, overturning previous decisions that lacked jurisdiction in such cases. The ASBCA's decision relied on the FAR's definition of \"claim\" to determine that a contractor's request for a reevaluation constituted a claim. The ASBCA and federal courts have jurisdiction over contractor challenges to performance evaluations, based on the duty of good faith and fair dealing in contracts. Recent decisions have clarified that relief for such challenges is uncertain. The court in Todd Construction, L.P. v. United States found that it did not have the authority to set aside the Air Force's final performance evaluation or direct its removal from CCASS. Declaratory relief would not change the evaluation, and its statutory authority could only direct the agency's attention to further action, not mandate specific changes. The court found that agencies lack the authority to rescind or revise poor performance evaluations. Past performance is considered in negotiated procurements to determine the best value for the government. This involves evaluating price, technical merit, and other criteria specified in the request for proposals. In the mid-1990s, past performance consideration in source selection decisions became standardized. OFPP issued guidelines in 1993, later mandated by FASA in 1994, to evaluate past performance in negotiated procurements. Regulations were established in 1995-1997, codified in FAR Subpart 15.3 in 1999, governing the use of past performance in evaluations. In 1999, Subpart 15.3 governs the use of past performance in source selection decisions for negotiated procurements. Past performance is considered a better indicator of a contractor's ability to provide quality goods and services at a reasonable cost compared to complex technical and cost proposals previously relied upon. The use of past performance in source selection decisions for negotiated procurements is governed by Subpart 15.3. It is considered a better indicator of a contractor's ability to provide quality goods and services at a reasonable cost. Agencies must consider past performance or other non-cost evaluation factors in procurements valued at or below the simplified acquisition threshold. In source selection for negotiated procurements, agencies must consider past performance or other non-cost factors for procurements below the simplified acquisition threshold. For procurements exceeding the threshold, past performance must be considered unless documented otherwise by the contracting officer. Subpart 15.3 allows agencies broad discretion in evaluating past performance, including subcontracting with small disadvantaged businesses. Agencies have broad discretion in evaluating past performance for procurements, determining factors like \"recent\" and \"relevant\" performances, whose performances are considered, and the role of past performance in relation to other evaluation factors. They must also consider cost/price, product/service quality, and may consider factors like corporate experience, management, key personnel, and small business status. Agencies have discretion in evaluating past performance for procurements, considering factors like \"recent\" and \"relevant\" performances, cost/price, product/service quality, corporate experience, management, key personnel, and small business status. Past performance need not be heavily weighted, and poor scoring can be offset by higher scores on other factors. Information comes from questionnaires, customer surveys, and evaluations prepared under Subpart 42.15 of the FAR. Subpart 15.3 does not mandate agencies to consider evaluations from Subpart 42.15 in source selection decisions, but failure to do so could be deemed unreasonable. GAO has emphasized the importance of not ignoring readily available information in past performance evaluations for source selection. For instance, in a case involving FEMA, GAO found fault with solely relying on contractor-submitted past performance information without considering other relevant data. The contractor's performance evaluation by FEMA was criticized for not considering information from customer questionnaires, which were required to be submitted. Agencies are generally not required to seek out information that would mitigate negative past performance, but they must consider relevant data in source selection decisions. The contracting officers must take into account the currency, relevance, and context of the information when evaluating past performance. When evaluating past performance information for source selection decisions, contractors may challenge the evaluation through bid protests with the Court of Federal Claims or the GAO. Protesters must demonstrate standing and allege defects in the evaluation process to overturn a decision, facing significant hurdles due to the deference given to contracting officers' evaluations. Protesters challenging past performance evaluations must allege that the evaluation was unreasonable, not adequately documented, or not in accordance with the law or solicitation terms. Contracting officers have broad discretion in determining the best value for the government, including selecting contractors with lower past performance ratings over higher-rated ones. Agencies may prioritize other factors besides past performance, such as price, in the source selection decision. Agencies may prioritize factors other than past performance, such as price, in source selection decisions. Past performance can be considered in various ways, including as a component of evaluation factors or as its own factor. FASA allows past performance to be used in determining orders under multiple-award contracts. Contracting officers are encouraged to consider past performance on earlier orders to ensure fair opportunities for all contractors. The FAR requires agencies to consider contractors' \"satisfactory performance record\" and overall responsibility before awarding government contracts. This determination is similar to a source selection decision and affects who supplies goods or performs work for the procuring activity. OFPP Policy Letter 92-5 and FASA further emphasize the importance of contractor responsibility in awarding contracts. OFPP amended Subpart 9.1 of the FAR to require agencies to consider \"relevant past performance information\" in responsibility determinations. Contractors with unsatisfactory past performance should be screened out, and the best value offeror selected based on past performance comparison. This process aims to avoid contractors with poor performance histories. The responsibility determination process aims to screen out contractors with poor past performance, but nonresponsibility determinations should not be used to punish contractors. Poor performance on prior contracts does not automatically lead to a nonresponsibility determination. To avoid a contractor with poor past performance long-term or government-wide, formal exclusion through debarment or suspension is necessary. Past performance has a significant role in the responsibility determination process due to amendments made to Subpart 9.1 of the FAR in 1995. In 2008, Congress mandated that contracting officers consider information from FAPIIS, which includes details of civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings related to federal contracts, when making responsibility determinations. This requirement changed the traditional role of past performance in the responsibility determination process. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires consideration of past performance information from FAPIIS for contractors with federal contracts or grants worth $500,000 or more in the past five years. This information is crucial for assessing criteria like integrity and business ethics. Additionally, contractors with a history of serious deficiencies in performance are presumed nonresponsible unless circumstances warrant otherwise. Contractors with a history of serious deficiencies in performance are presumed nonresponsible unless circumstances warrant otherwise. GAO and the courts have found that serious deficiencies could include delinquent performance, delivery of nonconforming items, failure to adhere to contract specifications, late deliveries, poor management or technical judgment, failure to correct production problems, failure to perform safely, and inadequate supervision of subcontractors. Contractors have limited ability to challenge agency determinations of responsibility. Judicial and other tribunals do not routinely review contracting officers' responsibility determinations as they are considered practical, not legal determinations. The GAO and federal courts do not routinely review contracting officers' responsibility determinations as they are practical, not legal determinations. They only hear protests regarding responsibility determinations when specific criteria are not met or when there is evidence of unreasonable failure to consider relevant information. Judicial and administrative tribunals overturn determinations only in limited cases where the protester can prove the determination was arbitrary, an abuse of discretion, or not in accordance with the law. The GAO and federal courts do not routinely review contracting officers' responsibility determinations. They overturn determinations only when shown to be clearly unreasonable. The focus is on the contractor's ability to meet government needs, not to exclude contractors with past performance issues. Misusing the responsibility determination process could be considered de facto debarment. De facto debarment ensures contractors receive due process in exclusion proceedings by excluding them through other means. Repeated nonresponsibility determinations or intent to exclude can constitute de facto debarment, as seen in cases like Old Dominion Dairy Products, Inc. v. Secretary of Defense and Art-Metal-USA, Inc. v. Solomon. In Inc. v. Solomon, the General Services Administration de facto debarred a contractor for supplying \"inferior products\" without proper notice or hearing. Courts have granted relief in cases of de facto debarment, which may involve unconstitutional deprivation of contractors' liberty interests. Courts have granted relief in cases of de facto debarment, which may involve unconstitutional deprivation of contractors' liberty interests. Agencies have legal authority to debar or suspend contractors for failure to perform under a contract. Debarment and suspension are government-wide and last for a fixed period of time, implemented to protect the government. Exclusions should not be used to punish the contractor, and agencies could violate the Administrative Procedure Act if they exclude a contractor for conduct they were aware of when determining responsibility. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims found in Lion Raisins, Inc. v. United States that the USDA's suspension of a contractor for falsifying raisin certifications violated the APA. This decision has been both criticized and supported, potentially limiting agencies from debarring contractors based on old allegations of wrongdoing, including poor performance on past contracts."
