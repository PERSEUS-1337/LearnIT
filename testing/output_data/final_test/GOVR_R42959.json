    "content": "The estate and gift tax is imposed on bequests at death and on inter-vivos gifts. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 established permanent rules for the estate and gift tax, with a $5.49 million exemption for 2017. The estate tax rate is 40% on the taxable portion of the estate. The exemption applies to both estates and lifetime gifts, with a separate annual exemption per donee for inter-vivos gifts. The estate and gift tax exemption has increased from $13,000 in 2012 to $15,000 in 2018. Transfers to spouses are exempt, and special rules for farms and small businesses are retained. The exemption level doubled in the 2017 tax revision, with the exemption set at $11.2 million for 2018. This report provides an overview of the estate and gift tax structure, recent developments, revenue effects, and distribution of the tax. The estate and gift tax exemption has increased to $15,000 in 2018, with special rules for farms and small businesses. The exemption for 2017 is $5.49 million, doubling to $11.2 million for 2018. The tax is imposed on the decedent's estate at a flat 40% rate, with a credit for the exemption. Annual gifts of $14,000 per recipient are exempt from the lifetime exemption. The estate and gift tax exemption has increased to $15,000 in 2018, with special rules for farms and small businesses. Transfers between spouses are exempt, and estates can deduct charitable contributions, administrative expenses, and state taxes. A spouse can inherit any unused exemption, benefiting from the deceased spouse's remaining exemption amount. Small businesses, including farms, can pay estate tax in installments. Family businesses can pay estate tax in installments with interest payments, benefit from minority discounts, and defer payment for up to 14 years. Small businesses can take advantage of special provisions for farms and closely held businesses. The estate tax provision allows for a reduction in value of up to $1 million for farms and closely held businesses. Heirs must continue to use the assets as a farm or business for 10 years. Conservation easements can further reduce the value of the land, with an exclusion of up to 40% of the restricted value, capped at $500,000. Heirs can use the value of the asset at the date of the decedent's death as their basis for future capital gains. The step-up in basis rule allows heirs to use the value of the asset at the date of the decedent's death for future capital gains, avoiding capital gains tax on appreciation during the decedent's lifetime. This rule does not apply to gifts, where carryover basis is used, resulting in both the donor's and donee's gains being taxed. When it comes to estate tax rules, gifts do not benefit from the step-up in basis like bequests do. The basis for gifts is the original cost to the donor, leading to potential gains being taxed when the donee sells the asset. Gift tax is tax exclusive, while estate tax is tax inclusive. For example, a $1 million gift would cost $1.5 million at a 50% tax rate. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Act of 2001 (EGTRRA; P.L. 107-16) led to a gradual reduction in the estate tax, with a unified exemption for lifetime gifts and estates. The exemption rose from $675,000 in 2001 to $3.5 million in 2009, and the top tax rate fell from 55% to 45%. The gift tax rate equivalent for a 40% estate tax rate is 28.6%. The exemption acts as a credit that eliminates tax due at lower rates. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Act of 2001 (EGTRRA) gradually reduced the estate tax, with a unified exemption for lifetime gifts and estates. The exemption increased from $675,000 in 2001 to $3.5 million in 2009, with a top tax rate of 45%. The gift tax exemption was limited to $1 million. EGTRRA also allowed for a carryover of basis for inherited assets, with a $1.3 million exemption for gains. These provisions were set to expire in 2011, reverting to pre-EGTRRA levels. The carryover basis provision effective in 2010 would be eliminated, and there were debates on the estate tax rules for that year. President Obama proposed a permanent extension of the 2009 rules, while the Senate discussed reinstating the 2009 rules retroactively. Different proposals were made, including a 35% tax rate and a $5 million exemption. The estate tax rules underwent changes over the years, with proposals for different exemptions and rates. In 2010, a temporary extension set a $5 million exemption and a 35% rate. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 established a permanent exemption of $5.25 million and a 40% rate. The 2017 tax revision doubled the exemptions for 2018-2025. The House proposed further changes, including repealing the estate tax and lowering gift tax rates. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 established a permanent exemption of $5.25 million and a 40% rate for the estate tax. The 2017 tax revision doubled the exemptions for 2018-2025, reducing revenues by $83 billion over eight years. The estate tax affects only a small portion of high-income decedents, with 91% paid by the top quintile and 26% by the top 0.1%. The estate tax affects a small portion of high-income decedents, with 91% paid by the top quintile, 60.4% by the top 1%, and 26% by the top 0.1%. Higher temporary exemption levels would increase concentration in upper income categories. Approximately 100 farm estates are projected to be subject to the estate tax, constituting 1.8% of taxable estates. With the higher exemption level enacted in 2017, around 25 farm estates would be taxable. Less than a quarter of taxable farm estates are projected to have inadequate liquidity to pay estate taxes. Agriculture projects that less than 1% of farm operator estates will pay the estate tax, totaling 153 estates. About 94 estates with assets in small businesses are expected to be subject to the tax, constituting 2.5% of total estates. Concerns have been raised about the estate tax discouraging savings and reducing charitable contributions. The estate tax is criticized for reducing charitable contributions and causing complex planning issues. The House and Senate proposed different approaches to reform, with the final bill doubling the exemption level temporarily until 2025. The Obama Administration had previously suggested returning to 2009 rates. The Obama Administration's budgets included proposals to address estate tax abuses, with estimates showing potential revenue gains from FY2016-FY2025. The House's H.R. 1 aimed to increase exemption levels and repeal the estate tax after 2023, with a projected cost of $150 billion from FY2018 to 2027. However, the delayed repeal would likely result in a higher permanent cost due to filing delays. The proposal in the 114th Congress aimed to immediately repeal the estate tax and reduce the gift tax rate. It included a transition rule for assets in a qualified domestic trust and was estimated to cost $269 billion for FY2015-FY2025. The Obama Administration's FY2016 budget proposed restoring higher rates and lower exemptions, estimated to raise $189 billion over 10 years. The grantor can transfer assets tax-free using a Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT), with any remaining assets going to the trust recipient. The value of the gift is reduced by the annuity's value, and if the assets appreciate, the gift can be further reduced. If the grantor dies during the annuity period, the remaining value is included in the estate. Short annuity periods are common to ensure the grantor survives, but long-term GRATs have advantages if interest rates are expected to rise. President Obama's 2016 budget proposal included a provision for long-term Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts (GRATs) with a minimum annuity term of 10 years and a maximum term of the annuitant's life plus 10 years. This proposal aimed to prevent artificial actions to reduce estate value and was estimated to raise $18.4 billion over 10 years. The provision to reduce fair-market value in family partnerships for estate tax avoidance is not included in the current budget proposal. This rule allows for low valuation of assets to reduce estate tax, but a high valuation for stepped-up basis purposes. Requiring the same value for both was projected to raise $3.2 billion over 10 years. Generation-skipping transfers to a trust also exempt associated earnings from estate tax. The Obama Administration's proposal aimed to limit the life of a generation-skipping trust to 90 years, with a projected revenue increase of $0.3 billion over 10 years. Currently, the IRS has liens on estate tax deferrals for closely held businesses, but they are shorter than the deferral period. The proposal would have extended the liens through the deferral period. Payments for medical care or education made directly to the provider for another are exempt from the generation-skipping tax and gift tax when made through trusts. The Obama Administration proposed changes to estate tax laws, including limiting the life of a generation-skipping trust to 90 years and extending liens on estate tax deferrals for closely held businesses. They also aimed to disallow exemptions for payments to trusts, extend authority for addressing federal income tax issues to the executor of an estate, and impose a $50,000 overall limit on gifts made via trusts. These changes were projected to have minimal revenue impact.

They also aimed to disallow exemptions for payments to trusts and extend authority for addressing federal income tax issues to the executor of an estate. Additionally, there was a provision to impose a $50,000 overall limit on gifts made via trusts, projected to raise $3.4 billion over 10 years. Grantor trusts treat an individual as the owner for income tax purposes, but assets are included in the grantor's estate and subjected to gift tax if the grantor is the owner. This provision was not included in the current budget proposal but was projected to raise $3.3 billion over 10 years in prior budgets."
