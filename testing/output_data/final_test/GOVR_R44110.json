    "content": "According to CRS analysis, IS supporters have been involved in 57 homegrown violent jihadist plots between 2014 and March 2016, dominating the landscape. The FBI had over 900 investigations of IS suspects in the US in November 2015. Domestic law enforcement agencies face challenges in dealing with the threat posed by IS supporters, who engage with the terrorist group in various ways. The 57 plots can be categorized into three groups based on the actions taken by the plotters. The Departed, The Returned, and The Inspired are three categories of American foreign fighters involved in IS-related plots. These individuals either plan to leave the US, have returned from fighting with IS, or are inspired by IS propaganda to carry out attacks domestically. The desire to become a foreign fighter was a factor in 33 out of 57 IS-related plots, with most cases involving individuals leaving for Syria or considering such a trip. The allure of the Islamic State has led many would-be violent jihadists to travel to Syria instead of attacking domestically. However, the Islamic State also encourages followers to stay in their home countries and commit terrorist acts. Propaganda has inspired individuals to consider attacking targets in the United States, with some succeeding in carrying out attacks. Four of the 12 homegrown violent jihadist attacks since 9/11 were inspired by the Islamic State, involving DIY terrorists without sustained contact with foreign terrorist organizations. They acquired skills independently or from online sources, drawing inspiration from figures like Anwar al-Awlaki. On January 7, 2016, Edward Archer shot a Philadelphia police officer three times in the arm, mentioning the Islamic State. The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of terrorism. On December 2, 2015, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik killed 14 people in a shooting at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, CA. Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, who carried out the San Bernardino shooting, had planned a terrorist attack with neighbor Enrique Marquez Jr. They intended to target State Route 91 and Riverside Community College using firearms and explosives. The FBI investigation revealed their plot, leading to their eventual shootout with police. The San Bernardino shooting involved Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik planning a terrorist attack with neighbor Enrique Marquez Jr. Farook helped radicalize Marquez with extremist ideology. Other incidents like the University of California stabbing and the Garland, TX attack show a pattern of individuals inspired by Islamic State propaganda. Abdul Malik Abdul Kareem, a U.S. citizen, conspired with others but was not directly involved in the Garland shootout. In March 2016, Kareem was found guilty of attempting to support the Islamic State. Some American IS fighters may return home unnoticed by law enforcement, while others may never come back. Some American IS supporters may die abroad. The threat of American IS supporters includes those who may perish abroad, as well as foreign IS adherents who could try to enter the United States. U.S. law enforcement must identify and preempt terrorists to counter these threats, drawing on resources developed post-9/11. Additional efforts targeting the Islamic State have been implemented beyond established programs. This discussion aims to inform policymakers on federal law enforcement counterterrorism efforts. The United States uses a watchlisting regimen to identify potential terrorists linked to the Islamic State. The National Counterterrorism Center maintains a classified database called TIDE, which helps track and stop known or suspected terrorists planning to travel to IS territory or return to the homeland. This database assists in monitoring the activities of homegrown IS supporters and reducing the threat of terrorism domestically. TIDE is a classified database used by the National Counterterrorism Center to track individuals involved in terrorism activities, excluding purely domestic terrorism. It held identities of around 1.1 million people, including 25,000 U.S. citizens and residents. NCTC collaborates with European partners to monitor foreign fighters in Syria, using TIDE as an analytic tool for identifying and sharing information on terrorists. The National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) uses a Pursuit Group to track and share information about terrorists, focusing on identifying foreign fighters entering Syria with potential connections to the Homeland. Recently, news outlets received documents from an alleged IS member containing personnel files of over 22,000 IS members, which could aid in identifying unknown fighters. The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) is crucial for federal efforts to identify individuals posing terrorism threats to the United States. The Terrorist Screening Center (TSC) maintains the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) with biographic identifiers and biometric information on individuals with ties to terrorism. The TSDB feeds into the Terrorist Watchlist and other screening lists used for identifying potential threats entering the United States. Law enforcement activities focus on screening, interdiction, investigation, and government efforts to prevent terrorist activity. The TSDB is crucial for screening potential threats entering the United States, with data shared among federal agencies for background checks and border security. DHS components like CBP and TSA utilize the TSDB to identify known or suspected individuals with ties to terrorism. The TSA and CBP use the TSDB to identify known or suspected terrorists, including Americans who joined the Islamic State. CBP's intelligence-driven efforts aim to prevent these individuals from entering the United States. CBP and its partners address risk at each stage of the international travel process, including application, ticket purchase, check-in at foreign airports, and arrival in the United States. DHS has expanded liaison with international officials regarding foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq. The State Department and DHS play key roles in visa security, with the State Department Bureau of Consular Affairs responsible for issuing visas and conducting national security reviews. The Visa Security Program, including the \"Kingfisher Expansion\" tool, examines all visa applicants for terrorism connections by comparing data with NCTC holdings. It is an interagency program involving FBI, DHS, and the Terrorist Screening Center to provide a coordinated response to the State Department. ICE operates the Visa Security Program to prevent terrorists and criminals from entering the US through legal visas, with agents stationed at 20 Visa Security Units in embassies and consulates abroad. In 2014, DHS responded to concerns regarding IS foreign fighters from Visa Waiver Program countries by expanding information collected from travelers through ESTA. CBP uses ESTA to review prospective travelers for security risks before they board flights to the US. DHS has enhanced ESTA as a security tool for travelers to the US, but some argue it lacks the thoroughness of a visa application. In 2015, DHS increased security criteria for VWP countries, and Congress passed legislation with new eligibility requirements for the program. As of April 2016, new eligibility requirements for the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) were implemented, including the use of e-Passports for all foreign travelers. The FBI leads investigations on terrorism, focusing on suspects known as \"the departed,\" \"the returned,\" and \"the inspired.\" They collaborate with various U.S. federal agencies, state, local, and foreign governments for assistance. Local police have been involved in surveillance of potential terrorism suspects linked to the Islamic State, with Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTFs) coordinated by the FBI playing a key role. Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTFs) led by the FBI coordinate federal counterterrorism investigations in the United States, involving federal, state, and local participants. With over 100 JTTFs nationwide, these multiagency teams gather leads, evidence, and information related to terrorism cases, analyze it, and help develop cases for prosecution in federal court. They share information with partners to broaden U.S. counterterrorism efforts. The development of state and major urban area fusion centers has increased law enforcement cooperation in sharing threat information for counterterrorism efforts. These centers, controlled by state and local entities and supported by the federal government, play a significant role in information and intelligence sharing among federal, state, and local law enforcement and security professionals. The U.S. government collaborates with law enforcement agencies to share intelligence on counterterrorism efforts, focusing on preventing radicalized individuals from turning into terrorists. FBI, DHS, and NCTC work to understand motivations behind radicalization and joining terrorist groups in Syria. The U.S. government's counter-radicalization approach focuses on engaging with communities affected by terrorism, with a strategy aimed at countering violent extremism (CVE). This includes efforts to prevent radicalization of potential terrorists, particularly violent jihadists. A CVE summit was held in February 2015, and a Countering Violent Extremism Task Force was created in January 2016 to coordinate federal efforts in this area. The Task Force, comprised of representatives from 11 departments and agencies, will coordinate federal efforts at Research and Analysis, Engagements and Technical Assistance, Communications, and Interventions in countering violent extremism (CVE). This includes managing CVE communications, providing technical assistance to practitioners, and developing intervention programs with stakeholders. The Task Force aims to cultivate CVE programming based on sound research findings and enhance coordination among federal agencies and CVE stakeholders. The National Security Council has coordinated an interagency effort with Boston, Los Angeles, and Minneapolis/St. Paul to support the development of violent extremism prevention and intervention pilot frameworks. DHS and NCTC conduct Community Resilience Exercises to build capacity in municipalities to mitigate terrorist threats. The Community Awareness Briefing conveys information on terrorist recruitment threats, including those from violent extremist groups in Syria and Iraq. The Community Awareness Briefing on terrorist recruitment efforts by violent extremist groups in Syria and Iraq was presented in 15 U.S. cities as of June 2015. Community engagement efforts by the office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties in DHS included meetings in Los Angeles in June 2014 covering topics related to Syria and World Refugee Day."
