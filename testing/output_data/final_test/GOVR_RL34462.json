    "content": "During 2007, the House and Senate established new earmark transparency procedures for public disclosure of approved earmarks and their sponsors. The House adopted rules requiring disclosure of earmarks and sponsors, as well as additional information like certification of no financial interest in the earmark. Additionally, the House implemented procedures for transparency on new spending earmarks added to conference reports. The House and Senate established new earmark transparency procedures for public disclosure of approved earmarks and sponsors. The House Rule XXI, clause 9 requires transparency for new spending earmarks added to conference reports. The Senate Rule XLIV, through the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007, provides for public disclosure of earmarks, sponsors, and certifications of no financial interest. The report compares House and Senate rules on earmark procedures and requirements. The House and Senate have established new earmark transparency procedures for public disclosure of approved earmarks and sponsors. When submitting an earmark request, there may be considerations such as whether it should be included in the bill text or committee report. Both House and Senate rules provide definitions for spending earmarks, limited tax benefits, and limited tariff benefits. The House and Senate rules define spending earmarks as provisions primarily requested by a Representative, Delegate, Resident Commissioner, or Senator, providing specific discretionary budget authority for contracts, grants, loans, or other expenditures. Earmarks must be selected through a competitive process. The definition of tariff benefits includes provisions modifying the Harmonized Tariff Schedule to benefit a limited number of entities, typically found in duty suspension bills. These provisions aim to reduce or eliminate tariffs on specific imports, mainly chemicals and raw materials used in manufacturing. Limited tax benefits are defined similarly in the House and Senate rules. The House and Senate have different definitions of limited tax benefits. The Senate defines it as a revenue provision that provides tax benefits to a specific group with non-uniform eligibility criteria. The House is more specific, limiting the benefits to no more than 10 beneficiaries with non-uniform eligibility criteria or providing transitional relief to one beneficiary from a tax code change. Both rules include parliamentary considerations. The House and Senate rules include parliamentary procedures for greater transparency of congressional sponsors of earmarks. This rule prohibits House consideration of legislation, certain amendments, or conference reports unless a list of earmarks and the name of any House Member who requested them is made available. Selected amendments covered under this rule include committee-reported legislation and manager's amendments. Manager's amendments are offered at the outset of consideration for amendment by a member of a committee of initial referral. Major legislation is typically brought up on the House floor by a special rule. The House adopts a special rule by majority vote to consider legislation on the House floor. House Rule XXI, clause 9, does not cover certain forms of amendments, such as those offered during floor consideration or committee amendments in the nature of a substitute. Earmarks and congressional sponsors must be disclosed in specified public documents for committee-reported legislation and conference reports. Legislation and conference reports require a list or statement in the report language. The chair of each committee must have a list or statement printed in the Congressional Record before considering non-reported legislation. Rules allow time for review of committee reports and conference reports before floor consideration, but these requirements can be waived. Members can draft amendments or lobby against reports. Committee-reported legislation may not generally have earmarks. House rules require committee-reported legislation and conference reports to be available to Members for at least three days before consideration on the House floor. Special rules often waive this requirement. Earmark and sponsor disclosure requirements are not self-enforcing; a Member must raise a point of order on the House floor to enforce them. The House rule requires committee-reported legislation and conference reports to be available for at least three days before consideration on the House floor. A point of order can be raised if there is a failure to include a list of earmarks or a statement that there are no earmarks. Each committee is responsible for determining the contents of the list, and the House rule prohibits waiving the public disclosure requirements. The House rule prohibits waiving public disclosure requirements for committee-reported legislation and conference reports. A special procedure allows the House to decide by majority vote whether to consider a special rule that includes a waiver. This rule aims to improve public disclosure of earmarks, including identifying the Senators who requested them. Rule XLIV prohibits a vote on committee-reported legislative measures or non-reported Senate legislative measures without certifications from the chair of the committee or Majority Leader. A similar certification is required for the adoption of a conference report. The certifications must ensure public disclosure of earmarks and the Senators who requested them on a congressional website for at least 48 hours before the vote. The Senate rules require certifications for public disclosure of earmarks and Senate sponsors on the congressional website. If a point of order is sustained against a vote, consideration is suspended until certification is made. Waivers can be requested to bypass these requirements, but appeals of the presiding officer's rulings are restricted. Unlike the House, the Senate lacks a general mechanism to waive its rules. The Senate lacks a general mechanism to waive its rules, but a waiver motion can be made under Senate Rule XLIV with a three-fifths majority vote. Points of order can also be waived if the Majority and Minority Leaders agree due to significant disruptions. The Senate rule restricts appeals of the chair's rulings on points of order, allowing only one appeal with limited debate. Earmarks in reported bill amendments are covered under the rule, with different procedures for floor amendments. The sponsor of an earmark-containing amendment is advised to ensure compliance promptly. The Senate rule advises sponsors of earmark-containing amendments to promptly provide a list of earmarks and the requesting Senator's name in the Congressional Record. Rules in both the House and Senate require similar information to be submitted to the committee of jurisdiction, but with different public disclosure requirements. Enforcement is not through points of order. Members must submit specific written information for earmarks in legislation. Each sponsor must provide their name, details of the earmark recipient or location, beneficiaries of tax benefits, earmark purpose, and a certification of no financial interest. House and Senate rules differ in financial interest certifications, with the House requiring it for Members and spouses, and the Senate for Senators and immediate family. The House committee must make the information \"open to public inspection.\" The House committee is required to make the Member's written statement on earmarks open to public inspection. Senate committees are recommended to provide certifications of no financial interest for earmarks, including classified spending earmarks to the extent possible while protecting national security. The House rule requires public disclosure of earmarks, including unclassified program descriptions, spending amounts, and Senate sponsors. It addresses spending earmarks added in conference reports not specified in the House or Senate-passed versions of bills. Public disclosure is similar to transparency requirements for earmarks in general. The Senate rule allows for the removal of certain spending add-ons, including earmarks, in conference reports. It requires a list of new earmarks and their congressional sponsors to be included in the joint explanatory statement. The House Appropriations Committee has been identifying earmark add-ons in the required list associated with conference reports. Clause 9(b) outlines differences in the procedure for earmarks in conference reports to regular appropriations bills. It specifies that airdropped earmarks only apply to the 12 annual appropriations bills and allows the House to decide, by majority vote, whether to consider conference reports with airdropped earmarks. This decision follows the same procedures as considering a special rule waiving points of order. The House Rule XXI, clause 9 allows for debate and voting on conference reports, even if clause 9(b) is not violated. The Senate rule targets new spending earmarks in conference reports, excluding tax benefits. Any Senator can raise a point of order against specific spending levels in a conference report. The Senate rule allows points of order against specific spending levels in conference reports, excluding tax benefits. Earmarks air-dropped into conference reports are not typically considered new matter. The Senate rule allows points of order against specific spending levels in conference reports, excluding tax benefits. Earmarks added to conference reports are often considered germane modifications. Funding levels for programs within an account, like earmarks, are generally considered germane modifications. A Senator may raise a point of order against provisions in a conference report with specific spending levels not in the House or Senate-passed versions. If sustained, the...

A Senator may raise a point of order against provisions in a conference report with specific spending levels not in the House or Senate-passed versions. If sustained, the offending provision is stricken from the conference report. The Senate decides whether to send the remaining text of the conference report to the House, with no amendments allowed. Waiving this point of order requires a three-fifths vote of all Senators. The Senate rule allows points of order against specific spending levels in conference reports, excluding tax benefits.

All Senators are required to adopt the motion to waive points of order against the pending measure or motion, which are collectively debatable for one hour, controlled by Senate Majority and Minority Leaders. House rule prohibits conditioning earmark inclusion on another Member's vote, unlike the Senate."
