    "content": "The Act titled \"Structured Settlement Protection Act\" imposes an excise tax on individuals acquiring structured settlement payments in factoring transactions. This amendment adds a new chapter to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, specifically addressing structured settlement factoring transactions. The Structured Settlement Protection Act imposes a 40 percent tax on individuals acquiring structured settlement payment rights in factoring transactions, with exceptions for approved transactions through a qualified order. The Structured Settlement Protection Act requires that any transfer of structured settlement payment rights must comply with state and federal laws, court orders, and be in the best interest of the payee and their dependents. The transfer must be authorized by a state statute or administrative authority with jurisdiction over the underlying action. The term 'applicable State statute' in the Structured Settlement Protection Act refers to a statute enacted by the state where the payee is domiciled or, if not available, by the state where either party to the settlement or the funding asset issuer is domiciled or has its principal place of business. The term 'applicable State court' in the Structured Settlement Protection Act refers to a court in the state that enacted the statute, and in certain cases, the court where the payee of the structured settlement is domiciled. A qualified order is considered final for the exception under this subsection. The term 'structured settlement' is defined as an arrangement established through a lawsuit or agreement for periodic payments. The curr_chunk discusses agreements for periodic payments of damages or compensation that are excludable from gross income under specific sections. The payments must meet certain criteria and be made by a party to the suit or agreement. The curr_chunk defines structured settlement payment rights as the rights to receive payments under a structured settlement. It also explains that a structured settlement factoring transaction involves the transfer of these payment rights for consideration. The curr_chunk provides exceptions to the term \"structured settlement payment rights,\" including the creation of a security interest without redirecting payments to an insured depository institution and subsequent transfers acquired in a factoring transaction. The curr_chunk defines terms related to structured settlement factoring transactions, including factoring discount, responsible administrative authority, and the definition of a State. The curr_chunk clarifies that the term 'State' includes any possession of the United States and outlines provisions related to structured settlement factoring transactions, ensuring that certain requirements are met and tax withholding does not apply in such transactions. The curr_chunk amends the table of chapters for subtitle E of the Code by adding a new item. The curr_chunk discusses the effective dates for structured settlement factoring transactions under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amendments apply to transactions entered into after the enactment of the Act, with a transition rule for transactions during a specific period. The curr_chunk specifies that no tax shall be imposed on structured settlement factoring transactions entered into between the 30th day following the enactment of the Act and July 1, 2002, under certain conditions related to the domicile of the payee and approval by a court or administrative authority. The structured settlement factoring transaction must be in the best interest of the payee and disclosed in advance, including payment details and consideration received. The structured settlement factoring transaction expenses are determined according to section 7520 of the Code and are to be paid by the payee or deducted from the transaction proceeds."
