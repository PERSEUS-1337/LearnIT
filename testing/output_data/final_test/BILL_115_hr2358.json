    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Chinese American World War II Veterans Congressional Gold Medal Act\". Chinese Americans have served in every conflict since the Civil War, including World War II where they earned citations for heroism. They faced discrimination in the US, notably through the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 which restricted immigration for over sixty years. Chinese Americans faced discrimination in America for over sixty years, with major court decisions like Lum v. Rice and People v. Hall treating \"yellow\" races equally to African Americans in terms of school facilities. They were also prohibited from testifying against White men. Chinese Americans were harassed, beaten, and murdered due to their ethnicity, with notable incidents like the Chinese Massacre of 1871 in Los Angeles, the Rock Spring Massacre of 1885 in Wyoming, and the Hells Canyon Massacre of 1887 in Oregon. During World War II, Chinese Americans faced discrimination but still made significant contributions to the war effort. Around 20,000 Chinese Americans served in the U.S. Armed Forces, with 25 percent serving in the U.S. Army Air Force/Corps. Many of those who served were not U.S. citizens due to laws denying citizenship to persons of Chinese descent. During World War II, Chinese Americans made significant contributions to the war effort. 25 percent served in the U.S. Army Air Force/Corps, with some sent to the China-Burma-India (CBI) theater with the 14th Air Service Group. The remainder served in all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces in all four theaters of war, including the Flying Tigers who established American air superiority in China. Chinese Americans in the CBI and Pacific theaters played crucial roles in combat, support, translation, coordination, servicing aircraft, training troops, delivering medical care, providing communication support, gathering intelligence, and securing supplies. Chinese Americans served in combat and support roles in European and African theaters, participating in ground and air combat, securing and delivering supplies, flying bomber missions, serving in infantry units and combat ships, and translating Japanese military plans. Chinese-American women served in various military roles during World War II, including pilots, air traffic controllers, and nurses. Captain Francis B. Wai, the only Chinese American to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor in WWII, was posthumously awarded the medal in 2000. Chinese Americans also earned various military honors such as Combat Infantry Badges, Purple Hearts, and unit citations for valor and bravery. Chinese American Veterans of World War II were honored with unit citations for valor and bravery, showcasing uncommon patriotism and honor despite facing discrimination. Chinese American Veterans of World War II, defined as individuals of Chinese ancestry who served honorably in active duty under the command of the United States Armed Forces between December 7, 1941, and December 31, 1946. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Treasury. Congressional Gold Medal is awarded to these veterans. The President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives will arrange for the award of a gold medal to Chinese American Veterans of World War II. The medal will be designed and struck by the Secretary with suitable emblems. After the award, the gold medal will be given to the Smithsonian Institution for display and research purposes. The Smithsonian Institution should display the gold medal awarded to Chinese American Veterans of World War II at other relevant locations. The Secretary may create and sell bronze duplicates of the gold medal to cover production costs. The gold medal struck under this Act will be a national medal for the purposes of title 31, United States Code, and all medals will be considered numismatic items."
