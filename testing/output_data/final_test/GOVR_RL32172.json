    "content": "In 2004, Macedonia faced political upheaval with the death of President Boris Trajkovski and the election of Branko Crvenkovski as his successor. Prime Minister Buckovski replaced the former Prime Minister later in the year. Macedonia also held a referendum to halt the decentralization process, a key component of the 2001 Ohrid peace process. In 2005, the United States recognized Macedonia as the \"Republic of Macedonia\" to support the multi-ethnic government and peace process. Municipal elections were held with some irregularities. Efforts to resolve the name dispute with Greece continue through U.N.-sponsored talks, but no agreement has been reached yet. Macedonia remains a small land-locked country in southeastern Europe. Macedonia, a small land-locked country in southeastern Europe, has a population of about 2 million people with a majority of Slav Macedonians and a significant Albanian minority. Despite avoiding ethnic conflict after gaining independence in 1991, concerns remained about potential spillover conflicts. In 2001, an ethnic insurgency threatened Macedonia's stability. In 2001, Ethnic Albanian guerrillas known as the \"National Liberation Army\" sparked an eight-month armed conflict in Macedonia, claiming to fight for improved rights for the Albanian community. The conflict spread from the border region with Kosovo to areas around the capital, Skopje. An agreement was reached in August 2001, known as the Ohrid Framework Agreement, outlining political reforms to expand the rights of the ethnic Albanian minority as the rebel force disbanded and disarmed under NATO supervision. The Ohrid Framework Agreement was implemented as the rebel force disbanded and disarmed under NATO supervision. Macedonia's multi-ethnic government remains committed to the process, with regional tensions possibly increasing due to deliberations over Kosovo's disputed status. International attention has shifted away from the Balkans since 9/11, with the US supporting multilateral efforts. The United States supports multilateral efforts to stabilize Macedonia and looks to the European Union to play a larger role in the Balkans. The US emphasizes the importance of peace and security in Macedonia for Balkan stability and US interests, actively engaging in efforts to prevent ethnic conflict and manage disputes with Greece. The United States has shown strong support for Macedonia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, deploying military forces in the early 1990s to demonstrate commitment to regional stability. In 2001, U.S. representatives played a crucial role in defusing inter-ethnic conflicts and implementing the Ohrid Framework Agreement for peace. The U.S. and its European allies aim for Macedonia's integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions for a peaceful and united Europe. The United States has supported the peace process in the Balkan region, promoting NATO and EU enlargement policies. The EU and its member states have provided financial assistance and military forces in the region. The Bush Administration has focused on accelerating this process, especially amidst global issues like terrorism and Iraq. In 2005, there was renewed attention on the region as international efforts to address the Kosovo issue began. The United States is committed to managing the issue of Kosovo and working with the European Union for stability in the region. There is ongoing U.S. interest in Macedonia to prevent conflict, support progress, and combat illicit trade. The United States remains committed to promoting stability and peaceful integration in Macedonia and the Balkan region. Despite reduced visible involvement, the US will continue to monitor and facilitate progress in the region. The United States maintains its commitment to stability in Macedonia and the Balkans, seeking support from the Macedonian government for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Macedonia's fate is closely linked to Kosovo, a key strategic concern in the region. The Bush Administration supports a resolution process for Kosovo's status in 2005 without a predetermined outcome. Resolution to Kosovo's final status is crucial for the entire region, with potential impacts on Macedonia. Despite not directly involved, Macedonia could be affected by Kosovo's outcome. Concerns include potential breakaway aspirations by ethnic Albanian communities, leading to a \"greater Albania/greater Kosovo\" or partitioning similar to Kosovo. Compromise proposals may also prompt dissatisfied ethnic Albanians to turn to extremist militant groups. The unresolved status of Kosovo could lead to ethnic Albanians turning to extremist groups in Kosovo, southern Serbia, and Macedonia. The uncertainty surrounding Kosovo's future contributes to an insecure security environment in the region. Macedonia is closely impacted by events in Kosovo due to shared borders, ethnic Albanian ties, and trade routes. Additionally, Macedonia serves as a test case for the European Union's foreign and security policies, showcasing U.S.-European partnership in the Balkans. Macedonia has been a model of constructive U.S.-European partnership in the Balkans, with coordinated diplomatic efforts leading to the 2001 Ohrid agreement. The U.S. and European officials continue to work towards stabilizing Macedonia and integrating it into Euro-Atlantic institutions.

In 2002, the DUI party joined the government, marking a peaceful transfer of power. Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski took office, emphasizing inter-ethnic relations and implementing the Ohrid agreement. Opposition leaders criticized the government, with some suggesting an ethnic partition. President Boris Trajkovski died in a plane crash in 2004.

Former Interior Minister Hari Kostov replaced Crvenkovski as Prime Minister but unexpectedly resigned in November due to frustration with economic reforms and corruption within the ethnic Albanian DUI party. Vlado Buckovski then took over as Prime Minister, leading a multi-ethnic coalition government. The Macedonian economy remains a major concern for post-conflict recovery and the implementation of the Ohrid accord, amidst political instability and inter-ethnic issues. Macedonia's economic outlook includes limited GDP growth, with levels declining during the 2001 conflict but recovering somewhat since then. Rising unemployment, particularly affecting minorities and youth, remains a significant issue. Fighting corruption and increasing foreign investment are top priorities for the government. The country is dependent on trade routes connecting Greece and Serbia, with efforts to develop further east-west routes. In 2004, Macedonian authorities finalized stand-by arrangements with the International Monetary Fund. Authorities in Macedonia have established agreements with the IMF and World Bank for new lending and reform projects. A national census was conducted in 2002 to determine ethnic representation in public sector positions and minority rights. The census results were supported internationally, despite some nationalist opposition disputing them.

The redistricting plans for certain towns were particularly contentious, with supporters arguing for greater ethnic diversity in municipalities. Critics highlighted the lack of transparency in the process. The government's decentralization plan in Macedonia sparked criticism for lack of transparency in negotiations. Macedonian nationalist groups organized protests in Skopje and Struga, leading to violence. Opposition parties and the World Macedonian Congress gathered signatures for a referendum to revoke the plan, which was held on November 7, 2004. The referendum in Macedonia on the government's decentralization plan failed due to low voter turnout, with only 26% of the electorate participating. Despite claims of fraud by opposition groups, the OSCE deemed the referendum to be generally consistent with democratic standards. The U.S. unilateral recognition of Macedonia's constitutional name before the referendum is seen as a contributing factor to the outcome. The 2005 Local Elections in Macedonia saw the governing coalition parties performing well, with the SDSM-led Together for Macedonia winning 36 mayor seats and the DUI winning 15 mayor seats. The electoral process was criticized by the OSCE for failing to meet universal suffrage and ballot secrecy standards, with serious irregularities reported in many municipalities.

The threat from armed ethnic Albanian extremist groups, such as the Albanian National Army (ANA) and remnants of the National Liberation Army (NLA), persists but with little public support, funded by criminal activities and diaspora support. The Albanian National Army, involved in criminal activities, claimed responsibility for terrorist attacks in Macedonia, Kosovo, and southern Serbia. Small arms prevalence in Macedonia remains a concern despite disarmament efforts. In 2004, armed ethnic Albanian militants briefly took control of Kondovo outside Skopje. In 2004, ethnic Albanian militants briefly seized control of Kondovo near Skopje in protest of treatment of Albanians and limited amnesty for former militants. The situation was peacefully resolved through negotiations with ethnic Albanian leaders. In June 2005, there was another incident involving the detention and beating of Macedonian policemen. Agim Krasniqi, the leader of the armed group, reportedly re-established Kondovo as a base. Macedonia has a history of foreign forces on its territory, with a small international military presence compared to Bosnia and Kosovo. During the Yugoslav secession wars in the 1990s, the United Nations and NATO deployed peacekeeping missions in Macedonia to maintain stability and prevent conflict spillover. NATO also stationed troops in Macedonia in support of Operation Allied Force and KFOR during the Kosovo conflict. In response to the 2001 conflict in Macedonia, NATO conducted Operation Essential Harvest to oversee the demilitarization of ethnic Albanian rebels. NATO conducted Operation Essential Harvest in Macedonia in 2001 to oversee the demilitarization of ethnic Albanian rebel forces. This was followed by smaller missions like Operation Amber Fox and Allied Harmony to provide monitoring and security. The European Union planned to take over the military mission from NATO in Macedonia, but unresolved issues delayed the transition. In late 2002 - early 2003, NATO and the EU formalized principles for establishing institutional links, including EU access to NATO assets under \"Berlin Plus.\" The Macedonian government invited the EU to take over the military mission from NATO, which was officially handed over on March 31, 2003.

The EU later established a new EU police mission called Proxima, focused on training local police forces with about 200 civil police officers. The EU's Proxima police mission in Macedonia, approved in 2003, is led by international police officers and civilian staff from EU countries and focuses on public order, organized crime, and border police. The mission was extended until December 2005 and aims to support the development of a professional and multi-ethnic police service in Macedonia.

Macedonia applied for EU membership in 2004 and submitted responses to the accession questionnaire in 2005. EU enlargement commissioner Olli Rehn commented on the country's preparedness for EU candidacy. Macedonia's progress towards EU candidacy is being assessed, with key concerns including judicial reforms and electoral practices. The country's leadership is focused on regional cooperation, economic integration, and closer ties to NATO and the EU. There are concerns about the potential impact of the EU's constitutional crisis on Macedonia's accession timetable. The Presidents of Albania, Croatia, and Macedonia proposed the U.S. - Adriatic Charter to deepen regional cooperation and promote reforms for NATO and EU integration. Former Secretary of State Powell and foreign ministers signed the Charter in 2003 as a guide towards full NATO membership.

Macedonia has a dispute with Greece over the name \"Macedonia\" since its independence in 1991. Greece objects to Macedonia's use of the name, claiming it usurps Greece's heritage. Despite signing a bilateral agreement in 1995, the name issue remains unresolved. Macedonian and Greek representatives have been meeting under U.N. auspices to resolve the name disagreement, with U.S. diplomat Matthew Nimetz facilitating talks. Efforts to reinitiate international negotiations on the dispute were reported in 2004, with a potential window for resolution identified after major events. Ambassador Nimetz expressed confidence in further negotiations. On November 4, 2004, the U.S. State Department officially referred to Macedonia as the Republic of Macedonia, showing support for the country's democratic state and decentralization efforts. This decision caused tension with Greece but was praised after the referendum. Despite the ongoing dispute with Greece, the lack of a negotiated resolution did not significantly impact other aspects of Greek or European policy towards Macedonia since 1995. Greece is a key trading and investment partner with a growing stake in Macedonia's stability. As the EU Presidency in 2003, Greece promoted EU engagement in the Balkans and efforts to improve Balkan security and stability, culminating in the Thessaloniki summit in June 2003. In response to the shift in U.S. policy on Macedonia's recognition, the Greek government emphasized the need for a mutually agreeable solution to the name dispute before approving Macedonia's accession to the EU or NATO. Ambassador Nimetz proposed a compromise, including a name change to \"Republika Makedonija-Skopje,\" which Greek officials accepted as a basis for further negotiations. Macedonian officials also welcomed the proposal. Macedonian officials rejected the proposal for a name change and insisted on maintaining their constitutional name. Both sides agreed to continue bilateral talks, but no breakthrough has been reached. Additionally, Macedonia has supported U.S. efforts in the global war on terror and Iraq, aligning with NATO candidate countries in signing a statement in favor of disarming Saddam Hussein.

Executive Order 13304 blocks assets of designated persons and groups, including the Albanian National Army labeled as a criminal extremist group. The United States may impose sanctions on countries failing to combat transnational trafficking, with the western Balkans being a key region for trafficking women and children. Macedonia was downgraded to a \"Tier 2\" country in the State Department's 2005 report for not meeting anti-trafficking standards.
