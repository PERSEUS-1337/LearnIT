H.R. 3887 proposes amendments to federal criminal law to address involuntary servitude and transportation for illicit sexual purposes, building upon existing legislation in Title 18 of the United States Code. The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2007 (H.R. 3887) introduced new criminal law proposals related to sex trafficking, sex tourism, coerced services, obstruction of justice, importation of prostitutes, false statements, and more. The bill was introduced by Representative Lantos in 2007 and went through several revisions before passing in December 2007. The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2007 introduced new criminal law proposals related to sex trafficking, including aggravated sex trafficking and sex trafficking offenses expanding federal jurisdiction. Proposed statutes condemn various actions related to recruiting, enticing, and harboring individuals for unlawful activities. The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2007 introduced new criminal law proposals related to sex trafficking, including aggravated sex trafficking and offenses expanding federal jurisdiction. The act punishes those who recruit, entice, harbor, transport, provide, or obtain individuals for unlawful activities, with penalties including fines and imprisonment for a minimum of 15 years or life if force, fraud, or coercion is involved, or if the victim is under 14 years old. The proposed criminal law under the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2007 includes penalties for sex trafficking offenses, with fines and imprisonment for a minimum of 15 years or life. The proposal expands federal authority to address recruitment, enticement, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of individuals for unlawful activities, with specific penalties for offenses involving minors. Proposed 18 U.S.C. 2430 expands federal authority to punish sex trafficking in interstate or foreign commerce, resembling 18 U.S.C. 2422. Three federal statutes outlaw inducing prostitution, with differences in jurisdictional elements. Subsection 2422(a) prohibits persuading individuals to engage in criminal sexual activity within U.S. territories or to travel interstate or abroad. Subsection 2422(b) prohibits coercing minors under 18 to engage in such activities. Proposed Section 2430 expands federal authority to punish sex trafficking in interstate or foreign commerce, similar to existing statutes outlawing inducing prostitution and coercing minors under 18 to engage in criminal sexual activity within U.S. territories or during travel interstate or abroad. Proposed Section 2430 expands federal authority to punish sex trafficking in interstate or foreign commerce, covering attempted violations and persuasion, inducement, or enticement to engage in consensual acts of prostitution involving adults. Proposed Section 2430 expands federal authority to punish sex trafficking in interstate or foreign commerce, covering persuasion, inducement, or enticement to engage in unlawful prostitution regardless of age, without mentioning coercion. Subsection 2422(a) requires coercion for travel in interstate or foreign commerce, while subsection 2422(b) includes a jurisdictional element involving the use of mail or interstate facilities. Proposed Section 2430 expands federal authority to punish sex trafficking in interstate or foreign commerce by prohibiting persuasion, inducement, or enticement of adults to engage in commercial sex acts affecting interstate commerce. This extends the current law, which only applies when a child under 18 is involved or when actual interstate or foreign travel occurs. The proposed amendments also include provisions related to seizing passports and immigration documents for trafficking purposes. The proposed amendment to Section 1592 aims to streamline the prohibition on seizing documents for trafficking purposes, focusing on obtaining or maintaining labor or services through coercion or for use in commercial sex acts. The proposed amendment to Section 1592 aims to prohibit seizing documents for trafficking purposes, focusing on obtaining or maintaining labor or services through coercion or for use in commercial sex acts. It also outlaws the abuse of authority or legal process to obtain labor or commercial sex acts, with penalties of fines or imprisonment up to 5 years. The proposed amendment to Section 1592 aims to prohibit obtaining labor or services through coercion or for use in commercial sex acts. It specifies financial harm as a means of coercion and includes penalties of fines or imprisonment up to 5 years. Additionally, a new federal offense, arranging sex tourism, is proposed under 18 U.S.C. 2431, which outlaws arranging travel for individuals to engage in commercial sex acts in foreign commerce. The proposed amendment to Section 1592 aims to prohibit obtaining labor or services through coercion or for use in commercial sex acts. It includes penalties of fines or imprisonment up to 5 years. A new federal offense, arranging sex tourism, is proposed under 18 U.S.C. 2431, which outlaws arranging travel for individuals to engage in commercial sex acts in foreign commerce. This offense would be punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years, or up to 30 years if the commercial sex act involved a child under 18. The proposed amendment to Section 1592 aims to prohibit obtaining labor or services through coercion or for use in commercial sex acts. It includes penalties of fines or imprisonment up to 5 years. Subsection 221(g) would criminalize arranging, inducing, or procuring foreign travel for an American to engage in a commercial sex act, even if the travel itself is not a federal crime. Subsection 221(h) would prompt the Sentencing Commission to consider any potential First Amendment implications. Amendment implications include adjustments to Sentencing Guidelines for new offenses related to sex trafficking and sex tourism. Changes to federal witness tampering and retaliation laws would prohibit the use of force, threats, persuasion, or deception to prevent disclosure of information on federal employment-related visa or labor laws. Offenders could face up to 20 years imprisonment for physical force tampering and up to 10 years for other offenses. Under existing law, obstructing enforcement of the peonage prohibition is a federal crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison. The federal witness tampering statute prohibits using force, threats, or intimidation to prevent a witness from informing law enforcement of a federal crime. The witness retaliation statute prohibits retaliating against a witness for providing information to law enforcement. Unlike the proposed amendment, current laws do not address obstruction or retaliation related to noncriminal alien employment violations. The proposed amendment aims to establish a cause of action for victims of obstruction of justice offenses related to noncriminal alien employment violations. Federal law allows for the confiscation of property involved in federal crimes through criminal or civil forfeiture, with civil forfeiture not requiring a conviction. Civil forfeiture can be triggered by the commission of an underlying offense, leading to the confiscation of property used in the offense. The civil forfeiture of property used in peonage or trafficking offenses under 18 U.S.C. 1581-1595 can occur without a conviction. Confiscated property proceeds are typically deposited into law enforcement funds, with the possibility of petitioning for remission or restoration. The proposal aims to amend laws to require the Attorney General to return seized property to victims of involuntary servitude and trafficking offenses, allowing for the return of confiscated property under other laws to trafficking victims. Additionally, it may introduce a concept of sharing in the enterprise. The proposed amendment to 18 U.S.C. 1593 may introduce a share-in-the enterprise concept, allowing exploited sex workers to share in confiscated proceeds. Victims could potentially recover confiscated property even if they were involved in the offense. However, there may still be an ownership requirement for restitution. The proposed amendments aim to enhance the civil cause of action for victims of involuntary servitude and trafficking, with a 10-year statute of limitations for filing suits. It is suggested that victim restitution could be paid from forfeited assets of oppressors, but the amendments may not fully address this issue. The proposed amendments aim to enhance the civil cause of action for victims of involuntary servitude and trafficking by amending Section 1595 to include other offenses in chapter 77. It addresses the statute of limitations for criminal prosecution and civil cause of action, with a 10-year limit for criminal offenses and a six-year limit for civil actions. If Congress does not provide a statute of limitations, courts will refer to the most analogous state or federal civil statute. Paragraph 214(b)(1) of Section 214 proposes adding a new Section 1404F to the Victims of Crime Act of 1984. The new section would remove coverage limitations based on victim characteristics and expand the definition of \"victim\" to include individuals exploited under certain federal laws. Section 222 proposes establishing extraterritorial jurisdiction over various peonage and trafficking offenses, including offenses such as peonage, enticement into slavery, sale into involuntary servitude, forced labor, human trafficking, and aggravated sex trafficking. This would apply when the offender or victim is American or when the offender is in the United States. Extraterritorial jurisdiction under federal law allows for prosecution of crimes committed overseas in federal court, based on statute or international law principles. This applies when the offender or victim is American, the conduct impacts the US, or the crime implements a treaty obligation. Section 222 of federal law allows for extraterritorial jurisdiction in certain cases, such as when prosecuting crimes that violate international law or treaties. It permits prosecution for overseas violations of specific laws, like aggravated sex trafficking, if the victim or offender is American or if the offender is later brought to the United States. However, the offense must be committed within the special maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the United States or affect its interstate or foreign commerce. Offenses committed in or affecting interstate commerce or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States are not committed overseas. International law principles recognize extraterritorial application when a crime impacts the United States. However, applying Section 1596 may be challenging if the only connection to the US is the offender being brought there. Prosecution under 18 U.S.C. 1589 for forced labor may be difficult if the misconduct occurs entirely in another country with no American victims. Subsection 223(a) raises potential issues. The proposed amendment in Subsection 223(a) aims to streamline Section 278 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, focusing on penalizing individuals who knowingly import or harbor aliens for illegal activities in the United States. Offenses committed overseas with no American victims may pose challenges for prosecution under this section. The proposed amendment in Subsection 223(a) aims to streamline Section 278 of the Immigration and Nationality Act by expanding the responsibilities of the Justice Department's Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section to include sex trafficking offenses involving sexually exploited adults. This would rename the section to the Sexual Exploitation and Obscenity Section. The amendment also includes a special evidentiary rule allowing the testimony of a husband or wife to be admissible against each other in prosecutions under this section. The proposed amendment aims to expand the jurisdiction of the Justice Department's Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section to include offenses such as federal obscenity, child pornography, and international parental kidnapping. This would be in conjunction with the Innocence Lost Initiative started in 2003. The amendment would also outlaw trafficking in commercial sexual activity occurring in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, regardless of age or willingness of the individual trafficked. Congress has the authority to address internal organization matters within the Department of Justice. The proposed amendment would require recruiters to disclose specific details about employment to foreign workers and prohibit false statements in disclosures. Violations could result in imprisonment for up to 20 years under Section 1519 of Title 18, United States Code. The proposed amendment would require recruiters to disclose employment details to foreign workers and prohibit false statements. Violations could lead to imprisonment for up to 20 years under Section 1519 of Title 18, United States Code. The Justice Department drafted a Model State Anti-Trafficking Criminal Statute in 2004, including suggested language for state criminal laws related to trafficking and involuntary servitude. The Attorney General would provide a model reflecting misconduct proscribed in certain statutes, distribute it to states, assist in implementation, and report annually to relevant committees on the results of these efforts."
