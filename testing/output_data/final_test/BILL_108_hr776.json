    "content": "The \"Technological Resource to Assist Criminal Enforcement (TRACE) Act\" aims to increase public safety by assisting law enforcement in solving gun-related crimes through ballistics technology. It requires ballistics testing of all new firearms for sale and those in custody of Federal agencies to aid in identifying firearms used in crimes. Additionally, it adds ballistics testing to existing firearms enforcement programs. The definition of ballistics is a comparative analysis of fired bullets and cartridge casings to identify the firearm used. Additionally, the act includes testing and automated storage of ballistics records. Amendment to Section 923 of title 18, United States Code requires licensed manufacturers or importers to test fire firearms, prepare ballistics images, store records in a database, and keep fired bullet and cartridge casings as specified by the Attorney General. No civil cause of action is created against any licensee or person. The Attorney General assists firearm manufacturers and importers in complying with testing and storing ballistics images and cartridge casings. This includes acquiring equipment, hiring personnel, providing education, and coordinating with law enforcement agencies. No civil liability is imposed on licensees or individuals. The Attorney General collaborates with law enforcement, regulatory agencies, and the firearm industry to reduce firearm-related crime and trafficking. They establish a computer system for accessing ballistics records, mandate training for examiners, and conduct mandatory ballistics testing on firearms. Reports are submitted to the Senate and House Judiciary Committees annually.
