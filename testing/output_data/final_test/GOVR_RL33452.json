    "content": "In early September 2005, a Navy report on the status of Lt. Cdr. Michael Scott Speicher concluded he may have been captured, with no evidence of his death. It recommended maintaining his status as missing. The report also discusses U.S. POWs and MIAs from the Vietnam and Korean Wars, comparing losses to other American conflicts and addressing reports of POWs not being returned. The curr_chunk discusses Americans possibly captured by communist countries during Cold War incidents, POW/MIA matters and controversies related to post-Cold War U.S. military operations, and legislation and congressional oversight concerning the POW/MIA issue. It also mentions ongoing military operations such as Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. American former POWs held by the Japanese during World War II can seek compensation from Japanese corporations. Key terms related to the POW/MIA issue include POW (Prisoner Of War), MIA (Missing In Action), KIA-BNR (Killed In Action-Body Not Recovered), and PFOD (Presumptive Finding Of Death). There is no current evidence indicating that a person previously listed as MIA or POW could still be alive. Unaccounted For refers to Americans initially listed as POW, MIA, KIA-BNR, or PFOD, with no further information known. Statistics on U.S. POWs and MIAs in Vietnam and past wars are often conflicting. North Vietnamese and Viet Cong authorities returned 591 POWs to U.S. control after the signing of an agreement. Since the signing of the Vietnam War peace treaty in 1973, 591 POWs were returned to U.S. control. Some Americans were trapped or stayed voluntarily after South Vietnam fell in 1975, but all were released by 1976. Since then, some Americans have been imprisoned in Vietnam for civilian offenses and eventually released. Only one U.S. military member has returned alive from Vietnam since 1973. Marine Corps PFC Robert Garwood, listed as a POW by U.S. authorities in 1965, returned voluntarily to the U.S. in 1979 after being convicted of collaboration with the enemy. After the return of 591 POWs, 2,583 Americans were unaccounted for. Remains of 768 Americans have been returned from Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and China since the war ended. As of August 5, 2005, 1,815 Americans are still listed as unaccounted for, with the Department of Defense actively seeking to account for 1,148. It is believed that the remains of the other 667 will never be recovered. Since 1982, the official U.S. position is that while unable to prove Americans are still held captive, they cannot rule out the possibility. The DOD Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office continues to prioritize investigating live-sighting reports in case some Americans are still held captive. The DOD's POW/Missing Personnel Affairs oversees POW/MIA matters and policies for past and future conflicts. JPAC in Hawaii supervises field activities related to POW/MIA accounting worldwide, including research, interviews, and identification of remains. Recovery efforts for POW/MIA cases have been conducted in various countries, including Hungary, China, New Guinea, Betio Island in Tarawa atoll, and Libya. The U.S. government has acquired 22,677 reports related to Americans in Southeast Asia between April 1975 and August 2005, with 1,976 alleged first-hand sightings. Of these, 1,942 have been resolved, with 1,341 individuals accounted for, 556 determined to be fabrications, and 45 related to pre-mid-1975 sightings of Americans. Since 1991, the U.S. has gained access to aircraft crash sites, Vietnamese records, and civilians, with efforts focused on 34 sightings of Americans in captive or non-captive environments. Despite increased access to archives and interviews with Vietnamese military leaders, large numbers of Americans remain unaccounted for between 1991 and 2005. The U.S. has gained access to aircraft crash sites, Vietnamese records, and civilians since 1991. The total number of unaccounted Americans has generally dropped by 30-35 cases per year between 1991 and 2005. However, much information obtained in Vietnam does not assist in remains identification, as it is redundant or already in U.S. hands. The DPMO has mentioned a Vietnamese Government disinformation program associated with recent reporting on missing Americans. Some argue that Vietnamese cooperation on the POW/MIA issue has been spotty and uneven. The U.S. government tends to equate activity with results and resource inputs with true outputs regarding unaccounted-for Americans. The true cost of military and diplomatic activities related to POW/MIA issues is much higher than the stated budget. Vietnam and North Korea charge high fees for support, with services received not as lavish as billed. DPMO believes 667 of the 1,815 Americans listed as unaccounted for are definitely dead, with further investigation potentially yielding no new evidence or remains. The U.S. government is facing challenges in resolving cases of unaccounted-for Americans, with some believing that the Vietnamese may have evidence on their fate. The number of cases listed for \"No Further Pursuit\" by DPMO fluctuates based on new evidence, and concerns over public reaction may be delaying the closure of these cases. The FY2006 National Defense Authorization Act did not address POW/MIA issues. In June 2005, during House debate on the FY2006 Department of Defense Appropriation Act, concerns were raised about the Defense POW/Missing Personnel Office's treatment of POW/MIA organizations and families. Representative Nathan Deal requested a report on alleged mistreatment by the DPMO, including coercion of MIA families to support DPMO initiatives. This report was to be included in the eventual conference report on the act. The National League of Families of American Prisoners of War and Missing in Southeast Asia accused the Defense POW/Missing Personnel Office (DPMO) of using military air transportation to coerce MIA families into supporting DPMO initiatives. The FY2005 NDAA included a provision requiring DOD to maintain personnel levels in the DPMO and allocated a budget of $16.0 million, reflecting congressional concern over decreasing resources for the DPMO. The FY2004 National Defense Authorization Act expressed Congress's support for aggressively pursuing MIA cases, including offering a $1 million reward for information on the Speicher case. The FY2003 NDAA included provisions to prevent reductions in personnel and budget levels for the DPMO. The FY2004 National Defense Authorization Act supported aggressive pursuit of MIA cases, offering a $1 million reward for information on the Speicher case. Congress required a comprehensive report on the Speicher case within 60 days. From 1993-1997, defense bills included significant POW/MIA sections, but Congress was less active on POW/MIA matters during 1998-2001. No major provisions or report language on POW/MIA were included in later defense authorization acts. Some Americans believe that live Americans were still held after the Vietnam War, pointing to a lack of government will to investigate the POW/MIA issue in the 1970s. Others argue that despite reports and interrogations, no validated reports of unaccounted-for live Americans have been found. Most U.S. government analysts believe it is unlikely that North Vietnam kept U.S. prisoners after the war or transferred them to the USSR. Despite the repressive nature of communist regimes, evidence suggests that American POWs were not kept behind in the early 1970s or are still being held. The presence of American officials, business interests, and tourists in Vietnam has not revealed any indications of American POWs being held. Some believe the U.S. government has covered up evidence of live Americans still being held in Indochina, citing unreliable sources. The government denies this, stating investigations have cleared them of cover-up charges. Since 1982, it has been policy to provide intelligence to families of missing Americans. Some Americans stayed voluntarily in Indochina, like Garwood, while others defected to the Viet Cong. Some Americans remained in Indochina voluntarily due to ideology, collaboration with the enemy, fear of punishment upon return, personal problems, or being \"brainwashed\" by captors. The Vietnamese denied Americans living in areas under their control, leaving room for speculation. The U.S. government policy refers to \"Americans still being held against their will.\" There is a belief that the Vietnamese had a collection of remains that may have been exhausted by August 1990. The Vietnamese may hold remains of Americans indicating mistreatment or captivity after the war. Laotians might have more information on missing Americans, but their ability to provide answers is limited due to Vietnamese occupation and lack of resources. Searches at aircraft crash sites in Laos have yielded recent results. In Laos, searches of aircraft crash sites have led to the identification of missing Americans. A U.S. delegation discussed improving access to information on POWs from the Vietnam War. Rumors suggest Americans captured in the Korean War may have been held in North Korea, China, or Russia. Communist powers withheld information on POWs from the U.S., with more secrecy from North Korea and China. There is compelling circumstantial evidence that Korean War POWs may have been transferred to the Soviet Union. The cumulative weight of circumstantial evidence suggests that some Americans may have been transferred to North Korea after the Korean War. Some sightings of Caucasians in North Korea may be American soldiers who defected. U.S. POWs were not released by China until 1955, and some CIA aircrew members were imprisoned until 1972. Declassified documents show the U.S. government's interest in live POWs from the Korean War. Bitter relations between the U.S., North Korea, and China after the war hint at the possibility of American POWs being held by communist enemies. During the Korean War, the U.S. demanded accountability for missing Americans from North Koreans and Chinese. Despite sporadic efforts, concrete progress was minimal until negotiations in 1996. Parameters for field investigations and archival research for U.S. MIAs were agreed upon between the United States and North Korea. 36 joint field missions were completed between 1996 and 2004. Between 1996 and 2004, U.S. personnel conducted 36 joint field activities in North Korea, recovering 224 remains with 20 identified as Americans. In 2005, an agreement for five more activities was reached, but operations were suspended in May due to safety concerns amidst rising tensions. The teams faced communication restrictions, hindering their efforts. The restrictive conditions imposed on U.S. forces in North Korea hampered their ability to protect recovery teams in emergencies, leading to the suspension of missions. Controversy surrounds the payments made to North Korea for POW/MIA-related search activities, with $15 million paid since 1993. During the Cold War, U.S. military aircraft were shot down by various countries, including North Korea. Some were performing intelligence missions near Soviet airspace, while others were in international airspace. The losses were acknowledged, but the intelligence functions were not always disclosed. During the Cold War, U.S. military aircraft were shot down by various countries, including North Korea. Between 1946 and 1977, there were at least 38 aircraft shootdowns and one involving a ship. Of the 364 crewmembers, 187 were eventually returned to U.S. custody, 34 remains were recovered, 11 were known to be dead, and 132 were \"not recovered, fate unknown.\" Intelligence from German and Japanese POWs provided evidence of some crewmembers being in Soviet concentration camps. After the Cold War, the U.S. received Russian cooperation on Soviet involvements. The United States received substantial Russian cooperation regarding Soviet involvements in Cold War shootdowns, but not all information has been released due to obstructionism in post-Soviet Russia. Kidnappings of U.S. personnel in Soviet-occupied territory after World War II by Soviet intelligence agents occurred, with some being defectors or entering the area for nonpolitical reasons. West Germans were also kidnapped by Soviet and East German intelligence agencies in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The POW/MIA issue was highlighted during the Iraq war in 2003. The POW/MIA issue, highlighted during the Iraq war in 2003, remains a concern for Americans missing or captured since the Cold War. Lt. Cdr. Michael Scott Speicher's status was changed from KIA to MIA in January 2001, suggesting he may have survived and been captured. Lt. Cdr. Michael Scott Speicher's status was changed from KIA to MIA, indicating he may have survived and been captured during the Persian Gulf War. Issues surrounding his disappearance include the lack of remains, questions about his fate, and evidence suggesting he was taken prisoner by the Iraqis. A joint DOD/CIA report suggested that Iraq may be concealing information about his fate. Lt. Cdr. Michael Scott Speicher's status was changed from KIA to MIA, indicating he may have been captured by the Iraqis during the Persian Gulf War. Despite extensive investigations, no substantive information about his fate has been found, with some leads remaining unexplored due to security threats. A Navy report in 2005 reiterated the possibility of his capture and recommended maintaining his status as missing. On April 13, 2003, seven American POWs captured by Iraqis were recovered by U.S. troops. An eighth had been rescued earlier. A total of 21 U.S. military personnel were listed as POW or MIA during the initial stages of the war. On April 9, 2004, one American soldier was captured by Iraqi insurgents, the first since the early part of the war. Rumors of his death in June 2004 were unconfirmed. Reports of a U.S. Marine of Lebanese descent missing from his unit in Iraq in 2004, returning to U.S. custody a month later, and going AWOL in 2005 are unclear if he was ever a POW. Allegations of the USSR not repatriating American POWs after WWII lack factual basis. Research shows that almost all prisoners were returned. The large flow of information on Soviet concentration camps of the Stalin era in the 1960s has not indicated mass imprisonment of Americans. U.S. citizens of German descent taken prisoner by the Red Army were singled out by the Soviet secret police. Accounts of U.S. dealings with the USSR during and after WWII on the POW issue show Soviet obfuscation and reluctant cooperation. The Joint U.S.-Russian Commission on POWs/MIAs has gathered significant information on these issues. The Commission has faced obstacles from Russian officials hindering their work on POW/MIA matters. Various studies and analyses on POW/MIA issues from World War II onwards have been conducted, providing extensive statistical breakdowns and lists of individuals. Relevant sources include Nenninger's article on US prisoners of war, Sledge's book on honoring fallen soldiers, Swift's work on searching for lost soldiers, and a report by the US Congress Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs. The Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs published a report on January 13, 1993, providing extensive information on POW/MIA issues."
