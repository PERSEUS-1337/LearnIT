FINDINGS.\" Congress finds that the Islamic Republic of Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism, with the Qods Force being the primary mechanism for supporting terrorists abroad. The Qods Force provides aid to various terrorist groups and has been responsible for deadly attacks over the past three decades. In 2007, President George W. Bush and General David Petraeus accused Iran's Qods Force of aiding militias in killing American soldiers in Iraq. The U.S. Department of the Treasury designated the Qods Force for providing material support to terrorist organizations. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Qods Force was sanctioned for supporting proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In 2008, Congress urged designating Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as a foreign terrorist organization and placing them on the list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists. Following the 2009 election in Iran, the Qods Force was implicated in violence, including custodial deaths, killings of protesters, torture, beatings, and rape. President Obama issued Executive Order 13572 in 2011, blocking property of certain persons involved in human rights abuses in Syria, including the Qods Force. This was due to the repression of the Syrian people through violence, torture, arbitrary arrests, and detentions of peaceful protestors. In 2011, two members of Iran's Qods Force were charged with an alleged plot to assassinate the Saudi Arabian Ambassador to the United States. The criminal complaint against individuals included charges of conspiracy to murder a foreign official, engage in murder-for-hire, use explosives, and commit acts of international terrorism. The U.S. Department of the Treasury designated Iran's Qods Force General Gholamreza Baghbani as a Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficker for supporting terrorism. Iran's Qods Force stations operatives in foreign embassies and institutions to build relationships. In recent years, there has been an increased presence of Iran in Latin America, fostering relationships with the Shia Diaspora. The Secretary of State will designate Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Qods Force as a foreign terrorist organization. Additionally, a report on the terrorist activities of this group will be submitted to the relevant committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate."
