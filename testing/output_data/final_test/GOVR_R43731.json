    "content": "Poverty in the United States remains a significant issue despite the War on Poverty launched in 1964. In 2013, 45.3 million people were officially counted as poor, with a poverty rate of 14.5%. The 50th anniversary of the War on Poverty has sparked discussions on the effectiveness of past and current policies, with various viewpoints and new initiatives being proposed. The topic of poverty extends beyond just cash assistance programs, encompassing broader social insurance programs like Social Security. Universal social insurance programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Unemployment Insurance are crucial antipoverty measures in the US. Poverty is influenced by various public policies, from macroeconomic strategies to antidiscrimination laws. While poverty reduction is not always the explicit goal of policy debates, decisions can directly impact poverty rates. For instance, welfare reform in 1996 aimed to transition cash assistance recipients into employment, while the 2010 health reform focused on expanding healthcare access for the uninsured. The 2010 health reform aimed to expand health insurance access and make coverage more secure. Recent proposals by some Members of Congress focus on addressing poverty through various federal programs, reflecting common themes in antipoverty policy discussions. The Obama Administration's policies also align with these historic themes. The report provides an overview of poverty trends and population characteristics. The report discusses the impact of poverty on the population and changing perceptions of the poor. It also outlines key federal policies enacted over the past century to address poverty and presents recurring themes in poverty policy debates. Tables highlight aspects of selected congressional proposals and Administration initiatives within this historical context. Specifically, Table 2 focuses on Obama Administration initiatives, and Table 3 on Representative Paul Ryan's proposals. Table 4 highlights the Pathways Out of Poverty Act (H.R. 5352) introduced by Representative Barbara Lee, while Table 5 looks at Senator Marco Rubio's antipoverty ideas. These selected congressional proposals aim to address poverty in a broad context, but are not comprehensive or comparable in scope. The report provides a brief overview of antipoverty policies in the United States, focusing on the various factors that influence poverty. It mentions President Franklin Roosevelt's acknowledgment of widespread poverty in 1937 and highlights the lack of an official government definition of poverty at that time. The report also notes the extensive literature available on poverty and federal antipoverty policies. Poverty is a complex concept with no official government definition until the 1960s. It can be seen as deprivation of money or access to necessities like medical care and housing. The official poverty measure is based on pre-tax income, with a family of four considered poor if their income is below $23,624 in 2013. Census Bureau data on poverty rates is available from 1959 to 2013. The official poverty rate data from 1959 to 2013 shows a decline from 22.4% in 1959 to 11.1% in 1973, fluctuating thereafter. The rate remained above 12% from 1980 to 1998, reaching 15% in 2010-2012 before dropping to 14.5% in 2013. Poverty rates for the aged and children decreased until 1973, with the aged initially having a higher rate than children. Child poverty rates increased from 14.4% in 1973 to 20% in 1981, remaining above 19% until 1998. In 2012, child poverty exceeded 21% before dropping to 19.9% in 2013. In contrast, the poverty rate for persons aged 65 and older was 9.5% in 2013, continuing a decline that started in the late 1990s. Discussions have focused on the adequacy of the current poverty measure, which does not consider benefits from programs like SNAP or Medicaid. The new supplemental poverty measure from the Census Bureau for years 2010 through 2012 considers benefits like tax refunds from EITC and the Child Tax Credit, as well as out-of-pocket medical expenses. This measure shows a higher elderly poverty rate in 2012 (14.8%) and a lower child poverty rate (18%) compared to the official rates. Factors like economic slumps and growth are correlated with poverty rates, which have persisted even during periods of economic growth. Poverty rates are higher for individuals with certain characteristics such as racial and ethnic minorities, low educational attainment, foreign-born noncitizens, and single mother-headed families. Antipoverty policy development is influenced by subjective views and statistical measures of poverty. Factors associated with poverty include low earnings capacity, discrimination, and lack of jobs in various sectors. The curr_chunk discusses various factors contributing to poverty, including economic issues, lack of jobs, slow wage growth, single-parent households, personal behaviors, and assistance program designs. It also mentions the increase in poverty during the 2000s and the effects of the 2007-2009 recession. The next section will cover federal policies addressing poverty. The rise in poverty is attributed to various factors such as changes in demographics, economic structure, and availability of assistance programs. Federal policies to address poverty have evolved since the Great Depression, with significant changes in each decade starting from the 1960s. In response to the Great Depression, the federal government provided grants for relief and work programs. President Franklin Roosevelt enacted the Social Security Act in 1935 to provide economic security for individuals facing hardships. Social insurance programs were established to protect workers from old age and unemployment. During the Great Depression, the federal government implemented \"New Deal\" programs to aid the elderly, disabled, and mothers raising children. This included assisted housing programs and the expansion of Social Security benefits to widows, survivors, and disabled workers. Additionally, federal grants were established to assist states in aiding needy disabled individuals, the aged, and the blind. Minimum wage, labor standards, and union rights were also introduced during this time. The rights of unions to collectively bargain wages and benefits date back to the Great Depression. Minimum wage rates were periodically updated until the 1960s, with the real value peaking in 1968. However, after 1981, there were no further increases in the federal minimum wage until it was raised again in 1990, 1991, 1996, 1997, 2007, 2008, and 2009. President Johnson launched the War on Poverty in 1964, emphasizing the importance of a strong national economy, education, and job skills training. President Johnson's War on Poverty focused on addressing the cycle of poverty through various initiatives, including macroeconomic conditions, education and skills training, youth programs, and empowering low-income residents. He also proposed expanding food stamp programs and improving housing and urban areas. The War on Poverty under President Johnson aimed to address poverty by enacting laws for food stamps, hospital insurance, housing, and civil rights. The Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 established programs like Head Start and Job Corps. Other legislation included the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and the Higher Education Act to help low-income students. The Food Stamp Act of 1964 made the food assistance program permanent. During the Kennedy Administration, an assistance program was initiated as a pilot, and the Social Security Amendments of 1965 established Medicare and Medicaid. The Nixon Administration shifted focus to \"welfare reform,\" specifically targeting the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. AFDC, originating from the 1935 Social Security Act, provided cash assistance to families in need. The Nixon Administration proposed welfare reform to replace AFDC with a negative income tax model, providing income guarantee and adjusting based on earnings. Similar proposals were made during the Nixon and Carter administrations. In the 1970s, under the administration of President Carter, there were significant changes in low-income assistance programs. This included federalizing assistance for the aged, blind, and disabled under the Supplemental Security Income program in 1972, expanding the food stamp program nationwide in 1974, and enacting the Food Stamp Act of 1977 which established an \"income guarantee\" for qualifying low-income households. Additionally, Section 8 rental housing assistance was enacted in 1974, and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for low-wage workers was created as a temporary measure in 1975 and later made permanent in 1978. In the late 1970s, public service employment programs were created to address high unemployment, authorized under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA). President Reagan's policies in the 1980s focused on tax cuts and federal spending reductions to stimulate economic growth. Rising concerns about the urban \"underclass\" also emerged during this time. In the 1980s, concerns about the urban \"underclass\" and poverty policy focused on programs for the poor, with attention on inner cities and issues like welfare dependency and work requirements for recipients. In the 1980s, legislation allowed states to require mothers on assistance to work for their benefits (workfare). The Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) replaced CETA, emphasizing partnerships between governments and private employers for employment training. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced tax rates, increased personal exemptions, and expanded the EITC. In the 1980s, policy changes aimed to remove the working poor from federal income tax rolls and expand Medicaid eligibility based on poverty status rather than receipt of public assistance. The EITC expansion in the 1986 tax act and the Family Support Act of 1988 reflected a trend towards broadening need-tested aid to a wider population of the poor, including the working poor. The Family Support Act of 1988 focused on welfare reform, particularly on AFDC, with enhanced employment and training programs for mothers. High unemployment rates in inner cities disproportionately affected African-Americans. Discussions on lack of jobs in inner cities led to welfare reform legislation in the mid-1990s, with President Bill Clinton promising to \"end welfare as we know it.\" State welfare reform experiments began in 1992. In 1996, welfare reform legislation was enacted under President Clinton, replacing AFDC with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and emphasizing work. This included making low-wage work more beneficial than cash assistance through expansions of the EITC, increased funding for child care subsidies, and continued health insurance for children in low-income families. The 1996 welfare reform legislation replaced AFDC with TANF, emphasizing work and time-limited aid. TANF gave states authority to spend funds on various benefits and services, including cash assistance. Refundable tax credits like EITC and Child Tax Credit were expanded for low-income earners. States were given more flexibility in administering food stamp programs, renamed SNAP in 2008. The 2002 Farm Bill reduced administrative burden on states and recipients by allowing less frequent reporting of changes in household circumstances, adopting more liberal asset rules for vehicles, and providing a fixed food stamp benefit to households transitioning off TANF assistance. States also implemented \"broad-based categorical eligibility\" to make more households eligible for SNAP without an asset test. Temporary measures were enacted during the 2007-2009 recession through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (P.L. 111-5) expanded federal spending on low-income aid, particularly for SNAP and Medicaid. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA, P.L. 111-148) made significant changes to low-income assistance policies, including expanding Medicaid eligibility and providing tax credits for lower-income individuals to purchase private health insurance. The curr_chunk discusses overarching themes in federal policies addressing poverty, providing a framework for policymakers. It includes tables highlighting current Administration and congressional proposals in this context. The topic of poverty is broader than a single program or set of programs. The topic of poverty is broader than a single program or set of programs, encompassing various aspects of public policy. There is ongoing debate on whether policies should be universal or targeted to those in financial need. Universal approaches include macroeconomic policies, social insurance programs, legal and regulatory policies, and the provision of public goods and services. Universal policies, such as free public education and minimum wage laws, aim to benefit society as a whole. In contrast, need-tested programs like TANF and Medicaid provide assistance based on financial need and specific criteria. The debate between universal and targeted policies involves conceptual, political, and fiscal considerations. Universal policies, like Social Security, have been effective in reducing poverty among the elderly by providing benefits to all, regardless of income level. This approach has garnered more political support compared to narrowly targeted programs. Social Security, a near universal program, has played a significant role in decreasing poverty among the elderly since the 1950s. Targeted need-tested programs focus public dollars on low-income populations to address specific conditions associated with poverty. These programs provide intensive benefits to smaller eligible groups and serve as a safety net for those not covered by universal policies like Social Security. They can also differentiate between deserving and undeserving poor, and incentivize certain behaviors. Universal social policies often include targeted elements, such as Social Security's progressive benefit structure and refundable tax credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit. These policies combine elements of both universal and targeted approaches, providing support through the federal income tax system. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Child Tax Credit are targeted towards families with children, but not limited to the poor. Strategies to address poverty include income, services, and employment strategies, with federal policy focusing on income and services. Providing money to the poor is one approach to alleviate poverty. One strategy to address poverty is to provide economic assistance directly to low-income families, either in cash or in kind. This approach raises the purchasing power of recipients by subsidizing specific necessities like food, housing, and medical care. Noncash benefits such as SNAP and Medicaid also help by freeing up income for other goods and services. Social insurance programs have historically been the dominant poverty policy, providing benefits to those facing specific circumstances like old age, disability, or job loss. In 1935, federal aid to states for need-tested benefits was established, providing support to groups like single mothers with children who were not expected to work. Over time, income support expanded to include noncash benefits like food, housing, and medical assistance for lower income individuals. These benefits not only help meet basic needs but also serve other interests such as promoting agricultural policies and increasing the use of medical care. The current focus is on policies that aim to \"make work pay.\" The current focus is on policies that aim to \"make work pay\" by providing expanded benefits to low-income working families with children, such as the EITC, child care subsidies, and medical assistance. The EITC is now a larger program than cash assistance for families with children, showing short-term effectiveness in alleviating material hardship associated with poverty. Addressing material hardship does not require a specific diagnosis of poverty's root cause. Increasing resources for families can improve children's well-being, education, behavior, and health outcomes. However, work disincentives in income support programs may reduce earned income over time. Services aim to change behaviors and improve individuals' economic functioning, addressing both the effects and root causes of poverty. The federal government and states offer education, employment, and social services programs to address various needs related to poverty, such as low educational attainment, lack of soft skills, and substance abuse. These programs, associated with President Johnson's War on Poverty, include Head Start, Job Corps, federal aid to poor school districts, and aid to disadvantaged college students. The services strategy, part of the nation's need-based benefits system, is criticized for not directly addressing poverty. Critics argue that service programs may primarily benefit professionals and organizations providing the services. Labor-intensive services can be costly, with effectiveness varying based on implementation quality. Measuring the impact of services is challenging, often showing long-term effects rather than immediate results. The research on mandatory participation in welfare-to-work services during the 1980s and 1990s found that such programs increased work and reduced welfare receipt. Evaluations of other services like early childhood development programs and career academies also showed positive effects. A job is often considered the best antipoverty program in discussions of macroeconomic policies. The targeted employment strategy, involving direct government job creation or subsidized employment, has been less common in poverty policy compared to fiscal and monetary policies. Examples include public works employment during the Great Depression and public service employment in the 1970s. Despite limited use, the strategy has been discussed in poverty and welfare reform debates, with calls to revive programs like the WPA during economic downturns. Some propose replacing cash assistance with government-financed jobs as a last resort in welfare reform. The welfare reform proposals of Presidents Carter and Clinton included expanded public service employment for unemployed single mothers on cash assistance. TANF could be used for subsidized private or public sector employment, but has mainly focused on getting recipients into unsubsidized jobs. Additional TANF funding in 2009 and 2010 allowed for subsidized employment during the recession. The employment strategy assumes poverty is due to a lack of job opportunities in specific time periods, locations, or for specific groups. The impact of government job-creation is challenging to measure, with concerns about displacement of regular public sector employees by new workers. Antipoverty policies debate encouraging conformity to social norms, particularly regarding work for able-bodied adults. Social insurance programs base benefits on past work and specific events like old age or involuntary unemployment. Cash aid programs have evolved to require work or participation in activities for single mothers to receive benefits. Participation requirements have been extended to noncash programs like food stamps and housing assistance. In the past, aid was conditioned on maintaining a suitable home for children or other behaviors. Under current TANF policies, states can require recipients to undergo drug tests and meet behavioral requirements. Conditional cash transfer programs offer financial rewards for meeting goals related to education, health care, and employment. There is a tradeoff between conditioning aid on work or behaviors and alleviating short-term poverty. This could lead to some families leaving aid rolls due to sanctions or deter others from seeking assistance. The rate of participation in welfare programs has fluctuated over the years due to changes in rules and requirements. Following welfare reform in 1996, the participation rate among financially eligible families declined significantly. However, under food stamps/SNAP in the 2000s, states made their employment and training programs voluntary, leading to an increase in receipt among eligible households. Placing conditions on benefit receipt may help screen out those who are less in need of assistance. The federal government's role in social programs has evolved over time, with a shift towards greater involvement since the Great Depression. Conditions for receiving aid can deter individuals from seeking assistance, but promoting work can help integrate recipients into society and reduce poverty in the long term. Discussions on federalism's role in social policy are ongoing. The federal government's role in social programs expanded significantly after the Great Depression, culminating in the enactment of the Social Security Act in 1935. Today, the federal government provides substantial funding for various social policy goals, with debates ongoing about the appropriate balance between federal and state involvement in designing and funding social programs. Advocates of a strong federal role argue for national policies to address national problems and ensure equitable treatment of vulnerable populations, while proponents of decentralized policy making emphasize the importance of states and localities setting their own rules within federal parameters. Advocates of decentralized policy making argue that states are better equipped to design policies for their residents' specific needs, enabling innovation and avoiding inefficiencies caused by strict federal rules. Current programs like TANF, SNAP, and SSI reflect different approaches to federalism, with varying levels of state and federal involvement in administration and funding. The largest federal low-income program, Medicaid, operates under federal eligibility and benefit rules. States receive reimbursement for eligible expenditures on behalf of eligible individuals. Federal programs vary among states due to optional populations and services. The EITC is a refundable federal tax credit, and low-income housing programs involve a direct relationship between the federal government and local public housing authorities. Federal program designs reflect different eras and theories of federalism. In 1964, President Johnson introduced \"Creative Federalism,\" expanding the federal role in social programs to achieve national goals like ending poverty and racial injustice. This approach involved direct relationships between the federal government and localities through categorical grants. Private community groups also played a role in delivering services at the local level. The proliferation of grant programs during the Johnson era raised concerns about duplication. President Nixon responded to concerns about duplication in grant programs by introducing \"New Federalism,\" which aimed to consolidate programs into block grants for states and localities. He proposed devolving decision-making to the states in areas like education and urban development, while acknowledging certain federal functions like welfare and health care. President Reagan also focused on federalism in his domestic agenda, making sweeping proposals for change. Reagan's \"New Federalism\" proposed significant changes to the federal-state relationship, advocating for block grants to replace existing grant programs and a shift in responsibilities between the federal government and states. This included a plan for the federal government to take over Medicaid costs in exchange for states managing cash welfare and food stamps. Additionally, Reagan suggested returning control of over 40 federal programs to the states, with temporary federal funding provided through a trust fund. President Reagan's proposed \"swap-and-turnback\" was not enacted, but there has been movement towards block granting and devolution to the states. In 1996, President Clinton signed the welfare reform law that replaced AFDC with the TANF block grant to states and consolidated certain child care funding streams. The War on Poverty focused on empowering the poor through the Community Action Program, which established community action agencies to develop local antipoverty plans and coordinate resources. President Johnson aimed to create opportunities for active participation in programs serving communities. The Community Services Block Grant supports various agencies, including private nonprofits, in implementing social policy programs. These organizations provide services such as outreach, training, and program evaluation through different arrangements with the government. The welfare reform law of 1996 included \"charitable choice\" rules for the participation of religious organizations in the TANF program. The TANF program allowed states to work with charitable, religious, or private organizations to provide services without compromising their religious character or the freedom of beneficiaries. The provision also aimed to promote privatization of social services. President George W. Bush established a White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives to support these efforts. The expansion of federal grant programs in the 1960s raised concerns about duplication and overlap in serving similar populations. This issue continues to be a recurring feature in poverty policy discussions, often leading to proposals to consolidate programs into block grants to states. Coordination mechanisms are also suggested to promote efficiency without necessarily changing the existing program structure. Efforts to promote coordination in social programs aim to maximize efficiency and minimize confusion for beneficiaries. Integration initiatives have also been explored, such as using the same eligibility criteria for multiple programs. Past coordination and integration efforts have shown varying degrees of success, with lessons learned including the need for realistic cost expectations. Efforts to promote coordination in social programs aim to maximize efficiency and minimize confusion for beneficiaries. The selection of programs for integration is crucial, with leadership playing a critical role in facilitating coordination across federal agencies. Evaluations are important for measuring impacts and informing future policies, but can be costly. Effective performance measures help ensure accountability, yet developing them can be challenging. Waivers of federal provisions may be necessary to cut across conflicting programs. Waivers of federal provisions are crucial for coordination and service integration in social programs. They have been used in the evolution of social policy, including during the TANF experimentation period. President George W. Bush proposed a \"superwaiver\" to allow states to request waivers for integrating activities across multiple programs. This would provide flexibility in serving additional populations and testing innovative service delivery systems. The proposal allowed states to design demonstration programs changing federal eligibility rules for various social programs, with few limitations on state discretion. Demonstrations could not increase federal spending and certain provisions related to civil rights, health, safety, labor standards, and environmental protection could not be waived. The proposal was passed by the House and Senate Finance Committee but not enacted. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of bold experimentation in social and economic policy, citing quotes from Franklin D. Roosevelt and Justice Louis Brandeis. It highlights the value of states serving as laboratories for novel policy experiments without risking the rest of the country. The chunk emphasizes the history of experimentation in economic and social policy, referencing the War on Poverty as an example. The negative income tax experiments in the late 1960s and 1970s provided evidence that income guarantees reduced work effort but did not conclusively show the impact of economic assistance programs on family structure. By the 1980s, the focus had shifted to work requirements for cash assistance recipients. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 allowed states to implement \"workfare\" programs for welfare recipients, requiring them to participate in community service or work experience. Welfare-to-work programs in the 1980s and 1990s showed that mandatory work requirements could reduce assistance receipt and increase employment, but did not effectively reduce poverty. However, programs like the Minnesota Family Investment Program (MFIP) and New Hope in Milwaukee successfully reduced poverty by providing ongoing earnings supplements to participants who found employment. New Hope program served low-income families regardless of AFDC eligibility, reducing poverty through earnings supplements tied to full-time work and community service. Welfare reform experiments tested \"work-first\" strategies and longer-term education programs, both increasing employment and reducing assistance receipt. However, neither type of program raised participant incomes. The 1996 welfare reform law allowed states to design their own cash assistance programs without waivers or formal testing. Social experiments shifted focus from cash assistance recipients to broader disadvantaged populations and other policies like education reform. The current emphasis on \"evidence-based\" policies ties social science research to social policy, but research has limitations in informing policy. Randomized controlled experiments are considered the \"gold standard\" but may not always explain why a program is effective. High-quality evaluations can be costly. High-quality evaluations can be expensive, and a major policy consideration for antipoverty initiatives is their impact on the federal budget. The cost of low-income assistance gained visibility during the recession, with some temporary responses expiring. Outlays for SNAP are projected to decline as the economy improves, but the Affordable Care Act permanently raised need-tested health care spending. The Affordable Care Act permanently increased need-tested health care spending through Medicaid expansion and tax credits for private insurance. Low-income health program spending is projected to rise, while other low-income assistance spending is expected to decline. Changes in low-income assistance programs in the 1990s cost money but were offset by cuts in other programs or revenue. The legislation in the 1990s reduced the federal deficit through spending cuts and revenue increases. Examples include the EITC expansion, welfare reform law creating TANF, and CHIP creation in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Welfare reform experiments showed that work requirements alone did not raise incomes, but supplement programs did. The New Hope and MFIP experiments aimed to reduce poverty through earnings supplements and work supports, costing money for health care and child care. Past initiatives to coordinate programs did not save money. Budget neutrality in new antipoverty initiatives could involve offsetting new spending with reductions in other areas or increased revenues. The largest share of need-based aid goes to the elderly, disabled, and families with children. The largest share of need-based aid is currently received by the elderly, disabled, and families with children. Expanding aid to other populations may reduce aid to these groups. Budget neutrality in need-based programs could lead to a redistribution of resources. Congress will consider the budgetary impact of new initiatives under congressional budget rules, estimating costs or savings and comparing them with projected baselines. Public policies related to poverty are complex, with small, long-term impacts that may be difficult to distinguish from other policy outcomes. The last major debate on antipoverty policy in the 1990s aimed to reduce welfare dependency and promote work for cash assistance recipients. This led to the establishment of work requirements and time limits for aid recipients, along with policies to \"make work pay\" through income supports like EITC and child care subsidies. These policies continue today, particularly with regard to cash welfare. The TANF program, established in the 1990s to reduce welfare dependency and promote work, has been effective in meeting its goals. The current caseload has significantly decreased from its pre-reform high, focusing on single mothers with children. However, challenges arose during the recession of 2007-2009, leading to a sharp increase in the poverty rate despite modest TANF roll growth. The size and cost of the SNAP program have reached record levels, with high poverty rates and SNAP caseloads persisting even five years after the recession. Changes in demographics and the economy have led to an increase in foreign-born population, suburban poverty, decline in manufacturing jobs, and growth in lower-paying service sector. Attention is now focused on supporting men, adults without children, and those re-entering the workforce after incarceration. Current proposals to address poverty reflect recent trends and past debates. Current proposals to address poverty reflect recent trends and past debates, focusing on low-income populations with some universal elements. The Pathways Out of Poverty Act suggests direct government job creation for low-income individuals. All proposals emphasize policies supporting work, such as expansions of earnings supplements for childless workers. Congressional Republicans echo past initiatives for poverty alleviation. Proposals from congressional Republicans and Democrats aim to provide states with more flexibility in low-income assistance programs, including creating new initiatives and implementing accountability measures. Research shows that work requirements alone do not reduce poverty, but interventions combining work with earnings supplements have been effective, albeit at a cost to the government. Various theories about the causes of poverty have led to varied proposals from policy makers, reflecting the complexity of the issue. Current debates are influenced by factors such as the slowly recovering economy and differing opinions on the best approaches to address poverty. Additional readings on poverty and policy issues are included in the appendix, divided into source documents for proposals by the President and Congress, as well as major books and reports on the topic. The curr_chunk discusses various proposals from policy makers on poverty issues, including reports from the U.S. Council of Economic Advisors, a bill introduced by Representative Barbara Lee, and remarks by Senator Marco Rubio on conservative reforms for combating poverty. The information can be found in documents available online from the U.S. Government Printing Office, the House Budget Committee, and Senator Rubio's prepared remarks. Senator Marco Rubio delivered remarks on conservative reforms for combating poverty at the U.S. Capitol on January 8, 2014. Various books and reports on poverty issues were referenced, including works by Ken Auletta, Martha Bailey, Sheldon Danziger, Vincent J. Burke, John Kenneth Galbraith, Judith M. Gueron, Michael Harrington, and Ron Haskins. Various books and reports on poverty issues were referenced in Senator Marco Rubio's remarks on conservative reforms for combating poverty at the U.S. Capitol on January 8, 2014. The works mentioned include titles by Ron Haskins, Mickey Kaus, Lawrence M. Mead, Pamela A. Morris, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Charles Murray, and the President's Commission on Income Maintenance Programs. The \"Heineman Commission report\" is often referenced in discussions on poverty issues. Various works by authors such as William Julius Wilson and reports by the U.S. government have also contributed to the understanding of poverty in America. The Moynihan report, officially titled \"The Negro Family, The Case for National Action,\" was published by the U.S. Government in 1965. It is a significant document in discussions on poverty and is often referenced in academic and policy circles."
