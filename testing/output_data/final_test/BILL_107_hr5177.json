The Gila River Indian Community Judgment Fund Distribution Act of 2002 is cited as the short title for Title I. The findings are outlined in Section 102. Congress finds that the Gila River Indian Community filed a complaint in 1951 regarding water rights, with most claims resolved except for Docket Nos. 236-C and 236-D. The Indian Claims Commission held the United States liable for claims in Docket 236-C. In Gila River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community v. United States, the court held the US liable for claims in Docket 236-D. The Community settled with the US for $7,000,000 on April 27, 1999. The final judgment for $7,000,000 was entered in favor of the Community on May 3, 1999. The Department of the Treasury certified the payment on October 6, 1999. The payment of $7,000,000, minus attorney fees, was certified and deposited into a trust account for the Community. The Secretary must submit a plan to Congress for approval under the Indian Tribal Judgment Funds Use or Distribution Act. SEC. 103. DISTRIBUTION OF JUDGMENT FUNDS. Per Capita Payments: Funds appropriated in satisfaction of an award to the Gila River Indian Community will be distributed equally to eligible enrolled members, minus attorney fees and expenses. The Community will prepare a payment roll based on specific criteria for eligibility. The Judgment Fund will provide per capita payments to eligible enrolled members of the Gila River Indian Community based on specific criteria, including those living on the date of enactment and those who have died after the effective date of the payment plan. Ineligible individuals will not receive payments from the Judgment Fund. Ineligible individuals for per capita payments from the Judgment Fund include those who have relinquished membership, minors whose parents have relinquished membership before they turn 18, individuals disenrolled for just cause, and those certified by the Secretary as ineligible. The Community must notify the Secretary of the total number of eligible individuals for per capita distribution, including shares for living adult tribal members and deceased or legally incompetent individuals. The Community provides enrollment information to the Secretary for estate accounts of deceased individuals, IIM accounts for legally incompetent individuals and minors. The Secretary disburses funds for per capita distribution to eligible adult tribal members, with the Community responsible for administering and distributing the funds. The Secretary distributes shares of deceased individuals to their heirs or legatees, with unclaimed shares reverting to the Community. Shares of legally incompetent individuals are deposited into supervised IIM accounts, while shares of minors are also placed in supervised IIM accounts without certain provisions applying. The Distribution Act does not apply to minors' per capita shares held in trust by the Secretary until they turn 18. Judgment Funds and interest cannot be disbursed until the minor reaches 18. Eligible individuals not listed on the payment roll may be paid from residual funds, with the Community covering any shortfall. The Secretary can accept and deposit funds into an IIM or estate account for minors. The Secretary can invest funds into an IIM or estate account for minors, legal incompetents, or deceased beneficiaries. Residual funds after per capita distribution can be disbursed to the Community. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act does not apply to Community-owned funds used to cover payment shortfalls for eligible individuals not listed on the payment roll. SEC. 104. DEFINITIONS. The definitions in this title include terms such as \"adult\" referring to individuals 18 years or older, \"Community\" as the Gila River Indian Community, \"Community-owned funds\" as funds held by the Secretary for payments, \"IIM\" as individual Indian money account, and \"Judgment Fund\" as a specific fund. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms such as \"Judgment Fund\" as funds awarded to the Community by the Court of Federal Claims, \"legal incompetent\" as an individual deemed incapable of managing their affairs, \"minor\" as an individual under 18 years of age, and \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Interior. SEC. 105. GENERAL PROVISIONS.

Funds subject to specific sections shall continue to be held in trust until disbursed. All funds distributed are subject to certain provisions of Public Law 93-134. The judgment fund plan for funds awarded to the Community in Docket No. 228 was submitted to Congress under the Act of October 19, 1973. It became effective on August 10, 1986, and was amended by Public Law 99-493 on October 16, 1986. The plan is further amended to exclude certain provisions for minors' per capita shares held in trust by the Secretary.
