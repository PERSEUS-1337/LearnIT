    "content": "The \"Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore Conservation and Recreation Act\" defines key terms such as \"line of demarcation,\" \"map,\" \"Secretary,\" \"State,\" and \"wilderness area.\" The Act designates the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore Wilderness. SEC. 3. Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore Wilderness Area. Designated as \"Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore Wilderness,\" approximately 32,557 acres of land along Lake Michigan in Michigan's Benzie and Leelanau Counties are designated as wilderness under the National Wilderness Preservation System. The map and legal description will be available for public inspection. The Secretary must submit a legal description of the wilderness area boundary to the Senate and House committees. The map and description can be corrected for errors. The lakeward boundary of the wilderness area bordering Lake Michigan is determined, taking into account surface water and the active wash zone. The active wash zone of Lake Michigan is considered outside the designated wilderness boundary, regardless of lake level or demarcation line. SEC. 4. ADMINISTRATION. The wilderness area will be managed by the Secretary in accordance with the Wilderness Act, with adjustments for the effective date and the Secretary of Agriculture. The boundary of the wilderness area must be located at least 100 feet from the centerline of each road. The Act allows for maintenance and improvement of roads adjacent to the wilderness area, with specific distance requirements from county roads and state highways. Hunting within the wilderness area is permitted under state and federal laws, and fish and wildlife jurisdiction remains unaffected. The Act does not create buffer zones around the wilderness area and does not affect the use of watercraft within the area. It also does not impact treaty rights. The Act does not impact treaty rights, private property rights, or the management of water in Lake Michigan within the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. It also does not prohibit the use of motors on Lake Michigan adjacent to the wilderness area."
