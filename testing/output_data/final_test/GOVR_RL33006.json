    "content": "Since the Arab oil embargo in 1973-1974, Congress has periodically addressed energy policy legislation due to rising oil prices and U.S. dependence on imported oil. The gap between U.S. oil production and consumption has led to increased oil imports, now exceeding 10 million barrels per day to meet total U.S. consumption of nearly 21 million barrels per day. This dependence on imported oil raises issues related to fossil fuel demand and consumption. Energy policy in the United States faces challenges such as the production of fossil fuels, development of alternative energy sources, and energy infrastructure issues. Balancing economic, security, and environmental concerns is a significant challenge for policymakers. The House approved an omnibus energy bill in the 109th Congress in 2005. The omnibus energy bill (H.R. 6) in 2005 aimed to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas leasing, change oversight of electric utilities, increase alternative motor fuels, provide energy tax incentives, extend nuclear accident liability, and authorize energy R&D programs. The Senate passed a version without ANWR provisions but with tax incentives and climate change provisions. Both versions included provisions from a previous bill in the 108th Congress. The bill also mandated increasing ethanol production and phasing out MTBE as a gasoline additive. The omnibus energy bill in 2005 aimed to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas leasing, increase alternative motor fuels, provide energy tax incentives, and mandate increasing ethanol production while phasing out MTBE as a gasoline additive. The House bill granted protection to producers of MTBE and renewable fuels from product liability lawsuits, while the Senate bill focused on renewable fuels and included a \"renewable portfolio standard\" and a credit-based deployment program for reducing greenhouse gas intensity. The House and Senate bills in 2005 aimed to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas leasing, increase alternative motor fuels, provide energy tax incentives, and mandate increasing ethanol production while phasing out MTBE as a gasoline additive. Provisions in both bills included increasing access for energy developers to federal lands and establishing efficiency standards for consumer and commercial products. The bills also proposed creating an electric reliability organization to enforce mandatory reliability standards for the bulk-power system and address transmission infrastructure issues. The House and Senate bills in 2005 aimed to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas leasing, increase alternative motor fuels, provide energy tax incentives, and mandate increasing ethanol production while phasing out MTBE as a gasoline additive. Provisions in both bills included increasing access for energy developers to federal lands and establishing efficiency standards for consumer and commercial products. The bills also proposed creating an electric reliability organization to enforce mandatory reliability standards for the bulk-power system and address transmission infrastructure issues. The Senate bill would terminate FERC's Standard Market Design notice of proposed rulemaking, while the House bill would remand it. Both bills clarify native load service obligations and allow federal utilities to participate in regional transmission organizations. The House and Senate bills in 2005 aimed to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas leasing, increase alternative motor fuels, provide energy tax incentives, and mandate increasing ethanol production while phasing out MTBE as a gasoline additive. Provisions in both bills included increasing access for energy developers to federal lands and establishing efficiency standards for consumer and commercial products. The bills also proposed creating an electric reliability organization to enforce mandatory reliability standards for the bulk-power system and address transmission infrastructure issues. Under both bills, the electricity title would repeal the mandatory purchase requirements under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) and the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA). The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and state regulatory bodies would be given access to utility books and records, with FERC required to issue rules for an electronic system providing information on wholesale electric energy and transmission services availability and price. Refunds for unjust electric rates found by FERC would begin at the time of a complaint filing, with increased penalties under both versions. The House and Senate versions of the 2005 bills aimed to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas leasing, increase alternative motor fuels, provide energy tax incentives, and mandate increasing ethanol production while phasing out MTBE as a gasoline additive. The bills also included provisions to increase access for energy developers to federal lands, establish efficiency standards for consumer and commercial products, create an electric reliability organization, and address transmission infrastructure issues. Additionally, the bills would repeal mandatory purchase requirements under PURPA and PUHCA, give FERC and state regulatory bodies access to utility books and records, and implement rules for an electronic system providing information on wholesale electric energy and transmission services availability and price. Refunds for unjust electric rates found by FERC would begin at the time of a complaint filing, with increased penalties under both versions. The House version would give FERC review authority for asset transfers valued over $10 million, while the Senate version would also apply to the purchase, lease, or acquisition of existing generating facilities over $10 million used for FERC jurisdictional interstate wholesale sales. The Senate version would require FERC to ensure no harmful cross-subsidization with a non-utility associate company. The House and Senate bills in 2005 aimed to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas leasing, increase alternative motor fuels, provide energy tax incentives, and mandate increasing ethanol production while phasing out MTBE as a gasoline additive. Both bills would ban the use of MTBE in motor vehicle fuel by December 31, 2014, except in states that specifically authorize its use. The bills would require an increasing amount of gasoline to contain renewable fuels like ethanol, with the House bill requiring 3.1 billion gallons of renewable fuel in 2005 and the Senate bill requiring 8.0 billion gallons by 2012. However, concerns have been raised about potential increases in gasoline prices due to these requirements. The House and Senate bills in 2005 aimed to phase out MTBE as a gasoline additive by December 31, 2014, with exceptions for specific authorization. The bills allocated funds to assist in converting MTBE production facilities to other fuel additives and aimed to preserve emissions reductions achieved by the RFG program. The House version of H.R. 6 included a controversial provision for a \"safe harbor\" establishment. The House version of H.R. 6 includes a \"safe harbor\" provision to protect producers of MTBE and renewable fuels from product liability lawsuits. The provision would be retroactive to September 5, 2003, and has led to numerous lawsuits filed after that date. The Senate bill includes a safe harbor for renewable fuels but not for MTBE, and it would not be retroactive. The energy tax provisions from H.R. 6 in the 108th Congress were included in the Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004 and the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Additional energy tax incentives were part of these acts, with differences between the House and Senate versions of the bills in the 109th Congress. The Senate bill offers more tax cuts for energy efficiency and alternative fuels compared to the House bill. Specifically, the Senate bill includes $12 billion in tax cuts for alternative fuels, while the House bill only includes $0.6 billion. Additionally, the Senate bill provides more tax incentives for energy efficiency investments. The House bill, on the other hand, focuses more on tax cuts for the electricity industry, particularly electricity infrastructure, making it more tilted towards fossil fuel production. The Senate bill's tax cuts are focused on alternative and renewable fuels, with larger cuts for oil, gas, and coal compared to the House bill. Strong incentives for nuclear energy, including a tax credit for electricity produced by nuclear reactors, are included in the Senate version of H.R. 6. The Senate bill includes incentives for nuclear energy, such as tax credits and loan guarantees for new reactors. Reauthorization of the Price-Anderson Act is crucial for new reactors, as it provides liability coverage for accident damages. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 6 propose a 20-year extension of the Price-Anderson Act until 2025. The nuclear industry supports the extension, citing its effectiveness, while opponents argue that the liability limits provide an unjust subsidy to nuclear power. The House bill also includes provisions for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to assess plant security and implement additional measures. The Senate version of H.R. 6 includes a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) that mandates retail electricity suppliers to obtain a minimum percentage of their power from new renewable energy resources. The RPS starts at 2.5% in 2008, increases every four years, and levels off at 10% from 2020 to 2030. Eligible resources include solar, wind, ocean, geothermal energy, biomass, landfill gas, and hydropower. Additional energy from existing facilities can also be used to meet the RPS target. The Senate version of H.R. 6 includes a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) that mandates retail electricity suppliers to obtain a minimum percentage of their power from new renewable energy resources. Geothermal energy would be eligible to satisfy the RPS target, with tradable credits created for purchasing alternative power sources. Credits can be carried forward for up to three years, with additional incentives for facilities on Indian land and distributed generators under 1 megawatt in size. The Senate version of H.R. 6 includes a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) mandating retail electricity suppliers to obtain a minimum percentage of power from new renewable energy sources. Geothermal energy is eligible for the RPS target, with tradable credits available for purchasing alternative power sources. Credits can be carried forward for up to three years, with additional incentives for facilities on Indian land and small distributed generators. DOE collections from credit sales and penalties would fund grants to states to promote renewables and establish new energy efficiency standards for various products and appliances. The congressional debate over opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to oil and gas development has been ongoing for over 40 years. The House passed H.R. 6 authorizing exploration and production in a portion of ANWR with a 2,000-acre limit on certain facilities, while the Senate version has no ANWR provisions. Proponents argue that ANWR oil would benefit U.S. energy markets, boost oil production, lower prices, and create jobs, with minimal environmental impact. Opponents believe intrusion on the ecosystem cannot be justified. Opponents of development in ANWR argue that intrusion on the ecosystem cannot be justified, economically recoverable oil would provide little energy security, and job claims are overstated. They believe the footprint of oil development would still have a significant impact despite limits on acreage, especially on Native lands in the Refuge. The Department of the Interior estimates that a quarter of oil resources and less than one-fifth of gas resources on Indian lands have been developed. H.R. 6 aims to encourage domestic energy production by reducing royalties for marginal oil and gas wells on public lands and the outer continental shelf. It also includes provisions to increase access to federal lands for energy projects like drilling, electric transmission lines, and gas pipelines. The House bill would also prohibit EPA from regulating hydraulic fracturing to protect drinking water sources. The House version of H.R. 6 authorizes $4 billion for hydrogen and fuel cell R&D over FY2006-2010, with a goal of commercial fuel cell vehicles by 2020. Critics suggest the program aims to avoid raising vehicle CAFE standards, while others argue government involvement is necessary for environmental and energy technology development. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 6 address energy policy with major differences, such as opening ANWR in the House bill and addressing global climate change in the Senate version. Table 1 provides a comparison of the major provisions. The report gives a section-by-section summary of the House and Senate-passed versions of H.R. 6. The Senate version of H.R. 6 addresses energy policy with various sections listed in numerical order. Controversial sections are discussed in appendices, and funding authorizations are detailed in Tables 2 and 3. Analysts from the CRS Resources, Science, and Industry Division contributed to the report on topics such as electric utilities, nuclear security, energy security, and more. Before 1997, EPA did not regulate hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas development under the SDWA's UIC program. In 1997, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that hydraulic fracturing constitutes underground injection and must be regulated. This ruling applied to hydraulic fracturing of coalbed methane wells in Alabama. Hydraulic fracturing for coalbed methane wells in Alabama must be regulated under the state's UIC program. Concerns arise from the injection of fluids directly into underground sources of drinking water, with the use of diesel fuel introducing toxic substances. Hydraulic fracturing can introduce toxic substances into underground drinking water sources and create new pathways for natural gas to enter aquifers. Concerns over the impact on water resources, especially in water-scarce regions, have increased with the rise in coalbed methane wells and hydraulic fracturing. Few studies have evaluated these impacts, leading to recommendations to eliminate diesel fuel in fracturing fluids. EPA entered into a voluntary agreement with major hydraulic fracturing companies to address these concerns. The EPA entered into a voluntary agreement with hydraulic fracturing companies to remove diesel fuel from fluids injected into drinking water sources if cost-effective alternatives are available. The National Drinking Water Advisory Council recommended further study on public health and environmental issues related to hydraulic fracturing for coalbed methane production. Oil and gas industry representatives argue against regulation, citing potential delays in natural gas development. EPA issued a report in 2004 concluding that hydraulic fracturing injection could introduce toxic substances into groundwater. The EPA concluded that hydraulic fracturing fluids injected into CBM wells pose little threat to underground drinking water sources, but further research on environmental impacts is needed. Criticisms have been raised, prompting a review by the EPA Inspector General. The Clean Water Act (CWA) defines oil and gas exploration facilities for stormwater permitting rules. Phase II requires small construction sites and municipal storm sewer systems to have discharge permits. Phase I, starting in 1991, included larger sites like oil and gas facilities. EPA authorized a two-year extension of Phase II rules for small oil and gas construction sites to assess economic impact. The exemption was extended until June 2006, with a specific rule proposed for small oil and gas construction sites by September 2005. The House-passed version of H.R. 6 made EPA's delay permanent for all oil and gas development and production sites. The amendment to the stormwater rule applies to all oil and gas construction sites, regardless of size. Industry argues that the rule creates costly permitting requirements, while supporters claim it clarifies existing CWA language. Opponents believe the provision doesn't belong in energy legislation and question the pollution levels from oil and gas construction compared to other activities regulated by the EPA. $500 million is authorized for pollution control projects over FY2006-FY2010, with an additional $2.5 billion for various emissions control measures.

Additional authorizations totaling $2.5 billion over FY2007-FY2013 would be provided for projects using coal-based electrical generation equipment and processes, and associated environmental control equipment. Project selection criteria would be based on significantly improving air quality, replacing less efficient units, and improving thermal efficiency. Up to 25% of projects would be cogeneration or other gasification projects. At least 25% of the projects would be solely for electrical generation, with priority for those generating less than 600 MW. Federal loans or loan guarantees would not exceed 30% of the total funds obligated during any fiscal year. The federal share of projects funded would not exceed 50%. No technology funded by the program, or level of emissions reduction achieved by funded projects, would be considered adequately demonstrated for purposes of Sections 111, 169, or 171 of the Clean Air Act. Under Price-Anderson, commercial reactor owners must assume all liability for nuclear damages awarded to the public, waive legal defenses after a severe radioactive release, and carry financial protection up to $300 million. Damages exceeding this amount are shared among reactors, with retrospective premiums capped at $95.8 million per reactor. These payments are limited to $10 million annually per reactor to ease financial burden post-accident. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission requires commercial reactor owners to have insurance coverage up to $300 million. In the event of a major nuclear incident, the total potential compensation from all covered reactors would be around $10.7 billion, with a 5% surcharge per reactor. The liability for an incident is capped at this amount under the Price-Anderson Act. The Price-Anderson Act provides liability limits for nuclear incidents, with an inflation adjustment every five years. Congressional approval is required for damages exceeding the limit. The Act also covers contractors at hazardous DOE nuclear facilities, with the same liability limit as commercial reactors. DOE can indemnify contractors for damages, funded by the U.S. Treasury. The Price-Anderson Act establishes liability limits for nuclear incidents, with fines for safety violations and criminal penalties for violations. Non-profit DOE contractors are exempt from certain penalties. The Act has been crucial for the nuclear power industry, providing compensation for accident victims while critics argue it subsidizes the industry. The Price-Anderson Act protects the nuclear power industry from financial consequences of accidents. While missing the deadline for extension has little immediate impact, utilities are considering building new reactors, which would require Price-Anderson coverage. A lapse in Price-Anderson would affect DOE nuclear facility contracts, requiring alternate indemnification authority. The bills passed by the House and Senate include provisions for FERC to establish regional advisory bodies if requested by two-thirds of states in a region with over half their electric load served within that region. The House and Senate passed bills include provisions for FERC to establish regional advisory bodies composed of one member from each participating state in a region with over half their electric load served within that region. The advisory body would provide advice on reliability standards, proposed regional entities, fees, and other responsibilities requested by FERC. The bills also authorize the state of New York to develop rules for greater reliability as long as neighboring states are not negatively impacted. Both versions of the bill require the ERO to be funded through contributions from its utility members, which the CBO determined to be an unfunded mandate. The House-passed H.R. 6 would limit the total amount of dues, fees, and charges collected by the ERO to $50,000,000 annually through 2015. This limit aims to avoid a budget resolution point of order and restricts the cost of the mandate to avoid UMRA considerations. It is unclear if the limit applies to U.S. and Canadian utilities or just U.S. utilities' contributions. The 2005 budget for NERC and its regional entities is $51,950,000, with munis contributing $6,370,000. The ERO would have new functions, including imposing and collecting penalties. The CBO estimated that complying with intergovernmental mandates could exceed the threshold established in UMRA. The House-passed legislation authorizes up to $50 million per year for activities related to the Federal Power Act and the ERO. The bill aims to provide federal jurisdiction over activities supporting the reliability of the U.S. bulk power system. It is unclear if FERC would be the sole recipient of the annual authorization, as the ERO is not considered a government entity. The curr_chunk discusses the proposal to give FERC authority over the ERO to improve reliability in the U.S. bulk power system. Advocates believe central jurisdiction would increase accountability, with FERC being responsible for enforcing penalties for non-compliance with reliability standards. This new relationship could enhance coordination between market and reliability functions. Despite general support, there is minor opposition to granting FERC jurisdiction. Opposition to proposal giving FERC jurisdiction over bulk power system reliability focuses on FERC's lack of experience in this area. Concerns include reliance on ERO for expertise and uncertainty in institutional changes. Commissioners from 15 states argue that the proposal infringes on state authority. State regulators from 22 states and the District of Columbia also express opposition. Several states and industry groups support FERC's efforts to address discrimination in the interstate transmission system for a competitive power market. FERC released a White Paper in response to concerns about the implementation of SMD, clarifying that utilities would be required to join an RTO or ISO instead of an Independent Transmission Provider. The final rule will not assert new FERC jurisdiction over bundled retail sales, eliminating the requirement for a minimum level of resource adequacy and auctioning Firm Transmission Rights. Each RTO or ISO must have a cost recovery policy, with phased implementation to address regional differences. The Department of Energy analyzed the impact of SMDNOPR on electricity prices and the safety of generation and transmission facilities. DOE used economic models to analyze price impacts, assuming a 1.8% annual increase in electricity demand and 15% reserve margins in most regions. The report did not include changes from FERC's White Paper in its analysis. The Department of Energy analyzed the impact of SMDNOPR on electricity prices and the safety of generation and transmission facilities. DOE assumed a 2% to 4% higher generator efficiency for fossil steam plants in new RTO regions with SMD. In the non-SMD case, models did not consider freezes on retail rates or increased transmission capacity. Under the SMD case, a 5% increase in transmission capability by 2005 is assumed, leading to potential savings from control area consolidation and improved market design. DOE estimates a 10% savings from efficiency improvements. DOE estimates a 10% savings from efficiency improvements in the SMD rule, with a median cost of $760 million per year. Costs vary by region, ranging from 47 cents to 12 cents per megawatt-hour. The impact on retail rates depends on state regulations, with some regions facing increased costs passed on to customers. The DOE projects that electricity exports will lead to lower retail prices in some regions with cost-based rates, while regions with retail choice may see higher market-clearing prices. California is expected to have lower wholesale prices and consumer prices due to increased imports. The net benefit for all consumers is estimated to be $1 billion per year over the first six years, decreasing to $700 million per year from 2016-2020. The net benefit of electricity exports is projected to be about $700 million per year. Retail prices will vary by region, with the mid-Atlantic region seeing a 4% decrease, while Illinois, Wisconsin, and Arizona are expected to have a 3% increase. The Fuel Use Act of 1978 (FUA) allowed qualifying facilities (QFs) to take advantage of natural gas and new generating technology, lowering the financial threshold for entering the electricity generation business. The Fuel Use Act of 1978 (FUA) allowed qualifying facilities (QFs) to enter the electricity generation business. FUA was repealed in 1987, leading to a shift towards market-based rates for wholesale transactions. This change marked a movement towards a market-oriented approach to electricity supply, raising questions about encouraging nonutility generation and allowing utilities to diversify into non-regulated activities. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 removed regulatory barriers for entry into electricity generation to increase competition. However, it does not allow FERC to mandate retail wheeling, which remains under state jurisdiction. PURPA shifted regulatory responsibilities to the federal government, creating new options for utilities and regulators to meet electricity demand. Proponents of PURPA repeal argue that state regulators' implementation in the early 1980s forced them to pay high prices. The PURPA Reform Group supports repealing \u00a7210 of PURPA, arguing that the mandatory purchase obligation is outdated and anti-competitive. Opponents, including independent power producers and environmental groups, argue that PURPA promotes competition and cleaner energy sources in the electric generating sector. Opponents of repealing \u00a7210 of PURPA argue that it would decrease competition, impede renewable energy development, result in utility monopoly control, and limit state regulators' jurisdiction. The electric industry historically operated as a natural monopoly with high investment thresholds and limited entrants. Unified control of generation, transmission, and distribution is seen as efficient, with most people served by vertically integrated utilities. The electric utility industry has evolved, leading to a belief that market forces can replace traditional economic regulatory structures. Evidence shows that vertical integration is not necessary for efficient electric service, with independent firms now able to provide generating capacity. The Public Utility Holding Company Act and the Federal Power Act established regulations for electric utilities. The Public Utility Regulatory Act established regulations for electric utilities, with states and the federal government having specific powers. Utilities must provide electricity at regulated rates in exchange for exclusive franchise service territories. State regulatory commissions oversee intrastate utility activities, including rate-making. State authority varies, with some regulating retail rates only, while others oversee multiple aspects of utility operations. The primary mission of state regulators is to establish retail electric prices through an adversarial hearing process. Federal economic regulation under the FPA addresses wholesale transactions and rates for electric power in interstate commerce, filling the regulatory vacuum left by states' inability to regulate interstate commerce. FERC has the principal functions at the federal level for economic regulation of the electric utility industry, including wholesale rate regulation and financial transactions. The SEC regulates utilities' corporate structure and business ventures under PUHCA to prevent abusive practices. The electric utility industry has shifted towards small-scale production facilities due to improved technologies and reduced costs. The SEC regulates utilities under PUHCA to prevent abusive practices and ensure economic efficiency. Electric utilities argue for diversification to improve risk profile and resource utilization. Holding companies seek reform to allow acquisition of securities and utility assets for better use of under-utilized resources. Some utility holding companies exempt from SEC regulation argue against PUHCA, claiming it discourages diversification. There has been bipartisan support for repealing parts of PUHCA since the 1980s, but after Enron's collapse, Congress has reconsidered significant amendments. Enron's exemption from PUHCA was denied by the SEC in 2003. State regulators have expressed concerns about increased diversification leading to potential abuses, such as cross-subsidization. This practice involves a regulated company subsidizing an unregulated affiliate, which was a major argument against exempt wholesale generators (EWGs) and is now being used against further PUHCA changes. Non-utility ventures resulting from diversification by electric and gas companies could benefit from regulated utilities' allowed rate of return, but unsuccessful ventures could harm the entire holding company, including utility subsidiaries. Opponents fear that utilities may not be adequately protected in this scenario. In 2002, a 24-mile 330-megawatt transmission cable was installed beneath Long Island Sound between Connecticut and Long Island. The cable was not buried to specified depths in some areas, leading to objections from the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (CDEP). CDEP denied operation of the cable unless it met permit requirements. In 2003, Cross-Sound filed a new permit application with CDEP, but Governor John Rowland signed a law prohibiting permits for certain infrastructure crossings. In response to a blackout, an emergency order was issued to energize the cross-sound cable, which was later rescinded. LIPA and Cross-Sound petitioned FERC to re-energize the cable by July 1, 2004, leading to a settlement agreement on June 25, 2004. The parties reached an agreement to re-energize the cross-sound cable on June 25, 2004, after an emergency order was issued in response to a blackout. The consistency provisions in Section 307 of the CZMA have caused friction between states and federal agencies over the years regarding the reach of these provisions. States have sought broader application while the federal government has pushed for narrower interpretations, especially concerning offshore energy development. The exact boundary separating state powers in decision-making has been a subject of federal appeals. The federal appeals and litigation over state powers in decision-making, particularly regarding offshore energy development, have been ongoing. The process for resolving disagreements between states and federal agencies includes an appeal to the Secretary of Commerce. Only a few appeals have been made to the Secretary in the past. The appeals process for consistency determinations, covered under a final rule issued by NOAA in 2000, has been contentious with delays addressed by 1996 amendments in Section 319. The Secretary must issue a final decision within 45 days if no decision is reached within 90 days after the record has closed. The 1996 amendments in Section 319 aimed to address delays in the appeals process for consistency determinations. Some seek additional statutory language to define deadlines and remove decisions from the rulemaking process. The consistency provision allows states to halt federal actions that conflict with state interests, incentivizing the development of coastal plans. 34 out of 35 eligible states and territories are now administering federally approved coastal management programs. The most recent efforts involve allocating federal offshore oil and gas revenues to coastal states to address impacts. Congress considered similar proposals known as CARA, with the House passing a version in 2000. Support for CARA grew as budget deficits turned into surpluses, funding federal natural resource protection programs. Since the early and mid-1990s, there has been a shift from budget deficits to surplus forecasts, with a focus on protecting natural resources to combat sprawl. Efforts to secure federal funding for coastal resource protection have increased. However, support for wide-ranging legislation like CARA has declined due to changing national priorities post-9/11. Interest remains in redirecting offshore oil and gas revenues to areas affected by offshore activity."
