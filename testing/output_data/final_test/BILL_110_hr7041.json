    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Laboratory Surge Capacity Preparedness Act\". The Congress has invested over $250,000,000 in constructing regional biocontainment laboratories (RBLs) through grants from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. These labs serve to support research for drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics for emerging infections and biological threats, as well as provide surge capacity for public emergency response to bioterrorism. The Federal Government has funded the construction of regional biocontainment laboratories (RBLs) to support research for emerging infections and biological threats. However, operational support for these labs to fulfill their surge capacity mission is lacking, potentially hindering the response to large-scale bioterrorism events. The network of RBLs will collectively provide over 52,000 square feet of laboratory space during national emergencies. The regional biocontainment laboratories (RBLs) are equipped to handle select agent pathogens and conduct diagnostic testing in a secure BSL3 setting. Each facility has highly trained personnel with Department of Justice clearance and can maintain chain of custody requirements for specimen processing. The labs were designed with multiple laboratory suites to handle multiple airborne pathogens simultaneously without the risk of cross-contamination. The regional biocontainment laboratories (RBLs) are crucial for threat assessment research and have the support of leading bioterrorism experts. The House Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee recognizes the importance of RBLs and calls for federal funding to preserve these facilities for responding to bioterrorism and pandemics. SEC. 3. LABORATORY SURGE CAPACITY. The Secretary of Homeland Security will award grants to regional biocontainment laboratories for maintaining surge capacity to respond to bioterrorism or infectious disease outbreaks. The amount of the grant is based on the costs incurred by the laboratory for surge capacity. Inspections of the laboratory facilities by the Secretary and other relevant Federal agencies are required for grant eligibility. Regional biocontainment laboratories are defined as the 13 laboratories funded through the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The Secretary of Homeland Security will award grants to regional biocontainment laboratories for surge capacity in response to bioterrorism or infectious disease outbreaks. The grants are based on incurred costs, with inspections required for eligibility. Funding amounts authorized for fiscal years 2009-2011 are $21.5 million, $23.5 million, and $26 million respectively. The Secretary of Homeland Security will report to Congress on integrating regional biocontainment laboratories with the CDC's network and the need for additional BSL3 laboratories for national surge capacity."
