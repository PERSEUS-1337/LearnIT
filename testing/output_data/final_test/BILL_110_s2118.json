It includes provisions for formula grants to state educational agencies, state grant applications, information dissemination, and defines research-proven programs. The Act introduces research-proven programs and competitive grants in education. Competitive preference points may be awarded to agencies proposing to use research-proven programs. It also amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to include research-proven reading programs. Formula grants to state educational agencies are outlined. Section 1202 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include competitive preference points for using research-proven reading programs in subgrants to local educational agencies. The Act emphasizes the importance of research-proven programs in education. In amending Section 1202 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, competitive preference points are added for utilizing research-proven reading programs in subgrants to local educational agencies. The emphasis is on the importance of research-proven programs in education. SEC. 203. STATE FORMULA GRANT APPLICATIONS. Section 1203 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to focus on research-proven reading programs in instructional materials and approaches for teaching reading to children and adults.
