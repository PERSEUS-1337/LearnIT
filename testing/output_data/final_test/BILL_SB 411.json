    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 69 of the Penal Code is amended to increase penalties for obstructing or resisting an executive officer in the performance of their duties. Taking a photograph or recording of an officer in a public place is not considered a violation. Section 148 of the Penal Code is also amended. Section 148 of the Penal Code is amended to increase penalties for willfully resisting, delaying, or obstructing public officers, peace officers, or emergency medical technicians in the discharge of their duties. Maliciously interfering with public safety radio frequencies is also punishable by fine or imprisonment. During the commission of an offense, removing a weapon other than a firearm from a public officer or peace officer results in up to one year in county jail. Removing a firearm leads to imprisonment according to Section 1170. Removing or attempting to take a firearm from a public officer or peace officer while they are on duty is punishable by up to one year in county jail or imprisonment under Section 1170. The prosecution must prove specific intent by showing acts such as unfastening the officer's holster strap or releasing the firearm safety. The defendant's actions in relation to the firearm included attempting to remove it, touching it, trying to take it away from an officer, having their fingerprint on it, and attempting to pick it up after it fell during a struggle. These actions were corroborated by independent witnesses and scientifically verified physical evidence. (e) A person cannot be convicted of resisting a public officer in addition to other violations if the resistance and weapon removal were against the same officer. Multiple convictions are possible if there are multiple victims. (f) This section does not apply if the officer is disarmed during a criminal act. Taking a photograph or recording of a public officer in a public place or where allowed does not automatically constitute a violation or give reason to detain or arrest the person."
