    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Article 4.5 of the Right to Try Act in the Health and Safety Code defines the terms \"Consulting physician\" and \"Eligible patient\" for the purpose of the act. An \"eligible patient\" under the Right to Try Act must have a life-threatening disease, exhausted all FDA-approved treatment options, not accepted into a clinical trial, and have recommendations from primary and consulting physicians for an investigational drug. The Right to Try Act defines an \"eligible patient\" as someone with a life-threatening disease, who has exhausted all FDA-approved treatments, not in a clinical trial, and has recommendations from primary and consulting physicians for an investigational drug. The Act also requires written informed consent from the patient or their legally authorized representative, documentation from physicians, and defines terms like \"health benefit plan\" and \"immediately life-threatening disease or condition.\" The Right to Try Act defines terms like \"investigational drug, biological product, or device,\" \"primary physician,\" and \"state regulatory board\" in relation to patients with life-threatening diseases seeking experimental treatments. Written, informed consent for experimental treatments must be approved by the primary physician's institutional review board, signed by the patient or their legal representative, and attested to by the physician and a witness. It includes explaining approved treatments for the life-threatening disease and confirming that conventional treatments are unlikely to prolong the patient's life. The patient seeking to use an investigational drug must be informed of the potential outcomes, including new symptoms or hastened death. It should be clearly stated that the health benefit plan and healthcare provider are not obligated to cover the costs of the treatment. The patient's eligibility for hospice care may be withdrawn if curative treatment begins, and in-home health care may be denied. The patient is liable for all expenses related to investigational drugs, with consent requirements aligned with the Protection of Human Subjects in Medical Experimentation Act. (a) A manufacturer of an investigational drug, biological product, or device can provide it to an eligible patient without compensation. The patient may be required to pay for the costs associated with the manufacture of the investigational product. This article does not expand coverage provided under specific codes. If a clinical trial for an investigational drug, biological product, or device is closed due to lack of efficacy or toxicity, it cannot be offered. Patients taking these investigational products outside of a trial must be notified by the manufacturer and their primary physician if the trial is closed. If an eligible patient dies during treatment with an investigational drug, their heirs and health benefit plan are not liable for any outstanding debt related to the treatment. A state regulatory board cannot take disciplinary action against a physician for recommending or prescribing an investigational product approved by an institutional review board. The physician's institutional review board must report biannually to state health departments and medical boards on requests for investigational drugs, treatment status, duration, costs, treatment outcomes, and adverse events. State agencies cannot change recommendations to CMS based solely on a healthcare provider's suggestion for a patient to access investigational drugs. Violations of this rule are not subject to Section 111825. This article prohibits civil, criminal, or disciplinary claims against manufacturers of investigational drugs or devices if they have complied with the terms of the article in relation to the patient, unless there was a failure to exercise reasonable care."
