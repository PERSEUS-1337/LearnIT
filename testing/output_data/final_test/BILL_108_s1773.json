    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Biotechnology Future Investment Expansion Act of 2003\". Congress finds that American bioscience research corporations play a crucial role in developing breakthrough medical technologies, linking scientific discovery to biomedical products. Encouraging long-term research projects is essential for maintaining American competitiveness and addressing critical social needs, even if they may not lead to significant profits. Biomedical research companies face challenges such as long-term research, regulatory reviews, and financial constraints. They operate in research-intensive and capital-intensive environments, often lacking internal cash flow and stability. The long-term commercial bioscience research industry heavily relies on external equity capital due to long lead times and high scientific and regulatory risks. Government support and tax incentives are crucial for sustaining breakthrough research in this sector. American bioscience research companies are a vital commercial sector recognized by Congress. The current Federal income tax incentives are not effective for many bioscience companies focused on breakthrough medical technologies. High technology bioscience companies often experience net operating losses for a decade or more during their research and development phases, leading to no immediate benefit from these incentives. Additionally, Federal tax rules aimed at preventing corporate loss trafficking and tax-motivated mergers penalize these companies. Raising private capital through equity financings triggers severe limitations on tax incentives for biomedical research companies, favoring large profitable companies over long-term breakthrough technologies. This puts long-term bioscience research companies at a disadvantage in benefiting from Federal income tax incentives. The purpose of this Act is to ensure that long-term biomedical research corporations are not disadvantaged in the capital marketplace due to limitations on research-related tax incentives. The tax system should be non-discriminatory to provide equal cost-reducing impact on companies conducting short-term and long-term research. This will minimize distortions in the capital marketplace caused by differences in tax and income status. SEC. 3. RESTORING TAX INCENTIVES FOR BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH AND CLINICAL TRIALS. The amendment to section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code allows for certain financing transactions of biomedical research corporations to be treated differently for tax purposes if they involve a 5% shareholder and a qualified investment during the testing period. The term 'biomedical research corporation' is defined within this context. Qualified investment for tax purposes involves a domestic corporation not in bankruptcy holding rights to a drug under clinical investigation in phase II or III. Qualified investment for tax purposes involves acquiring stock in a biomedical research corporation at its original issue in exchange for cash, including stock issued in exchange for convertible debt. Acquiring convertible debt at original issue solely for cash must meet requirements separately at time of investment and conversion for stock. Biomedical research corporation must pass 5-year expenditure test for any qualified investment. The paragraph outlines requirements for a qualified investment in a biomedical research corporation, including the expenditure test for each year of the measuring period and definitions for terms like measuring period and clinical testing. The term 'clinical testing' refers to human testing under an investigational new drug application. Rules similar to section 1202(c)(3) apply to qualified investments, with 'stock acquired in a qualified investment' replacing 'qualified small business stock'. Other transactions between biomedical research corporations and investors making qualified investments are also addressed. During the 2-year period around a qualified investment, if a biomedical research corporation engages in a transaction with a member of its investment group and receives non-cash consideration, there is a presumption that stock received was not solely in exchange for cash. The term 'qualified investment group' refers to investors making qualified investments. The term 'qualified investment group' refers to persons who receive stock in exchange for a qualified investment, including related persons as defined by tax regulations. The Secretary will exempt certain transactions in the bioscience research industry from this rule if they are customary and of minor value. Proceeds from qualified investments must be used for research on preexisting technology. The paragraph exempts qualified investments in biomedical research corporations from certain restrictions if the net proceeds are within specified limits based on qualifying clinical expenditures. The paragraph exempts qualified investments in biomedical research corporations from restrictions based on qualifying clinical expenditures, which are amounts paid for clinical testing in connection with a drug or biologic with an investigational new drug application. The paragraph exempts qualified investments in biomedical research corporations from restrictions on qualifying clinical expenditures. The Secretary may issue regulations to prevent abuse and provide consistent treatment under specific code sections. Equity investment proceeds are not considered working capital if used within 3 years for qualifying clinical expenditures. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2002."
