    "content": "The \"Export Promotion Act\" may be cited as the short title of this legislation. The findings section highlights key points related to export promotion. The Export Promotion Act acknowledges the importance of exports to the US economy, with 11.6 million jobs supported by exports. Despite export growth since 2010, goals set by the Administration have not been met. Federal assistance is crucial for small and mid-size businesses to access new markets. Numerous resources are available at Federal agencies for companies looking to export. Federal agencies such as the Department of Agriculture, Small Business Administration, and Export-Import Bank offer programs for technical assistance, financing, and market development for US companies. However, there is significant overlap among agencies, leading to confusion, inefficiency, and difficulty in tracking the success of export promotion efforts. The U.S. Government Accountability Office found shortcomings in Federal export assistance programs, including lack of collaboration, communication, and coordination among agencies. Significant changes are needed to maintain global economic competitiveness for small businesses. By consolidating functions of multiple Federal agencies into the new Export Promotion Agency in the Department of Commerce, small- and mid-size businesses can utilize a one-stop-shop for export assistance, reducing waste, improving access to information, and cutting bureaucracy. The new Export Promotion Agency in the Department of Commerce aims to streamline export assistance for small- and mid-size businesses by cutting bureaucracy and improving coordination with other agencies like the Trade and Development Agency and the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
