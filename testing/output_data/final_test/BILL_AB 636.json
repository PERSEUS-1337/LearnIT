    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 67380 of the Education Code is amended to require educational institutions to compile records of campus crimes involving violence, hate violence, theft, destruction of property, illegal drugs, or alcohol intoxication. All noncriminal acts of hate violence on campus must be reported and documented by designated authorities. Written records must include a description of the act, victim and offender characteristics. Information on crimes must be made available within two business days upon request by students, employees, or applicants. Victim information for specific crimes cannot be disclosed without permission. The campus police, security personnel, and safety authorities are considered part of state or local law enforcement agencies for the purpose of disclosing crime information. Campus officials must prepare, post, and distribute a campus safety plan detailing security personnel availability, summoning methods, special safeguards, recent safety improvements, and upcoming safety changes. Distribution can be done through student handbooks or brochures. The appropriate officials at each campus must report hate violence information to the governing board, who will compile and transmit a report to the Legislative Analyst's Office annually by January 1. The report will be made public on the institution's website. The University of California and other public-funded educational institutions must establish guidelines for identifying and reporting hate violence, in consultation with relevant organizations. The guidelines should be consistent with each other and reported annually to the Legislative Analyst's Office. The University of California and other public-funded educational institutions must establish guidelines for reporting violent crimes, sexual assaults, and hate crimes to local law enforcement without victim identification unless consent is given. The institution must disclose the identity of the alleged assailant to the local law enforcement agency and inform the victim if certain conditions are met. The institution must disclose the identity of the alleged assailant to the local law enforcement agency if they pose a threat to safety. This requirement does not waive confidentiality laws and applies to participation in the Cal Grant Program. Refusal to provide information can result in a civil action for damages up to $1,000. In this section, \"hate violence\" is defined as any physical intimidation, harassment, force, or threat directed at a person or group based on ethnicity, race, religion, etc. \"Part 1 violent crime\" includes homicide, rape, robbery, and assault. \"Sexual assault\" encompasses various acts like rape, sodomy, and sexual battery. This section exempts private postsecondary institutions with less than 1,000 students and applies to public postsecondary campuses with over 1,000 students. It does not apply to California Community Colleges unless funds are allocated by the Legislature."
