    "content": "Taiwan, officially known as the Republic of China (ROC), traces its political lineage to the ROC established in 1912 after the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty in China. The ROC celebrates its national day on October 10, known as \"Double Ten,\" but does not recognize the People's Republic of China (PRC) founded in 1949. The PRC claims Taiwan as a province of \"one China\" and seeks unification without renouncing the use of force. Since 1949, the ROC has governed only Taiwan, while the PRC governs the mainland. Since 1949, the ROC has governed only Taiwan, while the PRC rules mainland China. Taiwan, previously called Formosa, has never been ruled by the CPC or as part of the PRC. The ROC claimed \"recovering\" Formosa from Japan on October 25, 1945, after Japan's surrender. The ROC's military forces first occupied the island at that time. The ROC did not exist when the Qing Empire ceded Formosa to Japan in 1895. The KMT contends that the ROC claimed Formosa at Japan's surrender in 1945, with no country challenging its status. The ROC under KMT forces retreated to Taipei in 1949 when Communist forces took over mainland China. Taiwan faces social, ethnic, linguistic, and political issues regarding identity with Taiwan or China. The United States recognized the ROC until 1978, then shifted recognition to the PRC under the \"one China\" policy. The Taiwan Relations Act has governed policy toward Taiwan since 1979. Since 1979, the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), P.L. 96-8, has governed policy toward Taiwan, focusing on the U.S. \"one China\" policy and congressional influence. The evolution of policies is reviewed in relation to legislation and key statements by Washington, Beijing, and Taipei. Tensions across the Taiwan Strait impact international security, U.S.-Taiwan engagement, and U.S.-PRC contacts. In the 1990s, questions about the \"one China\" policy arose after Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui characterized cross-strait relations as \"special state-to-state ties\" in 1999. Beijing opposed this deviation and threatened to use force to prevent Taiwan's independence. The Clinton Administration reaffirmed the \"one China\" policy but some questioned if the TRA requires U.S. defense of Taiwan against PLA attacks. Senator Jesse Helms criticized Lee's statement. Some congressional leaders criticized the \"one China\" policy and emphasized support for Taiwan as a democracy. They expressed concerns about tensions between Beijing and Taipei. Some congressional leaders, including Senator Richard Lugar and Representative Henry Hyde, voiced concerns about cross-strait tension between Beijing and Taipei. Lugar emphasized the need for a peaceful unification plan between Taiwan and China, while Hyde highlighted U.S. support for Taiwan as a democracy and a model of Chinese democracy. Hyde emphasized Taiwan's importance as a model of \"Chinese democracy\" and its compatibility with Chinese culture. U.S. views were influenced by Taiwan's developments and concerns about cross-strait tension. President Chen Shui-bian's speech in 2002, advocating for \"one country on each side\" of the strait, surprised Washington. Leading up to the 2004 presidential election, Chen proposed referendums and a new constitution, alarming Beijing. Premier Wen Jiabao warned of safeguarding China's unity, and Chen announced a provision before his visit to Washington. President Chen announced a referendum on China's threats during the presidential election, drawing criticism from President Bush for changing the status quo. The Taiwan Caucus criticized Bush for siding with Beijing over Taiwan's democratic reforms. The House International Relations Committee held a hearing on Taiwan's 25th TRA anniversary, clarifying U.S. policy and warning of limitations in support for constitutional changes in Taiwan. At a hearing on the TRA, Representative James Leach emphasized Taiwan's unique situation and the importance of maintaining political ambiguity for security. He praised President Chen's address as thoughtful and statesmanlike, excluding sovereignty issues and a referendum from his plan for a new constitution by 2008. Leach represented the United States at Chen's inauguration, highlighting the contribution of the TRA to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. On June 2, 2004, Leach praised Chen's address as \"thoughtful, statesmanlike, and helpful\" for dialogue with Beijing. The House reaffirmed commitment to the TRA on April 10, 2004. Concerns were raised in Congress about reducing tensions across the strait. China's \"Anti-Secession Law\" in March 2005 led to grave concern expressed by the House in March 2005. Hearings were held on the law in April 2005. President Chen announced the termination of the National Unification Council and Guidelines in February 2006. In March 2006, Senator John Warner expressed doubts about full U.S. support for Taiwan in case of conflict due to Taiwanese politics. In July 2007, Representative Tom Lantos deemed Taiwan's U.N. membership impractical. After Ma Ying-jeou became president in May 2008, cross-strait tensions eased, leading to closer Taiwan-PRC relations and strengthened U.S.-Taiwan engagement. Congressional concerns persisted. After Ma Ying-jeou became president in May 2008, U.S.-Taiwan engagement strengthened. Congressional concerns focused on enhancing political, defense, and economic cooperation to support U.S. interests in Taiwan's security, democracy, and prosperity. Key events included the House passing H.Con.Res. 55 in 2009 and hearings on \"Why Taiwan Matters\" in 2011, emphasizing adherence to President Reagan's Six Assurances. Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell reaffirmed these assurances during his testimony. The Administration and Congress supported Taiwan's inclusion in the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) and passed legislation for Taiwan's participation in the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Legislation was introduced to obtain observer status for Taiwan at ICAO. H.R. 1151 (Royce) became law on July 12, 2013. Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen introduced the Taiwan Policy Act (H.R. 2918) to enhance ties with Taiwan. On April 7, 2014, the House passed H.R. 3470 affirming the Taiwan Relations Act and authorizing the sale of U.S. Navy frigates to Taiwan. Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Russel clarified the Administration's commitment to the Six Assurances, TRA, and Joint Communiques. On April 9, 52 Senators sent a letter to President Obama regarding the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) and the potential sale of U.S. Navy frigates to Taiwan. There are debates on whether to review U.S. policy towards Taiwan due to changes since 1994. Some argue for expanded cooperation with China, while others believe restrictions on Taiwan relations undermine U.S. interests. The overall issue is whether to further normalize the relationship. The issue at hand is whether to pursue further normalization of the relationship and expand engagement with Taiwan in defense, diplomatic, and economic domains. Congress may review State Department restrictions on contacts with Taiwan officials and consider resuming visits by Cabinet-rank officials. Representative Ed Royce and 29 Members called for expanding engagement with Taiwan, citing its free and democratic status. The State Department acknowledged the need for a new Taiwan Policy Review to enhance relations with Taiwan and promote peace and stability in the region. This includes maintaining commercial, cultural, and other ties with Taiwan's people under the TRA. The Department's letter referenced the \"one China\" policy but did not mention specific ways to improve cooperation. The Obama Administration's strategic \"rebalancing\" to the Asia-Pacific raised questions about Taiwan's roles in the region. The Obama Administration's strategic \"rebalancing\" to the Asia-Pacific raised issues about Taiwan's security role in the region. Assistant Secretary of State Campbell emphasized the importance of building a strong relationship with Taiwan, highlighting its security partnership with the United States. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also recognized Taiwan as an important security and economic partner during a speech in Honolulu. The United States considers Taiwan an important security and economic partner. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta expressed support for improving cross-strait relations. Congress has played a significant role in overseeing the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979. US interests in Taiwan's security and democracy have faced challenges due to China's military modernization. Since 2000, Taiwan's security and democracy have been challenged by China's military modernization and political polarization. The United States aims to promote sustainable stability, U.S.-PRC engagement, Taiwan's democracy, and economic ties with Taiwan while seeking a peaceful resolution to the Taiwan dispute. However, partisan politics in Taiwan has limited U.S. leverage in advancing its priorities. The KMT and DPP in Taipei have dealt with disputes with the CPC in Beijing over Taiwan's status and cross-strait ties. U.S. policy on Taiwan is guided by key documents such as the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) since 1979, providing a firm foundation for the relationship. Despite consistent statements since World War II, the \"one China\" question remains ambiguous among Washington, Beijing, and Taipei. The concept of \"one China\" remains ambiguous among Washington, Beijing, and Taipei, complicated by the co-existence of the PRC and ROC since 1949. Taiwan, a democracy since 1986, has a new basis for government legitimacy. The strategic rationale for U.S.-PRC relations has changed since the end of the Cold War. In 2000, Chen Shui-bian of the DPP became President of the ROC, ending 55 years of KMT rule in Taiwan. The DPP became the ruling party in Taiwan for the first time in 55 years, emphasizing the name \"Taiwan\" over \"ROC.\" The KMT, in 2008, focused on \"ROC\" and sought closer ties with mainland China. The first formal meeting between officials in charge of cross-strait affairs took place in 2014. There are complications regarding the definition of \"China\" in key statements, with the PRC never ruling Taiwan. Deng Xiaoping's 1984 proposal of \"one China, two systems\" further complicates the situation. The PRC's Deng Xiaoping proposed \"one China, two systems\" for Taiwan's status. Disagreement exists on whether Taiwan's status is resolved. Nixon assured Taiwan's status as part of one China in 1972. The PRC claimed the Taiwan question was resolved in 1978, but the US expected a peaceful settlement. The Taiwan question is expected to be settled peacefully by the Chinese themselves, as per the TRA of 1979 and President Reagan's 1982 statement. The US policy emphasizes a peaceful \"settlement\" or \"resolution\" of the Taiwan question, leaving it open for determination without specifying \"unification\" or \"reunification.\" Congress has supported self-determination for the people of Taiwan without determining its final destiny. The Taiwan question is left open for peaceful resolution by both sides of the strait, without involvement of the United Nations or other countries. The US emphasizes a peaceful settlement but key issues like PRC's use of force, US arms sales to Taiwan, and US help in Taiwan's defense remain contentious. Washington has not promised to end arms sales to Taiwan despite terminating the Mutual Defense Treaty in 1979. The United States terminated the Mutual Defense Treaty with Taiwan in 1979. In response, the US expressed interest in a peaceful resolution regarding Taiwan, while the PRC asserted that Taiwan is an internal affair of China. President Reagan agreed to reduce arms sales to Taiwan in the 1982 Communique, based on the PRC's policy of peaceful unification. The US is committed to providing defense articles and services to Taiwan for self-defense, and will view any non-peaceful means to determine Taiwan's future with grave concern. There has been ongoing debate on deterring conflict in the Taiwan Strait since the mid-1990s. A debate has emerged on how to prevent conflict in the Taiwan Strait, focusing on the ambiguity or clarity of U.S. statements regarding a potential military role. Questions persist about clarifying U.S. intentions for defending Taiwan and its stance on Taiwan's sovereignty. Policy discussions also revolve around the extent of the U.S. defense commitment to Taiwan, considering past actions and Taiwan's self-defense capabilities. The debate over the \"one China\" policy has raised questions about changes in U.S. stance since 1971 and its alignment with U.S. interests. There are differing views on whether policy shifts have occurred and if any aspects should be reviewed. The policy covers sovereignty, use of force, and cross-strait dialogue, with concerns about Taiwan's status, unification vs. independence, referendums, and international involvement. The U.S. position on \"one China\" differs from the PRC's principle, leading to discussions on potential modifications. U.S. policy on Taiwan emphasizes the process of peaceful resolution and cross-strait dialogue, rather than focusing on outcomes like unification or independence. Taiwan asserts its sovereignty and seeks international recognition, while the status of Taiwan remains undetermined according to the State Department. The State Department states that sovereignty over Taiwan and the Pescadores is unsettled and subject to future international resolution. Both the Republic of China and Chinese Communists claim these areas as part of China. The United States recognizes the Republic of China's jurisdiction over Taiwan and the Pescadores, but Nixon's talks with China in 1972 hinted at promises regarding Taiwan beyond official statements. Nixon's promises regarding Taiwan during talks with China in 1972 included no U.S. support for Taiwan independence and recognition of Taiwan as part of China. The United States did not explicitly state its position on Taiwan's status in the U.S.-PRC Joint Communiques. The Nixon Administration acknowledged in 1972 that Taiwan is a part of China, and the United States did not challenge this position. Subsequent U.S.-PRC Joint Communiques in 1979 and 1982 also acknowledged the Chinese position of one China including Taiwan. President Reagan's statement emphasized that the Taiwan question should be resolved by the Chinese people. The Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) did not address the \"one China\" concept. After the Taiwan Policy Review, the United States acknowledged the Chinese position on one China since 1978. Some argue that the US has adopted the PRC's \"one China\" principle instead of maintaining neutrality. Senator John Glenn criticized the Carter and Reagan Administrations for recognizing the PRC's claim to Taiwan in the 1979 joint communique. The key phrase \"all Chinese on either side of the\" was dropped, shifting the US acknowledgment to the Chinese position of one China. The United States has shifted its position to acknowledge the Chinese assertion of one China, dropping key phrases and implicitly indicating that Taiwan is part of that one China. This change in policy was prompted by threats from China to downgrade relations unless arms sales to Taiwan were ended. President Reagan assured China that the US policy is based on the principle of one China. The U.S. policy towards China and Taiwan has significantly changed in the last 10 years, with the current stance being that there is only one China. President Clinton's 1995 letter to PRC President Jiang Zemin outlined opposition to Taiwan independence and support for a unified China. This shift in policy contradicted previous assurances from the State Department. The U.S. policy towards China and Taiwan has evolved over the years, with a shift towards supporting a unified China and opposing Taiwan independence. This stance was reinforced in a joint statement during the 1997 Clinton-Jiang summit, emphasizing adherence to the 'one China' policy and the principles of the three U.S.-China joint communiques. The letter from President Clinton to PRC President Jiang Zemin in 1995 marked a departure from previous assurances and set the foundation for the \"Three Noes\" policy. President Clinton reiterated the U.S. policy on Taiwan during a summit in China in 1998, stating opposition to Taiwan independence and membership in organizations requiring statehood. This stance, known as the \"Three Noes,\" was seen as a continuation of Nixon-era assurances and was further solidified in the Clinton Administration's Taiwan Policy Review of 1994. In response to Taipei's bid for U.N. re-entry in 1993, concerned Members of Congress passed resolutions in 1998 reaffirming U.S. commitment to Taiwan. The Clinton Administration argued that the \"Three Noes\" policy did not represent a change. Assistant Secretary of State Stanley Roth testified in 1999 that the policy was consistent with past administrations. President George W. Bush reiterated the U.S. stance on Taiwan in 2001. President George W. Bush reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to Taiwan in 2001, stating the obligation to assist Taiwan in defending itself. He emphasized opposition to Taiwan independence and reiterated this stance during a summit with Jiang Zemin in 2002. President George W. Bush reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to Taiwan in 2001, stating opposition to Taiwan independence. Questions arose about a potential shift in U.S. policy after President Chen Shui-bian's speech in 2002, with concerns about unilateral moves towards independence in Taiwan. The issue of U.S. assurances to Chinese leaders regarding opposition to Taiwan independence was discussed, potentially representing a policy shift from neutrality to active opposition. The U.S. reaffirmed opposition to Taiwan independence in 2001, consistent with President Clinton's \"Three Noes\" policy. Taiwan, under the DPP, argued for its independence since 1996. President Chen's calls for referendums and a new constitution raised concerns about sovereignty. The Bush Administration urged Chen to stick to his \"Five Noes\" pledges, including not promoting a referendum to change the status quo. Chen's push for a new constitution in 2003 further heightened tensions. Chen called for a new constitution for Taiwan with specific timelines. The US advised against unilateral changes to the status quo. Despite opposition, Chen announced a defensive referendum to address security concerns. The US expressed concerns about Taiwan's political actions and reforms, opposing any referendum that would change Taiwan's status or move towards independence. Bush delivered a clear message to Taiwan about avoiding provocations during a meeting with PRC Premier Wen Jiabao. During a meeting with PRC Premier Wen Jiabao, Bush opposed any unilateral decisions by China or Taiwan to change the status quo and questioned Chen's referendum plans. Chen remained defiant, stating his intention to hold the referendums as planned to maintain Taiwan's independent status quo. American opinions on the Bush Administration's statements toward Taiwan were divided. Some viewed Chen as pushing for permanent separation from China, supporting Bush's stance against his referendum plans. Others criticized Bush for favoring China over Taiwan's democracy, urging a new approach to the \"one China\" policy. Some advocated for arms sales to Taiwan while staying out of conflicts in the Taiwan Strait. Uncertainty remains about the Bush Administration's implementation of U.S. policy on Taiwan, including questions about recalibrating policy, maintaining a delicate balance in the Taiwan Strait, perceptions of mixed messages from Washington, and the U.S. stance on referendums and a new constitution in Taiwan. Taiwan's long-standing independence from China, separate national identity, and the increasing PLA threat are also key concerns for the U.S. On January 16, 2004, President Chen proposed two referendums for Taiwan regarding missile defense systems and negotiations with China for peace and stability. Despite efforts, the referendums failed to be valid due to low voter turnout. The White House then sent Michael Green to Taiwan to discuss sovereignty-related issues with President Chen. The White House sent Michael Green to Taiwan to discuss sovereignty-related issues with President Chen, who responded to U.S. concerns in his inaugural address. During President Chen's second term, the Bush Administration did not support Taiwan's independence or U.N. membership and opposed unilateral changes to the \"status quo.\" The Administration also expressed opposition to referendums on Taiwan's U.N. membership in 2008. One issue was the appropriate U.S. response to Taiwan's president's requests to enter the U.S. for visits or transits. Since 1994, U.S. response to Taiwan visits has evolved, from denying Lee Teng-hui entry to relaxing restrictions for Chen Shui-bian's transits. Clinton Administration allowed Lee a refueling stop in Hawaii in 1994 but denied him a visa. Lee later received a visa to visit Cornell University in 1995. Congress's view played a role in the policy reversal. In 2000, Chen Shui-bian was allowed to transit in Los Angeles. In 2001, President Chen had \"private and unofficial\" transits through New York and Houston, where he had private meetings with Members of Congress. Representative Sam Gejdenson organized a meeting in Los Angeles, but Chen declined to hold public events. The Bush Administration allowed private meetings between Chen and Members of Congress, with 21 Representatives attending a dinner with Chen in New York and Representative Tom DeLay hosting him in Houston. In 2003, the Bush Administration granted President Chen's requests for transits through New York and Anchorage. Some Members of Congress welcomed Chen, but no Administration officials met with him. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Randall Schriver canceled a planned meeting with Chen in New York. Chen enjoyed transits through Honolulu and Seattle in 2004. In January 2005, Chen stopped in Guam on his way back to Taiwan. In 2005, the Bush Administration allowed President Chen to stop in Miami and San Francisco on his way to Latin America and back to Taiwan. Chen received a human rights award in Miami but faced tightened restrictions on his U.S. stops in 2006. President Bush countered Chen's request for stops in San Francisco and New York with transits in Honolulu and Anchorage, leading to a dispute. Representatives questioned the decision's consistency with legislation. In 2006, the Bush Administration imposed restrictions on President Chen's U.S. stops, leading to a dispute over the decision's consistency with legislation. The restrictions included switching to a civilian aircraft instead of \"Air Force One\" for a stop in Guam, and limitations on transits in San Francisco and Los Angeles. Representative Dana Rohrabacher and 14 other Members called for the removal of these restrictions in a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. In January 2007, a letter was sent to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi calling for the removal of restrictions on high-level visits with Taiwan. Representative Tancredo criticized Mexico's ban on Chen's plane, similar to U.S. treatment of Taiwan. The Bush Administration restricted Chen's transits to 50-minute refueling stops in Anchorage in August 2007. President Ma Ying-jeou expressed a desire to visit the U.S. before his inauguration in May 2008, but the Bush Administration denied his request. Ma later \"transited\" in the United States, meeting with Members of Congress and joining public activities in various cities from 2008 to 2014. The United States has shown support for Taiwan's \"international space\" and participation in international organizations. Views on Taiwan's international presence vary, with some advocating for democratic representation and others supporting Taiwan's separate identity or independence. Policy Review supported Taiwan's participation in international organizations where statehood is not required and advocated for opportunities for Taiwan's voice to be heard. This included efforts to involve Taiwan in the World Health Organization (WHO) and its governing body, the World Health Assembly (WHA). President Bush and Representatives in the House sought ways for Taiwan to contribute to the WHO, despite not being a member. Taiwan sought inclusion in the WHO, with support from the US, but faced challenges in gaining observer status at the WHA in 2008. Despite efforts to increase participation, Taiwan was not granted observer status until later. In 2009, Taiwan's focus shifted to the WHA meeting, with the State Department supporting Taiwan's observership. Taiwan's Minister of Health participated as an observer for the first time at the WHA in May 2009, but concerns arose over the invitation requiring PRC approval. In 2010, the State Department supported Taiwan's participation in the WHA, aiming for observer status in other U.N. bodies. However, a secret WHO Memorandum revealed an arrangement with China regarding Taiwan's status, leading to protests from U.S. officials. President Ma pursued Taiwan's bid to rejoin the U.N. more flexibly than his predecessor. Taiwan seeks meaningful participation in U.N. specialized agencies like WHO and ICAO. The U.S. supports Taiwan's involvement in international organizations. Taiwan aims for observer status in WHO, ICAO, and UNFCCC. Taiwan was nominated for the Visa Waiver Program by the State Department under President Obama. Taiwan citizens can now travel to the U.S. for business or tourism for up to 90 days without a visa. Taiwan joined the VWP as the 37th country. The Taiwan Relations Act ensures that U.S. laws apply to Taiwan in relevant contexts. The U.S. passed legislation in FY1994 and FY1995 directing the State Department to register foreign-born Taiwanese-Americans as U.S. citizens born in Taiwan, called for support for Taiwan in relationships, and allowed Taiwan's President to enter the U.S. on certain occasions. President Clinton signed the Immigration and Nationality Technical Corrections Act of 1994 into law, expressing Congress's view. Later, Congress passed H.Con.Res. 53 expressing support for Taiwan. In 1999, Congress legislated semi-annual reports on U.S. support for Taiwan and required a report on Taiwan's participation in the WHO. The State Department stated in 2000 that the U.S. does not support Taiwan's membership in organizations. In 2000, the U.S. does not support Taiwan's membership in organizations like the U.N. or WHO where statehood is required, but supports arrangements for Taiwan to participate in WHO work. Congress passed resolutions in support of Taiwan's participation in international organizations, and legislation was enacted to obtain observer status for Taiwan at the WHA summit in May 2001. In 2001, the U.S. passed legislation to obtain observer status for Taiwan at the WHA summit in Geneva. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act for FY2003 allowed U.S. departments to assign employees to the American Institute in Taiwan, handling the U.S.-Taiwan relationship since 1979. In the 108th Congress, legislation was passed to authorize the Secretary of State to pursue observer status for Taiwan at the WHA. President Bush supported Taiwan's participation in the WHO but maintained the \"one China\" policy. Congress also welcomed President Chen to the United States and supported Taiwan's efforts to gain observer status in the WHO. In 2004, Congress passed legislation supporting Taiwan's observer status in the WHO, with President Bush signing it into law. However, the reporting requirement was subject to executive branch discretion. Congress continued to support Taiwan's participation in international organizations like the ICAO. In July 2010, the House passed a resolution supporting Taiwan's observer status in ICAO. In September 2011 and 2012, the Senate and House agreed to the same resolution. In June 2013, both the House and Senate passed a bill directing the Secretary of State to develop a strategy for Taiwan's observer status at the ICAO Assembly. President Obama signed the bill into law in July 2013, supporting Taiwan's participation at ICAO while maintaining the \"one China\" policy. The State Department reported U.S. support for Taiwan's \"observer status\" in ICAO meetings, in line with the \"one China\" policy and TRA. The PRC has not ruled out using force for its objectives despite claiming \"peaceful unification\" and has strengthened its military capabilities since the 1990s. In the 1990s, the PRC increased military threats against Taiwan, including missile exercises and deploying PLA forces near the Taiwan Strait. The tension escalated during the Taiwan Strait Crisis of 1995-1996, prompting the US to deploy aircraft carriers. The PRC continued to build up its military capabilities, raising tensions again in 1999 after President Lee's remarks on cross-strait relations. In 1999, the PRC raised tension after President Lee's remarks on cross-strait relations. In 2000, the PRC issued a White Paper on Taiwan, warning of using force for unification if Taiwan refuses to negotiate. The US was warned against selling arms to Taiwan or forming alliances with them. In 2003, a PRC official threatened to use force against Taiwan independence promotion. Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage responded to Taiwan's open promotion of independence during an election, emphasizing the need for peaceful resolution. President Bush did not support DPP President Chen or Taiwan's independence, opposing referendums on U.N. membership in 2008. The U.S. sent aircraft carriers near Taiwan for the election, which faced PRC condemnation. The KMT's Ma Ying-jeou won the election as the referendums failed to be valid. Since the 1950s, the US government has maintained a consistent position for a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan question, including the U.S.-ROC Defense Treaty of 1954 and the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979. The Act commits the US to assist Taiwan's self-defense and potentially maintain peace in the strait, with a provision to consider any non-peaceful means to determine Taiwan's future with grave concern. The Act excludes islands off the mainland from its security coverage over Taiwan. The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 commits the US to assist Taiwan's self-defense and maintain peace in the strait. President Reagan signed a Joint Communique on reducing arms sales to Taiwan in 1982, but clarified that arms sales will continue. President George H. W. Bush sold 150 F-16 fighters to Taiwan in 1992 due to concerns about military balance. The Clinton Administration deployed two aircraft carrier battle groups to waters off Taiwan in 1996 after the PRC announced renewed PLA exercises. President Clinton demonstrated grave consequences for non-peaceful efforts regarding Taiwan's future. President George W. Bush publicly committed to helping Taiwan defend itself. In 2002, Bush emphasized U.S. commitments to Taiwan and regional allies during visits to China and Japan. In Beijing, Bush emphasized U.S. commitments to the TRA and peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question, while opposing provocations. Concerns about miscalculations of U.S. views in Taiwan were raised by Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Lawless in 2003. Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage clarified in 2003 that the TRA is not a defense treaty but guides policy in providing Taiwan with defense articles for self-defense. President Bush reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to assist Taiwan's self-defense without a defense treaty, emphasizing the need for sufficient force in the Asia Pacific area to maintain calm. Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly clarified U.S. policy after Chen Shui-bian's re-election, warning Taiwan not to dismiss PRC threats and mentioning limitations to U.S. support for constitutional changes in Taiwan. Assistant Secretary of Defense Peter Rodman cautioned Beijing against using unilateral actions. In September 2005, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Richard Lawless emphasized the Taiwan Relations Act's focus on Taiwan's self-defense. The Act expects Taiwan to be capable of defending itself, with the U.S. obligated to assist in enabling Taiwan's self-defense. Taiwan must be ready, willing, and able to maintain its own self-defense. Taiwan must fulfill its obligations under the Taiwan Relations Act by providing for its own defense and not solely relying on the U.S. The Act requires both parties to deter aggression towards Taiwan. The debate includes whether the U.S. strategy should be clear or ambiguous, or if defense commitments should be removed while still selling weapons for Taiwan's self-defense. Despite no formal relations, U.S. arms sales to Taiwan have been significant. The issue of pursuing normalization of ties with Taiwan arose after tensions in the Taiwan Strait in 1995-1996. The Pentagon expanded military ties with Taiwan under the Clinton and Bush Administrations, focusing on strategy, logistics, and arms sales. In 2001, President Bush announced a shift to routine considerations for Taiwan's requests. The Bush Administration granted a visa for ROC Defense Minister Tang Yiau-ming to visit the U.S. for a conference in 2002. In 2002, the Bush Administration requested legislation to authorize the assignment of personnel from U.S. departments and agencies to AIT, with implications for the assignment of active-duty military personnel to Taiwan for the first time since 1979. The first active-duty defense attach\u00e9 since 1979, an Army Colonel, began duty in Taipei in August 2005 with civilian clothes and a status similar to military attaches assigned to Hong Kong. In 2002, a ban on visits by U.S. general and flag officers to Taiwan was imposed under the State Department's \"Guidelines on Relations with Taiwan.\" The catalyst for this debate among policy makers arose from the U.S.-PRC summit in Crawford, TX, on October 25, 2002, where PRC leader Jiang Zemin offered a freeze or reduction in China's deployment of missiles targeted at Taiwan in exchange for restraints in U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. President Bush did not respond to Jiang's proposal. Policy considerations include the TRA and the 1982 Joint Communique. Since the 1990s, Congress has asserted its role in determining arms sales to Taiwan under the TRA, particularly in response to provocative actions by the PLA. Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly stated that Taiwan's defense requirements could change if the PRC pursues a peaceful resolution to the Taiwan issue. In the 103rd and 104th Congress, concerns over PLA exercises near Taiwan led to the passage of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act and H.Con.Res. 148 expressing Congress's stance on arms sales and Taiwan's security. H.Con.Res. 148, passed by the Senate on March 21, 1996, expressed Congress's support for defending the ROC. The resolution prompted the deployment of USS Independence and USS Nimitz carriers by the Clinton Administration. Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord stated that the situation did not constitute a threat to Taiwan as outlined in the Taiwan Relations Act. In the 105th and 106th Congress, legislation required reports on U.S. missile defense systems for key regional allies like Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Congress asserted its role in decision-making on arms sales to Taiwan. In the 105th and 106th Congress, legislation required reports on U.S. missile defense systems for key regional allies like Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.

In 1998, former Clinton Administration officials visited Beijing and Taipei to reduce cross-strait tensions. A proposal for a 50-year \"interim arrangement\" was suggested, where China would renounce force against Taiwan, and Taiwan would not declare independence. In March 1998, Joseph Nye proposed a \"three-part package\" regarding Taiwan independence, while Anthony Lake encouraged cross-strait talks. Chas Freeman suggested deferring negotiations with Beijing for 50 years in July/August 1998. Perry led a delegation in February-March 1999. In September 1999, Perry led a delegation with Admiral Joseph Prueher to reduce cross-strait tensions. Deputy Assistant Secretary Susan Shirk mentioned \"one country, three systems\" for \"one China.\" President Clinton outlined \"three pillars\" for U.S. policy on cross-strait dialogue. In February 2000, Clinton added the expectation of resolving the dispute peacefully with Taiwan's assent. The George W. Bush Administration, which began after Chen Shui-bian of the DPP became President in May 2000, emphasized the \"Six Assurances\" given to Taiwan by President Reagan in 1982. Secretary of State Colin Powell reaffirmed these assurances in March 2001, stating that the U.S. would not consult with the PRC on arms sales to Taiwan.

U.S. policy towards Taiwan focuses on a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan question, leaving it to be resolved by the people on both sides of the strait. Taiwan asserts its sovereign status, challenging the U.S. approach. The meaning of \"status quo\" in the Taiwan Strait remains a question. The situation in the Taiwan Strait has changed significantly, with a shifting military balance favoring the PRC and increased engagement between the PRC and Taiwan. There has been no comprehensive review of U.S. policy towards Taiwan since 1994, leading to calls for a new strategy to sustain U.S. interests in the region. Admiral Robert Willard initiated reviews of approaches in 2010. In January 2010, the Pacific Commander initiated reviews of approaches towards the PRC and Taiwan through \"Strategic Focus Groups.\" Key issues include adherence to the TRA for defense support to Taiwan, assessing political, economic, and military trends in the region, and implications of engagement across the Taiwan Strait on U.S. interests and policies.

The Chinese government reaffirmed its stance on Taiwan being a part of China, hindering normalization of relations with the United States. The Chinese Government insists on Taiwan being a part of China and opposes any notions of Taiwan's independence.

The United States plans to withdraw all forces and military installations from Taiwan gradually as tensions decrease. Relations with Taiwan are deemed complex, with a belief in a peaceful transition. The commitment to the principles of the Shanghai communique with China is reiterated, leading to the recognition of the People's Republic of China in 1979.

The legal status and international personality of the Republic of China as an independent sovereign state must be recognized and respected by the United States. Taiwan's separation from China for nearly 30 years is artificial and against national interests. Unification of China aligns with popular sentiment and global trends, with the world recognizing only one China. Recent treaties and normalization of relations demonstrate the unstoppable trend towards unification. China and the United States recognize the trend towards unification, with hopes placed on Taiwan authorities to maintain a firm stance on one China. The Chinese Government orders the PLA to cease bombardment of islands, but military confrontation still exists along the Taiwan Strait.

The United States provides defense support to Taiwan based on its needs, with input from US military authorities. Laws apply to Taiwan in relation to foreign entities. Policy on Taiwan's return to China for peaceful unification was elaborated in 1981. The Chinese government proposed talks between the Communist Party of China and the Kuomintang for national unification, including facilitating exchanges in mail, trade, and visits after reunification. After reunification, Taiwan can have a high degree of autonomy, retain its armed forces, maintain its current socio-economic system, and have no interference from the central government in local affairs. People in Taiwan can hold leadership positions in national political bodies, receive subsidies for local finance when needed, and have their proprietary rights protected. After reunification, Taiwan can have a high degree of autonomy, retain its armed forces, maintain its current socio-economic system, and have no interference from the central government in local affairs. People in Taiwan are guaranteed proper arrangements, no discrimination, freedom of entry and exit, and welcome to invest in various economic undertakings on the mainland. The unification of the motherland is a responsibility of all Chinese, and proposals and suggestions from people in Taiwan are welcomed for the great cause of national unification. The Kuomintang authorities are urged to stick to their one-China position and oppose \"two Chinas\" for national unification and prosperity. The United States reaffirms its commitment to the One China policy and will not allow unofficial relations with Taiwan to weaken this principle. In negotiating the third Joint Communique with the PRC, the United States has not agreed to end arms sales to Taiwan, hold prior consultations with the PRC on arms sales, mediate between Taipei and Beijing, revise the Taiwan Relations Act, alter its position on sovereignty over Taiwan, or pressure Taiwan to negotiate with the PRC. The decision is based on the PRC's commitment to peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue, with the U.S. monitoring PRC military activities and sharing intelligence. The United States recognizes the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government and acknowledges Taiwan as part of China. The issue of arms sales to Taiwan was not resolved in diplomatic negotiations. China considers Taiwan its internal affair. The United States acknowledges Taiwan as part of China and recognizes China's sovereignty over Taiwan. China's policy aims for peaceful unification and the US respects this, refraining from interfering in China's internal affairs or supporting \"two Chinas\" or \"one China, one Taiwan.\" The United States government acknowledges China's position on the settlement of arms sales to Taiwan, stating that it does not seek a long-term policy of arms sales and intends to gradually reduce sales to Taiwan. This aligns with China's stance on the issue. The United States government's policy on future arms sales to Taiwan aligns with the Taiwan Relations Act and emphasizes a peaceful resolution to the Taiwan issue without interfering in the matter or pressuring the people of Taiwan. The U.S. government's policy on arms sales to Taiwan is contingent on China's commitment to a peaceful resolution of Taiwan-PRC differences.

The U.S. government's policy on arms sales to Taiwan is based on China's commitment to a peaceful resolution of Taiwan-PRC differences. The U.S. did not agree to set a date for ending arms sales to Taiwan and will not exert pressure on Taiwan to negotiate with China. The U.S. maintains its long-standing position on sovereignty over Taiwan, acknowledging China's stance that Taiwan is part of China. After reunification with China, Taiwan will have a unique status with independent judicial power and the ability to maintain its own army as long as it does not threaten the mainland. The mainland will not station troops or administrative personnel in Taiwan, allowing Taiwan to govern itself in terms of party, governmental, and military systems. The Taiwan authorities will administer their systems, with some central government posts available to Taiwan. The proposal for unification with mainland China includes maintaining Taiwan's capitalism and mainland's socialism under one unified China. The Hong Kong issue will also follow the \"one China, two systems\" approach. If peaceful resolutions fail for Taiwan and Hong Kong, force may be used, but it is not ideal for any party. National unification is a long-standing goal, with a deadline of 100 years if not achieved. The speaker proposed the \"one country, two systems\" approach to achieve national unification, allowing Hong Kong and Taiwan to maintain their systems for a specified period. They emphasized the commitment to the principle of one China and constructive dialogue with Taiwan.

Both sides of the Taiwan Strait agree on the concept of \"one China,\" but have differing interpretations. Beijing sees it as the People's Republic of China, while Taipei views it as the Republic of China. Taiwan is considered part of China, with the mainland also being part of China. Taipei announced the authorization of the sale of 150 F-16A/B aircraft to Taiwan. The US will authorize the sale of 150 F-16A/B aircraft to Taiwan to maintain peace in the Asia-Pacific region. This decision does not change the US commitment to the one-China policy and recognition of the PRC as the legitimate government of China. The importance of the 1982 communique on arms sales to Taiwan lies in promoting peace and stability in the region through mutual restraint. Beijing's ARATS and Taipei's SEF are willing to verbally state their respective principles on \"one China\" to end hostility between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. The Chinese Government is determined to end hostility and achieve peaceful unification with Taiwan, opposing any form of independence. Contacts between the two sides of the strait have resumed after over 40 years, with a willingness to discuss any issues through dialogue.

President Lee's remarks in 1999 emphasized the importance of dialogue and non-use of force in the cross-strait relationship. He clarified the differing interpretations of \"one China\" between Taiwan and the Chinese mainland, based on the 1992 agreement. Beijing's recent actions have unilaterally abandoned this agreement, causing tensions. Taiwan has always maintained the concept of \"one China\" with each side entitled to its own interpretation. The \"one China\" concept refers to the future, with Taiwan and the Chinese mainland existing as equals but ruling separately. Both sides share a \"special state-to-state relationship\" before unification.
