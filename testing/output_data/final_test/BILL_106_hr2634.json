    "content": "The Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 may be cited as the \"Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000\" and includes an amendment to the Controlled Substances Act. The Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000, also known as the \"Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000,\" amends the Controlled Substances Act by waiving certain requirements for practitioners dispensing narcotic drugs in schedule III, IV, or V. The Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 amends the Controlled Substances Act by waiving requirements for practitioners dispensing narcotic drugs in schedule III, IV, or V if specific conditions are met. Practitioners must submit a notification to the Secretary before dispensing these drugs for maintenance or detoxification treatment, including certifications of being a qualifying physician and providing the drugs to eligible patients. The practitioner can provide drugs or drug combinations for addiction treatment, with a limit of 30 patients at a time for individual practitioners or group practices. The Secretary has the authority to adjust this limit. The Secretary can establish different patient limits for group practices based on the number of practitioners. Conditions for prescribing narcotic drugs in schedule III, IV, or V include approval for maintenance or detoxification treatment and no adverse determinations. The Secretary, in consultation with the Attorney General, can make adverse determinations regarding the use of drugs for treatment. A waiver for a practitioner requires written notification and identification of their registration. The practitioner, upon notification, is assigned an identification number by the Attorney General for confidentiality when dispensing narcotic drugs under a waiver. The Secretary must be informed within 45 days of the notification. If a practitioner dispenses narcotic drugs without proper registration and in violation of specified conditions, the Attorney General may consider it against public interest. A practitioner who submits a notification in good faith and meets specified conditions can dispense narcotic drugs for treatment without a waiver until notified otherwise by the Secretary. Adverse determinations by the Secretary are considered notifications effective after 30 days. With respect to dispensing narcotic drugs for maintenance or detoxification treatment, a practitioner may dispense under registration or waiver, without affecting registration conditions. Terms like 'group practice' and 'qualifying physician' are defined in the context. Physicians who are licensed under State law and meet specific conditions related to addiction psychiatry or medicine can treat and manage opiate-dependent patients after completing at least eight hours of training. Physicians treating opiate-dependent patients must meet specific conditions related to addiction psychiatry or medicine, including participating in clinical trials for narcotic drugs and completing training provided by recognized medical organizations. The physician must have specific training and experience to treat and manage opiate-dependent patients, as determined by the State medical licensing board and the Secretary. Criteria set by the Secretary are effective for 3 years and may be extended. The Secretary may extend criteria for treating opiate-dependent patients for additional 3-year periods through a statement in the Federal Register. Regulations or practice guidelines will be issued to address specific issues in consultation with various agencies. The Secretary will issue practice guidelines on approval of additional credentialing bodies, exemptions, and treatment protocols for opiate-dependent patients in consultation with relevant agencies. No federal official can control the practice of medicine. During the 3-year period after the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000, a State cannot prevent practitioners from prescribing drugs for detoxification treatment unless a law is enacted to prohibit it. This paragraph becomes effective upon enactment. The paragraph takes effect upon the enactment of the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000. The Secretary and the Attorney General may make determinations regarding the effectiveness of treatments provided under waivers for maintenance and detoxification treatment during a 3-year period. The Attorney General can determine if waivers for maintenance and detoxification treatment have increased the dispensing of narcotic drugs in violation of the Act and assess any adverse consequences for public health. The Attorney General can assess waivers for maintenance and detoxification treatment to determine if they have led to increased dispensing of narcotic drugs in violation of the Act, with adverse consequences for public health. If a decision is made to revoke the waivers, the paragraph ceases to be in effect after 60 days. The Secretary and Attorney General must consult with each other before making and publishing any such decision. Section 304 of the Controlled Substances Act is amended to replace \"section 303(g)\" with \"section 303(g)(1)\" in subsections (a) and (d). The House of Representatives passed a bill authorizing additional appropriations for the Department of Health and Human Services to assist with new duties. The bill allows for necessary funds to be appropriated for fiscal year 2000 and beyond."
