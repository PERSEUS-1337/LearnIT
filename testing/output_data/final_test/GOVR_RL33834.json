    "content": "This report examines logistical support contracts for troop support services in Iraq and Afghanistan, focusing on the United States Air Force Contract Augmentation Program (AFCAP) and the United States Army's Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP). It also discusses proposed legislative initiatives to improve the acquisition, management, and oversight of defense service contracts. In March 2009, the House Armed Services Committee (HASC) appointed a Panel on Defense Acquisition Reform to review the defense acquisition system, issuing its final report in March 2010. The House Armed Services Committee's Defense Acquisition Reform Panel issued its final report on March 23, 2010, providing findings and recommendations. New legislative initiatives, including H.R. 5013, the IMPROVE Act of 2010, were introduced to address ongoing issues with DOD's acquisition process. H.R. 5013 aims to overhaul the Defense Acquisition System to address systemic failures in DOD's acquisition of goods and services. It represents one of the first attempts to improve oversight and management of defense service contracts. The bill is divided into four major areas of reform: Title I focuses on the Defense Acquisition System, Title II on the Defense Acquisition Workforce, Title III on the Financial Management System, and Title IV on the Industrial Base. Title I of H.R. 5013 introduces Chapter 149\u2014Performance Management of the Defense Acquisition System, requiring regular performance assessments to maximize value for the Department of Defense. Key provisions include developing system-wide metrics, conducting audits for accuracy, and establishing linkages between assessments. Title I of H.R. 5013 introduces Chapter 149\u2014Performance Management of the Defense Acquisition System, requiring regular performance assessments to maximize value for the Department of Defense. This includes establishing linkages between assessments, management of personnel, criteria for promotion, awards, and workforce incentives, as well as generating requirements for the acquisition of services. Additionally, there are revisions to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and amendments to Title 10, Chapter 141 regarding the acquisition of certain \"military purpose, nondevelopmental items.\" Title II focuses on workforce improvements for a highly skilled acquisition workforce. Title II of H.R. 5013 focuses on developing and maintaining a highly skilled acquisition workforce. It includes provisions for using full authorities to manage the defense acquisition workforce, hiring and training managers, developing performance plans, incorporating best practices, and utilizing programs for hiring experts. The revision of acquisition workforce policies and programs includes hiring highly qualified experts, implementing incentive programs, and establishing special requirements for civilian employees in the acquisition field. Additionally, guidance and standards for workforce training are being developed, along with a plan to strengthen the information technology workforce segment. Title III of the document focuses on financial management within the Department of Defense. It introduces a new structure to increase accountability, including incentives for producing auditable financial statements earlier than September. Title III of the document focuses on financial management within the Department of Defense, encouraging early production of auditable financial statements and introducing penalties for non-compliance. It also requires a review and update of policies to ensure best value for the federal government within 180 days. Title IV of the document focuses on expanding the industrial base and increasing innovation within the Department of Defense. It includes provisions such as identifying nontraditional suppliers, implementing price trend analysis, and requiring disclosure of delinquent Federal tax debts by contractors and grantees. The amendment of Title 10, Chapter 8, Subchapter II authorizes the appointment of a General Counsel for the Defense Contract Audit Agency. It also requires the Secretary of Defense to adhere to guidelines for contractor business system reviews and establish a panel to eliminate barriers to contracting with the Department of Defense. Additionally, Title 10, Section 2500 is revised to expand the National Technology and Industrial Base. The U.S. Air Force has a smaller contingency contracting support program for services in Iraq through the Air Force Contract Augmentation Program (AFCAP). The Air Force Contract Augmentation Program (AFCAP) in Iraq is a large logistical support service contract similar to the U.S. Army's LOGCAP. Established in 1997, AFCAP provides non-combatant services like food, lodging, carpentry, and project management. Initially a $475 million program, it has now grown to a $10 billion program managed by the Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency at Tyndall Air Force Base. The AFCAP program, managed by the Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency, involves a contract awarded to RMS in 1997 for $452.6 million. The contract was rebid in 2002, with RMS winning again for AFCAP II until February 2010. The program includes key players like the customer, MAJCOM Civil Engineer, and AFCAP program managers. The AFCAP program involves key players such as the Engineer or Director of Services, AFCAP program managers, AFCAP contracting officers, and AFCAP contractors. The customer is responsible for on-site contract administration, quality assurance, and task order surveillance. The MAJCOM Civil Engineer/Director of Services provides resource advocacy and guidance on task execution. AFCESA AFCAP program managers act as intermediaries between customers and contracting officers. LOGCAP, established in 1985, manages civilian contractors for DOD missions during war. The LOGCAP program manages civilian contractors for DOD missions during war, augmenting combat support to military forces. The Army Sustainment Command oversees 65,000 contractors and $25 billion in contracts. The Defense Contract Management Agency manages task orders under the LOGCAP contract, with eight task orders awarded under LOGCAP IV. The LOGCAP program oversees civilian contractors for DOD missions during war, providing combat support to military forces. Transition from LOGCAP III to LOGCAP IV is ongoing, with protests against awarded task orders. U.S. Army officials discussed combat support operations in Kuwait and Afghanistan, with the drawdown in Iraq supported by current LOGCAP III contractor. The transition from LOGCAP III to LOGCAP IV began in May 2009 and continues through August 2010. Contractors Fluor and DynCorp will increase support as troops move to Afghanistan. Fair opportunity competition is ongoing for Transportation and Corps Logistics Support Services in Iraq. The next step involves Base Life Support with a draft Request for Proposal issued in December 2009. The LOGCAP III contractor will provide logistics services for the Iraq drawdown. The transition from LOGCAP III to LOGCAP IV began in May 2009 and continues through August 2010. The LOGCAP III contractor will provide logistics services for the Iraq drawdown, including transportation assets, maintenance services, and support for supply activities. The LOGCAP IV contractor is expected to provide similar services for bases remaining after August 2010. Twelve task orders have been awarded under LOGCAP IV as of March 29, 2010. To date, $1.8 billion has been obligated under the LOGCAP IV contracts, with 76 percent of work competitively awarded. The first LOGCAP contract was awarded in 1992 to Brown and Root Services for combat support services in Iraq. The transition from LOGCAP III to LOGCAP IV began in 2009 and is ongoing. The LOGCAP II contract was awarded to Dyncorp in 1997, followed by the LOGCAP III contract awarded to Halliburton/KBR in 2001. The LOGCAP III contract included tasks such as providing housing for troops, preparing food, supplying water, and collecting trash under a cost-plus-award-fee contract. The LOGCAP III contract with Halliburton/KBR in 2003 exceeded $3.5 billion, with a fixed 1% profit above costs and potential for additional bonuses. The LOGCAP IV contract was awarded through full and open competition, involving multiple contractors for best value to the government. In best value source selections, the government may make tradeoffs to award contracts based on factors other than costs or technical superiority. The use of multiple LOGCAP contractors aims to reduce risk, with three performance contractors competing for task orders to control costs and enhance quality. The U.S. Army announced in May 2010 that KBR would continue executing the LOGCAP III contract in Iraq until the troop withdrawal in December 2011, potentially earning $568 million in additional work. The total value of KBR's contract under LOGCAP III would be approximately $35.7 billion. The Army decided to keep the LOGCAP III contract with KBR, bringing its total value to $35.7 billion. Some Members of Congress questioned this decision, especially after the Justice Department took civil action against the LOGCAP III contractor. The Army selected Serco, Inc. for the LOGCAP IV contract, with a minimum value of $613,677 and a contract period of up to five years. The Army awarded Serco, Inc. the LOGCAP IV contract with a minimum value of $613,677 and a maximum contract value of $225 million. The contract includes logistical and program services to enhance the Army's contingency planning capabilities. Tasks include developing staffing plans, working with performance contractors, integrating logistics support, and preparing procurement work statements and cost estimates. The Army selected three performance contractors for LOGCAP IV services - DynCorp International LLC, Fluor Intercontinental, Inc, and KBR. After protests were filed, the competition was reopened, and five companies submitted bids. The Army announced on April 17, 2008, that it would re-award the contract. The Army announced on April 17, 2008, that it would re-award the LOGCAP IV contract to the three companies previously awarded contracts. The contract covers a range of services including supply operations, field operations, engineering, construction, communication support, transportation, and facilities. Each contract has a maximum value of $5 billion per year, with a collective annual maximum value of $15 billion and a lifetime maximum value of $150 billion for LOGCAP IV. The U.S. Army Sustainment Command awarded the first task order under LOGCAP IV to Fluor Intercontinental, Inc. for logistical support services in Afghanistan. The task order is valued at $68 million and is valid from September 25, 2008, through September 24, 2009. KBR also received a task order under LOGCAP IV. Policymakers are concerned about oversight of Iraq contracts due to expense, logistical challenges, and reports of waste, fraud, and abuse. Some policymakers question DOD's ability to manage large contracts, leading to concerns about oversight, waste, fraud, and abuse. SIGIR conducts audits and investigations on Iraq reconstruction activities, including ongoing investigations into LOGCAP. GAO, DOD's IG, and SIGIR reports reveal a lack of federal oversight and accountability for Iraq contracting funds. The Defense Contract Management Agency has vacancies for over 600 oversight positions in Iraq and Afghanistan. An audit by the DOD IG found that $7.8 billion out of $8.2 billion spent on goods and services in Iraq lacked substantiation. DOD officials disclosed that $1.4 billion in Army payments lacked proper documentation. The FY2009 National Defense Authorization Act includes provisions impacting federal contracting. The FY2009 National Defense Authorization Act includes provisions impacting federal contracting, such as designating an expedited hiring authority for the DOD acquisition workforce and setting acquisition personnel requirements for military personnel. It also establishes policies to address personal conflicts of interest by employees of federal government contractors. Section 842 requires DOD contractors to inform employees of whistleblower rights, Section 844 mandates a report on off-shore subsidiaries, Section 845 sets defense industrial security requirements, Section 851 clarifies pay for Commission on Wartime Contracting, and Section 852 calls for audits of spare parts purchases for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Section 853 and Section 854 of P.L. 110-417 set additional reporting requirements for contractors in combat zones, including security functions and alleged crimes by or against contractor personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Clean Contracting Act of 2008, contained in Subtitle G, includes provisions that affect all federal contracts, such as limiting the length of certain federal contracts. The Clean Contracting Act of 2008, under Section 862, limits the length of certain federal contracts based on specific conditions. Section 863 requires competition for procurement of property and services exceeding a certain threshold under a multiple award contract. Section 864 allows the contracting officer to waive the competition requirement under certain circumstances. Section 864 of the Clean Contracting Act of 2008 requires a revision of the FAR to address the use of cost-reimbursement contracts, including guidance on when they should be used, justification, and necessary workforce resources. It also mandates Inspector General reviews and annual reports by the Director of OMB on agency compliance with cost-reimbursement contract regulations. Section 865 of the Clean Contracting Act of 2008 mandates a comprehensive report on interagency contracts and guidelines to improve their management. Section 866 aims to minimize excessive use of contracts that add no value, eliminating pass-through charges. This provision applies to cost-reimbursement contracts exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold. Section 867 of the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 provides guidance on award and incentive fees in federal acquisition programs for executive agencies. Section 868 clarifies procurement from the commercial services inventory to minimize abuse. Section 869 authorizes the development of a 5-year plan to increase the acquisition workforce and operate a government-wide intern program for federal agencies. Section 870 of the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 establishes a Government Wide Contingency Contracting Corps under the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act. The Corps, led by the Administrator of General Services, will deploy members to respond to emergencies, disasters, and contingency operations. This legislation aims to enhance competition, reduce sole-source contracts, improve the acquisition workforce, and address waste, fraud, and mismanagement in federal contracting. The Clean Contracting Act of 2008 introduced provisions to improve oversight and transparency in federal contracting. The Defense Base Act requires contractors to provide workers' compensation insurance for employees working outside the US. The U.S. Army's LOGCAP covers DBA insurance costs, with significant overhead expenses. KBR incurred $592 million in DBA insurance premiums from 2003 to 2007. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act of 2009 requires the Secretary of Defense to adopt an acquisition strategy to minimize costs for DBA insurance premiums. An audit by the U.S. Army Audit Agency revealed rising program costs and fluctuations in insurance rates under the DBA program. The audit report found that DBA insurance charges were paid through the Army's LOGCAP contract with KBR. Chairman Waxman testified on the DBA financial transactions under the LOGCAP contract, highlighting the excessive costs. The Army reimbursed KBR $284 million for DBA charges, but only $73 million was paid out in actual claims, showing significant waste in the program. The Army Audit Agency found that AIG's DBA insurance rates under the LOGCAP contract were unreasonably high and excessive, with a risk of overcharging the Army. The audit report raised concerns about unnecessary costs and significant annual increases in insurance rates not aligning with the risk. Army auditors also questioned the cost-plus nature of the charges, noting that the contract being primarily cost-reimbursable could lead to potential overpayments. The auditors found that KBR's DBA insurance costs under the LOGCAP contract were unreasonably high, with little incentive to control costs. KBR received a fee as a percentage of these costs, potentially earning millions on top of AIG's profits. Army personnel were aware of the high costs but had not taken sufficient action to scrutinize them. The auditors warned that similar problems could exist on other contracts outside the LOGCAP arena. The federal government typically requires full and open competition for awarding contracts, as outlined in the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984. However, there are exceptions for national security situations. Title 41 USC Section 428a grants emergency procurement authority for contingency operations or defense against attacks. The Department of Defense (DOD) has developed initiatives to strengthen DOD contracting operations, particularly in contingency contracting situations for combat and post-conflict operations. Legislation has directed the development of joint policies and reporting requirements for contingency contracting. The Department of Defense has implemented initiatives to improve contracting operations in combat and post-conflict situations. Legislation allows for rapid acquisition authority during emergencies and outlines methods to expedite goods and services delivery. Multiple agencies, including DCAA, DCMA, AAA, and DOD Inspector General, oversee DOD-appropriated funds for troop support services under LOGCAP. The Special Inspector General for the Coalition Provisional Authority (SIGIR) has audited and investigated contracts for Iraq reconstruction and relief funds, highlighting a lack of transparency, oversight, and financial accountability in LOGCAP contracts. SIGIR's work has resulted in significant benefits to the federal government through more than 150 reports, audits, or investigations of reconstruction-related activities. The SIGIR's work has identified deficiencies in KBR's contract for support services in Iraq, including overcharges for fuel and food services. The government's oversight and management of the contract were found to be inadequate. The SIGIR recommends avoiding sole-source and limited-competition contracting actions. The report criticizes the use of sole-source and limited-competition contracting in Iraq, suggesting that contracts should have been subject to re-competition. The SIGIR's Quarterly Report to Congress discussed the Department of State's request to use the existing LOGCAP program for essential services at Enduring Presence Posts. If unable to use the LOGCAP contract, DOS does not have a plan to meet its support requirements. The SIGIR conducted reviews of Task Order 130 and Task Order 151 under the LOGCAP program. The SIGIR conducted a review of LOGCAP Task Order 151, awarded to KBR for support services in Iraq, with an estimated value of $200 million. The review involved interviews with personnel from various agencies and described the costs of the task orders providing support to the Department of Defense and Department of State. The SIGIR's audit found that the federal government and KBR improved oversight and management of Task Orders 130 and 151 in Iraq. The total cost of the task orders is $1.5 billion, with costs shared 60% by DOS and 40% by DOD. Thomas F. Gimble testified on accountability in contracting and controlling materiel during a House Armed Services Committee hearing. In his testimony, Thomas F. Gimble discussed DOD's oversight efforts for contracting in contingency operations, including audits and investigations totaling over $550 billion. Collaboration with other DoD organizations is ongoing to address contracting, accountability, and documentation issues. Additionally, a new partnership has been formed to combat waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement across federal agencies. The International Contract Corruption Task Force (ICCTF) was formed by multiple federal agencies to investigate and prosecute cases of contract fraud and public corruption related to U.S. Government spending for Iraq reconstruction. Participating agencies include DCIS, Army CID, Office of the Inspector General (Department of State), FBI, Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, and Office of the Inspector General (Agency for International Development). The ICCTF aims to achieve maximum interagency cooperation to successfully prosecute fraud and corruption. The ICCTF aims to achieve maximum interagency cooperation to successfully prosecute fraud and corruption cases in support of the war effort in Iraq. Case information and criminal intelligence are shared without reservation, resulting in indictments, convictions, and debarments of individuals and companies involved in fraudulent activities. Nineteen companies and individuals were suspended from contracting, and two contractors reached settlement agreements with the U.S. Government, resulting in $9.84 million in restitution, $323,525 in fines and penalties, $3,500 forfeited, and $61,953 seized. The GAO has identified DOD contract management as high-risk and conducts periodic progress updates. The Comptroller General discussed challenges in oversight and management of contracts before Congress in July 2007. Managing risks during transitions in requirements requires effective oversight, but DOD lacks sufficient personnel for contracting and logistics, hindering oversight efforts. Challenges in Iraq reflect systematic issues within DOD, including a lack of aggregated information on contractor employees and services. While a new office has been established to address contractor support, specific roles are still under study. Clear understanding of DOD's objectives, needs, performance levels, schedules, and costs is crucial for DOD and its contractors to achieve desired outcomes within budget and time constraints. Potential contract oversight issues that Congress may examine include contract costs, development of requirements, transparency, and workforce diversity. Outsourcing program management to industry is justified by DOD's lack of in-house expertise. Congress may want DOD to plan to restore in-house expertise. Escalating costs and technical issues in weapons acquisition programs may prompt Congress to review individual programs and DOD's acquisition management processes. The Navy plans to reclaim authority over ship design from industry, while Congress may scrutinize the Army's Future Combat System and its reliance on the Lead System Integrator. Contract administration requires trained professionals to manage contracts effectively. Trained professionals are essential for effective contract management, especially during the requirements generation process. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy emphasizes the importance of technical administration in government contracts. Despite the increasing complexity of logistical support service contracts, there is a decrease in the federal contractor workforce, leading to a shortage of officials to manage large-scale contracts. The federal government faces challenges in managing large-scale contracts, leading to a shortage of trained professionals. Military officials and logistical support units lack understanding and experience in contract management. Former OFPP administrators warn that the current situation creates a crisis, emphasizing the need for well-managed contracts and trained personnel. Hiring contracting officials is crucial for successful contract management. The importance of qualified and experienced contract professionals in both civilian and military procurement sectors is emphasized. Contracting officials must make tough decisions, with good stewardship of federally appropriated dollars being crucial. Ms. Bunnatine Greenhouse raised concerns about the lack of competition in awarding a KBR contract. Ms. Bunnatine Greenhouse objected to awarding a sole-source contract to KBR due to lack of competition and organizational conflict of interest. She refused to approve the five-year contract, citing that KBR had an unfair advantage after being paid to draft the contingency plan. Ms. Greenhouse objected to awarding a sole-source contract to KBR, warning against extending it beyond a year to avoid the perception of limited competition. She was later demoted and fired for doing her job, while other officials testified to awarding KBR contracts without competition. The attorney determined that the oil-related task order was outside the scope of the LOGCAP troop support contract. GAO agreed, stating the work should have been awarded competitively. Undefinitized contract actions have given KBR a cost advantage, with DOD officials relying on their cost estimates. DOD contracting officials relied on inflated cost estimates from KBR, leading to increased profits for the company. The inability to properly define requirements was a significant challenge in Iraq contracting. ID/IQ contracts allow for task and delivery orders without specifying a firm quantity of goods or services. Task orders under ID/IQ contracts are not subject to CICA but are subject to competition-type requirements. Task orders are the contractor's action list and can be approved as needed without competition. Task Order 59 on the LOGCAP III contract was one of the largest, supporting up to 130,000 troops with estimated charges of $5.2 billion. Sole-source contracting in Iraq has been a topic of media scrutiny. The use of sole-source contracting in Iraq has raised questions about the uncontrollable costs in a war zone. The Department of Defense argues that the high costs are due to the uncertainty of war-related requirements. While full and open competition is the standard for government contracting, troop support services under programs like LOGCAP have not followed this practice. Reports show that billions of dollars in non-competitive contracts have been awarded in federal contracting. In 2005, $145 billion in non-competitive contracts were awarded by the federal government, with $97.8 billion being \"no-bid\" contracts. Of the $97.8 billion, $63.4 billion was awarded because only one contractor could supply the goods or services needed. The remaining $34.4 billion was awarded under various exceptions to full and open competition. The House Government Reform Committee issued a report titled \"Dollars, not Sense: Government Contracting Under the Bush Administration\" in 2000, stating that $67.5 billion in federal contracts were awarded. In 2000, the federal government awarded $67.5 billion in non-competitive contracts, which increased to $145 billion in 2005. The value of contracts overseen by government procurement officials rose by 83% between 2000-2005. Cost-reimbursement contracts can be cost-plus award fee, cost-plus incentive fee, or cost-plus fixed fee. In 2000, $62 billion was spent on cost-plus contracts, increasing to $110 billion in 2005. Nearly half of all cost-plus contracts were cost-plus award fee contracts, with LOGCAP being the largest at $16.4 billion. SIGIR's investigations revealed that in some contracts, overhead expenses accounted for more than half of the costs billed by KBR. A recent audit report found that high overhead costs accounted for more than half of the costs billed by KBR to the federal government for Iraq reconstruction contracts. Overhead costs ranged from 11% to 55% of projected contract budgets, with administrative costs surpassing project costs in some cases. For example, one project had administrative costs of $52.7 million compared to project costs of $13.4 million. In another instance, combined administrative costs for five contractors totaled $62 million, while direct construction costs were $26.7 million. The audit report revealed that high overhead expenses made up more than half of the costs billed by KBR to the federal government for Iraq reconstruction contracts. This included a case involving subcontracting with Blackwater Security Firm, where costs were passed down through multiple contractors before reaching KBR, without proper authorization from the U.S. Army. Transparency in contracting is crucial for effective oversight by the federal government. The SIGIR released audit reports highlighting barriers in government oversight of contractors, including difficulties in obtaining important information on invoices. Lack of transparency in contractor relationships hampers accountability for taxpayer dollars. Secretary Gates plans to increase the defense acquisition workforce by converting private-sector contractor positions to government roles and hiring additional employees. President Obama aims to reduce defense contracting spending by reviewing DOD's acquisition processes and federal budget. The federal budget review aims to eliminate underperforming government programs, reduce spending on contractors by 10%, and require federal agencies to justify cost-reimbursement and sole-source contracts. DOD's acquisition workforce has decreased by over 50% from 1994 to 2005, with half eligible to retire between 2006-2010. Insufficient contractor oversight personnel limit DOD's ability to ensure judicious use of taxpayer dollars, as highlighted in recent testimony before Congress. The GAO official highlighted challenges in overseeing LOGCAP contractor performance in Iraq due to limited personnel. Congress and DOD disagreed on reducing the defense acquisition workforce, with Congress viewing it as necessary to eliminate wasteful spending. In the past, Congress viewed reducing the defense acquisition workforce as necessary to eliminate wasteful spending and provide DOD with more funding. Staffing shortages in defense contracting personnel overseeing Iraq contracts have become a systemic issue within DOD, leading to an increase in private sector service contracts. This has resulted in a lack of experienced DOD contracting officials in Iraq to manage complex acquisition programs and oversee private sector contractors. The downsizing of the federal acquisition workforce, including those overseeing large-scale contracts like LOGCAP, has raised concerns about deficits in skills and experience levels. A study commissioned by the Secretary of the Army, led by former Deputy Secretary of Defense Jacques Gansler, analyzed structural weaknesses in the Army's acquisition system. Dr. Gansler presented the commission's findings and recommendations to Congress. The Army's acquisition workforce lacks trained and experienced military personnel, with only 3% of Army contracting personnel being active duty military. There is a shortage of certified officers and civilians in the contracting career field, despite increased workload and complexity. The Army is not adequately supporting this key capability for deployed war fighters. The Army's acquisition workforce lacks trained military personnel, with only 3% being active duty military. There is a shortage of certified officers and civilians in the contracting career field. The Operational Army does not recognize the impact of contracting on mission success. The commission's report recommends systemic changes in contracting for expeditionary operations, including increasing personnel, restructuring organizations, providing training, and obtaining legislative support. The Defense Business Board is examining the performance of the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) following increased scrutiny due to questionable auditing irregularities. Pressure from the contracting community and buying commands compromised the independence of audits involving major government contractors. DCAA management was also found to exert pressure to expedite audits. The DCAA management pressure to complete audit work on time and report favorable opinions led to inappropriate shortcuts, resulting in noncompliance with GAAS and internal guidance. Auditors must perform sufficient work to ensure fair and reasonable prices paid by the government. Managers and supervisory auditors need to work with their staff to foster a professional environment. The Gansler Commission's recommendations for examining DOD contracts for troop support include implementing broadening the jurisdiction of SIGIR, convening a study of the federal workforce, requiring more detailed information for Congress oversight, and establishing a dedicated office for audits. The Army needs to address institutional and cultural issues hindering progress. The Gansler Commission identified challenges in the Army's business operations, emphasizing the need for improved acquisition and program management to support the Operational Army. The Institutional Army has struggled to provide timely and efficient contracting support, particularly in Operation Iraqi Freedom. The Army faced challenges in providing effective contracting support during Operation Iraqi Freedom, with a lack of resources and institutional deficiencies persisting years later. One option is to empower the SIGIR to audit and investigate DOD logistical support contracts in Iraq. The SIGIR has conducted over 150 reports resulting in the arrest of five individuals and convictions of four, seizing over $17 million in assets. Recommendations have been made regarding audit and investigation of contracts, suggesting a study on the federal employee and contractor workforce balance and oversight presence. Congress could require separate reports on the acquisition workforce from each military service. Congress could require DOD to provide more details on the acquisition workforce from each military service, including military, civilian, and contractor personnel. To enhance transparency, Congress could consider limiting sole-source or limited competition for Iraq contracts, using more fixed-priced contracting, imposing dollar constraints on task and delivery orders, requiring public notice for task orders, and dividing larger contracts into smaller ones with better-defined tasks. Separate reports from each military service could provide data on contract administration, costs, and performance, especially for no-bid and sole-source contracts. Congress could require more details on contracts, including no-bid and sole-source contracts, impose criteria for approval, mandate periodic re-competition for certain contracts like LOGCAP, and ensure competition by selecting a minimum of three contractors for large defense contracts. Financial oversight and competitive bidding for services in Iraq could be enhanced. One recommendation is to designate a single contracting entity for oversight in Iraq, possibly through a Contingency Contracting Corp. The DOD Inspector General's office may need additional resources for better contract management and oversight of funds. Should the DOD Inspector General have a stronger presence in promoting integrity and accountability within the Department of Defense? The DOD Inspector General could play a crucial role in preventing contractor waste, fraud, and mismanagement in Iraq. Congress may consider creating a dedicated office for auditing DOD contracts for troop support services. Various oversight agencies have issued reports on Iraq contracting issues. The U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Government Reform-Minority Staff released several Congressional Research Service reports in June 2006 on topics such as Department of Defense fuel costs in Iraq, defense acquisitions, the cost of Iraq and Afghanistan operations, private security contractors in Iraq, Iraq reconstruction, and frequently asked questions about Iraq. The curr_chunk provides references to various reports and testimonies related to contracting, acquisitions, and oversight in Iraq, including reports from CRS, CBO, GAO, and testimonies from government officials. The curr_chunk lists various reports and testimonies related to contracting, acquisitions, and oversight in Iraq, including GAO reports on military operations, DOD acquisitions, contract management vulnerabilities, and opportunities to improve surveillance on DOD service contracts. The curr_chunk provides a list of reports and testimonies related to contracting, acquisitions, and oversight in Iraq, including GAO reports on military operations, DOD acquisitions, contract management vulnerabilities, and opportunities to improve surveillance on DOD service contracts. The reports cover various periods from 2004 to 2008 and include information on the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program in Kuwait and the Gansler Commission's report on Army Expeditionary Contracting. Selected Legislative Initiatives on Iraq Contracting in the 110th Congress include bills such as H.R. 5658, H.R. 3033, H.R. 5712, and H.R. 3928 aimed at improving accountability and oversight of defense contractors. These bills address issues such as maintaining a database on defense contractors, reporting violations of federal criminal law, and over-payments on contracts valued over $5 million. The Government Contractor Accountability Act of 2007 (H.R. 3928) requires certain government contractors to submit financial disclosures if they receive 80% or less of their revenue from federal contracts. The Contracting and Tax Accountability Act of 2008 (H.R. 4881) mandates tax compliance for federal contract eligibility and prohibits awards to delinquent tax debtors. These bills aim to improve oversight and accountability in defense contracting. The Security Contractor Accountability Act of 2007 expands the coverage of the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act to include all persons employed under a contract awarded by any U.S. department or agency for work outside the country. This could impact DOD contracting in Iraq by transitioning security functions to U.S. federal government personnel within six months of enactment. The Security Contractor Accountability Act of 2007 expands the coverage of the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act to include all persons employed under a contract awarded by any U.S. department or agency for work outside the country. This provision would require the Secretary of Defense to review all Iraq defense contracts for reconstruction or troop support involving any contractors, subcontractors, or federal officers indicted or convicted for contracting improprieties. Other legislative initiatives proposed during the 110th Congress may impact defense contracting. The Security Contractor Accountability Act of 2007 expands the coverage of the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act to include all persons employed under a contract awarded by any U.S. department or agency for work outside the country. This provision broadens MEJA to cover individuals working in conflict zones where the Armed Forces are conducting operations. The Sunshine Act requires key government agencies to disclose contracts over $5 million to Congress. The Freeze Private Contractors in Iraq Act limits the number of security contractors in Iraq. The FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act focuses on DOD contract management and oversight. Key provisions include prohibiting new Lead System Integrators and requiring reports on organizational modifications. The FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act includes provisions for reporting on DOD contract management and oversight, such as annual reviews on deficiencies in Major Defense Acquisition Programs and reports on noncompetitive awards. It also establishes a commission to study federal contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan and requires collaboration on audits of DOD contracts for logistical support activities in the region. The FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act includes provisions for reporting on DOD contract management and oversight, such as audits for federal agency contracts, subcontracts, and task and delivery orders for security and reconstruction functions in Iraq and Afghanistan.
