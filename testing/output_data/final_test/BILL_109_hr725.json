In 1980, Congress established the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) to reduce the paperwork burden on the public. In 2002, OIRA estimated the paperwork burden at 7.7 billion hours and $230 billion in cost, with the IRS accounting for 83% of the burden. Despite government goals to reduce paperwork, the burden increased from 1996 to 2001. In fiscal year 2002, paperwork burden increased, with the Office of Management and Budget and the Internal Revenue Service needing to focus on reduction efforts. The House Report highlighted the continuous rise in paperwork burdens over the last six years, emphasizing the need for OMB to review IRS paperwork. The key to success in reducing paperwork lies in OMB's systematic review of new and existing paperwork. In 2000, researchers estimated Americans spend $843 billion annually to comply with Federal regulations. Congress has a responsibility to review major rules proposed by agencies, especially regulatory alternatives and associated costs and benefits. In 2000, Congress established new responsibilities within the General Accounting Office to assist with reviewing Federal rules and paperwork costs. Congress required the Office of Management and Budget to submit an annual report on the total costs and benefits of Federal rules, including effects on the private sector and State and local governments. The Office of Management and Budget requires agencies to report on budget and paperwork costs associated with regulatory requirements. Congress made this reporting requirement permanent in 2000. The Office of Management and Budget should also require agencies to submit estimates on costs and benefits of agency rules and paperwork to help prepare required reports for Congress. SEC. 3. REDUCTION OF TAX PAPERWORK.\n\nSection 3504 of title 44, United States Code, is amended to reduce the information collection burden on small businesses by reviewing collections of information conducted by the Internal Revenue Service.

Amendments include changes to funding and the duration of the pilot project. The amendments made by this section will take effect 90 days after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 6. IMPROVED REGULATORY ACCOUNTING. The text discusses the requirement for agencies to submit information on regulations and paperwork to OMB, including estimates of total annual costs and benefits. It also mentions regulatory budgeting under Chapter 11 of title 31, United States Code. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will designate agencies to participate in a study on regulatory budgeting for fiscal years 2006 and 2007. The study will focus on preparing regulatory budgets that show the estimated benefits and costs associated with regulations. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will include in reports to Congress for 2006 and 2009 the estimated regulatory benefits and costs for major regulatory programs of designated agencies. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will include a report on the feasibility and advisability of regulatory budgeting in the annual budget submission, along with any difficulties encountered and recommendations for proposed legislation. The report on regulatory budgeting required under subsection (d) will be submitted directly to the Committees on the Budget and on Government Reform of the House of Representatives and the Committees on the Budget and on Governmental Affairs of the Senate. Regulatory budgeting report will be submitted to relevant committees."
