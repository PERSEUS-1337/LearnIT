    "title": "SB 1437",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature emphasizes the importance of parents in providing quality education for California's schoolchildren. Tax relief for citizens supporting the common good is recognized as sound public policy. Parents often bear the cost of essential educational resources for their children from kindergarten to grade 12. Financial pressures on families make it challenging to ensure quality education while saving for college. State education tax relief empowers low- and middle-income families to care for their schoolchildren's learning needs from kindergarten to high school and generates funds for college by amending Section 17072 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. Section 62(a) of the Internal Revenue Code is modified to allow a deduction under Section 17208.2 in determining adjusted gross income. A new section, 17208, is added to the Revenue and Taxation Code, allowing a deduction for contributions to a Coverdell education savings account, up to $750 per year, from 2016 to 2021. Section 17208.2 allows a deduction for qualified education-related expenses for dependent children by a qualified taxpayer from 2016 to 2021. The basis of Coverdell education savings accounts is reduced by any amount deducted under this section. This section will be repealed on December 1, 2021. To qualify for a deduction for qualified education-related expenses for dependent children in California, the child must attend school in the state, be deemed a full-time pupil, be under 21 years old, meet specific IRS requirements, and be claimed as a dependent on the taxpayer's return. The qualified amount is the expenses paid for education, up to a specified limit. Qualified education-related expenses in California include costs such as educational equipment, computers, college courses, diagnostic evaluations, special education services, enrichment programs, tutoring, and transportation to and from school. Qualified taxpayers in California must meet specific requirements to claim qualified education-related expenses for their dependent children. These expenses do not include items used in a trade or business. The household income must not exceed 250 percent of the federal Income Eligibility Guidelines, based on adjusted gross income. The total deduction allowed for qualified taxpayers in California for dependent children is limited to $2,500 per taxable year. The Franchise Tax Board has the authority to establish rules and guidelines for this deduction without being subject to the Administrative Procedure Act. The act provides for a tax levy and will be repealed on December 1, 2021."
