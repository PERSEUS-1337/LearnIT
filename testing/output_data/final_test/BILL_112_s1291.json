This section aims to provide a business credit for integrating renewable electricity. The SEC. 45S Renewable Electricity Integration Credit provides a tax credit for eligible taxpayers based on their renewable electricity production and sales to retail customers. The intermittent renewable portfolio factor determines the credit amount before 2017. The intermittent renewable portfolio factor determines the credit amount based on the eligible taxpayer's renewable electricity percentage. For taxable years before 2012, the factor is zero cents for percentages less than 4 percent, 0.1 cents for 4-8 percent, and 0.2 cents for 8-12 percent. For percentages between 12-16%, the credit amount is 0.3 cents. For percentages between 16-20%, the credit amount is 0.4 cents. For percentages between 20-24%, the credit amount is 0.5 cents. Percentages equal to or greater than 24% receive a credit of 0.6 cents. For taxable years after 2016, the intermittent renewable portfolio factor for eligible taxpayers is determined based on specific percentages. For eligible taxpayers, the intermittent renewable portfolio factor varies based on specific percentages. For taxable years before 2019, the factor ranges from zero cents to 0.3 cents, depending on the renewable electricity percentage. Starting in 2019, the factor ranges from zero cents to 0.15 cents. Starting in 2019, the intermittent renewable portfolio factor ranges from 0.4 cents to 0.6 cents based on specific percentages. The term 'eligible taxpayer' refers to an electric utility defined in the Federal Power Act. 'Renewable electricity' is electricity generated from wind, solar, or other intermittent renewable sources with a capacity factor below 50%. The 'intermittent renewable electricity percentage' is defined as the percentage of electricity generated from intermittent renewable sources. The term 'intermittent renewable electricity percentage' refers to the percentage of an eligible taxpayer's total electricity sales derived from renewable sources. Rules similar to section 45(e) apply, and no credit is allowed if a credit has already been given to another eligible entity. Credit is disallowed unless passed to third-party generators for integration costs. Generators must reduce integration costs for renewable electricity purchased from eligible taxpayers to receive the credit. Integration costs do not include certain types of payments for infrastructure upgrades as defined by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission defines integration costs for renewable electricity to qualify for the credit. Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code include the renewable electricity integration credit as part of the general business credit. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include the renewable electricity integration credit as part of the general business credit. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 now includes the renewable electricity integration credit as part of the general business credit, with provisions for payments in lieu of credit. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 includes provisions for payments to eligible persons who sell renewable electricity to retail customers. The Secretary will pay an amount based on the renewable portfolio factor and the kilowatt hours of renewable electricity sold. Quarterly payments may be made if certain criteria are met. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows eligible persons to claim payments for renewable electricity sold to retail customers. A claim can be filed for electricity purchased or produced in a quarter or any prior quarter within the taxable year, with a deadline for filing set for the last day of the following quarter. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows eligible persons to claim payments for renewable electricity sold to retail customers. An eligible person is defined as an electric utility. Any term used in this section that is also used in section 45S shall have the same meaning. Rules similar to section 45(e) apply. Payment for renewable electricity purchased must include integration costs for third party generators. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows eligible persons, defined as electric utilities, to claim payments for renewable electricity sold to retail customers. Integration costs for third party generators must be included in the payment received. Charges intended to recover integration costs do not include certain defined expenses. The amendments made by this section apply to electricity produced or purchased after December 31, 2009."
