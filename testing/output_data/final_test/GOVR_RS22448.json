    "content": "Home and community-based services, covered by Medicaid since 1965, provide health and supportive services in non-institutional settings for individuals with disabilities or chronic conditions. These services include home health services like skilled nursing, aide services, medical equipment, therapy, rehabilitation, and private duty nursing. Private-duty nursing is skilled nursing care for individuals requiring services beyond Medicaid's home health benefits. Congress and CMS authorized states to offer additional HCBS services like personal care and case management. These services assist beneficiaries with daily activities and gaining access to medical, social, and educational resources. HCBS waivers under Section 1915(c) of the Social Security Act allow states to cover services for Medicaid beneficiaries who would otherwise need institutional care. The waivers permit flexibility in service coverage and eligibility criteria, including geographic limitations and targeted populations. States can limit the number of individuals served and target specific populations with HCBS waivers under Section 1915(c) of the Social Security Act. To be approved, states must meet requirements like a cost-effectiveness test. In 2005, 35 states and the District of Columbia used the Medicaid personal care state plan benefit for individuals with disabilities. Forty-nine states and the District of Columbia have at least one HCBS-waiver for elderly individuals, younger adults with physical disabilities, or individuals with mental retardation or developmental disabilities. HCBS waivers are also used for other groups like individuals with HIV/AIDS or brain injuries. Section 1915(i) of the Social Security Act allows states to offer Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) without waivers starting in January 2007. This new optional benefit differs from other Medicaid state plan benefits and HCBS-waivers, as it does not require beneficiaries to meet institutional levels of care to qualify for services. States have the flexibility to define beneficiaries' needs and can amend their Medicaid plans accordingly. Under Section 1915(i) of the Social Security Act, states can offer Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) without waivers, starting in January 2007. This new benefit allows states to provide HCBS services to beneficiaries who do not need institutional levels of care to qualify. States have the flexibility to amend their Medicaid plans without demonstrating budget neutrality, offer fewer HCBS services than under waivers, restrict eligibility to those with incomes below 150% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), offer self-direction, and cap enrollment. CMS is developing regulations for states interested in offering HCBS under 1915(i), with four states already submitting State Plan Amendments (SPAs) to provide HCBS services as permanent Medicaid benefits. The first state to submit a HCBS-SPA was approved in April 2007 to provide services to seriously mentally ill beneficiaries. State utilization of the 1915(i) option may lag behind expectations due to rapid growth of HCBS waivers. Data on states' plans for adopting the 1915(i) HCBS option are limited, with two states planning to submit SPAs and 16 others considering the option. Issues affecting states' utilization of the Section 1915(i) option include income eligibility differences between 1915(c) waivers and 1915(i). The 1915(i) option has more restrictive income eligibility standards compared to 1915(c) waivers, limiting states from converting beneficiaries. It only covers services described in Section 1915(c) paragraph 4(B) and prevents states from adding other services on a case-by-case basis. This contrasts with 1915(c) waivers, which have been used to address specific beneficiary needs like transportation and home modifications. States may define eligibility based on diseases or conditions under 1915(c) waivers. Under 1915(c) waivers, states can define eligibility based on diseases or geographic areas. In contrast, 1915(i) requires states to measure qualification based on individuals' service needs. Medicaid may use common medical measures for HCBS-waivers, but assessing support needs using daily activities can be challenging for some populations."
