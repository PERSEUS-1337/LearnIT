State Bonds Described: This section applies to bonds issued by the States of Alabama, Louisiana, or Mississippi, as general obligations in registered form with a maturity not exceeding 5 years. The bond proceeds must be distributed to political subdivisions of the issuing State, issued between the enactment of the Act and January 1, 2008, and designated by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary may designate a bond for this section based on an application from the State. The Secretary may designate a bond for this section based on an application from the State demonstrating the need for such designation on the basis of specified criteria, including the loss of revenue base, the need for resources for infrastructure or operating expenses, lack of access to capital, and any other criteria determined by the Secretary. The Secretary of the Treasury will provide guidance for the submission and consideration of applications. The Secretary of the Treasury will prescribe regulations for the submission and consideration of applications for bonds under this section. Bonds described in subsection (a) are guaranteed by the United States for 50% of the outstanding principal. The maximum aggregate face amount of bonds issued under this section is $3,000,000,000. SEC. 8. CERTAIN TAX RELIEF RELATED TO HURRICANES RITA AND WILMA. Special Rule for Determining Earned Income for qualified individuals allows for credits to be determined based on earned income for the preceding taxable year or the current taxable year which includes the applicable date. Qualified individuals include those affected by Hurricanes Rita and Wilma. Qualified Hurricane Rita individual refers to an individual whose primary residence on September 23, 2005, was in the Rita GO Zone or the Hurricane Rita disaster area and was displaced by Hurricane Rita. Qualified Hurricane Wilma individual refers to an individual affected by Hurricane Wilma, excluding those already classified as qualified Hurricane Katrina or Rita individuals. Qualified Hurricane Rita individual refers to a person whose main residence on October 23, 2005, was in the Wilma GO Zone or the Hurricane Wilma disaster area and was displaced by Hurricane Wilma. The term \"qualified Hurricane Katrina individual\" is defined in the Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005. The applicable date for a qualified Hurricane Rita individual is September 23, 2005. The terms \"Rita GO Zone\" and \"Hurricane Rita disaster area\" are defined as specific areas designated for individual or public assistance due to Hurricane Rita. The \"Wilma GO Zone\" and \"Hurricane Wilma disaster area\" are designated areas for individual or public assistance due to Hurricane Wilma. Earned income is defined for this purpose. The term \"earned income\" is defined under section 32(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Special rules apply to joint returns, where either spouse being a qualified individual allows for the sum of both spouses' earned income to be considered. Any election made under paragraph (1) applies to both section 24(d) and section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows for adjustments by the Secretary of the Treasury regarding taxpayer and dependency status for taxable years in 2005 or 2006. An incorrect use of earned income on a return is treated as a mathematical or clerical error for tax purposes. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows adjustments by the Secretary of the Treasury for taxpayer and dependency status in 2005 or 2006 to prevent loss of deductions or credits due to temporary relocations from Hurricane Rita or Hurricane Wilma. Adjustments ensure individuals are not claimed by more than one taxpayer for the same tax benefit. SEC. 9. GULF COAST RECOVERY BONDS. The Congress suggests the Treasury Secretary designate bonds as \"Gulf Coast Recovery Bonds\" in response to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma."
