    "content": "The Act titled \"Reducing Lead in Drinking Water\" aims to reduce lead levels in drinking water. The Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to define a lead service line and provide guidelines for replacing them. Eligible entities include public water system owners, qualified nonprofit organizations, municipalities, and states. The term 'lead pipe replacement program' refers to projects aimed at eliminating lead in water for human consumption by replacing lead service lines, testing, planning, or providing assistance to low-income homeowners. The Administrator will establish a grant program to assist eligible entities with lead pipe replacement programs. Assistance will be provided based on the evaluation of the entity's inventory of lead service lines in the public water system. The term 'low-income homeowner' will be defined by the Governor of the applicable State. The grant program will assist eligible entities with lead pipe replacement programs, including notifying customers, replacing publicly and privately owned portions of lead service lines, providing assistance to low-income homeowners, and recommending measures to avoid lead exposure after replacement. The Administrator will prioritize eligible entities for assistance in lead pipe replacement programs based on exceeding lead action levels in public water systems or addressing lead levels in facilities serving children or at-risk populations. The Administrator will prioritize eligible entities for assistance in lead pipe replacement programs based on exceeding lead action levels in public water systems or addressing lead levels in facilities serving children or at-risk populations. The lead pipe replacement program will include assistance to low-income homeowners and cost sharing of not less than 20 percent for programs funded by grants provided under this subsection. The Administrator can waive the non-Federal share for affordability reasons. Grants can be used to assist low-income homeowners in replacing lead service lines, with a limit of $10,000 per homeowner. The Administrator will develop guidance for owners of public water systems to create an inventory of lead service lines. $100,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2017 through 2021."
