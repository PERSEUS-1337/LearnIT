    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1824 of the Insurance Code establishes the Bail Investigation and Prosecution Fund, requiring surety insurers and bail permittees to pay a $15 fee per bail bond transaction, not exceeding $30 per transaction, to support the fund. Moneys in the Bail Investigation and Prosecution Fund are distributed for regulating entities involved in bail, with 70% allocated for consumer enforcement and protection purposes within the department. The Bail Investigation and Prosecution Fund is used for investigating and prosecuting unlawful conduct by bail licensees, responding to consumer inquiries and complaints, regulating bail bond products, and covering the cost of fiscal audits. The Bail Investigation and Prosecution Fund is used for investigating and prosecuting unlawful conduct by bail licensees. Thirty percent of the funds are distributed to county district attorneys and city attorneys for investigating and prosecuting surety insurer and bail abuse cases. The commissioner distributes funds based on specific criteria, and applicants must outline the proposed use of the funds and the anticipated outcome. Each district attorney and city attorney receiving funds must provide a detailed budget, prior case/project list, and final accounting. Interim accountings are required for projects lasting over six months. Each district attorney and city attorney receiving funds must submit a final report to the commissioner on the success of cases or projects, including information on active investigations, arrests, indictments, and convictions. The applications, distribution of funds, and annual reports are public documents. Information on criminal investigations submitted to the commissioner is confidential. The commissioner may conduct a fiscal audit of the programs. If a district attorney or city attorney is unable or unwilling to investigate or prosecute a bail abuse case, the commissioner can stop funding for that case and redistribute the funds. If the Bail Investigation and Prosecution Fund exceeds $8 million by June 30, the commissioner will reduce the assessment for the following year. Surety insurers must pay invoices for the fund, and any remaining balance at the end of the fiscal year will be carried over to the next year. The commissioner may develop guidelines and issue regulations for implementing provisions related to bail bond transactions. The commissioner shall provide an annual report on the department's website, including information on consumer complaints, investigations, and referrals related to bail transactions. The commissioner may develop guidelines and issue regulations for bail bond transactions. The department's legal division handles administrative cases related to bail transactions. Enforcement actions are taken in such cases, and violations are not considered crimes. The act limits public access to meetings and writings of public officials, as stated in the California Constitution. To protect criminal investigations, access to information submitted to the Insurance Commissioner under this act must be limited."
