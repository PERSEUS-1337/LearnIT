    "content": "In 1997, a new avian flu virus (H5N1) emerged in Asia, spreading to Europe and Africa, infecting over 330 people and killing more than half. Concerns exist about its potential to cause a global pandemic. Congress has allocated funding for pandemic flu preparedness since FY2004, primarily to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Funding is also provided to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) for controlling the disease in birds and to the Department of the Interior for wildlife activities. Other departments like Homeland Security, Defense, State, Veterans Affairs, and USAID have also received funds for global avian flu. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and other federal agencies have received funds for global avian flu control. Tracking federal funding for flu preparedness is challenging due to various reasons, such as activities not specifically designated for pandemic flu, the President's call for continuity plans, and inconsistent budget information presentation. The report provides information on appropriations for pandemic flu preparedness, primarily to HHS, presented in Tables 1 and 2. Funding for HHS is typically from the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund for short-term activities. In 2004, Congress allocated $50 million to enhance vaccine production capacity, including a $10 million contract for a domestic manufacturer. In 2004, Congress allocated $50 million to enhance vaccine production capacity. In response to a production failure in October 2004, Congress passed P.L. 108-447 in December 2004, providing $100 million to bolster flu vaccine production capacity. In 2005, funding was allocated for various programs to control the global spread of avian flu, purchase flu countermeasures, and expand vaccine production capacity. This included $25 million to USAID, $58 million to CDC for flu countermeasures, $10 million to HHS for sewer improvements, and additional funding requests for pandemic preparedness. Congress also provided emergency supplemental appropriations for pandemic flu in FY2006. In FY2006, Congress provided emergency supplemental appropriations for pandemic flu, using this vehicle to fund pandemic preparedness efforts. Additionally, regular FY2006 appropriations allocated $63.6 million to HHS for public health preparedness activities, including boosting flu vaccine production capacity and stockpiling vaccines. The Administration requested $7.1 billion in emergency supplemental funds for avian and pandemic flu preparedness, with $6.7 billion designated for HHS over three years. In FY2006, Congress provided $6.7 billion for HHS over three years for pandemic flu preparedness, with $3.8 billion allocated in emergency supplemental appropriations. Congress did not fund the amounts for FY2007 and FY2008 as requested by the Administration. In FY2006, Congress allocated $6.7 billion over three years for HHS for pandemic flu preparedness, with $3.8 billion provided in emergency supplemental appropriations. The Administration's request for FY2007 and FY2008 funding was not funded by Congress. In response, HHS requested $2.3 billion in FY2007 emergency supplemental funds for pandemic flu, which was approved by Congress in June 2006. In 2006, Congress authorized funds for federal domestic preparedness activities, vaccine initiatives, and stockpiling of antiviral drugs and medical supplies. $30 million was directed to USAID for global disease control activities. Additional funds were requested for HHS pandemic flu activities in regular FY2007 appropriations. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations recommended funding for pandemic flu activities, including domestic and global efforts at CDC. In FY2007, Congress allocated funds for pandemic flu activities at CDC and FDA. The appropriations included $28.1 million for FDA and a $50.5 million increase for FDA pandemic flu activities. The total recommended amount exceeded $60 million but was not enacted. In February 2007, Congress passed appropriations for HHS in H.J.Res. 20, providing $100 million to the PHSSEF for CDC's preparedness and response to pandemic flu. In FY2007, Congress allocated funds for pandemic flu activities at CDC and FDA, including $28.1 million for FDA and a $50.5 million increase for FDA pandemic flu activities. The total recommended amount exceeded $60 million but was not enacted. Congress also provided $100 million to the PHSSEF for CDC's preparedness and response to pandemic flu, with additional funding proposed in two supplemental appropriations bills that were not enacted. President Bush vetoed the Act in 2007 that would have provided $625 million for pandemic flu to the PHSSEF. A bill with the same name, H.R. 2206, also aimed to allocate $625 million to the PHSSEF, but the provision was removed before enactment. The law as enacted provided funds for avian flu control to USAID and the Department of the Interior. The Administration opposed funding for \"avian flu preparedness\" in H.R. 2206, stating it was addressed in the FY2008 budget request. The Administration had requested $7.1 billion in supplemental funds for pandemic preparedness in November 2005, with $1.16 billion allocated to HHS in FY2008. The requested supplemental amount for FY2008 has not been appropriated. In the FY2008 budget proposal, the Administration requested $1.19 billion in regular funding. In its FY2008 budget proposal, the Administration requested $1.19 billion for pandemic flu, including $870 million for the PHSSEF and $322 million for agency activities. President Bush vetoed the appropriations act, which would have provided $764 million for pandemic flu activities, including vaccine development and purchase. The conference report also allocated funds for CDC for immunization and global pandemic flu preparedness activities. Pending agriculture appropriations for FY2008, including potential funding for FDA pandemic preparedness activities."
