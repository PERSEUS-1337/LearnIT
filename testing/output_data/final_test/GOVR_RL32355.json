    "content": "In January 2005, federal white-collar employees received a 2.5% annual pay adjustment and a 1.0% locality-based comparability payment under Executive Order 13368 issued by President George W. Bush. The pay increase was authorized by Section 640 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2005. The Office of Personnel Management published the salary tables for 2005 on its website. Federal white-collar employees are to receive an annual pay adjustment and a locality-based comparability payment each year under the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act. The Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act (FEPCA) of 1990 has not been fully implemented as originally enacted. Federal white-collar employees received a 4.1% pay adjustment in January 2004, with a potential 15.15% increase if specified by FEPCA. In 2005, they received a 3.5% combined annual and locality pay adjustment. In 2005, federal white-collar employees received a 3.5% combined annual and locality pay adjustment, resulting in a nationwide average net pay increase of 13.06%. This report discusses the January 2005 annual adjustment and locality payments for federal employees under various schedules. Salary adjustments for federal officials, judges, and Members of Congress are not covered. The annual pay adjustment for federal employees is based on the Employment Cost Index (ECI), with rates increasing by 0.5 percentage points less than the ECI change. The pay adjustment is effective at the beginning of each calendar year, but the President can issue an alternative plan in case of a national emergency or economic crisis. The President can issue an alternative plan in case of a national emergency or economic crisis, but one was not issued. GS employees receive locality-based comparability payments, which may also be extended to other positions. OPM published regulations in 2001 to clarify limitations on pay adjustments for federal employees. Blue-collar workers under the Federal Wage System receive a prevailing rate adjustment capped at the average pay adjustment for federal employees. Blue-collar workers under the Federal Wage System receive a pay adjustment capped at the average percentage pay adjustment for federal white-collar employees. In 2004, blue-collar workers in Alaska, Hawaii, and non-foreign areas will receive a pay adjustment no less than GS employees in the RUS pay area. Special rate employees receive either the special rate or locality payment, with law enforcement officers receiving both special rates and locality pay. Federal employees in Alaska, Hawaii, and outside the continental US receive a cost-of-living allowance instead of locality pay. The Federal Register on August 5, 2004, established a locality rate of pay as basic pay for computing danger pay allowances and postdifferentials for certain employees temporarily assigned to foreign areas. The locality-based comparability payments procedure, established by FEPCA, aims to equalize pay rates between GS employees and non-federal workers in the same locality. FEPCA allows the President to adjust locality-based payments in case of a national emergency or serious economic conditions. President Bush issued an alternative plan on November 29, 2004, stating that the locality pay percentages authorized in 2004 would remain in effect in 2005. The Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts surveys to document non-federal rates of pay in each pay area, with 32 pay areas nationwide in January 2005. The National Compensation Survey (NCS) program replaced the Office of Compensation Survey Program (OCSP) for locality payments starting in January 2004. The NCS survey data is phased in with a 75% weight for NCS results and 25% for OCSP results. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) compares federal and non-federal salaries by grade to determine the pay gap in each area. The overall average percentage pay gap for each pay area is adjusted to 5% annually by OPM, as mandated by law. FEPCA requires a certain percentage of the gap between GS and non-federal salaries to be closed each year, with increments of 10% starting in 1994. However, the locality pay increases have been implemented at lower percentages, resulting in a slower reduction of the pay gap. In 1995-2004, the pay gap was gradually closed, with percentages increasing each year. FEPCA mandated that pay disparities be reduced to 5%, influencing locality rates recommended by the Pay Agent to the President. NCS surveys were not used for certain locality payments. The NCS surveys phased in for January 2004 and 2005 locality payments, using data from 2001 to 2002. The gaps were determined by using OCSP survey data from 1995 to 1996, with some data being up to eight years old. The Pay Agent explained the pay gaps in the 2005 locality payments report. The PayAgent explained in the 2005 locality payments report how pay gaps were determined, aging BLS survey data to a common reference date in March 2003. The overall gap between GS average salaries and non-federal average salaries was 31.82% in 2003, with an average reduction needed to meet FEPCA mandate at 25.54% for 2005. The PayAgent recommended locality pay raises to close the pay gap, ranging from 18.14% to 47.96% in different pay areas. The recommended net pay increases for 2005 ranged from 9.19% to 22.10% if ECI and locality-based comparability payments were granted. The council recommended continuation of 29 of the 32 locality pay areas in 2005, with Kansas City, Orlando, and St. Louis areas proposed to be part of the \"Rest of the United States\" pay area. The new Office of Management and Budget definitions for metropolitan statistical areas would be used to define locality pay area boundaries. In 2005, the council recommended keeping 29 of the 32 locality pay areas, with Kansas City, Orlando, and St. Louis proposed to be included in the \"Rest of the United States\" pay area. The new Office of Management and Budget definitions for metropolitan statistical areas would be used to define locality pay area boundaries. Pay gaps in Huntsville, Indianapolis, Kansas City, and Orlando were below the Rest of the United States in 2003, leading to redirection of survey resources to new locations. In 2005, the council recommended discontinuing salary surveys in Kansas City, Orlando, and St. Louis, and including them in the \"Rest of the United States\" pay area. Resources would be redirected to survey areas with more than 2,500 GS employees and a BLS pay differential of greater than five percent. The new areas to be surveyed include Phoenix, Memphis, Austin, Louisville, Buffalo, and Raleigh. The council recommended evaluating areas in the vicinity of locality pay areas for possible inclusion based on specific criteria. Adjacent MSAs and CSAs must have at least 1,500 GS employees and an employment interchange measure of at least 7.5 percent to be included in an adjacent locality pay area. Adjacent counties not part of a multi-county MSA or CSA must have at least 400 GS employees and an employment interchange measure of at least 7.5 percent to be included. Federal facilities crossing locality pay area boundaries also have criteria for inclusion. For federal facilities crossing locality pay area boundaries, specific criteria must be met for inclusion in an adjacent locality pay area. This includes having at least 750 GS employees outside of a higher-paying locality pay area, with the majority of employees within 10 miles of the separate locality pay area and a significant number commuting from the higher-paying area. Counties currently in an MSA-based locality pay area that would be excluded under new definitions must have an employment interchange rate of at least 15% to remain included. Areas meeting new criteria for inclusion should not be subject to further review. Requests for changes in locality pay area boundaries should include credentials of the requesting group, identification of the geographic area, number of GS employees by agency, explanation for adding the area to an adjacent locality pay area, current job vacancy rates, documentation of recruitment or retention issues, and evidence of unsuccessful use of other pay flexibilities. The council recommended improvements in the BLS National Compensation Survey program for locality payments in 2001 and provided a progress report on these improvements in 2005. The improvements and progress to date include using three factors to assign federal grade levels to non-federal jobs, developing a four-factor evaluation system, implementing an econometric model to estimate missing data, and improving the matching of federal survey jobs with non-federal survey jobs. OPM formed an interagency working group to develop a crosswalk between Federal job classifications and the new Standard Occupational Classification System. BLS will begin to phase in a new approach for grading supervisory occupations based on the level of work supervised. BLS has also developed criteria to exclude jobs classified above GS-15 in government. The Pay Agent endorsed the council's recommendations on defining locality pay areas in its 2003 report to the President, citing a national emergency as a reason to delay locality pay increases. OPM will publish proposed changes to locality pay area boundaries in the Federal Register in 2004 for implementation in January 2005. On September 22, 2004, OPM proposed regulations to align General Schedule locality pay area boundaries with metropolitan area definitions. The proposal would expand existing locality pay areas, moving 15,000 GS employees to metropolitan areas and retaining 16,000 employees. Final regulations were published on December 17, 2004. The final regulations published in December 2004 became effective immediately for the January 2005 pay adjustment. The Federal Salary Council recommended adding the York-Hanover-Gettysburg, PACSA to the Washington-Baltimore locality pay area. The estimated cost for the January 2005 locality-based comparability payments was around $8 billion. Table 1 shows the recommended locality payments for January 2005. The Pay Agent endorsed improvements in the BLS National Compensation Survey Program for January 2005, focusing on matching federal and non-federal jobs, excluding randomly selected non-federal jobs above GS-15, and addressing issues with random selection of survey jobs. The Pay Agent also supported adding Kansas City, Orlando, and St. Louis to the \"Rest of the United States\" pay area, discontinuing salary surveys in these areas, and enhancing surveys in other identified areas. The BLS is tasked with surveying new areas for locality pay purposes, including Phoenix, Memphis, Austin, Louisville, Buffalo, and Raleigh-Durham. OPM's proposed regulations suggest monitoring pay disparities in Kansas City, Orlando, and St. Louis before potentially discontinuing salary surveys in those areas. The Federal Salary Council recommended discontinuing pay areas in Kansas City, Orlando, and St. Louis by 2006. The Pay Agent recommended discontinuing pay areas in Kansas City, Orlando, and St. Louis by 2006, with concerns about the methodology for setting federal pay adjustments since FEPCA's enactment. The Agent supported updating locality pay area boundaries as an interim measure, pending fundamental reforms in the Federal white-collar pay system. The methodology for setting federal pay adjustments is flawed due to data completeness variations among survey areas, gaps not aligning with other labor market indicators, and a one-size-fits-all adjustment for all jobs. Despite concerns, OPM has not proposed legislative changes to amend FEPCA. A white paper in 2002 by OPM discussed the need for more flexibility in setting General Schedule pay but did not make any recommendations. In 2004, the Coalition for Effective Change endorsed a pay-for-performance system for the federal government, emphasizing flexibility, reviewability, periodic evaluation, and adequate funding. Reform of federal government pay and performance management systems is a top priority, advocating for government-wide legislation to provide personnel flexibilities. Pay rates are calculated based on annual and locality adjustments, resulting in a net increase in pay for 2005. President George W. Bush issued the report \"OPM's Guiding Principles for Civil Service Transformation\" in 2004. President George W. Bush issued his Administration's FY2005 budget on February 2, 2004, proposing a 1.5% federal civilian pay adjustment. The statutory annual pay adjustment required in January 2005 is 2.5%, with the President needing to submit an alternative plan for any changes by specific deadlines. He issued an alternative plan for locality payments on November 29, 2004. The President issued an alternative plan on November 29, 2004, stating that locality pay percentages for 2004 would continue for 2005 due to national emergency operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. The plan mentioned that locality payments would average 10.6 percent, costing about $9.8 billion in FY2005, resulting in an overall average pay increase of 13.1%. This increase was higher than the 1.5% pay adjustment proposed in the FY2005 budget, potentially leading to hiring freezes in agencies. The President's alternative plan proposed to maintain locality pay percentages for 2005 due to national emergency operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, resulting in an overall average pay increase of 13.1%. The plan also included a $300 million appropriation for the Human Capital Performance Fund to create performance-driven pay systems for employees. Ninety percent of funds appropriated are to be distributed to agencies on a pro rata basis, with the remainder allocated at OPM's discretion. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for F2005, P.L. 108-447, does not provide an appropriation for the fund. A hearing was conducted to examine progress in implementing human capital flexibilities, with OMB's Deputy Director for Management discussing targeted pay increases for recruitment and retention needs in the federal workforce. According to him, there are targeted recruitment and retention problems in the civilian workforce, with pay surveys showing overpayment in some occupational groups and locations. Congress annually considers the federal white-collar pay adjustment, setting amounts different from the President's recommendations. In January 2004, Congress set overall pay adjustment amounts, with resolutions expressing the need for parity between military and civilian pay increases. Members of Congress urged President Bush to embrace pay parity for federal civilian employees and the military. The FY2005 budget proposes a 3.5% pay increase for the military and a 1.5% pay increase for civilian employees. The Senate agreed to a Sense of the Senate provision regarding pay parity, but the House version of the concurrent resolution did not include a pay parity provision. The House version of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for FY2005 does not include a pay parity provision. Representative James Moran's amendment for pay parity was not approved during the House Budget Committee markup. During discussions on H.Con.Res. 393, Representative Moran's pay parity amendment was opposed by Thornberry and others. Speaker Hastert allowed a separate vote on H.Res. 581, which passed on March 31, 2004, stating that civilian employee compensation should be adjusted in line with military rates. Supporters of H.Res. 581 hope the vote result will be considered by the conference committee on the Concurrent Budget Resolution. The resolution sets the framework for Congress to consider spending legislation, including federal pay adjustments in the Departments of Transportation and Treasury and Independent Agencies Appropriations bill. The bill passed by the House of Representatives in 2004 includes a 3.5% pay adjustment for federal employees. On September 22, 2004, a bill was passed by the House of Representatives with a 3.5% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security. The bill did not specify how the increase should be divided between annual and locality pay adjustments. The bill was approved by the House Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies and the House Committee on Appropriations before being reported to the House. The House bill passed with a 3.5% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security. Section 501 ensures the pay increase is absorbed within appropriated levels. Section 636 prohibits funds from enforcing regulations inconsistent with Federal Salary Council recommendations. OPM is directed to compare Federal workforce compensation with the private sector in annual reports. OMB urged a 1.5% pay adjustment and expressed concerns about the Human Capital Performance Fund. The Administration opposes certain provisions in the bill related to pay adjustments for federal civilian employees in the Departments of Homeland Security and Defense, as well as blue-collar employees. These provisions could limit flexibility and create technical and equity problems. The Senate version of the Transportation/Treasury appropriations bill, S. 2806, includes a 3.5% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees. The bill was approved by the Senate Committee on Appropriations and reported on September 15, 2004. The Departments of Transportation and Treasury appropriations bill for 2005, incorporated in H.R. 4818, included a 3.5% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees. The House and Senate approved the conference report on November 20, 2004, with the adjustment effective from January 1, 2005. The OPM Director was directed to compare federal workforce pay with the private sector. President Bush signed H.R.4818 on December 8, 2004, with pay provisions at Section 640(a) and Section 501. Executive Order 13368 allocated a 3.5% pay increase as 2.5% annual and 1.0% locality. OPM published the 2005 salary tables on its website the next day. OMB Director opposed a federal civilian pay raise above 2.5%. The Administration strongly opposes a federal civilian pay raise above 2.5%, citing concerns about exceeding inflation, statutory base pay increase, and private sector pay. They argue that recruitment and retention issues are limited and do not justify a 3.5% increase, which would be difficult for agencies to absorb and may lead to reductions-in-force or resource shifts. The House passed an appropriation of $12.5 million for the Human Capital Performance Fund, which is $287.5 million less than the President's request. The OPM Director would determine and transfer necessary amounts to federal agencies, with funds not being obligated until approval is obtained. The Senate Committee on Appropriations did not recommend funding for the performance fund in S. 2806. The Senate bill committee report states that the initiative should be budgeted within agency expenses. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2005 does not provide funding for the fund. President Bush's FY2006 budget proposes a 2.3% federal civilian pay adjustment, with required annual pay adjustment in January 2006 at 2.1%. The President must submit alternative plans for any changes to Congress by specific deadlines. The Congress was urged to provide locality payments by November 30, 2005, with a proposed 6.93% nationwide average net pay increase in 2006. Resolutions were introduced for pay parity between military and federal civilian employees, with the President proposing a 3.1% pay adjustment for the military. Ten Members of Congress from the Washington, DC area urged President Bush to embrace pay parity principles. In January 2005, ten Members of Congress urged President Bush to embrace pay parity for federal civilian employees and the military. They emphasized the importance of pay parity during the war on terrorism and the need to retain experienced government employees. Representative Hoyer also offered to discuss pay-for-performance initiatives with the OMB Director. In January 2005, President Bush made adjustments to certain rates of pay through Executive Order 13368. This included Level of Comparability Payments and Net Annual and Locality Pay Increase. The report also mentioned Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA) and Combined Statistical Areas (CSA) as part of the pay area descriptions. The OMB Bulletin No. 03-04 from June 6, 2003, provides guidance on statistical areas and uses of the definitions. It includes information on annual and locality pay adjustments under FEPCA from 1991 to 2005, with sources and notes for the adjustments authorized by various Executive Orders. The net increase in pay rates for each year from 1998 to 2004 was calculated by CRS using a combination of annual adjustments and locality payments. The actual pay rates are determined by increasing the basic General Schedule (GS) by the annual adjustment percentage and then adding the locality payment.
