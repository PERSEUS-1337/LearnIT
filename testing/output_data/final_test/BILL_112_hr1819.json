    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"State Wildlife Management Act of 2011\" and addresses the status of population segments of gray wolves. The \"State Wildlife Management Act of 2011\" amends the Endangered Species Act to exclude gray wolves in the Northern Rocky Mountain distinct population segment, Nevada, and Colorado from being treated as endangered or threatened species, giving state management authority. The \"State Wildlife Management Act of 2011\" allows states to manage gray wolves in the Northern Rocky Mountain distinct population segment, Nevada, and Colorado if there are at least 450 wolves. If the number falls below 450, wolves will be temporarily treated as endangered or threatened species. The \"State Wildlife Management Act of 2011\" allows states to manage gray wolves in the Northern Rocky Mountain distinct population segment, Nevada, and Colorado if there are at least 450 wolves. In the Western Great Lakes distinct population segment, gray wolves are not considered endangered or threatened unless the number falls below 450 for 2 consecutive years. The Western Great Lakes states can manage gray wolves if numbers meet specific thresholds: Minnesota - 1,200, Michigan - 150, Wisconsin - 150. If numbers fall below these levels, management is determined by the Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary of the Interior can temporarily classify gray wolf populations in the Western Great Lakes states as endangered or threatened until their numbers reach specific thresholds for 2 consecutive years. Gray wolves in Arizona and New Mexico are exempt from certain regulations. Gray wolves in Arizona and New Mexico are not considered endangered or threatened under this Act unless their total population falls below 100 wolves, in which case state management authority can be granted. The populations of gray wolves in certain States may be temporarily treated as endangered or threatened species until their numbers reach a certain level for 2 consecutive years, as defined by the Secretary. The term \"gray wolf\" includes various taxonomic groups associated with the species. The term 'Northern Rocky Mountain distinct population segment' refers to a specific group of gray wolves identified by the US Fish and Wildlife Service in a final rule from 2008. The term 'Western Great Lakes distinct population' is also mentioned. The term 'Western Great Lakes distinct population segment' refers to a specific group of gray wolves identified by the US Fish and Wildlife Service in a final rule from 2007."
