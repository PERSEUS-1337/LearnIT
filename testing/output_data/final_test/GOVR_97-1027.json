Funding for the program ranged from $300 to $400 million per year between FY1993 and FY2004, with most projects focused on Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. The Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Program, established by Congress in 1991, aims to reduce the threat of nuclear and other weapons in the former Soviet Union. The program focuses on destroying weapons of mass destruction, safeguarding them, establishing safeguards against proliferation, and preventing the diversion of scientific expertise. While most Members of Congress support the program's objectives, some have questioned its effectiveness in enhancing U.S. security. Many question the effectiveness of the CTR programs in reducing threats to the United States, suggesting that defense funds could be better allocated elsewhere. However, supporters argue that CTR programs can help prevent proliferation and enhance U.S. security, advocating for increased funding. The initial purpose of U.S. assistance under the Nunn-Lugar amendment was seen as an emergency response to potential chaos following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The dissolution of the Soviet Union raised concerns about the control of nuclear weapons, materials, and knowledge. Senator Nunn highlighted the growing danger of proliferation as the Soviet economy weakened. The United States faced challenges in ensuring control over these weapons amidst political and economic chaos. The United States faced challenges in ensuring control over nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons in the former Soviet Union. Despite initial concerns, CTR programs have been successful in reducing the threat to the United States by deactivating thousands of nuclear weapons. Former Secretary of Defense William Perry referred to CTR as \"defense by other means.\" The CTR programs have successfully reduced the threat to the United States by deactivating thousands of nuclear weapons in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. These efforts also help safeguard nuclear warheads and materials, reducing the risk of proliferation and fostering cooperation between the United States and recipient nations. Members of Congress and analysts have expressed concerns about proliferation risks from nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union. Experts highlighted the proliferation risks of nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union due to inadequate control and accounting systems. Reports of smugglers transporting nuclear materials into Europe raise concerns about potential sale to nations like Libya or Iran, or terrorist groups. While these groups may lack the expertise to build nuclear weapons, the threat remains. Congress expanded the CTR programs in response to concerns about the proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological materials from insecure Russian facilities. This included increasing funds for security at facilities with nuclear materials and emphasizing the need for security at facilities with materials that could be used in chemical or biological weapons. The financial crisis in Russia in 1998 further intensified these concerns. In response to the financial crisis in Russia in 1998, Congress addressed concerns about proliferation of weapons of mass destruction expertise in the former Soviet Union. The Clinton Administration requested funds to assist Russia in safeguarding weapons materials and finding alternative employment for weapons scientists. However, some in Congress questioned the effectiveness of these programs and reduced funding for them. In January 2001, a DOE task force called for increased funding to stem proliferation from Russia's nuclear facilities. The DOE task force called for increased funding of $30 billion over 10 years to address the urgent national security threat of weapons of mass destruction or weapons-usable materials being stolen from Russia's nuclear facilities and used by terrorists or hostile nations. The Bush Administration expanded the CTR program to keep weapons of mass destruction away from terrorists in the former Soviet States. The CTR program has expanded its strategic focus to support the war on terrorism by increasing funding for export and border control programs, efforts to prevent knowledge leakage from the former Soviet Union, and locating radiological sources. These initiatives aim to prevent proliferation of nuclear materials for use in dirty bombs, rather than eliminating nuclear weapons in the former Soviet states as initially expected. The CTR program was established to safeguard and dismantle nuclear, chemical, and other weapons left vulnerable after the Soviet Union's demise. The implementation process was slower and more complex than anticipated, involving various U.S. government agencies. The Department of Defense provided funding and policy direction, while the State Department led negotiations for necessary agreements. The State Department led negotiations for agreements under the CTR program and coordinated policies between U.S. agencies and recipient nations. The Department of Energy's programs focus on improving security at facilities with nuclear materials and funding employment opportunities for weapons scientists. The Department of Commerce has also been involved in projects related to effective export establishment. The Department of Defense, through various organizations, manages different aspects of the CTR program. The Cooperative Threat Reduction Office, under the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, leads in developing U.S. policy objectives and identifying projects. The Joint Chiefs of Staff and Military Services provide advice on program goals. The CTR Program Office, under the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology, helps plan future programs and contracts with U.S. firms. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency, formed in 1998, manages the Cooperative Threat Reduction program and implements projects. The United States has negotiated agreements with recipient nations to establish legal frameworks for CTR projects. The United States and recipient nations negotiate agreements for CTR projects, outlining project details and funding commitments. Administration must notify Congress before obligating funds for a project. Once agreements are completed, funds can be used for contractor fees and equipment costs. The Department of Defense divides the CTR program into three project areas: destruction and dismantlement, chain of custody, and demilitarization. Funds are allocated to projects in each area, with expenditures dispersed as work progresses. Delays in the program have been addressed by improving implementation efforts in recent years. The CTR program is divided into three project areas: destruction and dismantlement, chain of custody, and demilitarization. Projects in the destruction and dismantlement category aim to eliminate nuclear, chemical, and other weapons. The United States is assisting countries like Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan in removing warheads and deactivating missiles. The United States is assisting Russia in designing a destruction facility for its chemical weapons stockpile. Projects include enhancing safety, security, and control over nuclear weapons. Previous projects provided Russia with protective gear and improved transportation for warheads. The CTR program is also funding projects to improve security and accounting systems at storage facilities for nuclear weapons and materials. Demilitarization efforts aim to reduce theft and losses at nuclear storage facilities. Projects encourage Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan to convert military efforts to peaceful purposes. International Science and Technology Centers provide grants for scientists to pursue peaceful projects. Funds support converting defense facilities in the former Soviet Union and military-to-military contacts for better protection of weapons and technology. The CTR programs train military officials in other nations to protect weapons and technology. Congress has shown support for the programs despite some members seeking funding reductions. The Senate generally supports higher funding levels compared to the House. The Nunn-Lugar Amendment received funding support from Congress, with $400 million authorized in FY1992 and additional funds in subsequent years. The Clinton Administration requested and Congress approved $400 million annually for CTR programs in FY1994 and FY1995. In FY1996, Congress approved $300 million for Defense Department funds, along with additional funding from the State Department and Department of Energy for ongoing projects. In FY1997, the Clinton Administration requested $327.9 million in DOD funds for the CTR program. The House approved $302.9 million, but the Senate added $37 million, bringing the total to $364.9 million. Additionally, the Senate added $57 million to the Department of Energy's $95 million request for materials control and accounting programs in the former Soviet Union. These additions were included in the final version of the FY1997 Defense Authorization Act. For FY1998, the Administration requested $382.2 million in DOD funds and $167 million in Department of Energy funds, with the House approving $284.7 million in DOD funds. The House rejected funding for chemical weapons destruction, nuclear reactor core conversion, and nuclear weapons storage security in FY1998. The Senate approved $382.2 million for DOD and $167 million for DOE. The House accepted the Senate provisions, and Congress approved the full request in the FY1998 Defense Authorization Act. For FY1999, the Clinton Administration requested $442.4 million in DOD funds and $167 million in DOE funds. The Senate approved $440.4 million for DOD, while the House approved only $414.4 million. The House reduced funding for chemical weapons destruction activities by $53.4 million and added $31.4 million for strategic arms elimination activities in Russia and Ukraine. The House National Security Committee noted that strategic offensive arms pose a direct threat to U.S. security, while Russia's chemical weapons pose more of an environmental problem. The Conference Committee approved $440.4 million without reallocating funds from chemical weapons destruction to strategic offensive arms destruction. Congress also approved $172 million in DOE funds, with an additional $5 million for the Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention Program. The Clinton Administration requested $475.5 million in DOD funds for CTR programs in FY2000, with the Senate approving the full request but the House only approving $444.1 million and eliminating funding for a chemical weapons destruction facility. The Services Committee expressed concerns about U.S. funding for Russia's chemical weapons destruction program, questioning its nonproliferation benefits. They mandated focusing on improving security at existing chemical weapons storage facilities. The Conference Committee approved $475.5 million for CTR programs but rejected funding for a new chemical weapons destruction facility. Congress approved $145 million for DOE's MCP&A program but reduced funding for the Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention and Nuclear Cities Initiative programs. The Clinton Administration requested $458.4 million for CTR in its FY2001 budget. The Senate Armed Services Committee approved the full amount but limited funds for the construction of a chemical weapons destruction facility until certain conditions were met by Russia. The House, however, eliminated funding for certain programs. The House eliminated funding for the chemical weapons destruction facility and provided $433.4 million for CTR in contrast to the Clinton Administration's request for $458.4 million. Congress approved funding for the Department of Energy's programs and the Bush Administration requested $403 million for CTR in FY2002. The Bush Administration requested $403 million for CTR funding in FY2002, a reduction of $40 million from the previous year. Despite the decrease, support for the CTR program remained strong as certain projects had already received full funding in previous years. The House and Senate approved the funding request, including $50 million for chemical weapons destruction in Russia. The Administration also reduced funding for the Department of Energy's MPC&A program. After the September 11 attacks, Congress restored funding for the NCI program to around $179 million in FY2001, with an additional $120 million in the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill. The Bush Administration sought to reduce funding for the NCI program to $6.6 million and consolidate it with the IPP program. However, Congress combined the two programs into the Russian Transition Initiative, increasing funding to around $42 million and adding $15 million more in the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill. The Bush Administration also conducted a review of U.S. nonproliferation programs with Russia in 2001. The Bush Administration conducted a review of U.S. nonproliferation programs with Russia in 2001. Despite initial concerns, the Administration announced an increase in funding and expansion of some programs in FY2003, with a focus on DOE programs. The CTR Program budget is expected to increase by around 10%, with a total request of $416.7 million for FY2003. Funding was also increased for the Shchuch'ye chemical weapons destruction facility and biological weapons nonproliferation programs. The FY2003 budget increased funding for biological weapons nonproliferation programs. The House and Senate approved the Administration's request, with the House reducing funding for the chemical weapons destruction facility. The final language in the FY2003 Defense Authorization Bill retained the reduction in funding for Shchuch'ye, allowing the Administration to use the removed funds for other projects related to nuclear weapons storage and elimination. The Bush Administration requested $450.8 million for DOD's CTR program in FY2004, with an increase in funding for Shchuch'ye to accelerate construction. Funding for strategic offensive arms reduction was reduced due to completed work and unexpended FY2003 funds. The House and Senate approved the request, with the House reducing funding for Shchuch'ye and linking U.S. funding to commitments from Russia and other nations. The Conference Committee adopted the Senate's position. The Conference Committee approved the Administration's request for $200.3 million for Shchuch'ye without restrictions on the U.S. contribution. Congress expanded the mandate of CTR programs to include preventing diversion of scientific expertise, demilitarization of defense industries, establishing science and technology centers, and expanding military-to-military contacts between the U.S. and former Soviet republics. In FY1994, Congress expanded the mandate of CTR programs to include environmental restoration at former military sites and housing for demobilized military officers. The Defense Enterprise Fund was established to support defense conversion efforts in the former Soviet Union. However, the 104th Congress reduced the mandate for CTR programs in FY1996 by prohibiting the use of funds for peacekeeping exercises or military officer housing. In FY1996, Congress restricted CTR funds from being used for peacekeeping exercises or military officer housing. The restrictions expanded in FY1997 with added prohibitions on environmental restoration, job retraining, and defense conversion. In FY2000, Congress made these prohibitions permanent but also increased funding for threat reduction programs in other areas. In FY2000, Congress limited the mandate for the CTR program by eliminating funding for certain facilities and allocating funds for biological weapons proliferation prevention activities in Russia. In FY2000, Congress limited funding for a facility to destroy chemical weapons and prohibited the use of funds for conventional weapons. Oversight of CTR projects has increased over the years. In FY2000, Congress limited funding for a facility to destroy chemical weapons and prohibited the use of funds for conventional weapons. Oversight of CTR projects has increased over the years, with Congress adding reporting requirements and expressing concerns about Russia's financial commitment to the programs. The slow pace of implementation was a key concern for Congress during the early years of CTR efforts. The Bush and Clinton Administrations had only spent around ten percent of the $1.2 billion allocated for CTR projects, with $329 million of the original funding lapsing by the end of 1994. Congress requested more transparency on Russia's financial commitment and required re-submission of certifications on arms control compliance and weapons modernization. Analysts have highlighted factors that slowed obligating funds for CTR projects in the program's early years. The Bush Administration did not initially support the program, leading to delays in identifying specific projects. Negotiations for umbrella agreements with recipient nations also took several years to complete. Congress authorized U.S. assistance in late 1991, with agreements signed with Russia in June 1992, Belarus in October 1992, Ukraine in October 1993, and Kazakhstan in December 1993. Negotiations for specific CTR projects have been time-consuming. The United States faced challenges in identifying responsible officials in newly independent states for CTR projects. Overcoming suspicions and negotiating access to sensitive facilities in Russia also posed difficulties. Delays in obligating funds were due to standard contracting procedures and the need to pay U.S. contractors for project implementation. The Department of Defense established a separate CTR program office in early 1994 to expedite the contracting process for projects. The Clinton Administration's political commitment and completed negotiations with recipient nations accelerated the program, with obligations increasing from $100 million in early 1994 to over $3.5 billion by May 2003. Expenditures also rose, with nearly $2.9 billion spent by mid-2003. Congress expressed concerns about accountability for funds spent on CTR projects. In response to concerns about accountability for funds spent on CTR projects, Congress mandated audits and examinations to ensure assistance was used as intended. The General Accounting Office reported in 1995 that audits had begun in Russia and Ukraine, raising new questions about the use of U.S. assistance. The General Accounting Office raised concerns about the use of U.S. assistance for scientists receiving grants from the International Science and Technology Centers (ISTC) who may still be involved in weapons work. Critics of the CTR program argued that supporting these scientists was indirectly supporting Russian weapons programs, but the State Department clarified that the grants were meant to supplement their income from other institutes to prevent knowledge and skills from being sold to other nations. The State Department ensured that scientists receiving ISTC grants did not sell their knowledge to other nations. In 2003, concerns were raised about the misuse of funds in a facility built to eliminate rocket propellant in Russia. Representative Duncan Hunter criticized the wastage of nearly $100 million on the facility. To address this, managers were mandated to oversee CTR projects to ensure they meet their objectives. The Clinton Administration believed the CTR program was beneficial for U.S. national security. The Clinton Administration praised the CTR program for its contributions to U.S. national security, citing achievements such as the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan, reductions of strategic weapons in Russia, and enhanced safety of fissile material. Some supporters argue that the projects could have done more. Some supporters of the CTR argue that the projects focused more on security and control of nuclear weapons rather than materials that can be used for nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons. They believe that the leakage of these materials poses a greater threat to the U.S. than the illegal sale of warheads. Senators Nunn, Lugar, and Domenici proposed expanding funding for CTR programs to address these concerns. The bill aims to increase funding for efforts to secure and control materials posing a proliferation risk, with some concerns raised about potentially subsidizing the Russian defense establishment. Some Members of Congress remain concerned about subsidizing the Russian defense establishment, questioning Russia's willingness to eliminate weapons systems without U.S. assistance despite its obligations under the START I Treaty. Congress prohibited funding for a chemical weapons destruction facility in the FY2000 Defense Authorization Act due to concerns raised by a GAO study about its impact on U.S. nonproliferation objectives and national security. Funding for a second wing at a plutonium storage facility in Mayak was conditioned on U.S.-Russian agreement on transparency measures. Supporters of the CTR programs argue that U.S. funds do not support the Russian defense industry or other military activities. The United States provides Russia with technology, expertise, and in-kind assistance for specific projects related to nuclear weapons elimination. Critics argue that the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program has not led to the dismantlement of any nuclear warheads, but supporters believe it incentivizes denuclearization efforts. The Clinton Administration and supporters of the CTR program aimed to facilitate transportation, storage, safeguarding, and destruction of nuclear weapons, not directly dismantle warheads. Critics question if U.S. assistance has achieved the goals attributed to the program, such as the completed denuclearization of Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus. The CTR program aimed to facilitate the destruction of nuclear weapons in certain nations, but the actual impact of the aid delivered was limited. Critics questioned if the program achieved its goals, such as the denuclearization of Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus. The Clinton Administration argued that the program demonstrated the U.S.'s commitment to safe weapon elimination. The Clinton Administration noted that promises of U.S. assistance played a significant role in convincing Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan to eliminate their nuclear weapons. This assistance helped these nations to fulfill their commitment to become nuclear-free and join the NPT as non-nuclear weapons states. The Clinton Administration acknowledged that Russia began eliminating its strategic offensive weapons under START I even before receiving U.S. assistance. U.S. assistance can ensure a safe and secure reduction process, accelerate the process, and help Russia reach treaty limits earlier. The CTR program is divided into destruction and dismantlement, chain of custody, and demilitarization projects. Several factors have influenced the funding balance among CTR program areas, with a shift in focus over time. Early projects focused on safe transportation of warheads, while recent funding has been directed towards missile and launcher elimination. Funding for demilitarization efforts has been limited, with some projects not receiving congressional funding. The funding balance for CTR programs has been influenced by various factors, including political and organizational priorities. The Department of Defense has had a significant influence due to its budget containing funds for CTR programs, leading to a focus on dismantlement and destruction activities. Recipient nations' officials' preferences and priorities have also impacted funding decisions. Officials in non-Russian republics have requested financial assistance to eliminate nuclear weapons on their territories, leading to increased funding for CTR programs. However, cooperation from Russian officials, particularly the Ministry of Atomic Energy (MINATOM), has been challenging, with reluctance to grant access to sensitive facilities storing nuclear materials. This has slowed down project implementation. The United States is assisting Russia in designing and constructing a facility at Mayak to store materials from nuclear weapons. The project has faced delays due to disagreements over design plans and construction schedules. Despite resolving some issues in early 1997, the project could slow down again due to financial contributions from MINATOM and transparency measures not being agreed upon. Some in Congress disagree with the Clinton and Bush Administrations' priorities for CTR programs, leading to debates over funding. While most support U.S. assistance with dismantling nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union, some question the amount of aid provided for projects not directly related to U.S. national security. Some Members of Congress have debated whether the United States should fund the elimination of Russia's chemical weapons. The House has cut funding for the chemical weapons destruction facility in FY1998 and FY1999, but it was restored by the Conference Committee. The House prioritized strategic offensive arms elimination over chemical weapons destruction, stating that Russia's chemical weapons stockpile does not directly threaten the U.S. Supporters of U.S. assistance for chemical weapons destruction argue that it enhances U.S. security by reducing the threat from Russian weapons and promoting Russian compliance with international agreements. However, funding for the chemical weapons destruction facility was eliminated in FY2000 and FY2001. The House approved $50 million for chemical weapons destruction activities in FY2002, including $35 million for a facility in Russia. The Bush Administration requested increased funding for FY2003 and FY2004, which was eventually approved by Congress. The House sought to reduce funding levels and link it to contributions from other nations. Members of Congress believe chain of custody projects benefit U.S. security. Most Members of Congress believe chain of custody projects benefit U.S. security by reducing proliferation risks. Some have questioned the U.S. approach and the need for additional funds, as agreements with Russia were not yet finalized. Despite concerns, Congress approved $100.7 million for chain of custody activities in FY1998, including support for a storage facility at Mayak, containers for fissile materials, and security improvements at weapons storage areas. Some in Congress feel that the Administration has not allocated enough resources for ensuring the safety and security of materials used for production. The Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act of 1996 was sponsored by Senators Nunn, Lugar, and Domenici due to concerns about the U.S.'s ability to deter or respond to terrorist attacks involving nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons. Additional funds were added to the CTR budget for materials protection, control, and accounting projects, as well as efforts to dismantle facilities that produced such weapons. Congress approved extra funds in FY1998 for the dismantlement of chemical and biological weapons facilities and for materials protection projects. In FY1997, Congress mandated $10 million for a DOE project to help Russia design a nuclear power reactor. Despite initial rejection, $41 million was approved in FY1998. Congress also approved $29.8 million in FY1999 for the project, with management moving back to DOD. Demilitarization programs were added to the CTR mandate in FY1993, with ongoing support for International Science and Technology Centers in Moscow and Kiev. Some criticism exists for projects converting Russia's defense industry plants to peaceful endeavors. The Clinton Administration responded to criticisms about defense conversion projects in Russia by stating that the funding was meant to prevent the reopening of dormant facilities producing weapons of mass destruction. U.S. assistance aimed to promote conversion by encouraging American investment in Russian enterprises, rather than converting the entire defense industry. Congress remained unconvinced by these arguments. The FY1998 Defense Authorization Act amendment prohibits CTR funds for defense conversion in the former Soviet Union. Ongoing projects funded privately or through specific programs will continue. Congress opposes using CTR funds for housing and environmental projects. Secretary Perry argued that housing construction is necessary for demobilization of military units in former Soviet republics facing severe shortages. Without housing assistance, nuclear weapons elimination would be hindered. Both Ukraine and Belarus sought U.S. assistance for deactivating nuclear weapons and restoring the environment due to Soviet Union's impact on their territories. Congress debated the use of funds for these projects, with some suggesting they could be better used for housing U.S. veterans. As a result, Congress banned the use of CTR funds for housing and environmental restoration in certain Defense Authorization Acts. The FY1997 and FY1998 Defense Authorization Acts raised concerns about the final costs of CTR projects and Russia's limited contribution. The Clinton Administration acknowledged Russia's economic weakness but disagreed that the US would cover Russia's share. Congress included provisions in the FY1998 Defense Authorization Act to limit US contributions and ensure Russia's participation in projects. Some Members of Congress believe that U.S. dismantlement assistance is \"subsidizing\" Russia's modernization programs by covering the costs of arms elimination projects in Russia. Congress has sought to limit the U.S. contribution to certain projects and ensure that Russia shares the costs. Some Members of Congress believe U.S. dismantlement assistance is subsidizing Russia's modernization programs by covering arms elimination costs. Congress has sought to limit the U.S. contribution to weapons systems and the plutonium storage facility at Mayak, with disagreements on funding amounts. Section 1407 of the FY1998 Defense Authorization Act requires an agreement on total costs before CTR funds can be used. Supporters and critics agree U.S. assistance should be linked to recipient nation policies, but disagree on which activities and standards should be applied. When Congress first passed the Nunn-Lugar amendment in 1991, it mandated that the President certify annually that recipient nations are committed to dismantling weapons, forgoing military modernization exceeding defense needs, and complying with arms control agreements. The Clinton Administration consistently certified Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan until FY1997 when certification was withdrawn. The Clinton Administration withdrew certification for Belarus in FY1998 due to human rights abuses, sparking debate over the certification process. Critics argue that relying on statements from Russian leaders for certification leaves room for interpretation, despite concerns about Russian activities violating arms control agreements. The Bush Administration refused to certify Russian compliance with arms control agreements in 2002, seeking permission from Congress to waive the certification requirements. Critics argue that the United States lacks sufficient information for certifications, citing examples like the Clinton Administration certifying Russia's non-use of fissile materials based on a uranium sale agreement. The United States has concerns about Russia's handling of uranium and plutonium from nuclear weapons. Russia has not provided clear information on its plans for the remaining uranium, and the US doubts the origin of plutonium placed in storage facilities. Critics question the lack of transparency in Russia's nuclear material management. Critics question the conditions in current legislation allowing recipient nations to pursue activities that may threaten U.S. national security. They argue that Russia's ongoing weapons modernization programs indicate a lack of commitment to weapons dismantlement. Critics claim that Russia's military modernization, including the production of the SS-27 ICBM and construction of an underground military complex, raises concerns. The Clinton Administration acknowledges Russia's modernization but argues it is not in violation of arms control treaties. The focus is on replacing multiple warhead missiles with single-warhead systems to reduce destabilizing threats. Russia is required to eliminate many multiple warhead missiles under START II. Russia must eliminate multiple warhead missiles under START II, leading to the production of new single-warhead systems. The underground facility at Yamanatau is questioned due to Russia's economic crisis, but not seen as a current threat to the US. There are proposals to change the linkage between US assistance and Russian policies, including stricter certification standards. Removing the \"committed to\" section of legislation could limit the Administration's flexibility in determining aid recipients. The proposed change in certification standards for U.S. assistance could limit the Administration's flexibility in determining aid recipients. Congress has considered requiring certifications for compliance with arms control agreements, such as chemical and biological weapons projects, or certifying projects in the U.S. national security interest. Some suggest altering legislation to require certifications for Russia as well. Some supporters of CTR programs object to proposed changes in legislation that would require the U.S. to certify Russia's cessation of nuclear modernization programs. They argue that strict compliance with arms control agreements is challenging and that disrupting ongoing CTR projects may not be justified. Additionally, CTR projects, like building a chemical weapons destruction facility, could help recipient nations meet their arms control obligations. Some CTR supporters believe that cutting off assistance in response to questions about Russia's compliance with chemical weapons agreements could be counterproductive. They also argue that linking CTR assistance to Russian nuclear weapons modernization may have unintended consequences, as Russia may prioritize modernization over eliminating older weapons. Additionally, during debates over Defense Authorization Bills, some House members proposed linking CTR assistance to various Russian defense and foreign policies. Some believed that linking CTR assistance to a broad range of issues could discourage Russian activities inconsistent with U.S. security interests. However, others argued that the low value of U.S. CTR assistance would not provide much leverage over Russian actions, and Russia may forgo aid if needed for national security. Some stated that the CTR program was not the appropriate place to address these issues. When Congress first passed the Nunn-Lugar amendment in November 1991, it aimed to provide quick U.S. assistance due to concerns about nuclear control in the Soviet Union. Despite the original reasons for assistance no longer being relevant, Congress continues to strongly support the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. However, some demilitarization programs are prohibited from receiving CTR expenditures. Representative Dellums emphasized that using the CTR program to address broader foreign policy concerns could harm U.S. interests. Congress has questioned progress on demilitarization programs and approved more money for CTR programs to enhance nuclear material security. Future debates over CTR funding are expected, with concerns about security at nuclear facilities and potential leaks to rogue nations or terrorist groups. Members may continue to support U.S. involvement in securing materials, but questions remain about the value of U.S. assistance to Russia and other former Soviet republics."
