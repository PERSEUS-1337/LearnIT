U.S. agricultural imports are expected to reach $106.5 billion in FY2012, a record high and a $12 billion increase over FY2011. The U.S. agricultural trade surplus for FY2012 is forecasted to be $24.5 billion, below the all-time high of $42.9 billion in FY2011. Wheat, corn, soybeans, oilseeds, and cotton are major U.S. agricultural exports, with cotton being the most export-dependent field crop. Livestock products are less export-dependent than crops, with beef exports slowly recovering. The export share of beef production in the United States is forecasted to be 11% in 2012, while pork exports are expected to reach 22.1% and poultry exports to 18.3%. Horticultural products are the largest category of U.S. agricultural exports, with a forecasted value of $28 billion in FY2012, followed by oilseeds and oilseed products at $25 billion. Field crop exports, livestock and poultry products, bulk agricultural exports, intermediate products, and consumer-ready products are all significant components of U.S. agricultural exports. Bulk agricultural exports like wheat, coarse grains, cotton, and soybeans were the main focus until 1990, but high-value products have surpassed their value since FY1991. Livestock and poultry products are forecasted to exceed $24 billion in FY2012, while field crop exports are expected to account for over $35 billion. In FY2011, high-value agricultural exports exceeded bulk exports, accounting for 56.3% of total U.S. agricultural exports. Canada and Mexico are top markets, with exports valued at $19 billion and $17.5 billion respectively. China, Japan, and the EU-27 are also significant export destinations. Total U.S. agricultural exports to NAFTA partners are forecasted at $36.5 billion for FY2012. The United States is a major supplier of wheat and wheat products to the world market, with a forecast export market share of 18.6% in marketing year 2011/2012. Thailand is the world's major rice exporter, with Vietnam emerging as a major competitor. India and Pakistan are also forecasted to have significant export market shares. In 2011/2012, the United States is the fifth-largest rice exporter with a forecast share of 9.6%. The US has the largest export market share for corn at 44.4%, while Brazil has increased its share of world corn exports. Brazil is the main supplier of soybeans with a share of 40.7%, followed by the US at 37.4%. U.S. cotton exports are estimated to be 30.1% of the world total in 2011/2012. Australia, Uzbekistan, and West/Central African countries are major players in beef exports. Australia leads with 16.8% forecasted share in 2012, while the US is forecasted at 15.2%. The US dominates pork exports with a 35.3% share, competing with the EU and Canada. Brazil is the top poultry exporter with a 36.1% forecasted share in 2012, surpassing the US and the EU. In the global market, New Zealand and the EU are leading suppliers of dairy products, while Brazil dominates as the top exporter of sugar. The United States is a sugar importer with minimal exports. High-value horticultural products are also significant in global trade. In FY2012, U.S. agricultural imports are forecasted to be $106.5 billion, with products like fruits, nuts, vegetables, wine, and malt beverages being the largest category. Livestock and dairy, grains and feeds, and oilseeds and products are also significant imports. NAFTA partners Canada and Mexico, as well as the EU-27, are expected to be major sources of agricultural imports. Additionally, Indonesia and Brazil are forecasted to ship significant amounts of farm products to the United States in FY2012. In 2005, the United States signed a free trade agreement (FTA) that is expected to bring in $2.4 billion worth of agricultural imports in FY2012. Colombia, another FTA partner, is forecasted to export $2.6 billion of farm products to the United States in the same year. U.S. agricultural exports to Asia have seen consistent growth due to economic expansion in the region. The EU has been a stable market for U.S. agricultural exports since 1992, with little growth. Agricultural exports to the former Soviet Union countries have decreased since 1992. On the other hand, exports to Latin America, including Mexico, and Canada have increased significantly since the early 1990s, partly due to NAFTA. Japan, like the EU, has been a slow-growing market for U.S. agricultural exports. U.S. agricultural exports have seen significant growth in various regions since the early 1990s. Exports to China have grown rapidly, fueled by GDP growth rates exceeding 9%. Southeast Asia and South Asia have also shown increased demand for U.S. agricultural products. Trade with Canada, Mexico, and Latin America, particularly through NAFTA, has been strong. Japan, similar to the EU, has been a slow-growing market for U.S. agricultural exports. The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (2008 farm bill) provides support to U.S. agricultural producers through 2012. U.S. agricultural exports to Latin America are expected to reach $12.3 billion in FY2012. Budgetary outlays for U.S. agricultural programs were $139.3 billion in FY2011. The United States provided an estimated $25.6 billion in agricultural support to producers in 2010. In 2010, the United States had a Producer Support Estimate (PSE) of 7%, the third-lowest among OECD countries. The PSE measures assistance to producers through monetary transfers from consumers or taxpayers. The decrease in PSE from 2009 was attributed to a decrease in market price support for dairy. Over time, producer support in the U.S. has decreased from 22% in 1986-1988 to 7% in 2010. Sugar is the most highly subsidized product in the U.S. The United States is the world's largest exporter of agricultural products, with tariffs and tariff quotas applied to products entering the country. The average applied tariff for agricultural products is 8.9%, with about 170 tariff lines subject to tariff quotas. Sugar is the most highly subsidized product in the U.S., with a provisional single commodity transfer estimated at 28.3% of the gross value of sugar production in 2010. The United States made export subsidy reduction commitments for 13 commodities under the WTO Agreement on Agriculture. The 2008 farm bill repealed the Export Enhancement Program (EEP) authority, except for dairy products. The Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) allows for cash bonuses to dairy exporters and was reauthorized through 2012. DEIP bonuses were awarded in FY2009 and FY2010, totaling $21 million. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) operates the program. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), a chartered public corporation operated by USDA, provides credit guarantees to finance U.S. agricultural exports through programs like GSM-102 and Facilities Guarantee Program (FGP). In FY2011, $4.1 billion of agricultural exports were tallied under GSM-102, with $5.4 billion guaranteed for FY2012. Additionally, the CCC operates export market development programs like the Market Access Program (MAP) and the Foreign Market Development Program (FMDP) to assist producer groups. The United States is the world's leading supplier of food aid, providing more than half of the global total through programs like P.L. 480 (Food for Peace Program). Wheat, rice, and vegetable oils are main commodities provided, with higher-value products available in special feeding programs. USDA and the U.S. Agency for International Development share responsibility for implementing food aid programs. Food aid is provided on a grant basis through Title II of the Food for Peace Act of 2008. Two additional food aid programs, under Section 416(b) of the Agricultural Act of 1949 and the Food for Progress Act of 1985, provide surplus CCC inventories as donations and concessional credit terms or commodity donations to support emerging democracies or countries making free market economic reforms.
