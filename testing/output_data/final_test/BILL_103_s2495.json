    "content": "The \"Gift of Life Congressional Medal Act of 1994\" authorizes the creation of a bronze medal by the Secretary of the Treasury to honor organ and tissue donors and their families. Eligibility requirements are outlined in the Act. Eligibility requirements for the Gift of Life Congressional Medal include organ donors, tissue donors, or their families being eligible for the medal. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish an application procedure for documentation to determine eligibility for the medal. The Secretary of Treasury delivers medals to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who arranges for their presentation to eligible recipients through organ procurement organizations. Only one medal can be presented to a family, except in cases where multiple family members are organ or tissue donors. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may present a medal to organ or tissue donors. The Secretary of the Treasury can create and sell duplicate medals to recipients under certain regulations. The price of duplicate medals must cover the production cost. These medals are considered national medals under the law. Additionally, there is a general waiver of procurement regulations. SEC. 7 of the Act provides a general waiver of procurement regulations for goods or services needed to implement the Act, except for equal employment opportunity laws. SEC. 8 addresses the solicitation of donations. The Secretary of the Treasury can partner with the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network to raise funds for medals. Funds received will be paid to the Treasury, with a limit of 5% for administrative costs. The Secretary of the Treasury will deposit all funds received under subsection (b)(1) into the Numismatic Public Enterprise Fund and charge the fund for all medal-related expenditures. The issuance of medals authorized under this Act must result in no net cost to the Government. SEC. 9. ORGAN AND TISSUE DEFINED. The term \"organ\" includes the human kidney, liver, heart, lung, pancreas, and other specified organs.
