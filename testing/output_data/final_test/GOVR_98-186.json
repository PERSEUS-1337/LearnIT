    "content": "The American impeachment process allows the legislative branch to remove federal officers for treason, bribery, or high crimes. Impeachment proceedings in the 111th Congress included the impeachment of Judge G. Thomas Porteous, Jr. on four articles of impeachment. Calendar No. 170. On March 11, 2010, the House impeached Judge Porteous after one hour of debate with unanimous votes on each article of impeachment. House Managers presented the impeachment resolution to the Senate on March 17, 2010. The Senate issued a summons to Judge Porteous to respond to the articles by April 7, 2010, and appointed an Impeachment Trial Committee. The impeachment investigation began during the 110th Congress. The United States certified to the House of Representatives its determination that impeachment of Judge Porteous may be warranted. The House adopted H.Res. 1448 directing the House Judiciary Committee to inquire about impeachment. A Task Force on Judicial Impeachment was established by the House Judiciary Committee to pursue the investigation. The investigation was not completed during the 110th Congress. The House passed H.Res. 15 on January 13, 2009, giving the House Judiciary Committee authority to continue the investigation in the 111th Congress. The House Judiciary Committee continued its investigation of Judge Porteous's conduct in the 111th Congress. On March 11, 2010, the House voted to impeach Judge Porteous and approved four articles of impeachment by unanimous votes. Representative Schiff, Representative Zoe Lofgren, Representative Johnson, Representative Goodlatte, and Representative Sensenbrenner were appointed as Managers on the part of the House to conduct the impeachment proceedings. On March 17, 2010, House Managers appeared before the Senate to present impeachment resolution and articles against Judge Porteous. Senate agreed to resolutions, including serving summons on Judge Porteous to respond to articles by April 7, 2010. House Managers had until April 21, 2010, to respond. The House Managers filed their replication with the Senate on April 15, 2010, and made corrections to it in a letter filed on April 21, 2010. A second resolution created an Impeachment Trial Committee for Judge Porteous, with Senators appointed to serve on the committee. Senator McCaskill will chair the committee, and Senator Hatch will also serve. Senator McCaskill will chair the Senate Impeachment Trial Committee, with Senator Hatch as vice chairman. The committee submitted a certified record of its proceedings and a report summarizing the articles of impeachment and evidence. The full Senate relied on the committee's evidence and report, along with post-trial filings, to make determinations on conviction or acquittal. The full Senate heard oral arguments on pending motions and the merits of the case. After final arguments, the Senate went into closed-door deliberations and voted to convict Judge Porteous on all four articles of impeachment. The votes for conviction were unanimous on article I, 69 to 27 on article II, 88 to 8 on article III, and 90 to on article IV. Judge Porteous was convicted and removed from office by votes of 88 to 8 on article III and 90 to 6 on article IV. The Senate also voted 94 to 2 to disqualify him from holding any future federal office. This was one of two impeachment inquiries regarding federal judges in the 111th Congress. Another judge, Samuel B. Kent, was impeached by the House of Representatives on June 14, 2009. Judge Samuel B. Kent was issued a summons to respond to articles of impeachment by July 2, 2009. He resigned from the federal bench effective June 30, 2009, and his resignation was accepted on June 29, 2009. The House agreed not to pursue impeachment further on July 20, 2009. The Senate dismissed the articles of impeachment against former Judge Samuel B. Kent on July 22, 2009. The American impeachment system differs from its English counterpart, with English impeachments dating back to as early as 1376. The American impeachment system differs from its English counterpart, with English impeachments dating back to as early as 1376. In England, any person could be impeached by the House of Commons for any crime or misdemeanor, with penal sanctions upon conviction. In contrast, the American system is remedial, focusing on removal from office and disqualification from holding public trust, aiming to protect the public interest rather than punish the individual impeached. The American impeachment process is designed to protect the public interest rather than punish the individual impeached. The procedure draws guidance from British precedents, with key provisions outlining the roles of the House of Representatives and the Senate in the impeachment process. The Senate has the sole power to try impeachments, requiring a two-thirds majority for conviction, leading to removal from office and disqualification from holding future public office. The American impeachment process is designed to protect the public interest rather than punish the individual impeached. The President, Vice President, and civil Officers of the United States can be removed from office on impeachment for Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors. The President has the power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for offenses against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment. The Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury. Impeachment in the United States is reserved for \"civil Officers\" and requires allegations of treason, bribery, or high crimes. The House of Representatives decides on impeachment, while the Senate conducts the trial and makes the final decision on conviction with a two-thirds majority vote. The Senate must determine the judgment for an individual convicted on articles of impeachment, which can include removal from office and disqualification from holding future federal offices. A separate vote is required for the additional judgment of disqualification, with a simple majority vote. The President cannot grant executive clemency to prevent impeachment or trial. Impeachment conviction does not prevent criminal prosecution. The recent impeachments of federal judges show that impeachment can occur after criminal proceedings, and an acquittal in criminal court does not prevent impeachment. The constitutional framework for impeachments does not address all procedural issues, but resources are available to fill the void. Senate has the authority to try impeachments, with decisions made on questions raised during trials. In the impeachment trials of Judges Walter L. Nixon, Jr., and Alcee Hastings, challenges were made to the Senate's procedure under Rule XI. The cases were compared with Nixon v. United States and Hastings v. United States, highlighting the Senate's authority in impeachment trials. The committee appointed by the Senate for impeachment trials has the power to receive evidence and testimony, determine times and places for proceedings, and follow Senate rules. The committee must report its findings to the Senate, and the evidence and testimony received will be considered by the Senate. The Senate committee appointed for impeachment trials has the power to receive evidence and testimony, with the Senate having the right to determine competency, relevancy, and materiality. Former Judge Nixon challenged the Senate's conviction, seeking reinstatement of his salary and privileges, but the courts deemed his claim nonjusticiable. Judge Williams, in a court ruling, emphasized the Senate's exclusive authority in impeachment trials, stating that the Senate has sole discretion in choosing its procedures. The court applied the political question doctrine, declaring former Judge Nixon's challenge nonjusticiable. Judge Randolph concurred, asserting that the judiciary has no role in reviewing the Senate's procedural decisions due to the Constitution's grant of sole power to the Senate in trying impeachments. The Supreme Court ruled in the Nixon case on January 13, 1993, finding the issue nonjusticiable as impeachment proceedings are constitutionally committed to the legislative branch. Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion, emphasizing the Senate's exclusive authority in impeachment trials. The Supreme Court ruled in the Nixon case on January 13, 1993, finding impeachment proceedings nonjusticiable as they are constitutionally committed to the legislative branch. The Court emphasized the Senate's exclusive authority in impeachment trials, with Justice Stevens and Justice White providing concurring opinions. Justice White and Justice Blackmun found nothing in the Constitution to prevent the Court from considering the constitutional sufficiency of the Senate's Rule XI procedure. The Supreme Court ruled in the Nixon case that impeachment proceedings are nonjusticiable and exclusively within the Senate's authority. Justices White and Blackmun believed the Senate fulfilled its constitutional duty to \"try\" Judge Nixon. Justice Souter agreed that the case presented a nonjusticiable political question. The Impeachment Trial Clause gives the Senate the power to try impeachments, with procedural requirements. Justice Souter found that the impeachment case presented a non-justiciable political question due to the Senate's authority to \"try\" impeachments. He mentioned that judicial interference might be necessary if the Senate's actions seriously threatened the integrity of its results. The court in Hastings v. United States ruled that a life-tenured judge acquitted of felony charges cannot be impeached and tried for the same alleged indiscretion by a Senate committee. This decision was made despite potential prudential concerns and the impact on the Republic's authority. Judge Sporkin ruled in Hastings v. United States that the Senate impeachment conviction and judgment against former Judge Hastings should be vacated, and a new trial by the full Senate should be granted. This decision was based on the belief that the Rule XI procedure did not provide a fair \"trial\" before the full Senate, as each Senator should be present to judge credibility. Judge Sporkin ruled in Hastings v. United States that the Senate impeachment conviction against former Judge Hastings should be vacated, and a new trial by the full Senate should be granted. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated and remanded the decision for reconsideration in light of Nixon v. United States. Judge Sporkin then dismissed the case, reluctantly emphasizing the factual differences but concluding that the Nixon decision compelled dismissal. The House of Representatives procedures are outlined in Jefferson's Manual. Jefferson's Manual provides general procedural principles for the House of Representatives, referencing precedents from Hinds' and Cannon's Precedents. Deschler's Precedents and House Practice by Brown and Johnson are also valuable sources for exploring precedents in this area. The Senate conduct of impeachment trials is governed by the \"Rules of Procedure and Practice in the Senate when Sitting on Impeachment Trials,\" with the current form dating back to the 1986 impeachment proceedings against Judge Harry E. Claiborne. Procedure and Guidelines for Impeachment Trials in the Senate were prepared to assist Senators in understanding and utilizing the Senate impeachment trial procedure. Upon receipt of a message from the House of Representatives regarding impeachment, the Senate can revise its rules as needed. Before proceeding with an impeachment inquiry, the legislative branch must determine if the individual in question falls under the category of President, Vice President, or \"civil Officers of the United States\" for impeachment. In the history of the United States, there have been 16 full impeachment trials, with one additional trial that did not proceed after the judge resigned. The question of impeachment revolves around whether the conduct involved constitutes \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes or misdemeanors.\" In the history of the United States, there have been 16 full impeachment trials, with one additional trial that did not proceed after the judge resigned. An 18th Senate trial of George W. English and a 19th Senate trial of Samuel B. Kent also ended due to resignations and requests to dismiss the impeachment proceedings. In the history of the United States, there have been several notable impeachment trials involving various officials, including judges, presidents, and cabinet members. Several officials, including judges, presidents, and cabinet members, have been involved in impeachment trials in the United States. Eight judges were convicted in their impeachment trials, including Judge Pickering, Judge Humphreys, Judge Archbald, Judge Ritter, Judge Claiborne, Judge Hastings, Judge Nixon, and Judge Porteous. Additionally, there have been instances where the impeachment process was initiated in the House of Representatives but did not result in articles of impeachment. In 1872, an impeachment inquiry was initiated in the House of Representatives against District Judge Mark H. Delahay for \"high crimes and misdemeanors in office.\" However, Delahay resigned before articles of impeachment were prepared, leading to no further action by the House. Similar instances of impeachment resolutions or investigations against federal judges that did not result in articles of impeachment include cases involving Lebbeus R. Wilfley and Cornelius H. Hanford. Several federal judges faced impeachment inquiries or investigations, including Cornelius H. Hanford, Emory Speer, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, and others in the early 1900s. Several federal judges faced impeachment inquiries or investigations in the early 1900s, including Harry B. Anderson, James Lowell, Joseph Molyneaux, Samuel Alschuler, Albert Johnson, Albert Watson, Alfred Murrah, Stephen Chandler, Luther Bohanon, and William O. Douglas. In the 1970s, federal judges faced impeachment inquiries following a lawsuit filed by 140 federal judges seeking additional compensation and challenging the constitutionality of a one-House veto provision. In the 1970s, federal judges faced impeachment inquiries related to a lawsuit filed by 140 federal judges seeking additional compensation and challenging the constitutionality of a one-House veto provision. Resolutions were introduced to impeach judges involved in the case, but no further action was taken. Other inquiries into executive branch officers' conduct that did not result in Senate trials included cases involving various officials such as Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty and President Herbert Hoover. In the 1970s, federal judges faced impeachment inquiries, including cases involving officials like Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty and President Herbert Hoover. Other impeachment cases involved officials such as the Immigration and Naturalization Service of the Department of Labor, President Harry Truman, President Richard M. Nixon, and Andrew Young, United States Ambassador to the United Nations. However, many of these cases did not progress beyond committee or subcommittee referral. In the 1970s, there were impeachment resolutions directed at various officials, including the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, members of the Federal Open Market Committee, President Ronald Reagan, and President George W. Bush. These resolutions were referred to different committees for investigation. In the 2000s, there were several impeachment resolutions introduced, including ones targeting Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, President William Jefferson Clinton, Secretary of Defense Donald R. Rumsfeld, Vice President Richard B. Cheney, and Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales. These resolutions were referred to various committees for further investigation. The House Judiciary Committee investigated whether Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales should be impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors in 2007. The impeachment mechanism has been used to explore misconduct allegations against civil officers from both the judicial and executive branches, with few resulting in trials and even fewer leading to convictions. Despite being a cumbersome process that diverts time from other legislative business, impeachment serves as a means of monitoring and checking misconduct by officials through a legislative forum. The impeachment process serves as a constitutional effort to balance the branches of government by deterring unwarranted legislative intrusions. Impeachment trials have mainly involved officials from the executive or judicial branches, with the term \"civil Officers of the United States\" not clearly defined in the Constitution. Senator Blount was not convicted in his impeachment trial. During Senator Blount's impeachment trial, Congress debated whether a Senator could be impeached as a civil officer. The Senate ultimately decided that Senators were not subject to impeachment, leading to Blount's acquittal. The term \"civil officer\" for impeachment purposes has been a topic of discussion, with precedents showing that federal judges are included. Questions have arisen regarding the impeachment of other officials such as the congressional printer, a former vice-consul-general, and a territorial judge. Additionally, there have been debates on whether officers appointed in accordance with the Appointments Clause should be considered civil officers for impeachment purposes. The Appointments Clause of the Constitution, Art. II, Sec. 2, Cl. 2, outlines the process for appointing various government officials, with the Senate's advice and consent required for certain appointments. The argument relies on a Supreme Court statement in United States v. Mouat, emphasizing the importance of appointments by the President or authorized entities for an individual to hold a government position. The Belknap impeachment trial explored the issue of a federal official being subject to impeachment for acts committed while in office, even if they resign before being impeached. The Senate concluded that former Secretary of War Belknap could be tried by impeachment despite his resignation. This raises the fundamental issue each Congress faces when contemplating impeachment of a federal official. The issue each Congress faces when considering impeachment of a federal official is whether the conduct in question fits the constitutional criteria of \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\" Treason is defined in the Constitution and statute as levying war against the United States or aiding enemies. Bribery, not defined in the Constitution, is covered by a bribery statute. The phrase \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" is not clearly defined in the Constitution or statute, leading to considerable debate. While treason and bribery have clear meanings, the interpretation of this phrase has been a subject of confusion since the Constitutional Convention. Despite ongoing debate, no definitive list of conduct falling within this language has been established. The impeachment process does not preclude judicial action, and criminal conduct may also lead to impeachment. The timing of impeachment in relation to criminal prosecution remains uncertain. The impeachment process allows for removal of public officials for serious misconduct, even if it does not constitute a crime. Precedents show that behavior bringing disrepute to the office can be grounds for impeachment. For example, Judge John Pickering was impeached for mishandling a case by violating federal laws and procedures. Judge Halsted Ritter faced impeachment for various reasons, including refusing to hear certain testimony and denying the United States an appeal. He was acquitted of six out of seven articles but convicted on the seventh, which accused him of appearing on the bench intoxicated. The allegations suggested his actions brought scandal to the court and rendered him unfit to serve as a judge. Judge Halsted Ritter faced impeachment for accepting fees, gratuities, and tax evasion. Article VII was challenged for repeating facts from previous articles. The President Pro Tempore ruled it involved \"general misbehavior.\" Impeachment provisions and \"good behaviour\" language in the Constitution should be read together to differentiate offenses for judicial officers. Representative Paul McCloskey, Jr. argued for this during Justice Douglas' impeachment investigation in the 91st Congress. During the Douglas impeachment debate, Representative Paul McCloskey, Jr. argued that impeachable misbehavior by a judge involves proven conduct that casts doubt on personal integrity and the judiciary as a whole. Minority Leader Gerald Ford emphasized the importance of maintaining an independent judiciary by impeaching judges for criminal misconduct related to their judicial functions. The Subcommittee suggested two concepts for impeaching judges: criminal conduct in violation of law or serious dereliction from public duty. Misconduct like sloth, drunkenness on the bench, or unreasonable impartiality could support impeachment even if not criminal. The Subcommittee proposed two grounds for impeaching judges: criminal conduct or serious dereliction from public duty. Impeachment does not require criminal behavior but must be serious enough to harm societal morals. Impeachment of a federal judge can be based on conduct unrelated to their judicial duties. The House Judiciary Committee referred to past impeachment cases for guidance in the impeachment of Judge Samuel B. Kent. The House Judiciary Committee has interpreted \"other high Crimes and Misdemeanors\" broadly, stating that impeachable offenses do not have to be limited to criminal conduct. They defined it as serious violations of public trust, not necessarily indictable offenses. Impeachment now focuses on public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary. The House Judiciary Committee has interpreted impeachable offenses broadly, focusing on public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary. Impeachment is not limited to criminal conduct but includes serious violations of public trust to protect the integrity of the judicial branch and uphold public trust. In the impeachment resolution against President Clinton in 1998, the House alleged that he had undermined the integrity of his office, brought disrepute on the Presidency, and acted in a manner subversive of the rule of law and justice. The House Judiciary Committee accused President Clinton of corrupting the judicial process for personal gain, making false statements to a grand jury, and obstructing justice in a civil rights case. The minority views expressed skepticism about the allegations against the President, stating that they did not amount to impeachable misconduct. They referenced the House Judiciary Committee's recommendation of impeachment against President Nixon in 1974, which was based on abuse of power and failure to faithfully execute the laws. The minority of the House Committee on the Judiciary expressed skepticism about the allegations against President Nixon, stating that they did not amount to impeachable misconduct. They believed that errors in the administration of his office were not sufficient grounds for impeachment. The charges against President Andrew Johnson involved violations of the Tenure of Office Act. The articles of impeachment against President Nixon accused him of undermining Congress and criticizing its authority. Secretary of War Belknap faced impeachment for appointing a trader for personal gain but resigned before trial and was not convicted. In response to H.Res. 511 (62nd Congress), Judge Robert W. Archbald was impeached by the House and tried by the Senate based on 13 articles of impeachment alleging misconduct in his federal offices. The President transmitted information related to charges of improper conduct brought to his attention by the Commissioner of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Judge Archbald was impeached by the House and tried by the Senate in the 62nd Congress for misconduct in his federal offices, including as a U.S. Circuit Judge and Judge of the U.S. Commerce Court. He was convicted on four articles of misconduct in his current positions and a fifth article for misuse of office in his previous position as a U.S. District Judge. Other allegations of misconduct in federal offices have also been investigated for possible impeachment. During George F. Seward's terms as consul-general and envoy to China, a report of impeachment was presented to the House, alleging misconduct in both positions. The majority of the Committee on Expenditures recommended impeaching Seward for high crimes and misdemeanors, while the minority suggested referring the report to the House Judiciary Committee. The House voted to consider the report on March 3, 1879, but no action was taken due to delays. The House Committee on Expenditures recommended impeaching Oliver B. Bradford for high crimes and misdemeanors while holding various positions in Shanghai. Some committee members questioned his impeachability, leading to a motion to refer the matter to the House Judiciary Committee. Judge G. Thomas Porteous was the first person impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate. Judge G. Thomas Porteous was the first person to be impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate for misconduct that occurred before he began his federal office tenure. He was convicted on four articles, including misconduct as a state and federal judge, false statements during his confirmation, and personal misconduct in a bankruptcy case. Porteous was removed from office and disqualified from holding future federal positions. No President, Vice President, or civil officer has been impeached solely on the basis of pre-federal conduct. The House has investigated allegations of misconduct occurring before a civil officer's tenure. In 1826, a committee investigated Vice President John C. Calhoun's conduct as Secretary of War but recommended no action. In 1872, a special committee was appointed to investigate bribery allegations involving legislative duties. The House Judiciary Committee limited the investigation to charges against Vice President Schuyler Colfax regarding bribery allegations from his time as Speaker of the House. Colfax, as a Member of the House, was not impeachable, but as Vice President, he was subject to impeachment. The committee reviewed impeachment precedents and concluded that impeachment was a remedial measure. The House Judiciary Committee concluded that impeachment should only be applied to high crimes and misdemeanors committed while in office, as it is a remedial measure and not punitive. The House Judiciary Committee concluded that impeachment should only be for high crimes and misdemeanors committed while in office. The committee found no just cause for impeachment of the Vice President regarding his involvement in the Credit Mobilier stock. Representative Clarkson Potter dissented from much of the committee's report but agreed to be discharged from the subject due to Vice President Colfax leaving office soon. The House Judiciary Committee debated whether a civil officer like the Vice President could be impeached for crimes committed before taking office. Representative M. Goodrich disagreed with the committee's stance that officers are not liable for pre-term offenses, questioning its protection of constituents' interests. The House Judiciary Committee debated whether a civil officer like the Vice President could be impeached for crimes committed before taking office. Representative M. Goodrich disagreed with the committee's stance, questioning its protection of constituents' interests. The committee's report was briefly debated in the House on February 24, 1873, and then postponed to February 26, 1873. Approximately 100 years later, then-Vice President Spiro Agnew sought an impeachment investigation of allegations against him concerning his conduct while governor of Maryland. The Speaker declined to take up the matter due to its pending status in the courts. The House took no substantive action on related resolutions, citing concerns about the matter's pendency in the courts and the fact that the conduct occurred before Agnew's tenure as Vice President. This review of precedents on impeachable offenses suggests the answer is unclear. Impeachment criteria for different officials vary. Serious criminal conduct is sufficient grounds for impeachment, including criminal intent, abuses of power, failure to fulfill duties, and interference with investigations. Federal judges can be impeached for improper judicial conduct or serious misconduct, not just criminal behavior. The impeachment language for judges is influenced by the constitutional requirement of serving during good behavior. Impeachment articles may allege misconduct in current and past federal offices, including false statements during nomination and confirmation. Views differ on whether impeachment can be based solely on pre-tenure conduct. Federal officers may face impeachment for conduct casting doubt on integrity or disrepute to the judiciary. The American impeachment process allows for investigating misconduct by federal officers in current and past offices, including false statements during nomination and confirmation. It is unclear if impeachment can be based solely on pre-tenure conduct or if it applies to misconduct in state offices. Past precedent suggests that the House may decline impeachment if state court proceedings are pending for alleged misconduct in a previous state office. The impeachment process is a legislative mechanism for investigating serious misconduct by federal officers, including the President, Vice President, and civil Officers of the United States. It has been used for judges, Presidents, and senior executive branch members but does not apply to Senators or likely Members of the House of Representatives. The definition of \"civil Officer\" is unclear but has been used for Cabinet level officials. Private citizens are not subject to impeachment. The impeachment process is a legislative mechanism for investigating serious misconduct by federal officers, including the President, Vice President, and civil Officers of the United States. Private citizens are not vulnerable to impeachment. Impeachment may lie for \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes or misdemeanors,\" but the boundaries of this language have not been fully explored. Impeachable offenses may include criminal acts or serious misconduct while in office. The impeachment process involves investigating serious misconduct by federal officers, including the President, Vice President, and civil Officers of the United States. Impeachable offenses may include criminal acts or serious misconduct while in office. The House is responsible for the initial investigation and decision to impeach, followed by a Senate trial if impeachment is deemed appropriate. In the Senate trial, the House of Representatives is represented by Managers and the individual impeached is entitled to assistance of counsel. The Senate must determine whether to convict on each article with a two-thirds vote. A conviction on any article results in a conviction in the impeachment trial. The Senate can choose to remove from office alone or also prohibit holding future public offices. The impeachment process allows for removal from office and potential prohibition from holding future public offices. A simple majority vote is needed for judgment, not a two-thirds majority. It serves as a check on abuse of power and misconduct by judicial and executive officers, but also requires significant legislative time and resources. The impeachment process serves as a check on abuse of power and misconduct by judicial and executive officers, requiring significant legislative time and resources. The constitutional framers aimed to balance the need for remedying misconduct while minimizing potential overuse or abuse of legislative power. House and Senate rules, procedures, and precedents fill the void in the constitutional framework, addressing some remaining questions."
