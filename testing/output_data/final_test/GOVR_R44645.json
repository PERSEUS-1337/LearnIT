    "content": "The Social Security Administration (SSA) oversees programs like Social Security, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and Special Benefits for Certain World War II Veterans. It also supports non-SSA programs like Medicare and provides data for federal and state programs. Benefit payments for SSA's programs are considered mandatory spending. The report focuses on annual discretionary appropriations for SSA's administrative activities, including projected spending on benefit payments and operating costs in FY2017. It also covers the President's budget request, the Commissioner's budget request, and major congressional actions on SSA's appropriations for FY2017. Trends in the budget request and appropriations for administrative expenses are also examined. The report discusses the appropriation for the limitation on administrative expenses (LAE) and its impact on agency workloads. SSA administers federal income support programs such as Social Security, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and Special Benefits for Certain World War II Veterans. Social Security is a social insurance program based on career-average earnings, while SSI and Special Benefits are public assistance programs providing a guaranteed minimum income to certain groups. Data in the report can be found in SSA's FY2017 budget justification to Congress. Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) and Disability Insurance are entitlement programs providing monthly cash benefits to insured workers aged 62 or older, their spouses, children, and certain survivors. Workers qualify by paying Social Security taxes for a sufficient number of years. OASI benefits and administrative costs are funded by the Federal Old-Age program. The Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program provides monthly cash benefits to nonelderly insured workers with severe disabilities. These benefits are paid out of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, to which workers contribute through payroll taxes. SSDI benefits are payable until the disabled worker dies, returns to work, or reaches Social Security's full retirement age. The worker transitions to OASI. SSDI benefits and administrative costs are paid out of the Federal Disability Insurance (DI) Trust Fund. SSI provides cash assistance to needy aged, blind, or disabled individuals. Monthly SSI benefits are reduced by other countable income, making it a program of \"last resort\" for low-income seniors and individuals with disabilities. States may complement federal SSI benefits with state supplementary payments (SSPs). States can supplement federal SSI benefits with state supplementary payments (SSPs) funded by the state. The Special Benefits for Certain World War II Veterans program provides cash benefits to low-income individuals aged 65 or older who were SSI eligible in December 1999 and are World War II veterans residing outside the U.S. Program costs are covered by general revenues. In FY2017, outlays for various SSA programs are projected to be $1.034 trillion, with $1.018 trillion allocated for benefit payments. Approximately 68.4 million individuals are expected to receive federal benefits. Benefit outlays are considered mandatory spending and are determined by program eligibility requirements and benefit formulas. Administrative expenses for each program are shown as a percentage of benefit payments. Administrative costs for SSA programs are projected to be 1.3% of benefit payments in FY2017. Disability programs have higher administrative costs compared to OASI due to their complexity. SSI is particularly complex to administer as it requires verification of all income sources and resources. The Special Benefits for Certain World War II Veterans program provides higher benefit payments compared to Social Security or SSI due to low benefit levels and a declining number of recipients. In FY2017, the program is projected to benefit fewer than 500 individuals monthly. While benefit payments for SSA's programs are mandatory spending, annual discretionary appropriations are needed for program administration and support for non-SSA programs like Medicare. This section discusses the Obama Administration's FY2017 budget request for SSA and highlights congressional actions on SSA's FY2017 appropriations. The President's FY2017 budget request to Congress for SSA included four accounts: Payments to Social Security Trust Funds, Supplemental Security Income Program, Limitation on Administrative Expenses (LAE), and Office of Inspector General. The LAE account funds costs for SSA's programs and administration of non-SSA programs. The Payment to Social Security Trust Funds account reimburses OASI and DI trust funds for certain activities. For FY2017, the President's budget request included $11.4 million in payments to the Social Security trust funds through annual appropriations. This included $5 million for interest earned on uncashed benefit checks and $6.4 million for administrative costs related to pension reform legislation. Additionally, $39.2 billion in payments to the trust funds were provided outside of the annual appropriations process, mainly from subjecting a portion of Social Security benefits to federal income tax. The majority of funding provided to the SSA each year is for the SSI program, which is a mandatory appropriation. The level of spending on SSI benefits is controlled by the program's authorizing statute. Funding for SSI benefits is provided through mandatory spending enacted through annual appropriations acts. Administrative expenses for SSI are also covered through the annual appropriations process. Funding for the SSI program is provided through annual appropriations from general revenues to the SSA. The SSI account has three components: regular appropriation for current fiscal year benefits and costs, indefinite appropriation for costs after June 15, and advance appropriation for the first quarter of the next fiscal year. Funds for the SSI program are available until expended. The FY2017 President's budget request for the SSI program included $43.8 billion for program costs and $15 billion for SSI benefits in the first quarter of FY2018. Total SSI benefits payable in FY2017 were estimated to be $52.9 billion, with $14.5 billion from an advance appropriation enacted in FY2016. The appropriation also covers administrative expenses, beneficiary services, and research costs, totaling $5.4 billion. Administrative expenses are initially paid from trust funds. The SSI program's administrative expenses, including disability determinations and program integrity activities, are initially paid from trust funds and reimbursed from general revenues. The FY2017 budget request allocated $5.2 billion for administrative expenses, covering beneficiary services, research, and Medicare outreach. This includes $89 million for beneficiary services, $58 million for research projects, and $2 million for Department costs. The FY2017 President's budget request for SSA's LAE account was $13.067 billion, which funds administrative costs for various programs including OASI, SSDI, SSI, and Special Benefits for Certain World War II Veterans. The account also covers expenses for Medicare and other non-SSA programs, employment verification, information technology activities, and the Social Security Advisory Board. The funds for this account come from various trust funds, general revenues, and user fees paid to SSA. The FY2017 President's budget request for SSA's LAE account was $13.067 billion, which is $905 million (7.4%) more than FY2016. It includes base LAE appropriation, program integrity funding, and user fee contributions. The base LAE appropriation was $11.121 billion, $522 million (4.9%) more than FY2016, excluding one-time renovation costs. Excluding these costs, the FY2017 request is $672 million (6.4%) more than FY2016. The FY2017 President's budget request for SSA's LAE account is $13.067 billion, $905 million (7.4%) more than FY2016. It includes base LAE appropriation, program integrity funding, and user fee contributions. The budget request also includes $1.819 billion for program integrity activities such as continuing disability reviews and SSI redeterminations, which are estimated to result in net federal program savings over a 10-year period. The Budget Control Act of 2011 allows for discretionary spending limits to be adjusted for program integrity work related to SSA's disability programs, resulting in estimated net federal program savings over a 10-year period. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 amended SSA's cap adjustment levels to allow for higher maximum adjustments for FY2017 through FY2019 and a lower maximum adjustment in FY2021. This included expanding program integrity activities to include CDI units and fraud prosecutions by SAUSAs. The CDI program, involving SSA, OIG, DDS agencies, and law enforcement, investigates disability claims fraud. SAUSAs prosecute fraud cases referred by OIG. BBA 2015 clarified work CDRs for disabled beneficiaries. FY2017 budget requested $127 million for administrative activities. The SSA charges participating states a user fee of $11.68 per SSP in FY2017 for administering SSI state supplementation programs. The fee is credited to the Treasury's general fund and the SSI state supplement user fees account. Federal law allows these funds to be used as provided. The FY2017 President's budget request for SSI state supplement user fees was $126 million. Another user fee is for SSA's administration of the certification process for nonattorney representatives. Nonattorney representatives must meet prerequisites to qualify for direct fee withholding, including passing an exam and background check. The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) investigates fraud, waste, and abuse within SSA's programs, monitors improper receipt of federal benefits, and supports homeland security efforts. Funding for the OIG comes from discretionary appropriations to a separate administrative account. The OIG receives funding through discretionary appropriations to a separate administrative account. The FY2017 President's budget request for the OIG account was $112 million, $6.5 million more than FY2016. $31 million was from general revenues and $81 million from the OASI and DI trust funds. SSA became an independent federal agency in 1995. The FY2017 Commissioner's budget request for administrative expenses and the OIG was $13.859 billion, with $13.610 billion for administrative expenses, $128 million for research, and $121 million for the OIG. The President's budget request for administrative expenses was $12 million less and $9 million less for the OIG compared to the Commissioner's request. The House Committee on Appropriations approved its FY2017 LHHS appropriations bill providing $11.899 billion. The House bill for the FY2017 appropriations provided $11.899 billion for SSA's LAE account, which was less than the President's budget request and the amount enacted for FY2016. It also included less funding for program integrity work and maintained the same amount for the OIG account as FY2016. The Senate Committee on Appropriations approved its FY2017 LHHS appropriations bill (S. 3040) with $12.482 billion for SSA's LAE account, $585 million less than the President's budget request but $320 million more than FY2016. The bill also included $105.5 million for the OIG account, the same as FY2016. President Barack Obama signed the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2017, which provided funding for various agencies including SSA's program integrity work. The bill was passed in the Senate and House with bipartisan support, maintaining funding levels from FY2016 with a slight across-the-board rescission. President Obama signed the Further Continuing and Security Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017, which included a 0.1901% across-the-board rescission for most discretionary accounts. However, funding for SSA's program integrity work was exempt from the rescission. The second FY2017 CR allocated $150 million to address the backlog in SSA's Office of Disability Adjudication and Review. President Trump signed a third FY2017 CR into law, continuing funding until May 5, 2017. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 was signed into law on May 5, 2017, providing appropriations for 11 of the 12 annual bills through September 30, 2017. The FY2017 omnibus bill allocated $12.428 billion for SSA's LAE account and $105.5 million for the OIG account. $1.819 billion of the LAE appropriation is for program integrity activities. The FY2017 appropriation includes changes in fund allocation methodology. The FY2017 omnibus bill allocated $12.428 billion for SSA's LAE account, with $1.819 billion dedicated to program integrity work. This leaves a base LAE amount of $10.539 billion. Funding for program integrity work is available through FY2018 and can be used for CDI units and fraud prosecution. The FY2017 omnibus provides $90 million from the LAE account for these activities. The FY2017 omnibus bill allocated $12.428 billion for SSA's LAE account, with $1.819 billion dedicated to program integrity work. $90 million from the LAE account is provided to address the disability hearings backlog through FY2018. The enacted appropriation for the LAE account has exceeded the Commissioner's budget request for certain fiscal years. The enacted appropriation for SSA's LAE account has exceeded the President's budget request for certain fiscal years, including FY2009. Historical trends in the annual appropriation show a steady increase over the past 20 years, although the rate of increase has slowed since FY2010. Between FY2010 and FY2017, SSA's LAE appropriation adjusted for price changes shows a noticeable rise, with a decline in real terms from FY2010 to FY2013 followed by an increase. Adjusting for wage growth is another method to analyze historical trends in SSA's LAE account, as payroll expenses, including pay raises and promotions, can increase administrative expenses faster than inflation due to faster wage growth. The SSA's fixed costs can increase administrative expenses faster than inflation, with a typical annual growth of $300-$350 million. The LAE appropriation trend adjusted for wage changes shows a decline in real terms from FY2010 to FY2015, followed by slight increases and decreases in subsequent years. The recent nominal growth in the LAE appropriation is attributed to increased funding for program integrity work, which saw a 140% increase from $758 million to $1.819 billion between FY2010 and FY2017. Between FY2010 and FY2017, SSA's program integrity funding increased significantly, allowing for more CDRs to be processed and reducing the backlog. However, general LAE funding remained relatively flat during this period. General LAE funding at SSA decreased from $11.85 billion in FY2010 to $10.663 billion in FY2017, with a 10% and 19% decline when adjusted for price and wage growth. This reduction in funding has led to delays in processing workloads, particularly in the growing number of pending disability cases at the hearing level, which increased by 58% from FY2010 to FY2017. The average wait time for a hearing decision also rose by 37% during this period. The wait time for a hearing decision at SSA increased by 37% from 426 days to 583 days. The House appropriations bill could result in employee furloughs and office closures, while the Senate bill falls short of providing sufficient funding. Congress believes the Senate's funding level is adequate for SSA to perform its non-program integrity duties. The FY2016 appropriations bill provided $12.162 billion for SSA's LAE account, which was slightly less than the President's budget request but more than the previous year. The OIG account received $4.3 million less than the President's budget but more than the previous year."
