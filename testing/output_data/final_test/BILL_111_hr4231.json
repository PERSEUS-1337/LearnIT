    "content": "The \"Safe Cities Act of 2009\" is created to assist in the coordination with federal agencies to curb violent crime by establishing and supporting violent and drug crime zones. The \"Safe Cities Act of 2009\" defines a Governor as the chief executive officer of a State or the Mayor of the District of Columbia. It also defines a Violent and Drug Crime Zone as a metropolitan area with high rates of homicides, violent felonies, sex offenses, drug, and gang-related crimes compared to national averages. The Attorney General, in consultation with relevant authorities, may designate specified areas as Violent and Drug Crime Zones based on certain criteria. The Attorney General will establish intervention teams and Safe Cities Task Forces in Violent and Drug Crime Zones, coordinating with various law enforcement agencies for the investigation and prosecution of criminal activities. The Attorney General will establish drug and violent crime intervention teams consisting of agents and officers from various law enforcement agencies. These teams will be temporarily reassigned personnel, funded through partnerships with states, and required to report intelligence and best practices. The Attorney General will designate Drug and Violent Crime Zones based on criteria including levels of homicides, violent crimes, and drug-related offenses. State and local law enforcement agencies in these zones may receive additional resources to combat crime. Federal agency personnel participating in drug and violent crime intervention teams must submit best practice reports to the Attorney General. These reports, along with other intelligence and knowledge-sharing opportunities, will be provided to State and local law enforcement agencies to help them replicate successful intervention strategies. Safe Cities Task Forces are established for Violent and Drug Crimes Zones, consisting of up to 8 members including the Mayor, Chief of Police, Governor, city attorney, and representatives from Federal law enforcement agencies. Their duties include overseeing funding expenditures for drug and violent crime interventions. The drug and violent crime intervention team for the zone is established with duties including coordination, outreach to affected communities, and authorization of appropriations from the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR COMMUNITY-BASED JUSTICE GRANTS FOR PROSECUTORS. Section 31707 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 is amended to authorize appropriations. Authorization of appropriations for community-based justice grants for prosecutors is amended to authorize $15,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2010 to 2013. This includes funding to increase the number of prosecutors working with drug and violent crime intervention teams as determined necessary by the Attorney General. Grants will be awarded to State and local law enforcement programs to establish State-wide crime prevention databases to track criminals, arrests, prosecutions, and convictions. The Office of Justice Programs will administer the grants, with funding authorized as necessary."
