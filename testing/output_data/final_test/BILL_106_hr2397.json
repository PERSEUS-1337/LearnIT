    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Paycheck Fairness Act\" and references the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. It includes findings related to pay equity. Congress finds that women entering the workforce in record numbers still face significantly lower pay than men for equal work, leading to wage depression for families and underutilization of labor resources. Pay disparities persist due to intentional discrimination or past biases. Congress finds that labor resources are being spread among workers through commerce, burdening and obstructing the free flow of goods, leading to unfair competition and labor disputes. This interference with commerce may deprive workers of equal protection based on sex. Artificial barriers hinder the elimination of these issues. Artificial barriers to wage discrimination based on sex persist despite decades since the enactment of the Fair Labor Standards Act and Civil Rights Act. Removing these barriers would benefit the economy, reduce reliance on public assistance, promote family stability, and address past discrimination effects. The Equal Pay Act of 1963 aims to address past discrimination and ensure equal protection for workers based on sex in the private sector. Increased information and effective remedies will help women enforce their rights to equal pay for equal work. Some employers have already made progress in eliminating unfair pay disparities. SEC. 3.

Entities eligible for the annual award include corporations, partnerships, professional associations, labor organizations, and similar business entities. Additionally, entities conducting education or training programs, as well as joint programs formed by a combination of eligible entities, are also eligible. SEC. 8. COLLECTION OF PAY INFORMATION BY THE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION. Section 709 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is amended to require the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to conduct a survey on employee pay data for enforcing laws against pay discrimination and issue regulations for collecting pay information based on sex, race, and national origin of employees. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission must prioritize enhancing enforcement of laws against pay discrimination, considering factors like employer burdens, report frequency, data confidentiality, and effective data collection formats.
