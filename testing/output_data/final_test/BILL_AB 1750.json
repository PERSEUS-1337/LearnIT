    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 2079.13 of the Civil Code is amended to define the term \"Agent\" in real property transactions. An associate licensee in real estate is someone licensed under a broker to act as the broker's agent and work under their supervision. The agent is responsible for their associate licensees' actions in real property transactions, with duties equivalent to those owed by the broker. In real estate, a \"Buyer\" is a person involved in a property transaction seeking the services of an agent. \"Commercial real property\" refers to all real estate in the state except certain types like single-family homes. A \"Dual agent\" represents both the seller and buyer in a transaction. A listing agreement is a contract between a property owner and an agent to sell the property. The listing agent is the person authorized to act as an agent for compensation. The listing price is the amount the seller is willing to sell the property for, while the offering price is the amount the buyer is willing to pay. An offer to purchase is a written contract that becomes the sale contract upon acceptance by the seller. Real property refers to various types of properties including residential, commercial, and mobilehomes when sold through an agent. A real property transaction involves the sale of real estate with an agent representing one or more parties. (m) \u201cSell,\u201d \u201csale,\u201d or \u201csold\u201d refers to a transaction for the transfer of real property from the seller to the buyer, including exchanges, sales contracts, and leases exceeding one year. (n) \u201cSeller\u201d means the transferor in a real property transaction, including owners listing property with an agent or receiving offers on their behalf. (o) A \"selling agent\" is a listing agent who sells or finds a buyer for real property, or locates property for a buyer without a listing. (p) A \"subagent\" is a person to whom an agent delegates powers in a real property transaction."
