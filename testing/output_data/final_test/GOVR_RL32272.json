    "content": "The conflict in Chechnya, initiated by Vladimir Putin in 1999, has resulted in thousands of casualties and widespread destruction. Chechen rebel forces, though weakened, continue to carry out small-scale attacks and bombings, including suicide bombings. The deadliest incidents in Russia after 2001 included a hostage-taking at a Moscow theater in October 2002 and a suicide truck bombing in Chechnya in December 2002. Suicide bombings in 2003 aimed to publicize the Chechnya conflict and influence elections. The pace and lethality of terrorist attacks increased in 2004, spreading beyond Chechnya with incidents like a bombing in the Moscow subway and downing of Russian commercial airliners by Chechen female suicide bombers. In 2004, terrorist attacks in Russia included downing of Russian commercial airliners by suicide bombers, an assassination attempt in Ingushetia, a Chechen terrorist attack in Ingushetia, attacks in Grozny resulting in deaths of pro-Moscow Chechens, and the Beslan hostage crisis where 320 children and others died. Basayev claimed responsibility for these attacks. In October 2005, an attack on police and security offices in Nalchik, Kabardino-Balkaria, led to over 100 deaths. Russian officials accused local Islamic extremists, aided by Basayev, of involvement. Maskhadov was killed in 2005, replaced by Sadulayev as Chechnya's leader. Sadulayev reorganized the rebel group in August 2005. In August 2005, Sadulayev reorganized the rebel \"government\" by appointing new \"ministers\" and dismissing Maskhadov's representatives. He made Basayev his second in command and criticized his hostage-taking tactic while praising his military leadership. Sadulayev further reduced the influence of \"moderate\" Chechen rebels in February 2006 by removing Zakayev as deputy prime minister and elevating the status of hardline Islamic ideologist Movladi Udugov. Since 2002, the Putin administration has opposed talks with Chechen rebels and focused on establishing a pro-Moscow government in Chechnya. The region's government is using its own forces to combat rebels, with an estimated 20,000 Chechen police and security personnel. This \"Chechenization\" strategy has allowed for the withdrawal of Russian troops. Pacification efforts aim to gain support for federal control through rebuilding assistance and elections. The assassination of the Chechen president in May 2004 and the attack on the school in Beslan in September 2004 have raised questions about the success of Chechenization and pacification efforts in Chechnya. The Putin government claimed that fighting terrorism required the suspension of civil rights, but in 2002, they stated that decreased fighting allowed for the strengthening of civil rights. However, human rights organizations have documented ongoing abuses by Russian and pro-Moscow Chechen forces, including civilian disappearances, summary killings, and hostage-taking. Despite a potential decrease in the scale of these actions since 1999, over 400 civilian abductions may have occurred in 2004. Despite a potential decrease in abuses since 1999, over 400 civilian abductions may have occurred in 2004 and more than 200 in 2005, according to Russia's Memorial human rights organization. Observers have objected to Chechen government policies of abducting relatives of rebel leaders to compel surrender. Chechen rebels also continue to commit abuses. The Putin government in 2003-2004 pressured displaced Chechens to return to Chechnya, closing tent cities in neighboring regions to force their return. U.N. Undersecretary-General Jan Egeland raised concerns about these forced return efforts in January 2004. The Russian government launched a limited compensation program for Chechen families affected by the conflict, but reconstruction in Chechnya is behind schedule due to corruption and lack of coordination. The region still faces abductions, torture, terrorist attacks, and poverty, with many Chechens unemployed and homeless. The Russian government has implemented a strategy in Chechnya to hold popular elections in an effort to foster peace and establish a new political system. This strategy was tested in 2004 with the assassination of Akhmad Kadyrov. Many Chechens remain unemployed and in poverty, lacking basic services like healthcare and education. The Putin government faced a severe test in May 2004 with the assassination of Akhmad Kadyrov, delaying legislative elections until late 2005. Despite promises of a constitutional referendum in 2002, it was postponed until March 26, 2003 due to unrest in the region. The Russian government portrayed the new Chechen constitution and referendum as a way to re-establish the rule of law. The Central Electoral Commission reported a high turnout of 89.5% among eligible voters in Chechnya, with 96% approving the new constitution. The voting rolls included Russian troops permanently based in the region. Some Chechens protested against the referendum due to the lack of a peace settlement, but Akhmad Kadyrov dismissed them as enemies. Visiting representatives from OSCE and the Council of Europe had misgivings about the referendum preparations. They recommended sending a handful of observers to assess the situation. The referendum in Chechnya saw a high turnout of 89.5% with 96% approving the new constitution, including Russian troops in the voting rolls. OSCE observers noted voting irregularities and allegations of threats to force voting. Despite criticism, President Putin hailed the referendum as removing a threat to Russia's territorial integrity. The Chechen Constitution, approved in a referendum with high turnout and Russian troops present, has raised concerns about its lack of regional autonomy and strong federal control. It designates Russian as the exclusive language, prohibits separatism, and gives the federal government power to remove officials. The Chechen Constitution establishes a presidential system with the regional president having significant powers, including the ability to appoint officials without regional legislature approval. Putin decreed a popular election for Chechnya's executive head in 2003 to replace his direct appointment in 2000. Eleven candidates ran in the election, seen as a step towards restoring local civil order. Before the 2003 election in Chechnya, three major opponents of Akhmad Kadyrov dropped out under questionable circumstances. Kadyrov's security forces took control of media, giving him extensive coverage. On election day, low turnout was reported, possibly due to fear among Chechens. Despite security concerns, 88% of registered voters turned out for the 2003 election in Chechnya, with 81% voting for Akhmad Kadyrov. The OSCE and Council of Europe did not send observers due to security reasons, but observers from the OIC and Arab League monitored the election. Media manipulation and lack of viable opposition candidates were cited as reasons for the non-pluralistic nature of the race. The OIC and Arab League monitored the 2003 Chechen election, declared it unobjectionable, and were praised by Putin. Akhmad Kadyrov proposed a legislative election for late 2004, which was postponed after his assassination in May 2004. Putin had proclaimed success in Chechnya just days before the attack that killed Kadyrov and over twenty others. The White House condemned the bombing. The Putin government continued its electoral strategy in Chechnya after the assassination of Akhmad Kadyrov, seeking a pro-Moscow candidate to replace him. Chechen Interior Minister Alu Alkhanov was selected to run for the presidency, with the main challenger Malik Saidullayev being refused registration. The election was viewed as problematic and unlikely to gain support from moderate Chechens. President Alkhanov, sworn into office on October 6, 2004, pledged to follow Kadyrov's policies, curb abductions, and convince rebels to cease fighting. Despite accusations of human rights abuses, he was awarded the title Hero of Russia by Putin in December 2004. Alkhanov's son Ramzan was named first deputy prime minister and controls the presidential guard. The legislative election in Chechnya was held on November 27, 2005, with 357 candidates contesting 58 seats. The legislative election in Chechnya on November 27, 2005, had 357 candidates vying for 58 seats. The pro-Putin United Russia Party won 24 seats in the National Assembly and nine seats in the Council of the Republic. The Communist Party gained three seats in each. Observers raised concerns about inflated turnout and the use of administrative resources to support favored candidates. Relatives and supporters of Ramzan Kadyrov were suggested to have won most, if not all, of the seats. President Putin declared the election in Chechnya as legitimate, with supporters of Ramzan Kadyrov winning most, if not all, seats. Putin emphasized Russia's role as a defender of the Islamic world and Chechnya's full participation in the Russian Federation. The election to the State Duma took place on December 7, 2003. The election in Chechnya on December 7, 2003, had discrepancies in the vote count, with the number of registered voters exceeded by 11%. Suicide bombers targeted the Duma building in early December 2003, but the bombs failed to detonate. Both Chechnya's seats in the Russian Federation Council became vacant in late 2003, with one seat filled by Umar Dzhabrailov appointed by Akhmad Kadyrov on January 5, 2004. In 1996, Umar Dzhabrailov's visa was revoked by the State Department due to his connection with the unsolved Moscow murder of U.S. investor Paul Tatum. Speculation suggests his appointment may have been a reward for his brother's withdrawal from the presidential election in Chechnya. Another seat in the upper chamber became vacant when Akhmad Kadyrov removed Adnan Muzykayev and appointed Musa Umarov. Many parties called for a boycott of the election in protest against the Russian government, as a turnout of over 50% was required for the election to be valid. Chechens were also urged to boycott the race as a symbol of protest. After the 2004 presidential election in Chechnya, there were reports of high voter turnout (94.2%) and a high percentage of votes for Putin (94.4%), which some media deemed improbable. The Russian and pro-Moscow Chechen governments praised the elections as a sign of peace and rule of law, but independent Russian media criticized the rise in suicide bombings. Russian media criticized the questionable elections in Chechnya, citing the rise in violence as proof that they cannot lead to peace. They questioned the legitimacy of the voting process, as some rebel populations did not participate. Observers noted that life in Chechnya did not improve after the elections, with the threat to Russia remaining. The hostage-taking in Beslan in 2004, carried out by Chechens, prompted the Putin government to continue its pacification strategy in Chechnya. Putin responded to the Beslan incident by increasing centralization of power in the presidency and eliminating direct popular elections of regional leaders. Critics argue that Russia's actions in Chechnya have hindered democratization and led to civil rights abuses against ethnic Chechens and other groups. Russian forces, with the aid of Ramzan Kadyrov's forces, intensified sweeps and abductions to eliminate rebels in Chechnya. Military units in Chechnya have allegedly committed abuses, even against non-Chechens, weakening civilian control over the military. Zbigniew Brzezinski argues that the conflict is reversing democratization in Russia by strengthening the security apparatus. The international community has criticized Russia's peace-making efforts in Chechnya, with European bodies being more critical and warning of potential war crimes tribunal if human rights abuses are not addressed. The European Parliament in July 2003 criticized Russia for \"war crimes\" in Chechnya and urged peace talks under international auspices. Disagreements within the EU on Chechnya policy were highlighted during Putin's visit to Italy in November 2003. The European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs emphasized the need to address Russia's human rights abuses in Chechnya and the \"illusory\" presidential election. In December 2003, Russia and the Council of Europe agreed on ad hoc programs in Chechnya for technical assistance in holding elections. However, Russia abolished the post of the Special Representative for human rights in Chechnya in January 2004, causing uncertainty. Despite criticism from the Council of Europe, Russia promised to appoint a new representative. In October 2004, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) criticized Russia for its handling of the electoral process in Chechnya and called for peace talks with moderate Chechen rebels. PACE criticized Russia for its handling of the conflict in the North Caucasus, calling for peace talks with moderate forces and expressing concern over the spread of violence. They also called for access to Chechnya for media and set up round table talks between PACE representatives, the Chechen government, and former independence fighters. Maskhadov's supporters refused to participate in the talks. In early 2006, PACE approved a resolution condemning human rights violations in Chechnya by the Russian government, highlighting torture and disappearances. The resolution called for addressing previous recommendations on abuses and increasing monitoring efforts. Maskhadov's supporters refused to participate in round table talks due to the goal of Chechnya's independence not being recognized. The Council of Europe urged increased monitoring of human rights in Chechnya, criticizing Russia's lack of action on abuses. The UN Human Rights Commission failed to pass resolutions on Russia's violations in Chechnya in 2003 and 2004. Saudi Arabia shifted its stance on Chechnya in 2004, offering support to Akhmad Kadyrov and cracking down on rebel financiers. In late 2005, the Arab League and Organization of the Islamic Conference observed Chechen legislative elections and deemed them acceptable. Various proposals for peace negotiations have been made by international observers, some Russians, and Chechens who oppose Russian government policy. In February 2004, European Parliament deputies endorsed a peace proposal calling for U.N. peacekeepers, withdrawal of Russian troops, and disarming rebels. Chechen legislators met with Akhmad Kadyrov in December 2003 to urge political talks to end the conflict, but Kadyrov rejected the idea and instead urged rebels to surrender. Maskhadov ordered a ceasefire in February 2005. Maskhadov ordered a ceasefire in February 2005 to initiate peace talks with Russia, but the Putin government refused. Russian human rights activists urged Putin to engage with \"moderate rebels\" like Maskhadov to prevent Chechnya from becoming a hub for terrorism. Despite some rebel attacks continuing, Basayev's forces agreed to the ceasefire. Maskhadov was killed by federal forces in March 2005. Sadulayev rejected calls for talks with Russia in May 2005 and established the \"Caucasus front\" to support North Caucasian Muslims against Russian abuses. In late August 2005, Sadulayev empowered Akhmed Zakayev to conduct consultations on peacefully regulating the Russian-Chechen conflict. Chechen factionalism complicates peace talks, with advocates urging the inclusion of moderate separatists while excluding Islamic extremists like Basayev due to their terrorist acts. Islamic extremists like Basayev demand full independence for Chechnya and Shariarule. Russia hopes to wind down the conflict through pacification and Chechenization efforts, but there are concerns about continued low-level fighting or escalating violence. The Putin administration is divided on accommodating pro-Russian Chechen leadership for greater self-rule. The State Duma election results and the strengthening of the security apparatus in the Putin administration may lead to less support for Chechenization. There is a possibility of Russia reverting to direct rule and excluding ethnic Chechens from political and economic control. Some argue that Chechnya's resources should be seen as reparations to Russia. Analysts warn of ongoing low-level conflict leading to further militarization, erosion of democracy, and breeding of radicalism and terrorism in Chechnya despite supposed rule of law establishment. Observers warn that the Chechnya conflict is intensifying again, with clashes between Russian forces and Chechen rebels, intra-Chechen clan conflicts, and vendettas. Islamic extremism is on the rise, creating wider schisms within Chechen society and making peace talks challenging for Russia. Islamic unrest in neighboring regions like Dagestan, Ingushetia, and Kabardina-Balkariya is also increasing. The unrest in Dagestan, Ingushetia, and Kabardina-Balkariya regions in 2005-2006 indicates a growing pool of terrorist recruitment in the North Caucasus. Critics accuse Russian troops of using excessive force in Chechnya and committing human rights abuses. U.S. Ambassador to Russia Alexander Vershbow criticized Russia's operations in Chechnya for causing civilian suffering and lack of accountability for troop excesses. The U.S. had concerns about gaining Russia's support before the Iraq conflict, and about terrorist attacks in Iraq afterward. There was a shift in the Administration's approach towards Russia's actions in Chechnya, with less pressure for peace talks and more tolerance for Russia's anti-terrorism efforts. Elections and rebuilding efforts in Chechnya were seen as potential contributors to a political settlement. The U.S. expressed concerns about the legitimacy of Russia's peace process in Chechnya, urging free and fair elections. However, after the regional presidential race, the State Department criticized the elimination of challengers and media constraints, questioning the election's credibility and legitimacy. Putin downplayed the criticism, emphasizing understanding from the U.S. President. The U.S. has criticized elections in Chechnya for lacking democracy and legitimacy, with the State Department emphasizing anti-terrorism efforts over election concerns. Some officials worry that Russia's problematic elections reflect a lack of interest in Western values. The U.S. has criticized problematic elections in Chechnya as a reflection of Russia's disregard for Western democratic values. Despite concerns, U.S. officials prioritize cooperation on anti-terrorism and weapons of mass destruction with Russia, downplaying the Chechnya conflict as an internal matter. However, some observers, like Zbigniew Brzezinski, criticize this approach for showing indifference towards the Chechen plight. The Chechnya conflict is spreading into other areas of the North Caucasus, eroding Russian society. Concerns arise about human rights abuses and authoritarian actions by the Russian government. Recent strains in U.S.-Russia relations are linked to Putin's reaction to statements about Ukraine. Putin suggested that U.S. policy towards Chechnya may be aimed at creating elements that destabilize the Russian Federation. While some Chechen factions are labeled as terrorists, the extent of support from al Qaeda and foreign Islamic fundamentalists remains controversial. Congress has criticized Russia's human rights abuses in Chechnya since 1999. Congress has been at the forefront in allocating assistance for Chechnya, with provisions in appropriations bills cutting aid to Russia unless NGOs are given full access to the region. For FY2005, $5 million was allocated for humanitarian assistance in Chechnya and the North Caucasus, and similar provisions were retained in FY2006 appropriations. For FY2006, Congress allocated $5 million for improvements in basic services, community reconstruction, economic development, and human rights in Chechnya and the North Caucasus. Senator Robert Leahy urged President Bush to address human rights abuses by Russian troops in Chechnya, while Senator John McCain expressed concerns about lagging democratization in Russia. Senator John McCain expressed concerns about Russian President Putin using the Beslan attack to consolidate power and repress media. He emphasized the need for autonomy for Chechens to stop the insurgency. The second Session of the 109th Congress is considering Russian support for anti-terrorism efforts and aid to Russia. The Chechen government has allowed some NGOs and aid agencies to operate in the region. Many NGOs and aid agencies face obstacles in operating in Chechnya, suspecting Russian involvement in targeting aid workers. Russia's new law tightening NGO regulations may further hinder access. The pro-Russian Chechen government is becoming less supportive of NGO activities, as seen in the ban on the Danish Refugee Council for alleged support of Chechen rebels and anti-Islamic views. The Danish Refugee Council faced a ban in Chechnya for alleged support of rebels and anti-Islamic views, which was criticized internationally. The ban was later lifted by the Russian government, allowing the NGO to resume activities in early March 2006."
