    "content": "The current tax law provides significant benefits for health insurance and expenses through tax subsidies, such as federal income tax exclusions and deductions. These benefits raise questions of equity as they reward some individuals more than others and influence the type of coverage people obtain. The tax treatment affects the distribution and cost of healthcare, impacting individuals' ability to choose healthcare providers. This section summarizes the tax treatment of obtaining health insurance and paying healthcare expenses, outlining general rules without discussing all limitations or exceptions. The tax law provides benefits for health insurance and expenses through tax subsidies, including exclusions and deductions. Tax expenditures measure the difference in tax liabilities due to exceptions to a normative comprehensive income tax. These rules have been adopted by states with income taxes. Nearly 60% of the non-institutionalized population under 65 is insured under an employment-based plan, with employers covering about 83% of the cost. Employers typically cover 83% of single coverage and 73% of family coverage costs under employment-based health insurance plans. This employer-paid insurance is excluded from employees' gross income for income tax purposes and is not considered for employment taxes. Premiums paid by employees may be subject to a premium conversion arrangement or counted towards the medical expense deduction. The tax deduction for employer payments is separate from the exclusion for employer-paid insurance. Employers can deduct payments and costs incurred, with the exclusion applying to employees for income taxes. The employer deduction is necessary for measuring net income subject to taxation. Insurance benefits from employment-based plans are excluded from gross income if for medical expenses or physical injuries. Benefits not meeting these criteria are taxable based on the employer's share of insurance costs. Benefits can also be taxable if taxpayers received a tax benefit from deducting expenses in a prior year. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the tax expenditure for employer payments for health insurance premiums, health care, and long-term care insurance premiums will be $117.3 billion in FY2011. The ACA required employers to report the value of health insurance coverage provided to employees on Form W-2 starting in tax-year 2011, but the reporting requirement was deferred until January. Highly compensated employees under discriminatory self-insured plans may have partly taxable benefits. The IRS has deferred the reporting requirement for large employers with more than 250 W-2 form employees until January 2013, making the reporting optional in 2011 and 2012. Smaller employers filing fewer than 250 W-2 forms have the reporting requirement optional for at least 2012. The reporting is for informational purposes to show employees the value of their health care benefits. The amount reported does not affect tax liability as employer contributions to health coverage remain non-taxable. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) allows separated employees and their families to continue employer-sponsored coverage for 18 to 36 months. Private-sector firms with 20 or more employees, state and local governments, and the federal government are subject to COBRA. However, not all individuals who lose their jobs have access to COBRA, as firms with fewer than 20 employees are exempt. Additionally, firms not providing health insurance to current employees are not required to offer COBRA coverage, and the cost of COBRA premiums may be prohibitive for some individuals. The COBRA premiums may be prohibitive for unemployed individuals, especially when compared to unemployment compensation. Taxpayers can deduct unreimbursed medical expenses that exceed 7.5% of AGI, but starting in 2013, the threshold will increase to 10% for taxpayers under 65. Medical expenses include health insurance premiums paid by the taxpayer, such as individual market policies and employee's share of premiums for employment-based coverage. The deduction for medical expenses includes costs for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease, as well as certain transportation and lodging expenses. It is not widely used as most taxpayers' standard deduction is higher than their itemized deductions. Only about 7% of tax returns in 2008 claimed this deduction, with taxpayers earning below $50,000 accounting for 41% of claimants. The FY2011 tax expenditure for this deduction is estimated by the JCT. The FY2011 tax expenditure for the medical expense deduction is estimated to be around $13.5 billion. Approximately 6% of individuals under 65 are insured through private individual market policies, including early retirees, young adults, and the self-employed. These individuals can claim the deduction if they qualify by itemizing and exceeding 7.5% of their AGI in unreimbursed expenses. Certain types of individual market insurance premiums are not deductible. The self-employed individuals, including sole proprietors, general partners, limited partners, and S-corporation shareholders, can deduct payments for health insurance as an \"above-the-line\" deduction. This deduction is not restricted to itemizers and can be taken into consideration up to 100% of the insurance cost, but it cannot exceed the net profit. The deduction for health insurance costs for self-employed individuals is limited by factors such as net profit, earned income, and eligibility for subsidized employment-based health plans. This deduction cannot exceed the net profit and any other earned income from the business, less deductions taken for certain retirement plans and for one-half the self-employment tax. The portion not deductible under these rules may be treated as an itemized medical expense deduction. The self-employed health insurance deduction allows self-employed individuals to deduct health insurance costs from their taxes. In 2008, 2.4 million tax returns claimed this deduction, totaling $5.1 billion in tax expenditure for FY2011. Cafeteria plans offer employees the choice between cash and nontaxable benefits like employer-paid health insurance. These benefits are exempt from taxation under specific conditions outlined in the Code. Cafeteria plans offer employees the option to choose between cash and nontaxable benefits, such as health insurance, under specific conditions outlined in the Code. These benefits are exempt from income and employment taxes. Complex plans allow employees to allocate a \"pot of money\" among various benefits like health insurance, dependent care assistance, and commuter benefits. Premium conversion allows employees to reduce taxable wages in exchange for pretax payment of health insurance premiums, reducing both income and employment taxes. Federal employees have had this option since October 2000, and private sector and state/local government employees may also elect premium conversion. Premium conversion is not available to retirees due to an IRS ruling that pension payments are always subject to taxes, with exceptions. However, employer payments for retiree health insurance are tax-exempt. Certain retired public safety officers can pay up to $3,000 of health insurance premiums from their pensions on a pretax basis each year. For retirees, employer payments for health insurance are tax-exempt. Flexible spending accounts (FSAs) reimburse employees for specified expenses and are closely related to cafeteria plans. FSAs can be used for dependent care or medical expenses, but must have separate accounts for each purpose. FSA reimbursements funded through salary reduction agreements are exempt from taxes. Health care FSAs funded through salary reduction agreements are exempt from income and employment taxes under cafeteria plan provisions. FSA reimbursements funded by employer contributions are tax-exempt under provisions for employer-paid dependent care or health insurance. Participants must elect a benefit amount before the plan year, which cannot be changed unless there is a family status change. Unused amounts at the end of the year are forfeited to the employer (the \"use it or lose it\" rule). Beginning in 2011, over-the-counter medications (except those prescribed by a physician) are no longer considered a qualified medical expense for health care flexible spending accounts (FSAs). According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics National Compensation Survey, 39% of all workers in 2010 had access to an FSA, with 56% of workers in firms with more than 100 employees having access. Employers may allow a 2\u00bd-month grace period for unused FSA funds, and military reservists called to active duty may receive remaining funds. In small businesses, only 20% of workers had access to a health care FSA. 37% of employees offered an FSA chose to participate, with an average annual contribution of $1,420. Federal employees have had access to FSAs since July 2003, with 240,000 federal health care FSAs in September 2008. Health Reimbursement Accounts (HRAs) are employer-established arrangements for medical expenses not covered by insurance. Contributions to HRAs can only be made by employers, not through salary reduction agreements. Health Reimbursement Accounts (HRAs) are employer-funded accounts that can be used for medical expenses not covered by insurance. Unlike FSAs, employers do not have to fund HRAs until employees use them, and unused balances can be carried over indefinitely. HRAs are governed by specific Code provisions and IRS guidance. Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) allow individuals to pay for unreimbursed medical expenses on a tax-advantaged basis, with eligibility requirements including a high-deductible health plan. In 2012, the deductible for self-only coverage must be at least $1,200 with an annual out-of-pocket limit not exceeding $6,050; for family coverage, the deductible must be at least $2,400 with an annual out-of-pocket limit not exceeding $12,100. The annual HSA contribution limits in 2012 are $3,100 for individuals with self-only coverage and $6,250 for family coverage, with an additional $1,000 contribution allowed for individuals aged 55 and older. HSA contributions are tax-deductible and exempt from income and employment taxes, and distributions for qualified medical expenses are not taxable. In 2012, HSA contributions are tax-deductible and distributions for qualified medical expenses are not taxable. However, distributions not used for qualified medical expenses are taxable as ordinary income with an additional 20% penalty tax for those under 65. The definition of qualified medical expenses excludes over-the-counter prescriptions not prescribed by a physician. Nearly 10 million people were covered by qualifying high-deductible insurance plans in January 2010, including policyholders and family members. The tax expenditure attributable to HSAs for FY2011 is estimated to be about $1.2 billion. MSAs, also known as Archer MSAs, were introduced in 1997 for self-employed individuals or employees covered by a high-deductible insurance plan from a small employer. Contributions are limited and can only be made when the account owners have qualifying high-deductible insurance. Contributions can be made by individuals or employers, but not both, and cannot occur through salary-reduction agreements. Contributions are tax-deductible for individuals and exempt from income and employment taxes for employers. Withdrawals for qualified medical expenses are tax-free, and unused balances can accumulate without limit. MSAs, introduced in 1997, are for self-employed individuals or employees with high-deductible insurance. Contributions are limited to those with qualifying insurance, tax-deductible for individuals, and exempt for employers. Withdrawals for medical expenses are tax-free, with unused balances accumulating without limit. The legislative limit on MSAs is 750,000, but there are far fewer accounts established. Three groups are eligible for the health coverage tax credit. The Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) program provides assistance to eligible individuals, including those receiving wage subsidies and aged 55 and older. Recipients cannot have certain other health insurance or be entitled to Medicare. The HCTC covers 72.5% of qualifying insurance premiums for the taxpayer and their family, with up to 11 types of coverage specified. The credit is payable in advance to insurers and is refundable. The Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) program provides assistance to eligible individuals, covering 72.5% of qualifying insurance premiums. The program is refundable and will end on January 1, 2014, when premium credits under the ACA will be available. The U.S. Department of Defense provides health care to active duty military personnel, retirees, and dependents through TRICARE plans, with about 9 million eligible for coverage. Military health care benefits are not taxable. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs provides health care to veterans through various facilities and clinics, prioritizing eligibility based on disability severity, military service history, and means testing. Just over 5.5 million veterans receive services, with coverage not being an entitlement. Medicare is a national health insurance program for people aged 65 and older or who meet certain disability tests, covering nearly 48 million individuals. Medicare Part A, financed by employment taxes, provides insurance for hospitalization, skilled nursing facilities, post-hospitalization home health, and hospice care. Tax payments for Medicare cannot be deducted as medical expenses, but employers can deduct them as a business expense. Workers and their spouses become eligible for Part A after paying employment taxes for a certain period. Medicare Part A is financed by employment taxes and provides insurance for hospitalization, skilled nursing facilities, post-hospitalization home health, and hospice care. People aged 65 and older can voluntarily enroll in Part A by paying a monthly premium, which can be deducted as a medical expense. Medicare Part B is financed by general tax revenues and monthly premiums, while Part D for prescription drugs is also financed by general tax revenues and monthly premiums. Premiums for Parts B and D can be deducted as medical expenses. Medicare Part C offers Medicare Advantage plans, requiring enrollment in Parts A and B. Some plans may have additional premiums, deductible, and copayments that can be deducted as medical expenses. Medicare Medical Savings Account plans under Part C have tax benefits similar to Health Savings Accounts. Contributions and earnings are tax-exempt, and withdrawals for medical expenses are also tax-free. Contributions to Medicare MSA plans are made by CMS. Medicaid, administered by each state, provides healthcare services for various populations including the elderly, disabled, pregnant women, and low-income families. Medicaid waivers offer states flexibility for certain populations, with nearly 70 million people covered in 2011. Medicaid covers nearly 70 million people in 2011, with benefits not taxable. Medicaid eligibility will expand in 2014 to include households with income below 133% of the federal poverty level. CHIP provides health insurance to children in families without coverage, with some states expanding Medicaid to cover these children. CHIP waivers allow coverage for adults as well. VEBA plans provide various benefits to employee members and their dependents, such as life insurance, medical, disability, and accident coverage. These plans are organized as trusts to be separate from employers, offering tax exemptions on investment earnings and benefits paid out. Employer contributions are tax deductible, but deductions are limited to qualified direct costs and additions to qualified asset accounts. VEBAs are used for prefunding retiree health benefits by some employers, especially in heavy manufacturing, communication, transportation, and utility industries. They are considered qualified insurance for the Health Coverage Tax Credit. Reserves for retiree health benefits must be funded over working lives on a level basis, using actuarial assumptions. Limitations reduce the utility of VEBAs for retiree health plans, but not for collectively bargained plans or MEWAs of 10 or more employers. Tax benefits help extend insurance coverage to more people by lowering after-tax costs, addressing Congress's concern about healthcare access. The public subsidy in incentives aims to prevent under-insurance and market failure. Uninsured individuals impose costs on society, leading to spill-over effects. Tax benefits also encourage individuals to obtain more coverage than they might otherwise choose. Some individuals purchase more comprehensive insurance coverage with lower cost-sharing, including routine doctor visits and prescription drugs. Tax benefits associated with Health Savings Accounts aim to promote less coverage by having higher deductibles. Employment-based insurance in the United States is influenced by tax benefits, with employer-paid insurance being predominant due to uncapped exclusions. Individual private market insurance covers only about 6% of the noninstitutionalized population under 65. This type of insurance offers advantages such as coverage based on larger risk pools, which can lower costs for those needing more care. Employee premiums do not vary by age or risk, providing stability for the typical worker. Employer-paid insurance in the United States is predominant due to tax benefits, covering about 94% of the noninstitutionalized population under 65. Employee premiums do not vary by age or risk, providing stability for workers. Plans chosen by employers may not meet individual workers' needs, leading to potential issues when changing jobs. Tax benefits increase the demand for health care, which can be beneficial or wasteful depending on the necessity of the care. Increasing use of health care contributes to rising costs. Consumer-driven health care, such as high-deductible insurance plans with Health Reimbursement Accounts and Health Savings Accounts, aims to provide coverage without driving up costs. Comprehensive reforms, like capping the exclusion for employer-paid insurance and replacing it with a limited tax credit, could help achieve this goal. However, implementing substantial changes may be challenging and could create inequities. The Congressional Budget Office analyzed the potential effects of Consumer-Directed Health Plans in a December 2006 publication. Many individuals may still obtain health insurance even without tax benefits. The cost of subsidizing people for what they would otherwise do is inefficient. Tax incentives for insurance should result in better healthcare for society, but revising them to achieve this goal is complex due to different insurance provisions and regulations. Distribution of tax incentives raises questions about horizontal equity, as they are not available to everyone. Workers without employment-based insurance and early retirees may not benefit from them. The tax incentives for health insurance deductions and exclusions are determined by taxpayers' marginal tax rate, leading to questions of vertical equity. The exclusion for employer-paid insurance is unlimited, while deductions for individuals are subject to a 7.5% of AGI threshold. This pattern of benefits may be seen as unfair if health insurance is considered a form of personal consumption. Tax incentives for health insurance deductions are based on taxpayers' marginal tax rates, which raises questions about vertical equity. The uncertainty of who pays for employer subsidies complicates the assessment of equity in these incentives. In the long run, the cost of subsidies is likely passed on to workers through wage and benefit reductions, but how these reductions are distributed among workers is unclear due to differences in preferences, attachment to employers, and labor market forces. Estimate of the Welfare Loss of Excess Health Insurance. Various studies on health reform and tax policy for health insurance have been conducted by researchers such as Furman, Gruber, Hubbard, Kaplow, Kahn, Smart, and Stabile. Mark Stabile's research on tax credits and medical care, along with studies by Pauly and Herring on expanding coverage through tax credits, have been influential in the discussion on health insurance and market failure. The President's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform also proposed solutions to fix America's tax system. Additionally, the U.S. Congressional Budget Office has examined the potential effects of consumer-directed health plans on healthcare spending and outcomes. The general formula for calculating federal income taxes is provided, omitting some steps like prepayments and the alternative minimum tax."
