    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999\". Congress finds that states vary in demographics, school governance, and funding mechanisms, which may require different approaches to improve education. Federal education statutes can impede local reform efforts, but granting waivers can help remove obstacles and raise achievement levels for all children. State educational agencies have the authority to waive certain Federal and State requirements to align with local initiatives and improve education. The Education Flexibility Partnership Demonstration Act allows for waivers, but only 12 States qualify. Expanding waiver authority can remove obstacles that impede progress. To streamline State and local educational improvement plans, certain statutory and regulatory requirements may be waived to reduce burdens on program administration while upholding civil rights, educational equity, and accountability. The focus should be on achieving results in raising student achievement, rather than on processes. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines terms such as \"local educational agency,\" \"State educational agency,\" \"outlying areas,\" \"Secretary,\" and \"State.\" SEC. 4. EDUCATION FLEXIBILITY PARTNERSHIP. The Education Flexibility Program allows the Secretary to authorize a State educational agency to waive certain requirements for programs or Acts, creating Ed-Flex Partnership States. Eligible States can participate in this program. The term \"eligible State\" refers to a State that has developed and implemented challenging State content standards, student performance standards, and aligned assessments as required by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Alternatively, an eligible State has made substantial progress towards meeting these requirements. The Secretary determines funding for standards and assessments, holds agencies accountable for meeting goals, and waives state requirements for education. The State educational agency must submit an application to the Secretary for participation in the education flexibility program, demonstrating adoption of an educational flexibility plan. The State educational agency must describe the process for evaluating waiver requests from local educational agencies or schools regarding Federal and State statutory or regulatory requirements related to education. The Secretary may approve waivers based on the detailed descriptions provided. The Secretary may approve an application for educational reform if it shows promise in assisting State educational agencies and local schools. Factors considered include the quality of the educational flexibility plan, accountability measures, and the importance of the State's goals. The State educational agency's process for approving and monitoring waivers of Federal and State statutory or regulatory requirements is essential for educational reform. Local educational agencies or schools must request waivers from the State agency. When requesting a waiver from a State educational agency, the application must include details on the Federal programs affected, the reasons for waiving each requirement, and specific educational goals for each school year. When applying for a waiver from a State educational agency, the application must include details on affected Federal programs, reasons for waiving requirements, and specific educational goals. The State agency will evaluate the application based on the State's educational flexibility plan and will only approve it if the local educational agency or school has a relevant reform plan in place. The State educational agency evaluates waiver applications based on educational goals and reform plans. The agency monitors activities of local educational agencies and schools receiving waivers, submitting annual reports to the Secretary. Federal waivers approved by the Secretary cannot exceed 5 years. The Secretary may extend a waiver period exceeding 5 years if deemed effective in enabling State or local educational agencies to carry out reform plans. The Secretary will review and terminate an agency's waiver-granting authority if performance is inadequate. The agency has the authority to issue waivers despite other regulations. The Secretary has the authority to issue waivers for the education flexibility program for fiscal years 2000 through 2004. The programs included in the waivers are Title I, Part A of Title II, Subpart 2 of Part A of Title III, Title IV, and Title VI of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The Secretary has the authority to issue waivers for certain education programs, including Title VI of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, Part C of title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, and The Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 1998. Waivers cannot be granted for specific requirements such as maintenance of effort, comparability of services, equitable participation of students and staff in private schools, parental involvement, distribution of funds, and use of Federal funds. The Act allows waivers for certain education programs, ensuring compliance with civil rights requirements and maintaining the underlying purposes of each program. State educational agencies with waiver authority under specific provisions of law are not affected. The Secretary reviews the progress of State educational agencies, local educational agencies, or schools to determine if they are achieving desired results. The decision to authorize waivers is published in the Federal Register and disseminated to various parties."
