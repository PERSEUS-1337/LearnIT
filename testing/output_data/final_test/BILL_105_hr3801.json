    "content": "SECTION 1. NEEDS-BASED BANKRUPTCY. Title 11 of the United States Code is amended to define 'current monthly total income' as the average monthly income received by the debtor or debtor and spouse in the 180-day period before the case is commenced, including amounts paid by others for household expenses. The amendment to Title 11 of the United States Code defines 'State median family income' and 'State median household income for 1 earner' based on Census Bureau data for the debtor's domicile in the 180 days before filing for bankruptcy. The amendment to Title 11 of the United States Code modifies various sections related to income and expenses in bankruptcy cases, including determining income available to pay creditors and additional expenses. The amendment to Title 11 of the United States Code introduces new criteria for determining income available to pay creditors in bankruptcy cases, including thresholds for current monthly income, projected net income, and repayment of unsecured nonpriority claims. The amendment to Title 11 of the United States Code sets criteria for income available to pay creditors in bankruptcy cases, including projected monthly net income requirements for repayment plans. This includes deducting expenses from total income to determine the amount payable to unsecured nonpriority creditors. The amendment to Title 11 of the United States Code establishes criteria for income available to pay creditors in bankruptcy cases, including projected monthly net income requirements for repayment plans. This involves calculating average monthly payments for secured and priority creditors over a 60-month period. If necessary, additional expenses due to extraordinary circumstances can be considered in determining projected monthly net income. The subsection specifies that in determining eligibility for relief under chapter 7 bankruptcy, the debtor must provide a written statement, list of additional expenses exceeding allowances, detailed description of extraordinary circumstances, and a sworn statement. The debtor must provide a sworn statement signed by them or their attorney confirming the accuracy of the information. The projected monthly net income stated by the debtor will be used unless objected to within 60 days. The court will then determine if extraordinary circumstances exist. The court will determine if extraordinary circumstances exist and establish the additional expense allowance. The burden of disproving such circumstances lies with the objector. If a party fails to prevail on a motion to dismiss a case under chapter 7, they must pay the debtor's reasonable attorney's fees and costs. In section 1302(b), there are amendments made to paragraphs (1) and (10) regarding the review of materials provided by the debtor and the investigation of the debtor's projected monthly net income. The court must file a report within 30 days to determine if the debtor qualifies under this chapter. Amendments are made to paragraphs (1) and (10) of section 1302(b) to review materials provided by the debtor and investigate the debtor's projected monthly net income. The court must file a report within 30 days to determine if the debtor qualifies under this chapter. Additionally, new paragraphs (6) and (7) are added to investigate and verify the debtor's monthly net income, file annual reports with the court, and assess if modifications to creditor payments are necessary due to changes in the debtor's income. The Act and its amendments will take effect on the enactment date, with application only to cases under title 11 of the United States Code initiated after that date."
