    "content": "Since the creation of the modern U.S. intelligence community after World War II, the total extent of intelligence spending has not been publicly disclosed, except for two fiscal years in the 1990s. Intelligence programs and personnel have been hidden within the Department of Defense budget, a practice criticized by proponents of open government. Efforts in the mid-1970s to increase Congressional oversight of the Intelligence Community also included proposals to make intelligence spending public. The end of the Cold War led to arguments that the aggregate amount of intelligence spending should no longer be kept secret. In the 1990s, there were proposals to disclose total intelligence spending, but Congress did not require it. Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet released total figures for intelligence appropriations during the Clinton Administration. The 9/11 Commission recommended making intelligence budget amounts public, but subsequent appropriations levels have not been disclosed. Various proposals for intelligence reform included provisions for budget transparency, but the Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 did not include this measure. The Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 did not include provisions for making budget numbers public. The FY2007 Intelligence Authorization legislation would require publication of budget totals for national intelligence programs. The report discusses the constituent parts of the intelligence budget, arguments for and against making spending totals public, and past congressional interest in keeping intelligence spending secret. The term \"intelligence budget\" is not easily defined. The intelligence budget encompasses various agencies and functions involved in intelligence activities, excluding some information collection efforts like reporting by U.S. embassies. Intelligence-related activities in the Department of Defense are also included in overall intelligence spending. Annual intelligence authorization acts authorize intelligence activities, and both the executive branch and Congress seek a comprehensive overview of intelligence collection. The concept of an intelligence community emerged to provide a comprehensive overview of all intelligence collection systems and activities. It is not a monolithic organization but a grouping of governmental entities, including the CIA and NSA, as well as smaller intelligence offices within departments like Treasury and Energy. These components are integral parts of agencies outside the Intelligence Community, with separate authorization processes for their budgets. For example, the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research is part of both the Intelligence Community and the Department of State, with its budget considered part of the overall intelligence budget and the State Department budget. Similar situations exist in the Defense Department on a larger scale. The U.S. \"intelligence budget\" includes activities authorized by annual intelligence authorization acts for various government elements such as the CIA, NSA, DIA, NGA, NRO, and intelligence elements of the military branches. Desegregating intelligence and non-intelligence costs in the Defense Department is challenging due to shared facilities and administrative structures. The U.S. intelligence budget includes activities from various government elements like the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, State Department, FBI, DHS, Coast Guard, Treasury, Energy, and DEA. The lines between intelligence and other information-gathering efforts can be blurred, with some activities closely related to intelligence but not officially classified as such. The U.S. intelligence budget is divided into the National Intelligence Program (NIP) and the Military Intelligence Program (MIP). NIP programs support national-level decision making and involve agencies like the CIA, DIA, NSA, NRO, and NGA. MIP programs support defense policymaking and military commanders worldwide. Prior to September 2005, DOD had the Joint Military Intelligence Program (JMIP) and Tactical Intelligence and Related Activities (TIARA). In September 2005, the Defense Department combined the JMIP and TIARA programs into the MIP, which includes programs supporting DOD-wide intelligence efforts and military operations. The relationship between intelligence-related programs and regular intelligence programs is complex and not easily understood by the public. The role of intelligence-related programs, described as a \"loose amalgamation of activities,\" is integral to defense programs and constitutes a significant portion of total intelligence spending. These programs are often supported by non-intelligence personnel and facilities, and their complexity is often misunderstood in public discussions. The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) has extensive statutory authority following the passage of the Intelligence Reform Act in 2004. Since the Intelligence Reform Act in 2004, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) has authority for developing the National Intelligence Program (NIP) and presenting it to the President for approval. The DNI's office prepares the annual budget and the DNI participates in the Military Intelligence Program (MIP) development with the Secretary of Defense. The Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD(I)) oversees Defense intelligence budget matters and coordinates with the DNI. The Office of the DNI and the USD(I) play essential roles in the MIP, with overlapping responsibilities requiring close coordination. President Truman established the Central Intelligence Group (CIG) in 1946 to provide direction over intelligence efforts post-World War II. This was a coordinative group, not a new agency, with funding limitations that raised concerns about the need for specific authorization from Congress. The Central Intelligence Group (CIG) was established in 1946 by President Truman to oversee intelligence efforts after World War II. Concerns arose about the legality of funding the CIG without specific authorization from Congress. General Vandenberg created a \"working fund\" from State, War, and Navy Departments to cover CIG costs. Efforts were made to obtain congressional approval for an independent intelligence agency with its own budget, leading to the National Security Act of 1947. The National Security Act of 1947 established the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) with its own budget and a Director of Central Intelligence. The Act authorized the transfer of personnel, property, and records from the Central Intelligence Group (CIG) to the CIA. Congress later passed the Central Intelligence Act of 1949 to provide a firmer statutory base for the CIA and establish procedures for regular appropriations. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was established in 1947 with its own budget and a Director of Central Intelligence. The Central Intelligence Act of 1949 provided a firmer statutory base for the CIA and authorized the transfer of funds between government agencies for agency functions. This legislation allowed the CIA to receive and transfer approved sums for its operations without limitations on appropriations. The CIA receives its funding through the defense authorization and appropriation process, as outlined in the CIA Act of 1949. The budget requests and actions taken by Congress regarding CIA funding were kept secret by senior members of the Appropriations Committees. Subcommittees were established in the Armed Services in 1956. In 1956, subcommittees were created in the Armed Services and Appropriations Committees of each House to oversee the CIA. Congressional oversight of intelligence activities was initially seen as supportive and perfunctory, but this view has been challenged. Evidence shows Congress closely monitored intelligence spending, especially on surveillance systems and headquarters construction. Senator Richard Russell played a key role in intelligence oversight during the Eisenhower Administration. During the Cold War, intelligence budgets grew significantly to determine Soviet nuclear capabilities through surveillance by U-2s and satellites. NSA and DIA became major agencies with large budgets, leading to the development of strategic weapons systems and arms control agreements with the Soviet Union. These programs, funded by Congress in secrecy, involved multiple intelligence agencies and DOD components. President Lyndon Johnson acknowledged the importance of these efforts in 1967. President Lyndon Johnson highlighted the value of the space program in 1967, stating that the knowledge gained from space photography alone was worth ten times the program's cost. Satellites provided crucial intelligence on enemy missile capabilities, leading to a reevaluation of defense strategies. Executive orders during the Ford Administration consolidated intelligence agency budgets and mandated reviews of the National Foreign Intelligence Program. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 established the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to coordinate intelligence activities and manage the National Intelligence Program (NIP). The DNI is responsible for developing the annual NIP budget and participates in the development of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP). Congressional oversight has played a key role in encouraging consolidated review of the intelligence budget. After the Vietnam War, Congress created select committees to investigate intelligence agencies due to revelations of illegal activities. The Church and Pike Committees conducted hearings and recommended strengthening congressional oversight and establishing permanent intelligence committees. Congress then worked to revamp oversight and increase public access to information on intelligence agencies. Following the Church and Pike Committees' work, Congress established the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) in 1976 and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) in 1977 to oversee intelligence agencies and prevent abuses. HPSCI oversees NIP and shares oversight of MIP with the Armed Services Committee, while SSCI only oversees NIP. Oversight of the MIP is conducted by the Armed Services Committee in consultation with the intelligence committee. The final bill authorizes intelligence activities and related activities, with armed services committees also issuing reports on intelligence authorization bills. Annual defense authorization acts cover intelligence efforts of national intelligence agencies in DOD and the four services, while other agencies' intelligence activities are authorized separately. Intelligence oversight involves reviewing and monitoring by congressional committees. The intelligence oversight process involves reviewing annual budget proposals for the Intelligence Community, conducting hearings, and preparing authorization bills. Classified annexes accompany these bills with dollar amounts for intelligence agencies. While intelligence committees have oversight, defense authorization acts also cover intelligence activities. Classified parts of defense bills include intelligence program authorizations. Members can access classified parts of defense authorization bills, including special access programs like intelligence and procurement of new weapons systems. Other authorization bills cover intelligence activities with shared oversight. Budgets for INR, DEA, and FBI are funded through appropriation bills for specific departments. These represent a small percentage of total intelligence spending, with INR's FY2007 budget request totaling $51 million. The FY2007 budget request for INR was only $51 million, with other agencies receiving smaller amounts. There was controversy over the specific authorization required for intelligence activities, as President George H.W. Bush vetoed the FY1991 Intelligence Authorization bill. Intelligence activities continued without an authorization act for over eight months. The House Intelligence Committee stated that only an intelligence authorization bill provides the necessary specificity to comply with Section 504(a) of the National Security Act of 1947. In 1993, the Armed Services Committee clarified that the inclusion of NFIP programs in defense authorization bills did not meet the specific authorization requirements. Additionally, the FY1994 Intelligence Authorization Act amended the National Security Act. The FY1994 Intelligence Authorization Act (P.L. 103-178) clarified that general authorization does not fulfill the requirement for specific authorization of intelligence activities. In some cases, appropriations acts have included provisions deeming funds for intelligence activities as specifically authorized until the enactment of an Intelligence Authorization Act. No FY2006 intelligence authorization bill was passed, so a clause in the appropriations bill served as authorization. A similar clause was included in the FY2007 defense appropriations bill. Less congressional guidance is provided for intelligence programs, with appropriations committees playing a central role. In recent years, appropriations committees have gained significant influence over intelligence activities. The reliance on supplemental appropriations for funding intelligence agencies has limited congressional guidance on the intelligence budget, which has been widely criticized for its negative impact on planning. The reliance on supplemental appropriations for intelligence activities has eroded long-term strategic planning. The hope is that the Intelligence Community can now begin long-term planning with stable resources. The use of appropriations measures to authorize intelligence programs may shift intelligence oversight towards the appropriations committees in Congress. Budget requests and funding levels for intelligence agencies within the Department of Defense (DOD) are approved by appropriations committees. This includes the CIA, NSA, DIA, NRO, and NGA. The Secretary of Defense plays a significant role in overseeing the budgets and activities of these agencies. Other departments also receive smaller amounts of intelligence funding. In 1992, the Defense Appropriation Act for FY1993 reduced funding for intelligence activities. In 1992, the Defense Appropriation Act for FY1993 reduced intelligence spending below authorized levels. Intelligence programs have been affected by appropriations measures, with no intelligence authorization act in FY2006. Intelligence budgets have not been public since the creation of the modern Intelligence Community after World War II. The CIA and other intelligence agencies' funding was transferred secretly from the Army, Navy, and State Departments. The Intelligence Community Management Account and CIA Retirement and Disability System costs are publicly disclosed. The CIA and other intelligence agencies' funding was transferred secretly from the Army, Navy, and State Departments. For FY2005, $310.4 million was authorized for 310 full-time CMA personnel and $239.4 million for CIARDS. The Church and Pike committees called for public disclosure of intelligence budgets, but the DCI and President Ford opposed it. The SSCI recommended disclosure in May 1977. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) recommended in May 1977 that the aggregate amounts appropriated for national foreign intelligence activities for FY1978 be disclosed, but the full Senate did not act on this. Despite willingness from then DCI Stansfield Turner to disclose a single budget figure, HPSCI unanimously concluded that there was no persuasive reason for public disclosure of intelligence budgets. Efforts to draft a legislative charter for intelligence activities during the Carter Administration were ultimately unsuccessful. Efforts to draft a legislative charter for the Intelligence Community were unsuccessful during the Carter Administration. The Reagan Administration showed less interest in this as it expanded intelligence activities. The issue resurfaced during the Clinton Administration and after the 9/11 Commission recommendations. Members of the intelligence committees have been able to review classified budget figures, but rules prevent the disclosure of classified information. Arguments for and against public disclosure of intelligence spending levels have remained consistent since the 1970s. Advocates of disclosure argue that public discussion of intelligence spending would strengthen the intelligence effort by highlighting inefficiencies. Senator William Proxmire emphasized the importance of transparency for a more efficient government. Advocates believe that disclosing intelligence spending would lead to a more efficient government by allowing for criticism and improvement. Revealing aggregate figures for intelligence spending could result in a cleaner defense budget and help identify extraneous expenditures not directly related to defense. Advocates argue that disclosing intelligence spending, including extraneous costs, would lead to a more efficient government. They believe that keeping intelligence budget totals secret serves only to prevent taxpayers from knowing how much is spent on intelligence. Opposition to public release of intelligence budget information is based on the belief that revealing such details could compromise national security. Intelligence activities are seen as exceptional and require extraordinary protective measures due to their vulnerability to exploitation by adversaries. In 1983, HPSCI highlighted the vulnerabilities of intelligence systems, stating that intelligence activities are fragile and can be compromised rapidly. Budget disclosure could be more detrimental to national security than to citizens, as it could be used to frustrate US intelligence missions. After the Cold War, there were arguments for reducing intelligence spending, with some believing that public perception of unjustified spending levels could lead to significant budget cuts. In the early 1990s, there was a concern about public opposition to intelligence spending levels. However, after the emergence of international terrorism and the 9/11 attacks, there was a shift towards prioritizing intelligence spending for national security. In recent years, the argument for disclosing intelligence spending levels has not been linked to reducing spending. The public's opposition to intelligence spending levels has shifted towards prioritizing national security after the emergence of international terrorism and the 9/11 attacks. Arguments against disclosing spending levels include concerns about the public's understanding of the breakdown of the figures and the potential for adversaries to exploit the information for countermeasures. Some argue for disclosing intelligence spending as a percentage of overall defense spending, citing Admiral Bobby Ray Inman's testimony. Opponents fear revealing fluctuations could expose new programs under development. According to a 1991 Senate report, there have been debates about the public disclosure of intelligence budgets. Some defense analysts argue that revealing changes in intelligence budgets could alert adversaries to new efforts or a decrease in U.S. efforts. The discussion often revolves around the constitutionality and propriety of keeping intelligence budgets secret. The debate over public disclosure of intelligence budgets often focuses on constitutionality and propriety. The nature of intelligence spending, including the roles of the NIP and MIP, is less discussed. Concerns arise about categorizing tactical intelligence programs and the potential arbitrariness in their inclusion in the MIP program. Some projects in the MIP program are inconsistently included each year, causing confusion in tracking intelligence spending. There are discussions about only making the NIP budget public, which includes funding for key agencies like the CIA, NRO, NGA, and NSA. There is a proposal to consolidate NIP authorization under intelligence committees and leave MIP to the armed services committees. The jurisdiction of the Armed Services committees is likely to continue due to the NIP including budgets of major defense agencies. Close ties between NRO, NGA, and other agencies are also highlighted. In 2002, the position of Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD(I)) was established to oversee the budgets of DOD's intelligence agencies, including NIP and MIP. The USD(I) collaborates with the Office of the DNI in preparing annual budget submissions to Congress. The issue of disclosing an aggregate intelligence budget figure raises questions about the Statement and Account Clause of the United States Constitution. The Statement and Account Clause of the United States Constitution, found in Article I, Section 9, Clause 7, requires disclosure of public money receipts and expenditures. The history of this clause dates back to the Constitutional Convention in 1787, with George Mason proposing the initial language. Col. Mason proposed annual publication of public expenditures, Mr. Gerry seconded. Mr. Govr. Morris argued it would be impossible, Mr. King mentioned the difficulty in detailing every shilling. Mr. Madison suggested changing \"annually\" to \"from time to time\" for frequent publications. Mr. Wilson supported the motion, citing the impracticality of timely finance disclosures. During the Virginia ratifying convention, the Statement and Account Clause was amended to include regular publication of receipts and expenditures of public money. James Madison emphasized the importance of timely finance disclosures for transparency and accountability. The Statement and Account Clause was amended during the Virginia ratifying convention to include regular publication of receipts and expenditures of public money. George Mason raised concerns about the ambiguity of the \"from time to time\" language, arguing that it could be extended indefinitely and that secrecy was only necessary for military operations and foreign negotiations. The curr_chunk discusses the debate over the transparency of public money expenditures. Mr. LEE argued that the expression \"from time to time\" was clear and meant short, convenient periods, while others, like George Mason, raised concerns about potential misuse of public funds if the information was not regularly disclosed. The curr_chunk focuses on the approval of a provision regarding the appropriation of public money by law, which was seen as a cautious and commendable measure by Mr. Nicholas, Mr. Corbin, and Mr. Madison. They believed that this provision would prevent any misapplication of funds. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of publishing expenditures regularly to ensure transparency and prevent errors. Mr. Mason compares this provision to the Confederation's monthly publication of public proceedings. This measure is seen as more thorough than any state constitution. The curr_chunk discusses the need for a bill of rights in the government to set limits on Congress's powers. It emphasizes the importance of transparency and accountability in public expenditures. The curr_chunk discusses the limitations of the congressional bill of rights and the potential implications of Congress exceeding its powers. It highlights the need for stronger restrictions to prevent abuse of power. The curr_chunk emphasizes the importance of transparency in government, comparing it to the openness of the legislature. It questions the need for additional security measures in the new government when the people already have access to legislative journals and debates daily. The curr_chunk discusses the power of Congress over privileges and the need for transparency in government. It references debates in New York and Maryland on the power to tax and the accountability of Congress in managing public funds. The curr_chunk emphasizes the importance of transparency in government finances, highlighting the need for public inspection of general government accounts. It also discusses the accountability of representatives in providing frequent and detailed statements of public expenditures. The curr_chunk discusses the principles of the proposed Constitution regarding the regulation of public money in the treasury, emphasizing the importance of transparency and accountability in government finances. It also touches on the debate surrounding the need for such provisions and the practical impact of requiring appropriations by law. The delegates debated the necessity of transparency in public finances, with some acknowledging the need for secrecy in certain situations. Mr. Wilson and Mr. Mason discussed the limitations of publishing financial operations, military actions, and foreign negotiations. Mr. McHenry expressed concerns about the potential for Congress to conceal public wealth under the clause's requirement of periodic publication. The Statement and Account Clause in the Constitution aimed to ensure transparency in public finances, with concerns raised about Congress potentially concealing public wealth. The clause imposed a duty to disclose information on public receipts and expenditures, but the scope and frequency of disclosures were not clearly defined. Some delegates at the Constitutional Convention and ratifying conventions anticipated delays or secrecy in releasing certain information. In 1974, the United States Supreme Court ruled on United States v. Richardson, where a federal taxpayer challenged the constitutionality of CIA expenditure reporting provisions under the Statement and Account Clause. The provisions allowed the CIA to account for its expenditures based solely on the Director's certificate, leading to concerns about transparency and constitutionality. The Supreme Court ruled on United States v. Richardson in 1974, where a federal taxpayer challenged CIA expenditure reporting provisions. The Court found the respondent did not have standing to sue, without addressing the constitutional question. The Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Richardson in 1974 that the respondent did not have standing to sue regarding CIA expenditure reporting provisions. The absence of any individual or class to litigate these claims supports the argument that Congress has the authority over the issue. Congress has the power to require any reporting and accounting it deems necessary in the public interest. It is questionable if the Framers of the Constitution intended for general directives to be enforced by individual citizens. The genesis of cl. 7 suggests secrecy of governmental operations, with Congress having the power to enforce through the \"power of the purse.\" Congress could grant standing to taxpayers or citizens, limited by Art. III. Nearly two centuries of acceptance show Congress's plenary power to specify when Executive agencies must report expenditure of funds and exempt secret activities from public reporting. Several lower court decisions, including Harrington v. Bush, have addressed the funding and reporting provisions of the CIA Act, noting their exception to the general method of appropriating federal funds. The court in Harrington v. Bush dismissed the suit for lack of standing, with the plaintiff not challenging the constitutional sufficiency of these provisions. The Congress has the power to define the appropriations process and reporting requirements for federal funds. The key statutory provision for reporting expenditures is 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029, which requires the Secretary of the Treasury to provide Congress with an annual statement of all public moneys. Exceptions to this framework can be established by the legislature, as seen with the CIA Act. In Halperin v. CIA, a private citizen sought access to CIA information. In Halperin v. CIA, a private citizen sought access to CIA documents regarding legal bills and fee arrangements of private attorneys retained by the Agency through the Freedom of Information Act. The documents were found to be exempt from disclosure under FOIA exception 3, citing protection from unauthorized disclosure of intelligence sources and methods. The plaintiff's argument against the constitutionality of the statutes under the FOIA exemption was rejected by the appellate court. The court in Halperin v. CIA rejected the plaintiff's argument for lack of standing to challenge secret appropriations for the CIA. The court found the injury alleged was common to all members of the public, similar to the taxpayer in Richardson. The court reviewed the history of the Statement and Account Clause, citing debates in the Virginia ratifying convention in 1788. Madison's comment on governmental discretion to maintain secrecy of expenditures was noted as representative of the Framers' intent. The debates in the Virginia ratifying convention in 1788 discussed the \"from time to time\" provision and the need for secrecy in military operations and foreign negotiations. Opponents like Mason only favored secrecy for operations and negotiations, not for expenditures. The court in Halperin v. CIA referenced Patrick Henry's concern over potential hidden expenditures by Congress, confirming the interpretation of the Madison-Mason debate. The Halperin court confirmed that the Framers intended the Statement and Account Clause to allow discretion for secrecy in military operations and foreign negotiations, based on historical evidence and the Madison-Mason debate. Opponents of the \"from time to time\" provision were concerned about hidden expenditures, but supporters did not indicate a requirement for disclosure. The Committee of Secret Correspondence of the Continental Congress was created in 1775 to handle confidential information, including French plans to aid the Continental Army. Congress exerted more control over the Committee after the Declaration of Independence, and secrecy in intelligence funding was practiced early on by George Washington. The Committee of Secret Correspondence was established in 1775 to handle confidential information, including French support for the Continental Army. George Washington practiced secrecy in intelligence funding, as seen in a letter from Robert Morris in 1783 regarding cash accounts for contingencies and secret services. Statutes created secret service funds for foreign intelligence activities, with the President required to report expenditures but allowed to conceal recipients' identities. The Act of February 9, 1793 allowed the President to make secret expenditures without specifying them, by making a certificate or directing the Secretary of State to do so. While specific expenditures were not expected to be disclosed, aggregate numbers for the appropriations were included. In Aftergood v. CIA, the plaintiff sought historical intelligence budget information from 1947 to 1970, but the CIA responded under FOIA. The CIA responded to a request for historical intelligence budget information by asserting exemption 3 under FOIA. The court granted the CIA's motion, denying the plaintiff's argument based on the Statement and Account Clause. The CIA's budget secrecy was challenged based on the Statement and Account Clause, which implies Congress must account for public funds. Debates at the Constitutional Convention and ratifying conventions focused on timing and scope of this obligation, with some acknowledging the need for secrecy in military and foreign affairs. There has been historical precedent for keeping intelligence information secret. The CIA's budget secrecy has been challenged under the Statement and Account Clause, which requires Congress to account for public funds. Historical precedent shows a need for secrecy in intelligence activities and funding. The courts have consistently upheld Congress's authority to define the scope of this clause, denying challenges to access undisclosed information under the 1949 Central Intelligence Agency Act. The Congress has the authority to require reporting of expenditures in the public interest, especially in the areas of foreign or military affairs. Statutes have allowed for secret funds for foreign intelligence activities with limited reporting requirements. The Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 is an example of such statutory mandate. The Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 allows for the transfer of funds for intelligence purposes from other agency appropriations, enabling concealment of actual intelligence funding levels. There is uncertainty among the Framers of the Constitution regarding the obligation imposed on Congress by the Statement and Account Clause. Courts view Congress as having the power to define the clause's meaning, with limited judicial interpretation. It is unlikely that a court would require disclosure of the aggregate intelligence budget based on current interpretations. The end of the Cold War led to significant reductions in intelligence budgets, sparking debates on the need for budgetary secrecy. Senator Robert Kerrey emphasized the importance of openness in government, suggesting that unless faced with a major threat, intelligence should be made more accessible to the public. Calls for intelligence agencies to improve their effectiveness, especially in understanding the Soviet system and Iraqi nuclear capabilities, were also raised. The end of the Cold War led to debates on intelligence budget reductions and the need for budgetary secrecy. Reductions in defense spending affected intelligence efforts, with arguments on the impact of smaller military force structures on intelligence infrastructure. Strong resistance arose against disproportionate reductions in non-intelligence programs to maintain intelligence spending levels. The debate over future intelligence program requirements was linked to the controversy over public disclosure of intelligence spending levels. Some feared that revealing high costs would lead to demands for drastic reductions. Efforts to cut intelligence funding in 1991 faced challenges due to shared oversight concerns and worries that reductions would be reallocated to other defense programs instead of reducing the deficit. With the end of the Cold War, the debate on disclosing intelligence budget resurfaced in Congress during the consideration of the FY1992 intelligence authorization bill. The bill proposed disclosing three versions of the total intelligence budget: the amount requested by the President, authorized by the conference committee, and actually spent by the executive branch. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) opted not to disclose the amount appropriated due to difficulties in tallying the numerous line-items. The Senate Armed Services Committee proposed delaying the implementation of new intelligence spending disclosure requirements until FY1993, citing significant departures from past practices. The conference committee agreed with the Senate's objective but chose not to mandate disclosure by law, expressing hope for voluntary disclosure instead. The conference committee agreed with the Senate's proposal to delay intelligence spending disclosure requirements until FY1993. The final legislation expressed hope for voluntary disclosure by the Intelligence Committees and the President to the American people without jeopardizing national security interests. The George H.W. Bush Administration's opposition may have influenced the decision to drop mandatory disclosures. The final version of the intelligence authorization bill stated that funding levels should remain classified, despite some officials expressing willingness to disclose top-line numbers. The Intelligence Committees were focused on reorganizing the Intelligence Community in FY1993. The FY1992 legislation included a provision for disclosing intelligence funding amounts to the public. President Bush signed the legislation without comment in October 1992. Senator Metzenbaum urged President Clinton to revisit the issue in February 1993. Howard Metzenbaum, a member of the SSCI, urged President Clinton to disclose the intelligence budget to the public. Newly appointed DCI Woolsey expressed concerns about making the budget public, citing the need for a public debate on the details behind the spending levels. President Clinton responded to Metzenbaum's request for public disclosure of the intelligence budget by asking for the opportunity to evaluate the benefits and concerns associated with such disclosure. The House version of the FY1994 Intelligence Authorization bill did not include a provision for public disclosure, while the Senate version also lacked such a provision. An amendment mandating disclosure of intelligence spending starting in 1995 was debated in the House but failed to pass. The House debated an amendment for public disclosure of intelligence spending starting in 1995, which failed to pass. In the Senate, Senator Moynihan introduced an amendment for an unclassified statement of intelligence budget outlays. Senator Moynihan introduced an amendment to transfer CIA functions to the State Department, but later withdrew it. Senator Metzenbaum proposed a similar amendment to include a \"sense of Congress\" language in the FY1994 Intelligence Authorization bill, which faced opposition from Senator John Warner. The Senate voted against tabling the Metzenbaum amendment by a narrow margin of 49-51. The Senate voted 52-48 to incorporate the Metzenbaum amendment into the FY1994 Intelligence Authorization bill (S. 1301), with support from Senator DeConcini. The final version of the bill, signed into law as the FY1994 Intelligence Authorization Act (P.L. 103-178) by President Clinton on December 3, 1993, did not address public disclosure of the intelligence budget. The FY1994 Intelligence Authorization Act did not address public disclosure of the intelligence budget, with strong opposition from Senator Warner and the Clinton Administration. Senator Warner inserted a letter into the Congressional Record opposing disclosure of intelligence funds. The issue persisted despite the Senate's decision. The conference committee indicated that hearings would be held in early 1994 to evaluate disclosing the aggregate intelligence budget figure. Senior congressional leaders urged the President to allow public disclosure of intelligence spending, stating it must be open to the public in a democratic system. The President opposed disclosing intelligence spending in 1993 due to cost outweighing benefits but agreed to review the proposal in 1994. Congressional hearings and an NSC-level review were scheduled, with DCI Woolsey reiterating his opposition to budget disclosure at HPSCI hearings in February 1994. The 1994-1995 debate on intelligence programs and priorities faced challenges due to concerns about revealing sensitive information to potential adversaries. Despite declining budgets and a changing global landscape, the House rejected an amendment to require annual reports of intelligence spending. The House rejected an amendment to disclose intelligence spending levels in 1995, while the Senate did not address the issue. In 1996, the Senate supported disclosure by passing a bill requiring the President to include aggregate intelligence appropriations in the annual budget submission. The House rejected an amendment in 1995 to disclose intelligence spending levels. In 1996, the Senate passed a bill requiring the President to include aggregate intelligence appropriations in the annual budget submission. In 1996, the House rejected an amendment to require a separate, unclassified statement of intelligence appropriations. The Senate rejected an amendment in 1997 to disclose intelligence spending levels, despite ongoing interest and pressure for public release. The Aspin-Brown Commission recommended in 1996 that the President or a designee provide aggregate figures on intelligence appropriations at the start of each congressional budget cycle. In 1996, the Aspin-Brown Commission recommended that the President or a designee disclose the total amount of money appropriated for intelligence activities at the beginning of each congressional budget cycle. President Clinton authorized Congress to make public the total appropriation for intelligence, but the Legislative Branch did not take action. In October 1997, DCI Tenet announced that President Clinton had authorized the release of the aggregate amount appropriated for intelligence and intelligence-related activities for FY1997. President Clinton authorized the release of the aggregate amount appropriated for intelligence and intelligence-related activities for FY1997 ($26.6 billion), with a focus on protecting classified budget information to prevent harm to national security. Tenet announced the aggregate amount appropriated for intelligence and intelligence-related activities for FY1998 was $26.7 billion, stating it would not harm national security. However, he declined to release the amount for FY1999 after facing pressure from litigants. The attacks of September 11, 2001, led to a significant increase in intelligence spending to support counterterrorism efforts. Investigations were launched to determine why there was no warning of the attacks, resulting in recommendations for improved intelligence performance. The Executive Branch and Congress showed a clear willingness to boost intelligence funding. The establishment of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) was a response to issues in intelligence acquisition and budgeting highlighted by the 9/11 Commission. The DNI has authority over the national intelligence budget and its execution. Recommendations were made for greater transparency in intelligence funding, contrasting with previous practices. The bill introduced in response to the 9/11 Commission recommendations proposed renaming the NFIP to the National Intelligence Program (NIP) and requiring the President to disclose the appropriations requested for the NIP. However, the final legislation, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, did not include the provision to make intelligence spending figures public. The Senate Intelligence Committee proposed a bill in 2006 (S. 3237) that would require the President to disclose the annual appropriations for the National Intelligence Program (NIP) to the public. The bill also mandates Congress to make public the authorized and appropriated amounts annually. A similar provision was included in the FY2007 intelligence authorization bill (S. 372) in January 2007. Congress will likely consider various factors when approaching this provision.
