    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Reliable Scheduling Act of 2016, known as Section 510.5 of the Labor Code, applies to employees in grocery stores, restaurants, and retail establishments. It provides additional rights and remedies without diminishing existing legal protections. The Reliable Scheduling Act of 2016, Section 510.5 of the Labor Code, applies to grocery stores, restaurants, and retail establishments. It defines terms like \"employer,\" \"grocery store establishment,\" and \"modification pay.\" Modification pay is calculated based on an employee's hourly wage, taking into account any variations in pay rates or types of compensation in the prior 90 days of employment. A restaurant is defined as any retail establishment serving food or beverages for onsite consumption. (7) A \"retail store establishment\" in the state generates over 50% of revenue from taxable merchandise, including electronics, clothing, and food for onsite consumption. (8) A \"shift\" is designated work hours with a set start and end time. (9) A \"work schedule\" is a written document listing all scheduled shifts for employees for at least 21 days. An employer must provide a work schedule at least seven days in advance, may have separate schedules for departments, and all employee work hours must meet the shift definition. An employer can provide more advance notice of work schedule changes. Employees can request additional or fewer work hours. Employers must give modification pay if a shift is canceled or rescheduled with less than seven days' notice. If less than 24 hours' notice is given for a shift change, the employee must receive modification pay equal to half of the scheduled hours, but not less than two hours or more than four hours. This pay is in addition to regular pay. On-call shifts require modification pay if the employee is not called in to work. These rules do not apply to rest, recovery, or meal periods, or shifts compensated with reporting time pay. An employer is exempt from violating certain requirements if operations are hindered by threats to employees or property, public utility failures, or acts of God beyond their control. The employer is exempt from violating certain requirements in cases of unforeseen circumstances like threats to employees or property, public utility failures, or acts of God. Additionally, specific situations where an employer is not in violation include when an employee is unable to work due to illness, vacation, or employer-provided time off, when another employee is fired or disciplined, when employees trade shifts, or when overtime is required. Employers must display a poster with relevant information in the workplace as mandated by the Labor Commissioner. An employer must display a poster stating that employees are entitled to modification pay, the amount provided, and the right to file a complaint against retaliation. Employers violating these rules face a civil penalty, must keep records for three years, and allow access to the Labor Commissioner. An employer is prohibited from retaliating against an employee for filing a complaint, cooperating in an investigation, or opposing any violation. Unlawful retaliation is presumed if an employee is discriminated against within 30 days of these actions. The Labor Commissioner enforces the prohibition of retaliation by investigating violations and ordering temporary relief. If a violation is found, appropriate relief such as reinstatement and backpay may be ordered. If modification pay was unlawfully withheld, the penalty will be three times the amount withheld or $250, whichever is greater, up to a maximum of $4,000. If the violation results in harm such as discharge, an additional penalty of $50 per day of violation, up to $4,000, will be imposed. The Labor Commissioner may take enforcement action, including civil action, if an employer does not comply. The violating employer may have to pay up to $50 per day for each employee affected by the violation. An employee or person can report a suspected violation of labor laws to the Labor Commissioner, who will keep the reporter's identity confidential. The commissioner may disclose the reporter's information if necessary for enforcement or other purposes with the reporter's authorization. The Labor Commissioner, Attorney General, or an aggrieved party can sue for violations of labor laws, seeking remedies like reinstatement, backpay, and liquidated damages up to $4,000 per violation. The Labor Commissioner, Attorney General, or an aggrieved party can sue for violations of labor laws, seeking remedies like reinstatement, backpay, and liquidated damages up to $4,000 per violation. If an employer unlawfully withholds modification pay from an employee, they may be required to pay three times the amount withheld or $250, whichever is greater, along with reinstatement or injunctive relief. Attorney's fees and costs will also be awarded. In administrative or civil actions, the Labor Commissioner or court shall award interest on unpaid amounts at the specified rate. Remedies, penalties, and procedures are cumulative. The Labor Commissioner can create necessary regulations. Violation of this section is not a misdemeanor. Definitions for \"railroad\" and \"railroad corporation\" are provided in Section 600 of the Labor Code. In Section 600 of the Labor Code, \"railroad corporation\" is defined as a corporation or receiver operating a railroad, and \"trainman\" is defined as various railroad employees."
