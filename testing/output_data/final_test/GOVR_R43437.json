    "content": "Federal law classifies marijuana as a Schedule I Controlled Substance, making it a federal crime to grow, sell, or possess the drug. Violators may face federal criminal prosecution and additional consequences such as property confiscation, job loss, and loss of tax benefits. Despite this, over 20 states have established medical marijuana regulations, with four legalizing marijuana for recreational use. State officials lack the authority to override federal law. The conflict between state and federal marijuana laws has generated legal issues and proposals for resolution. Federal regulation of controlled substances began in 1914 with the Harrison Narcotics Act, followed by the Marihuana Tax Act in 1937. Congress used its constitutional powers to tax, regulate commerce, and implement treaties to establish these laws. The Marihuana Act, similar to the Harrison Act, imposed penalties on those involved with marijuana but was later found to serve no revenue purpose and was primarily a criminal law. The Supreme Court highlighted Fifth Amendment issues with tax-based enforcement structures like those of the Harrison and Marihuana Tax Acts in the late 1960s. The Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination provides a defense to charges related to unregistered firearms and transporting marijuana without paying the transfer tax. This led to the development of the Controlled Substances Act, which classified marijuana as a Schedule I substance but with less severe penalties compared to LSD and heroin offenses. The severity of penalties for marihuana-related offenses, compared to LSD and heroin offenses, is seen as inequitable given evidence that marihuana is less harmful. Longer sentences do not reduce drug abuse, as seen with marihuana violations doubling in the last 2 years. Strict drug laws for marihuana have led to a clash between youth and the Government. The clash between youth and the Government over marijuana laws has led to calls for a study commission to recommend changes. The commission suggested legalizing personal possession of marijuana while keeping the Controlled Substances Act intact. This Act regulates controlled substances for medical and research purposes. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) regulates the manufacturing, distribution, and use of controlled substances for legitimate purposes and to prevent diversion for illegal use. Substances are categorized into five schedules based on medical use, abuse potential, and safety. Schedule I substances have no accepted medical use, while Schedules II-V have recognized medical uses. Those handling controlled substances must register with the DEA. Under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), registrants must adhere to strict requirements for drug security, recordkeeping, and maintaining production quotas to prevent theft and diversion. Schedule I drugs, with high abuse potential and no accepted medical use, can only be used for government-approved research. Only DEA-licensed doctors can prescribe controlled substances listed in Schedules II-V to patients. The CSA establishes regulations for controlled substances, including the process for adding, removing, or rescheduling drugs. Rescheduling marijuana petitions have been mostly unsuccessful, and Congress can also change a drug's scheduling status through legislation. Civil and criminal penalties apply to those involved in manufacturing, distributing, importing, or possessing controlled substances. Marijuana remains a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA, leading to severe restrictions and federal penalties for unauthorized cultivation, distribution, or possession. Possession of marijuana is typically a misdemeanor with up to one year imprisonment and a minimum $1,000 fine. Repeat offenses trigger harsher penalties, including a mandatory minimum fine of $2,500 and 15 days imprisonment. The law imposes harsh penalties for drug offenses, with mandatory fines and imprisonment terms increasing for repeat offenses. Cultivation, distribution, or possession of marijuana with intent to distribute can lead to imprisonment for five years to life, and property associated with the offense may be confiscated. The Department of Justice may use civil forfeiture provisions to disrupt marijuana dispensaries. The Department of Justice may use civil forfeiture provisions of the CSA to disrupt marijuana dispensaries and production facilities. Forfeiture is a penalty where property is confiscated from the owner and forfeited to the government, used to enforce laws and deter crime. Civil forfeiture does not require criminal charges against the property owner, treating the property as the offender. The civil forfeiture provisions of the CSA allow for the seizure and forfeiture of property connected to illegal activities, including those related to violations of the Controlled Substances Act. This includes property used to facilitate crimes or obtained through illegal activities. The civil forfeiture provisions of the Controlled Substances Act allow for the seizure and forfeiture of property involved in illegal activities. The government can seize property used to facilitate violations of federal law, including equipment, firearms, money, transportation, or real property. The Attorney General can destroy controlled substances and sell other forfeited property at auction. Excess funds are sent to the DOJ Asset Forfeiture Fund. Forfeiture proceedings are less resource-intensive than criminal prosecutions and have been used against medical marijuana dispensaries. DOJ can seize and liquidate property associated with marijuana production, distribution, or retail facilities without criminal charges. The civil asset forfeiture provisions of the Controlled Substances Act allow for the seizure of property involved in illegal activities, including marijuana-related facilities. While some states have decriminalized possession of small amounts of marijuana, federal law still prohibits its production and distribution. Successful challenges to these actions are unlikely due to the clear violation of federal law. More than 20 states have state law exceptions for medical marijuana, with Colorado, Washington, Alaska, and Oregon enacting legislation for retail and personal use of marijuana. State medical marijuana laws vary in enforcement due to individual characteristics and the influence of the Controlled Substances Act and legal cases like Conant v. Walters. The Ninth Circuit discussed the potential criminal liability for doctors prescribing marijuana to patients, emphasizing the need for specific intent to aid in acquiring marijuana. Holding doctors responsible for patients' actions post-appointment goes beyond conspiracy or aiding and abetting laws. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's order enjoining DEA enforcement actions related to doctor-patient discussions on medical marijuana. State laws require a doctor's recommendation, not a prescription, for medical marijuana. Registered individuals are immune from state criminal laws, and physicians can recommend it for specific medical conditions like cancer and HIV. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's order enjoining DEA enforcement actions related to doctor-patient discussions on medical marijuana. State laws require a doctor's recommendation, not a prescription, for medical marijuana, which can be recommended for specific medical conditions like cancer, HIV, and other chronic or debilitating diseases. The list of qualifying conditions may include severe pain, chronic pain, or other medical conditions added by the department. In many jurisdictions, medical marijuana laws restrict possession to less than three ounces for qualified patients who must be residents. Caregivers must register and may have the same immunities and limitations as patients. Some laws allow patient or caregiver cultivation, while others regulate dispensaries. Washington, Colorado, Oregon, and Alaska have retail marijuana regimes. Retail marijuana regimes in states like Washington, Colorado, Oregon, and Alaska regulate the distribution of marijuana for recreational use, decriminalizing possession and consumption for individuals over 21 years old. Each state has unique characteristics in their regulatory framework, with some being more specific in their statutory authority than others. Prohibitions on public consumption and driving under the influence of marijuana are maintained across all states. Washington Initiative 502 and Colorado Amendment 64 legalize marijuana possession for individuals over 21 years old. In Washington, individuals can possess up to one ounce of dried marijuana or specified amounts of marijuana-infused products, but must use it in private. In Colorado, it is not an offense for individuals over 21 to possess or use marijuana. Driving under the influence of marijuana is prohibited in both states. In Colorado, individuals over 21 can possess up to one ounce of marijuana or grow up to six plants for personal use. Oregon's Ballot Measure 91 decriminalizes possession of up to eight ounces of homegrown marijuana and cultivation of up to four plants for individuals over 21. Alaska law allows individuals over 21 to possess one ounce of marijuana and up to six plants, with restrictions on public consumption and cultivation. Licensing regimes are established for retail production, distribution, and sale of marijuana under recreational marijuana laws. Washington Initiative 502 addresses possession regulations. Washington Initiative 502 establishes a three-tiered licensing system overseen by the state Liquor Control Board for the production, processing, and retail sale of marijuana. Qualified individuals must obtain specific licenses to participate in the commercial life cycle of marijuana, with restrictions and requirements outlined in the initiative. The LCB adopted rules for implementing Initiative 502, detailing marijuana license qualifications, application process, fees, packaging restrictions, recordkeeping, security requirements, and advertising restrictions. Colorado implemented licensing standards through statutes and regulations, with three bills signed into law in May 2013. The Department of Revenue and State Licensing Authority adopted regulations for retail marijuana facilities on September 9, 2013. Alaska and Oregon have established licensing and registration systems for recreational marijuana facilities, with regulations covering licensing fees, security measures, labeling requirements, and advertising restrictions. Taxes are also imposed on recreational marijuana sales. Washington and Colorado impose taxes on recreational marijuana sales. Washington's excise tax is 25% of the selling price and is imposed on three separate transactions within the distribution system. The revenue generated from these taxes is deposited into the Dedicated Marijuana Fund and mostly used for social and health services. Colorado voters approved a 25% tax on retail marijuana transactions, with revenues going towards public school capital construction and funding. Under Oregon Ballot Measure 91, marijuana producers will be taxed based on the type of marijuana product, with revenues used to fund enforcement of regulations and various state funds. Alaska imposes a $50 per ounce excise tax on marijuana transactions. Local governments may have the authority to regulate marijuana businesses within their jurisdictions. Local governments in Colorado, Alaska, Oregon, and Washington have the authority to regulate or prohibit marijuana businesses within their jurisdictions. While Colorado, Alaska, and Oregon expressly permit local governments to impose restrictions, Washington's laws are unclear on local bans. The Department of Justice has prosecutorial discretion in enforcing laws on recreational marijuana businesses. Federal law enforcement officials decide when to prosecute violations based on factors like evidence strength and enforcement priorities. DOJ has issued memoranda outlining the Obama Administration's stance on marijuana-related activities. The Department of Justice has issued four memoranda since 2009 regarding state-authorized marijuana activities. In 2009, Deputy Attorney General David W. Ogden provided guidance to federal prosecutors in states with medical marijuana laws, emphasizing not to focus resources on individuals complying with state laws. The Ogden Memorandum in 2009 assured that the DOJ would not prosecute marijuana activities complying with state law, leading to a proliferation of medical marijuana dispensaries, especially for chronic pain patients. The DOJ clarified in 2011 that individual medical marijuana patients would not be prosecuted, but \"commercial\" dispensaries could face federal enforcement. Cultivating, selling, or distributing marijuana, even if compliant with state law, is a violation of the CSA. The 2011 Cole Memorandum clarified that individual medical marijuana patients would not be prosecuted, but \"commercial\" dispensaries could face federal enforcement for violating the CSA. The surge in enforcement activity following the release of the memorandum caught many by surprise. Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole's 2013 memorandum provided guidance on federal enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act in states that have legalized marijuana. The 2011 Cole Memorandum clarified that individual medical marijuana patients would not be prosecuted, but \"commercial\" dispensaries could face federal enforcement for violating the CSA. The 2013 memorandum by Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole instructed federal prosecutors to prioritize their resources on preventing specific activities related to marijuana distribution. The 2013 memorandum by Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole outlined specific activities related to marijuana distribution that federal prosecutors should prioritize resources on, including revenue going to criminal enterprises, diversion to states where it is prohibited, trafficking of other illegal drugs, violent behavior in cultivation and distribution, public health and safety consequences, growing on public lands, and possession on federal property. U.S. Attorneys and federal law enforcement are advised to focus on individuals or organizations involved in these activities, regardless of state law. The 2013 memorandum by Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole prioritized federal resources on specific marijuana distribution activities. It emphasized the importance of state jurisdictions enforcing their laws to protect against federal challenges. The memorandum also noted a change in policy regarding large-scale, for-profit commercial marijuana enterprises, potentially easing concerns for state-licensed distributors and retailers in Colorado and Washington. The 2013 memorandum by Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole prioritized federal resources on specific marijuana distribution activities, emphasizing state jurisdictions enforcing their laws. The guidance from the DOJ suggests that large-scale marijuana enterprises should not be targeted solely based on size or commercial nature, and states with robust regulatory systems for recreational marijuana are less likely to conflict with federal priorities. This may impact the debate on state marijuana laws and federal enforcement. The Oregon Supreme Court has indicated that states cannot authorize conduct prohibited by federal law, especially in the case of marijuana use. The 2014 Cole memorandum addressed banking and money laundering laws related to marijuana establishments, emphasizing the allocation of resources for offenses involving financial transactions. The preemption doctrine, based on the Supremacy Clause, dictates that federal laws supersede state laws in cases of conflict. This principle is crucial in the federal-state marijuana debate, particularly regarding financial transactions and money laundering laws. Congress has the authority to preempt state laws in certain situations, such as when it is physically impossible to comply with both state and federal laws or when state laws obstruct the objectives of Congress. The determination of preemption is based on examining the federal statute as a whole to understand its purpose. The Controlled Substances Act clarifies Congress's preemptive intent, stating that federal law does not intend to override state laws unless there is a direct conflict. State courts have had mixed results in addressing preemption challenges to state medical marijuana laws. Some state courts in Colorado, California, and Michigan have found that certain aspects of medical marijuana laws in those states survive preemption analysis. The Colorado case of People v. Crouse involved a defendant seeking the return of seized marijuana plants under state law immunity, with the court determining that state law only conflicts with federal law when it is physically impossible to comply with both. The court in Crouse held that the CSA language cannot preempt state law under obstacle preemption doctrine. It referenced a specific exemption for law enforcement officers in the CSA, allowing them to distribute controlled substances. This reasoning was also adopted in a California case, County of San Diego v. San Diego NORML. In San Diego NORML, California law required local governments to issue medical marijuana cards. The California appellate court found that the medical marijuana statute did not obstruct the CSA, as the CSA's purpose is to combat recreational drug use, not regulate medical practices. In the Michigan case Beek v. City of Wyoming, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that the CSA did not preempt the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act (MMMA). The Michigan Supreme Court ruled that the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act (MMMA) was not preempted by the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). The MMMA was found to escape impossibility preemption as it was permissive and did not require actions prohibited by federal law. It also escaped obstacle preemption as it only provided immunity from state law consequences without interfering with federal enforcement of marijuana prohibition. The Oregon Supreme Court interpreted obstacle preemption differently in Emerald Steel, ruling that federal law preempts state law on medical marijuana use. The decision's continued validity is uncertain, as a later case suggested the test used in Emerald Steel may have been too broad. The Oregon Supreme Court's decision in Emerald Steel on preemption of state law regarding medical marijuana use may have been an overgeneralization. It should not be seen as establishing a standalone rule that any state law affirmatively authorizing what federal law prohibits is preempted. The court attempted to apply federal rules and relevant cases to the specific preemption issue at hand, and the analysis in Emerald Steel cannot be a simple substitute for the broader federal rule. In a separate case, a bankruptcy court mentioned that conflict preemption was not a concern regarding Colorado's constitutional amendments on medical marijuana. The constitutional amendments for medical marijuana and general marijuana usage clarify that they only apply to state law. There have been constitutional issues regarding the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and state marijuana laws, with the Supreme Court ruling that Congress can outlaw marijuana cultivation and possession. However, Congress cannot force states to enforce federal law. Litigants have tried to use this limitation to protect themselves from the CSA. Litigants have invoked limitations to shield themselves from the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), but have been unsuccessful. Arguments based on the Tenth Amendment have also not been successful in challenging the CSA. The exercise of constitutional powers like the Commerce Clause can be defeated if it exceeds its scope or violates other constitutional limitations. The Tenth Amendment, Ninth Amendment, and due process components of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments impose limits on legislative powers, but litigants have struggled to convince courts to grant relief. The Tenth Amendment reservations disappear when the Constitution delegates a power to the United States, like the Necessary and Proper Clause and the CSA. The Ninth Amendment and Due Process Clauses limit government intrusion on fundamental rights, but courts have not recognized marijuana use as a fundamental right. Challenges to the CSA and state marijuana laws have raised due process and equal protection issues. At the federal level, courts have rejected claims that the government is estopped from enforcing the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) due to misleading statements. Municipal zoning laws play a role in state marijuana-related due process cases, with varying laws on whether municipalities can restrict marijuana activities. Federal banking laws aim to protect financial institutions from dealing with controlled substances. The Department of Justice and FinCEN issued guidance on marijuana-related financial crimes, requiring banks to file suspicious activity reports for transactions over $5,000 derived from illegal activity. Failure to comply can result in imprisonment for up to five years. Banks must establish anti-money laundering programs to ensure officers and employees can identify when to file SARs and CTRs for transactions involving $10,000 or more in cash. Failure to report can result in imprisonment for up to five years, or up to 10 years for repeated violations or structuring transactions to avoid reporting requirements. The money laundering statutes impose criminal liability on banks, their officers, employees, and customers for marijuana-related financial transactions. Section 1956 and 1957 of the statutes make it a federal crime to engage in financial transactions involving proceeds from marijuana distribution, with penalties of up to 20 years and 10 years imprisonment, respectively. Conspiracy and aiding and abetting these offenses carry the same maximum penalties. The money laundering statutes impose criminal liability on banks, their officers, employees, and customers for marijuana-related financial transactions, with penalties of up to 20 years and 10 years imprisonment. Real or personal property involved in the transactions is subject to confiscation. Banks engaging in illegal practices risk civil money penalties and losing deposit insurance coverage. FinCEN's recent guidance emphasizes the Justice Department's focus on preventing marijuana distribution to minors. The federal priorities for marijuana-related businesses include preventing distribution to minors, stopping revenue from going to criminal enterprises, preventing diversion to other states, and preventing violence and illegal activity associated with marijuana use. Financial institutions serving these businesses must adhere to guidelines set by FinCEN. FinCEN advises financial institutions serving marijuana-related businesses to file special SARs: marijuana limited SAR for compliant customers, marijuana priority SAR for suspicious activities, and marijuana termination SAR for ending relationships. \"Red flags\" indicating a priority SAR include lack of satisfactory documentation. The business is unable to provide satisfactory documentation or evidence of being licensed and operating within state law, unable to show legitimate sources of outside investments, and customers may be concealing involvement in marijuana-related activities through non-descript businesses. Negative information such as criminal records or connections to illicit activities is found through public sources. The curr_chunk discusses various red flags that may indicate illicit activity in a marijuana-related business, such as engaging in interstate or international transactions, being located on federal property, non-compliance with state laws regarding proximity to schools, and falsely claiming to be a non-profit organization. A marijuana-related business may be engaging in illicit activity if it falsely claims to be a non-profit while making excessive payments to managers or employees. Other red flags include receiving unusually high revenue, depositing more cash than reported for taxes, and using the business to launder money from criminal activities not related to marijuana. The business may be engaging in illicit activity if it cannot prove its revenue comes solely from legal marijuana sales, makes excessive cash deposits or withdrawals, structures deposits to avoid reporting requirements, rapidly moves funds, receives deposits from unrelated third parties, or mixes funds with personal accounts or unrelated businesses. The FinCEN guidance highlights suspicious activities in businesses related to marijuana, including transactions on behalf of undisclosed parties, inconsistent financial statements, and increased activity from third parties. It also emphasizes the obligation for banks to report any cash transactions over $10,000. Additionally, the use of marijuana, even for medicinal purposes, can lead to adverse employment consequences, with courts upholding the right to terminate employees for medical marijuana use despite state laws. State medical marijuana laws provide immunity to users but do not grant affirmative rights against private entities. The Americans with Disabilities Act and similar anti-discrimination laws are hindered by the Controlled Substances Act. Government employees have Fourth Amendment protections, limiting the likelihood of employers discovering their marijuana use. The Fourth Amendment limits government searches for employee drug testing to reasonable suspicion or special needs. Some government employees undergo random drug testing due to their job duties. State and local courts allow drug testing for safety-sensitive occupations. Federal contractors may face consequences for drug use. The federal Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 imposes drug-free workplace requirements on federal contractors and grantees to maintain eligibility for federal funds. Employers without federal influence can establish their own drug-free workplace policies and terminate employees testing positive for marijuana, medical or not. The federal Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 requires drug-free workplace policies for federal contractors and grantees to keep receiving federal funds. Employees fired for marijuana use may lose eligibility for unemployment benefits, and marijuana merchants face tax disadvantages under Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code prohibits marijuana merchants from deducting operating expenses on their federal income tax, except for the cost of goods sold. This provision applies to marijuana as long as it is a controlled substance under the CSA, regardless of state laws. Customers of medical marijuana merchants cannot deduct their purchases as medical expenses. Additionally, it is a federal crime for unlawful users of controlled substances to possess firearms or ammunition. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) prohibits individuals using marijuana, even for medicinal purposes, from possessing firearms or ammunition. Those involved in marijuana cultivation or sales may face additional criminal liability if they possess firearms for security. Offenders and accomplices could face mandatory imprisonment terms. The ATF prohibits individuals using marijuana from possessing firearms or ammunition, with offenders facing mandatory imprisonment terms. Illegal drug users are ineligible for federally assisted housing, with agencies able to prohibit admission or terminate tenancy if there is reasonable cause to believe they are illegally using controlled substances. The Department of Housing and Urban Development can deny access to federally assisted housing for individuals using marijuana, including medical marijuana. The Eleventh Circuit's Lebron decision suggests that preliminary drug testing without individualized suspicion may not be allowed. Rule 1.2(d) of the American Bar Association's Model Rules of Professional Conduct prohibits lawyers from advising clients to engage in criminal or fraudulent conduct. Some state bar associations have issued ethics opinions on conflicts between state and federal marijuana laws, with Arizona State Bar stating that compliance with state medical marijuana laws may provide a \"safe harbor.\" Arizona lawyers can counsel and assist clients within the state's medical marijuana statute, as long as clients are aware of federal law consequences. Maine and Connecticut bar associations advise against counseling clients to engage in marijuana business due to legal risks. The Colorado Bar Association advises attorneys on permissible and impermissible actions regarding marijuana-related activities. Attorneys can advise clients on legal consequences, government matters, and tax obligations, but cannot draft contracts or leases. Colorado attorneys are advised not to draft contracts or provide tax planning assistance for marijuana-related activities that violate federal law. Washington State attorneys can assist clients with marijuana businesses as long as it complies with state law and federal enforcement priorities. In Washington, attorneys can assist clients with marijuana businesses as long as it complies with state law and federal enforcement priorities. The King County Bar Association states that owning an interest in a marijuana dispensary does not reflect adversely on a lawyer's honesty or trustworthiness. The Washington State Bar Association proposed an advisory opinion allowing lawyers to advise clients on state marijuana laws without facing discipline. A lawyer in Washington can advise clients on state marijuana laws and assist in establishing dispensaries within state law boundaries. They can also engage in marijuana businesses without violating ethical rules, as long as they do not aid in violating state laws. The federal government maintains strict controls on marijuana use for research purposes. The federal government maintains strict controls on marijuana research, with the Secretary of Health and Human Services determining the qualifications of practitioners conducting research on schedule I drugs like marijuana. The DEA has registered around 237 practitioners for marijuana research, with some approved to study smoked marijuana on human subjects. Researchers obtain marijuana for approved studies through the NIDA drug supply program. The federal government controls marijuana research, with strict regulations on registration for manufacturing. Currently, only the NCNPR at the University of Mississippi is registered. Legislative actions have been taken regarding marijuana and state legalization initiatives. P.L. 113-235 \u00a7809(b) was enacted to prevent D.C.'s recreational marijuana law. The legal effect of Initiative 71, D.C.'s recreational marijuana law, is uncertain due to a provision in P.L. 113-235 \u00a7809(b) that restricts the use of funds for enacting laws related to marijuana. There are differing opinions on whether D.C. employees can use FY2015 funds to implement the law without facing legal consequences under the Antideficiency Act. Initiative 71, D.C.'s recreational marijuana law, faces uncertainty due to restrictions on funds for enacting marijuana laws. P.L. 113-79 and P.L. 113-235 have provisions related to marijuana, including rules for SNAP benefits and authorization for hemp research. The 2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act prohibits the Department of Justice from using funds to interfere with states' medical marijuana laws. There is debate over the interpretation of this provision, with some arguing it should prevent enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act against individuals following state laws. The Compassionate Access, Research Expansion, and Respect of States Act of 2015 is also relevant. The CARERS Act of 2015, also known as the Access, Research Expansion, and Respect of States Act, aims to exempt individuals following state medical marijuana laws from the Controlled Substances Act. It proposes reclassifying marijuana as a Schedule II substance for medical use and provides legal protections for financial institutions serving marijuana businesses. The CARERS Act of 2015 aims to exempt individuals following state medical marijuana laws from the Controlled Substances Act and reclassify marijuana as a Schedule II substance for medical use. It also provides legal protections for financial institutions serving marijuana businesses and allows for easier research on marijuana and cultivation for medical purposes. Additionally, it authorizes Department of Veterans Affairs health care providers to offer recommendations on veterans' use of marijuana. The Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2015 would remove industrial hemp from the definition of \"marihuana\" under the CSA. H.R. 262, States' Medical Marijuana Property Rights Protection Act, aims to prevent civil forfeiture of real property due to medical marijuana activities in compliance with state law. H.R. 667, Veterans Equal Access Act, allows VA health care providers to recommend marijuana use for veterans. H.R. 1013, Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol Act, seeks to remove marijuana from CSA schedules and regulate it like alcohol. H.R. 1014, Marijuana Tax Revenue Act of 2015, proposes an excise tax on marijuana sales. The bill proposes an excise tax on marijuana sales, starting at 10% and increasing by 5% annually until reaching 25% in the fifth year. It includes exemptions for medical use, requires an occupational tax for marijuana enterprises, and mandates permits from the Secretary of the Treasury. Civil and criminal penalties are imposed for non-compliance. The bill H.R. 1635, known as the Charlotte's Web Medical Access Act of 2015, aims to remove cannabidiol and cannabidiol-rich plants from the Controlled Substances Act and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. It also addresses the issue of federal taxation for marijuana merchants, who face a special tax disadvantage under Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code. Marijuana merchants are affected by Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code, which prohibits them from deducting operating expenses on their federal income tax. However, they can deduct the cost of goods sold. This provision applies to marijuana as long as it is considered a controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act, regardless of state laws. Customers of medical marijuana merchants cannot deduct their purchases as medical expenses."
