    "content": "At the beginning of a Congress, committees organize by assigning members, determining chairs and ranking minority members, creating subcommittees, and adopting rules. Committee assignments are crucial for a Member's career and party leaders who shape committee composition. House rules and party rules dictate committee assignments, with Representatives typically limited to serving on two standing committees. House rules and party rules dictate committee assignments, with Representatives typically limited to serving on two standing committees. Committee jurisdiction is determined by House Rule X, which designates subject matter within each standing committee's purview. The Speaker designates a \"primary\" committee for legislation referral, with other committees receiving referrals sequentially. The Speaker designates a \"primary\" committee for legislation referral, with other committees receiving referrals sequentially. Subcommittees are created by full committees to assist in managing their work and are subject to the authority of their parent committee. Subcommittee jurisdictions are determined by each committee, and most legislation is referred to a subcommittee before consideration by a full committee. Committees are generally limited to five subcommittees, with exceptions like the Appropriations Committee having 12 subcommittees. Members are typically limited to serving on four subcommittees under House rules. House Rule XI governs subcommittee assignments, directing each standing committee to adopt written rules consistent with House rules and laws. Committees must establish meeting schedules, quorums, chair roles, and majority authority. Adoption of committee rules is an early task at the start of a Congress. Committee rules dictate formal procedures for conducting business, including holding hearings to gather information. Hearings can be held in Washington or elsewhere, with notice requirements for the date, place, and subject. The chair must give at least one week's notice, but a hearing can be held sooner with approval from the ranking minority member or a majority vote. House committee hearings are open to the public unless closed by a majority vote. The chair sets the agenda and selects witnesses, but the minority can call their own witnesses with notification. Witnesses must submit written testimony in advance and limit oral testimony to a brief summary. Committee members typically have five minutes each to question witnesses, with the option for equal questioning time between majority and minority members for up to 30 minutes. Staff may also question witnesses. A committee markup allows staff to question witnesses and determine if a measure should be amended. The level of formality in markup reflects the contention over the measure. The process begins with the chair calling up a measure for consideration by the committee. The nature of the \"markup vehicle\" presented to a committee for amendment can vary, such as a previously introduced bill or a draft measure. The text laid before the committee serves as the markup vehicle, which may need to be converted into a measure for reporting. Alternatively, the markup vehicle can be presented as an amendment in the nature of a substitute. During a markup, a committee can report a measure favorably to the House with amendments, a substitute amendment, or as a clean bill. Once agreed upon, the measure is \"ordered reported\" and the committee report is filed in the House. The chair must promptly report the bill and take necessary steps for consideration by the full House. The House rules and statutes detail requirements for reports accompanying measures reported from committees, including explaining the measure's purpose, cost, committee votes, executive branch position, and changes to existing law. Committee members can file supplemental views within two days. Committees conduct oversight and investigations, initially done by staff and followed by hearings. House committees conduct oversight and investigations, initially done by staff and followed by committee hearings. They publish various documents on legislative issues, investigations, and internal matters, which are available online or from the issuing committee. Printed hearings contain edited transcripts of testimony, while committee reports provide an explanation of a measure, the committee's action, and certain findings. Activity reports at the end of a Congress describe the committee's actions, and committee calendars record the committee's activities, rules, membership, and legislative history. House committees conduct oversight, investigations, and publish various documents on legislative issues. These documents include committee rules, membership, legislative history of measures, hearings, markups, and committee prints on policy issues. Committee prints are distributed widely to provide information on specific topics."
