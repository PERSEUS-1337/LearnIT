Amendments to the Trademark Act of 1946 include provisions to address bad-faith registration and use of domain names that infringe on existing trademarks. Owners of distinctive marks can take civil action against individuals who profit from their goodwill through such actions. Factors like the domain name's relation to the owner's intellectual property rights are considered in determining bad-faith intent. The factors considered in determining bad-faith intent regarding domain names include the extent to which the domain name reflects the person's legal name or commonly used identifier, prior use of the domain name for offering goods or services, legitimate noncommercial or fair use of the mark, intent to divert consumers for gain or tarnishing the mark's goodwill, and offers to transfer or sell the domain name. The factors for determining bad-faith intent in domain name registration include offering to transfer or sell the domain name for profit, providing false contact information, and registering multiple domain names that infringe on trademarks. In civil actions involving domain name registration, a court may order forfeiture, cancellation, or transfer of the domain name to the mark owner. The owner of a mark can file an in rem civil action against a domain name that violates their rights, with remedies limited to forfeiture, cancellation, or transfer of the domain name.

In cases of domain name piracy, remedies include injunctions and statutory damages ranging from $1,000 to $100,000 per domain name. The court may award statutory damages of up to $100,000 per domain name, but must remit damages if the infringer believed their use of the domain name was fair or lawful. SEC. 5. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY. Section 32(2) of the Trademark Act of 1946 is amended to include protection for domain name registrars, registries, and registration authorities from liability for actions affecting domain names, regardless of infringement or dilution of the mark. The amendment to Section 32(2) of the Trademark Act of 1946 provides protection for domain name registrars, registries, and registration authorities from liability for actions such as refusing to register, removing, transferring, or canceling a domain name in compliance with court orders or reasonable policies prohibiting registration of similar names. The amendment to Section 32(2) of the Trademark Act of 1946 protects domain name registrars from liability unless bad faith intent is proven. If a person misrepresents a domain name's similarity to a registered mark, they can be held liable for damages incurred by the domain name registrant. The court may grant injunctive relief to the domain name registrant, including reactivating or transferring the domain name. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. This section amends the Trademark Act of 1946 by defining the terms \"Internet\" and \"domain name.\" SEC. 7. SAVINGS CLAUSE. This Act does not affect defenses under the Trademark Act of 1946 or free speech rights under the first amendment. SEC. 8. SEVERABILITY. SEC. 8. SEVERABILITY.
