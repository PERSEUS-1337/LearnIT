    "content": "On March 27, 2014, the U.N. General Assembly approved a resolution affirming Ukraine's territorial integrity and declaring the Crimea referendum illegitimate. Russia's ambassador argued for Crimea's self-determination. Armenia and Belarus opposed the resolution, while Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Moldova supported it. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan abstained, and China, Afghanistan, and Pakistan also abstained. During a meeting on February 24, 2014, President Obama and Vice President Biden urged Georgia to uphold the rule of law and expressed support for its Euro-Atlantic aspirations. They also discussed increasing trade and investment opportunities. The U.S.-Georgia Strategic Partnership Commission met on February 26 to set cooperation goals for 2014, with Secretary Kerry commending Georgia for its human rights initiatives and Association Agreement with the EU. Georgia and the United States discussed enhancing human rights, defense reforms, and economic cooperation. The U.S. expressed support for Georgia's engagement with South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and both sides looked forward to new projects funded by the U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation. They also praised Georgia's growing regional economic role and hoped for progress on a free trade agreement. Secretary Kerry emphasized their support during a press conference. Georgia and the United States discussed enhancing human rights, defense reforms, and economic cooperation. Secretary Kerry expressed support for Georgia's progress towards NATO membership and highlighted the strong partnership between the two nations. Prime Minister Garibashvili emphasized the shared values and potential for successful partnership. The South Caucasus states historically served as a trade and transport bridge linking Europe to the Middle East and Asia. In ancient and recent times, Azerbaijan's oil and gas resources attracted outside interest. The region had periods of autonomy before being re-conquered by Russia in 1921. Independence was regained after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. The United States recognized the independence of former Soviet republics by the end of 1991. Close ties were pursued with Armenia and Georgia for their democratic principles and leadership changes. In early 1992, President George H. W. Bush signed the FREEDOM Support Act into law (P.L. 102-511) to provide aid to Eurasian states. U.S. policy towards South Caucasus states includes efforts to resolve conflicts between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno Karabakh, and between Georgia and its breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. U.S. emissaries have been working since 1993 to settle these conflicts. Since 1993, U.S. emissaries have been working to resolve conflicts in the South Caucasus, including the disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno Karabakh. Congressional concerns led to Section 907 in the FREEDOM Support Act, restricting U.S. assistance to Azerbaijan until certain conditions are met. Some argue that U.S. involvement in the region should be approached cautiously due to ongoing ethnic and civil conflicts. The United States is urged to play a major role in the South Caucasus region to address ethnic conflicts and promote democratization and human rights. Some argue for increased U.S. aid and conflict resolution efforts to contain warfare, crime, smuggling, and Islamic extremism, while also countering Russian and Iranian influence. Close ties with Azerbaijan could benefit U.S. relations with other Islamic countries, as seen in the support offered after the September 11, 2001 attacks. In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, the United States views energy resources in the Caspian region as a strategic interest to reduce dependency on Russia and the Middle East. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper highlighted challenges faced by Georgia's new leadership, including economic decline and political polarization. Tensions with Russia have eased, but core disputes like the status of South Ossetia and Abkhazia remain unresolved. The chance of renewed conflict over NK is assessed as low. The chance of renewed conflict over the breakaway NK is low, but prospects for a peace settlement are dim. Azerbaijan is building up its military forces for an advantage, while Armenia wants to maintain the status quo. The United States reassures Azerbaijan as a strategic partner in counter-terrorism and energy security, balancing concerns about democratization. Relations between the United States and Azerbaijan cooled after supporting efforts to improve relations between Armenia and Turkey in 2009-2010. The Administration supported efforts in 2009-2010 by Armenia and Turkey to improve relations that Azerbaijan opposed. Azerbaijan may have pursued closer working relations with Russia after the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict. Despite this, Azerbaijan continued troop support for NATO operations in Afghanistan and played a significant role in the Northern Distribution Network. Azerbaijan also planned to increase gas supplies to Europe. To reassure Azerbaijan, the Administration emphasized the strategic significance of U.S.-Azerbaijan relations. The Obama Administration emphasized the strategic significance of U.S.-Azerbaijan relations through high-level visits and meetings. Secretary Clinton praised Azerbaijan's role in Afghanistan and Europe's energy diversification efforts but also called for further democratization. The U.S.-Azerbaijan Intergovernmental Commission on Economic Cooperation was re-launched in 2012. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a confirmation hearing for ambassador-designate to Azerbaijan Richard Morningstar in June 2012. Morningstar emphasized the importance of security, energy, and democratic and economic reform in the U.S.-Azerbaijan relationship. He also pledged support for peaceful settlement of the NK conflict. Morningstar was confirmed by the Senate and presented his credentials to President Aliyev in September 2012. In September 2012, Secretary Kerry met with Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov and praised Azerbaijan as an \"important partner\" in Afghanistan and in gas transit to Europe. They discussed the NK conflict and Kerry urged Azerbaijan to continue democratization for regional peace. Foreign Minister Mammadyarov called the U.S.-Azerbaijan relationship a \"strategic partnership\" and expressed hope for continued cooperation. There were reports of strained relations before the meeting. After President Aliyev's inauguration on October 19, 2013, Ambassador Morningstar called for expanding U.S.-Azerbaijani cooperation on shared interests, including resolving the NK conflict, bolstering regional security, counter-terrorism, energy security, and economic diversification. The United States pledged to promote democratic values in Azerbaijan. Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) in Afghanistan led to Azerbaijan and Georgia offering airbase support. Congressional attitudes towards Azerbaijan shifted, allowing for presidential waiver authority in Foreign Operations Appropriations for FY2002. The President can use the waiver if aid supports counter-terrorism efforts, Armed Forces readiness, Azerbaijan's border security, and does not harm peace talks or offensive actions against Armenia. The waiver can be renewed annually, with reporting requirements on aid to Azerbaijan, military balance with Armenia, peace talks, and aid effects. The waiver authority for U.S. aid to Azerbaijan can be used annually to support counter-terrorism efforts, Armed Forces readiness, and border security. Azerbaijan and Georgia supported Operation Iraqi Freedom by offering airbases and sending troops to Iraq. Armenia also sent personnel to Iraq in 2005. Troops from Azerbaijan and Georgia were withdrawn from Iraq in connection with the Russia-Georgia conflict in 2008. Armenia sent personnel to Iraq in January 2005, but they were pulled out in late 2008. Azerbaijan deployed troops to Afghanistan to serve with NATO's ISAF in late 2002, with 94 troops as of mid-January 2014. Georgia sent troops for training in Germany in November 2009, with deployments increasing to 925 troops in mid-2010. In December 2011, the Georgian legislature approved sending an additional battalion of 749 troops to Afghanistan, bringing the total to 1,560 troops by October 2012. Georgia became the largest contributor to ISAF among non-NATO member countries. The U.S. European Command's Georgia Deployment Program supports Georgian troop training and rotations. Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Kyrgyzstan are key routes for U.S. and coalition troops to and from Afghanistan. Georgia is a major contributor to ISAF among non-NATO member countries. The Azerbaijan-Georgia route is a crucial transit route for U.S. and coalition troops to and from Afghanistan. Azerbaijan serves as an air corridor, while Georgia is a major transit route for cargoes through the Black Sea port of Poti. General William Fraser thanked Georgia for supporting the transit of cargoes to and from Afghanistan. The key port in Georgia plays a significant role in transit of cargoes to and from Afghanistan, with a decrease in retrograde land shipments through the Northern Distribution Network. U.S. military officials prefer shipments through Pakistan due to lower costs, while issues with Uzbekistan have contributed to the slowdown in NDN traffic. The U.S. shows strong support for Georgia through the U.S.-Georgia Charter on Strategic Partnership, emphasizing the importance of a strong, independent, sovereign, unified, and democratic Georgia. The U.S. and Georgia intend to expand defense and security cooperation to promote peace, increase Georgian capabilities, and strengthen NATO membership candidacy. They also plan to enhance economic ties through investment treaties and explore a Free-Trade Agreement. Energy security goals include boosting energy production and transit security to European markets. In the realm of democratization, the focus is on promoting democracy in Georgia. The United States and Georgia pledge cooperation to bolster independent media, freedom of expression, and the rule of law. The U.S. trains judges, prosecutors, defense lawyers, and police officers. The Charter aims to reaffirm U.S. strategic interest in Georgia and counter perceptions of increased Russian dominance in the region. Some in Georgia express concern about potential concessions to Russia at Georgia's expense. President Obama reaffirmed support for Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity during a U.S.-Russia summit in 2009. He commended Georgia's efforts in police reform, rule of law, and free market reforms during a meeting with President Saakashvili in 2012. Obama also discussed strengthening defense cooperation and reiterated support for Georgia's NATO aspirations. During a meeting in 2013, Secretary Kerry reaffirmed support for Georgia's NATO aspirations and defense cooperation. President Saakashvili also visited the U.S. and met with Vice President Biden, Secretary Kerry, and Senator John McCain. Deputy Secretary of State William Burns reassured Georgia of U.S. support for its democratic development and sovereignty. In late August 2013, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and other U.S. officials met with Georgian Defense Minister Irakli Alasania to discuss Georgia's defense needs. U.S. Ambassador to Georgia Richard Norland expressed concerns about Russia's construction of barriers along Abkhazia's and South Ossetia's borders and praised then-President Saakashvili's admission of human rights issues during his presidency. Some observers have called for a reevaluation of U.S. support for Georgia. Some observers have raised concerns about democratization issues in Georgia despite progress in recent elections. They question U.S. defense commitments to Georgia and suggest encouraging reconciliation instead of immediate reintegration of disputed regions. Others argue for increased U.S. assistance to Georgia and a stronger NATO effort for defensive resupply. After Vladimir Putin became president in 2000, Russia aimed to increase influence in the South Caucasus region. However, this was challenged by events like the \"rose revolution\" in Georgia, NATO's closer ties with regional states, and the completion of key energy pipelines. Russia's concerns about security in the North Caucasus and the closure of its military bases also impacted its strategic goals. Calls for U.S. and NATO support to resupply Georgia with defensive weapons have been made to deter Russian aggression. Diplomatic recognition of breakaway regions is advised against without international consensus. Russia's influence in the South Caucasus region has faced challenges, but the August 2008 conflict with Georgia reversed some of these. The Russian leadership prioritizes military-strategic influence in the region, while also focusing on economic and domestic political spheres. Russia views Islamic fundamentalism as a threat and cooperates with Iran to counter other influences. It works to prevent contraband from entering its borders and has conflicting approaches to separatism in the Caucasus. The South Caucasian states have varied responses to Russian influence, with Armenia maintaining close ties for security and economic reasons. Russia's influence in the South Caucasus region has faced challenges, with Armenia maintaining close security and economic ties with Russia due to unresolved conflicts and trade blockages. Azerbaijan has concerns about Russia's ties with Armenia but values cooperative relations for diplomacy and trade. Georgia has suffered from trade restrictions imposed by Russia and has no formal diplomatic relations since the Russia-Georgia conflict. Russia's armed presence in the region includes military base personnel and border troops, established through the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) Collective Security Treaty in 1992. The Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) was established in 2002 with members including Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and Tajikistan. Russia has military bases in Armenia and Georgia, with around 3,300 ground forces troops in Armenia. The Federal Security Service Border Guard Directorate guards Armenia's borders with Turkey and Iran. Various statements have been made by CSTO and Armenian officials regarding the organization's role. During a visit by then-Russian President Dmitriy Medvedev to Armenia in August 2010, an agreement was made to extend the basing agreement with Russia to 2044. Russia pledged to help safeguard Armenia's national security and supply modern weaponry for its armed forces. Despite some officials in Armenia seeing this as assurance of Russian intervention against Azerbaijan, Medvedev stated the accord was not aimed at Azerbaijan. Georgia's then-Foreign Minister criticized the agreement for strengthening Russia's military influence in the region and compromising Armenia's independence. In December 2012, President Sargisyan emphasized Armenia's reliance on CSTO allies in case of war with Azerbaijan. He highlighted the strategic partnership with Russia as crucial for Armenian security. Reports indicated Russia had shifted forces in Armenia to professional contract troops, anticipating potential conflicts with Azerbaijan or Iran. In October 2013, the commander of Russia's military base in Armenia suggested that Russia might respond if Azerbaijan attacked NK as part of CSTO obligations. Azerbaijan's Defense Minister protested to the Minsk Group, but Armenia stated its forces were sufficient to repulse any attack without Russian intervention. Azerbaijani Defense Minister raised the issue during a Moscow visit in November 2013. In November 2013, Azerbaijani Defense Minister raised concerns during a Moscow visit about Russian troops in the South Caucasus and nearby regions. Armenian Defense Minister emphasized the importance of CSTO support if needed, while mentioning uncertainties about the involvement of Central Asian countries. Additionally, Azerbaijan was the first Eurasian state to have Russian troops withdraw, except at the Qabala radar site. In January 2002, Azerbaijan signed a 10-year lease agreement with Russia for a radar site. After contentious negotiations, Russia announced in December 2012 that it would relinquish the site. President Aliyev claimed in April 2013 that Azerbaijan asked for a higher lease payment due to the land's scenic value. President Putin visited Azerbaijan in August 2013, praising the country. Putin praised Azerbaijan as a long-standing partner and emphasized trade relations, energy cooperation, and military collaboration. Both leaders discussed security, border delineation, and environmental protection in the Caspian Sea. President Aliyev highlighted increasing cooperation in the oil and gas sector and existing substantial military ties with Russia. Military cooperation between Russia and Azerbaijan is substantial and ongoing. Agreements were signed for arms transfers worth $4 billion, modernization of Azerbaijani defense industries, and repair of military hardware. Russia will provide military education for 100 officers, while Azerbaijan will shift focus from the US to Russia for maritime security. Russia is compensating Armenia for arms transfers to Azerbaijan by maintaining a military presence in the region. Russia maintains a military presence in Armenia to ensure its safety, as highlighted by a new treaty signed in 2013. After 9/11, Russia accused Georgia of harboring Chechen terrorists, leading to tensions with the US. Azerbaijan convicted individuals of receiving terrorist training in 2006. In 2006, Azerbaijan convicted 16 people for receiving terrorist training from al Qaeda in the Pankisi Gorge. Russia has renewed allegations of terrorism in the Gorge, which Georgia denies. There are concerns that Russia may use a possible U.S.-Israeli military action against Iran as a pretext to move militarily against the South Caucasus. Observers warn that Russia could secure a route through Georgia to Armenia and occupy the region under the guise of protecting against disorder. In the early 1990s, mediation led to the presence of Russian military \"peacekeepers\" in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, with monitoring by the U.N. and OSCE. Georgian authorities later called for the \"peacekeepers\" to be replaced or supplemented by an international force. Georgia initially agreed to Russian military bases but later sought their closure, supported by European countries. In 1999, Russia and Georgia agreed to provisions of the amended CFE Treaty calling for Russia to reduce weaponry at its four bases in Georgia, close two bases, and negotiate the status of the other two bases. NATO hesitated to ratify the Treaty until Russia met these conditions. Russia claimed to have closed one base, and in 2007, announced the closure of the last base. However, after the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict, Russia deployed two army brigades to new bases in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Russia deployed two army brigades to new military bases in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, along with border troops and part of the Black Sea Fleet in Ochamchira. The Military Balance reported 7,000 Russian troops in the region. Russia plays a significant role in Armenia's economy as a major investor and trade partner. Georgia faced a Russian trade embargo from 2006 to 2013. Russia opposes free-trade agreements between the EU and former Soviet states. Armenia prioritized joining the Russia-led Eurasian Customs Union over an association agreement with the EU, citing the need to deepen economic and cultural ties with Russia. President Sargisyan emphasized Armenia's security partnership with Russia as a reason for the decision. Armenia chose to join the Customs Union over an EU association agreement due to security concerns and economic ties with Russia. Russia's subsidies for gas also influenced the decision. Russia has been pressuring Eurasian states to avoid ties with Europe, as seen in the case of Ukraine. Georgia, however, feels less economically vulnerable to Russian pressure and aims to sign an EU accord by August 2014. Russia has exerted influence in the Caspian Sea region by manipulating gas prices in South Caucasian countries. Armenia and Georgia made concessions to Russia after gas price hikes in 2006 and 2007. Azerbaijan also shifted away from Russian gas. Gazprom's transit arrangement with Georgia was affected after the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict. Gazprom's transit arrangement with Georgia for Russian gas to Armenia remains in place, with Armenia paying a transit fee. Georgia now gets more gas from Azerbaijan than Russia. Russia increased gas prices for Armenia in 2013 due to EU agreement talks. Armenia received a subsidy and signed an energy security accord with Russia. Details on gas subsidies were finalized during Putin's visit, reducing the price for Armenia. Armenia agreed to transfer its shares in Armrosgazprom to Gazprom and give Gazprom a concession until 2043 in exchange for $155 million. Critics noted the high gas price and Iran's exclusion from gas sales. The US sees Turkey as a key player in the region, despite its support for Azerbaijan in the NK conflict. Turkey aims for good relations with Azerbaijan, Georgia, and limited contact with Armenia while balancing Russian and Iranian interests. Turkey aims for good relations with Azerbaijan, Georgia, and limited contact with Armenia to balance Russian and Iranian interests. Existing oil and gas pipelines reflect cooperation between Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey. Armenia faces obstacles in its relations with Turkey due to historical disputes and Turkey's support for Azerbaijan in the NK conflict. Turkey's President Abdullah G\u00fcl visited Armenia in September 2008, leading to improved relations and agreements in April 2009 for normalizing ties, including establishing full diplomatic relations and opening borders. President Obama supported negotiations in April 2009, resulting in the signing of protocols by Turkish and Armenian Foreign Ministers in October 2009. The protocols called for the establishment of embassies in each other's capitals after mutual legislative approval. The protocol on foreign relations between Turkey and Armenia called for opening the common border within two months after ratification. The Armenian constitutional court's ruling that the protocols wouldn't affect genocide recognition was criticized by Turkey. Azerbaijan criticized Turkey for normalizing relations with Armenia without linking it to a peace settlement for the NK conflict. Turkey pledged not to approve the protocols until progress was made in settling the conflict. The ruling Armenian party coalition suspended the ratification process due to Turkey's refusal. In August 2010, Azerbaijan and Turkey signed a strategic partnership and mutual assistance agreement. The 10-year mutual assistance agreement between Azerbaijan and Turkey includes provisions for reciprocal aid in case of attack, cooperation on national security threats, banning of groups threatening sovereignty, and joint military exercises. Iran aims to deter Western influence, stabilize the region, and build economic ties in the South Caucasus. Armenia and Georgia maintain their Christian heritage in the Islamic region. Azerbaijanis are mainly Turkic practicing Shiite Islam, with many rejecting Iran's strict Shiism. Ethnic Azerbaijanis in Iran and Armenians reside there. Azerbaijani elites fear Iranian-supported extremism and object to Iranian support for Armenia. Iran insists on control of Caspian Sea energy to block the West and Azerbaijan. Iran has increased its diplomatic efforts in the region, proposing railroad links to Armenia and Azerbaijan for trade. However, its relations with Azerbaijan are complicated by reported suppression of dissent among \"Southern Azerbaijanis\" and alleged support for Islamic extremism. The U.S. aims to contain Iran's threats to its interests in the region. In February 2012, Azerbaijan was accused by Iran of harboring Israeli intelligence agents and sentenced individuals trained in Iran for terrorism. Azerbaijan confirmed a large arms deal with Israel aimed at \"liberating\" occupied territories. Terrorists trained in Iran were arrested for planning attacks on Israeli and U.S. embassies. Two Iranian spy networks were uncovered in 2011. In 2012, Iran accused Azerbaijan of collaborating with Israel to launch attacks. Iran arrested alleged Israeli agents directed from Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan arrested individuals involved in smuggling from Iran. Iran released Azerbaijani poets convicted of spying and Azerbaijan paroled an Iranian reporter convicted of drug charges. Presidents Ahmadinezhad and Aliyev met in October 2012. During the Economic Cooperation Organization summit in Baku, Azerbaijani and Iranian leaders expressed satisfaction with their cooperation and called for expanding economic ties. Azerbaijan assured Iran it would not be used for third-party aggression but also supported international sanctions against Iran. In 2013, an Azerbaijani court sentenced an Iranian citizen to 15 years in prison for planning an attack on the Israeli embassy, leading to tensions between the two countries. The Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution (Sepah) and mutual border closures in late 2013 were sources of contention. The United States and European countries play influential roles in the South Caucasus, aiming for integration into the West, trade, energy resources, and stability. The EU took a leading role in mediating the Russia-Georgia conflict in 2008, assuming a more prominent position than the United States in the region. The EU led mediation efforts and deployed observers after the ceasefire in the Russia-Georgia conflict. In 2009, the EU launched the Eastern Partnership program to deepen ties with South Caucasus states, aiming for free trade agreements, economic integration, and visa liberalization. In 2013, the EU concluded talks with Armenia on a free trade agreement to align laws with EU standards, boost exports, and attract Western investment. Armenia decided to join the Russia-led Customs Union in September 2013, while Georgia initialed its association and trade agreement with the EU in late November 2013. The South Caucasus region has economic and political ties with Black Sea and Caspian Sea littoral states. Azerbaijan shares linguistic and religious ties with Central Asian states and concerns about common neighbors like Iran and Russia. The South Caucasian and Central Asian states are worried about terrorist threats and drug trafficking from Afghanistan, making them dependent on stability in the wider region. Ethnic conflicts have hindered peace, stability, and economic development in the South Caucasus since the Soviet collapse in 1991. Since the Soviet collapse in 1991, the South Caucasus region has faced ongoing budgetary burdens from arms races, caring for refugees, and ethnic conflicts. The ruling nationalities in the three states harbor grievances against each other, particularly between Armenia and Azerbaijan. This discord led to the displacement of ethnic Armenians from Azerbaijan and vice versa by the early 1990s. The region has been the most unstable part of the former Soviet Union in terms of ethnic and civil conflicts, posing challenges for U.S. and international efforts to foster peace and independence. The South Caucasus region has experienced displacement of ethnic Armenians from Azerbaijan and vice versa by the early 1990s. The main languages in the three states are dissimilar, and separatist regions rely on economic support from other countries. Allegations of terrorist groups with political, ethnic, and religious goals have increased, with Armenia and Azerbaijan accusing each other of sponsoring terrorism. Georgian militias were reportedly active in efforts to regain control over South Ossetia in 2004. Russian defense and security officers allegedly assisted irregulars from Abkhazia, Transnistria, and Russia to enter Georgia's South Ossetia in 2004. These groups, along with local militias, carried out attacks against ethnic Georgians during and after the 2008 conflict. South Caucasus governments have accused opposition parties of terrorism, but attributing violence to specific groups is challenging. Other sources of violence include personal grievances, economic-based crime, and Islamic terrorism. Foreign terrorist influences have also been a concern in the region. Foreign terrorist influences in the South Caucasus region have included groups from Russia's North Caucasus, state-sponsored actors from Iran, and al Qaeda and other groups from Afghanistan and Pakistan. In Georgia, Chechen terrorists with links to al Qaeda sought refuge in the Pankisi Gorge in the 1990s and early 2000s, but were brought under control with U.S. security assistance. Azerbaijan also faced terrorist groups attempting to move people, money, and material through the country in 2012, but counterterrorism efforts reduced their presence. The potential for sectarian conflict between Shiites and Sunni extremist groups remains a concern. The potential of rising sectarian conflict involving Shiites and Sunni extremist groups in Azerbaijan is a concern. The Jayshullah and Salafi Forest Brothers terrorist groups have indicated intentions to launch new attacks against the government. Jayshullah, supported by Iran, has a history of attacks, including targeting the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The Forest Brothers, connected to insurgents in Russia's Dagestan Republic, have alleged links to al Qaeda and have carried out attacks in Baku. Counter-terrorism operations have been conducted against alleged members of these groups. In 2012, counter-terrorism operations targeted alleged Forest Brothers members in Sumgait, resulting in three deaths. Explosions in Baku and other cities in 2014 left three civilians dead, with some linking the blasts to Jayshullah or the Forest Brothers. Azerbaijani media reports hundreds of Sunnis and Shiites traveling to Syria to support rebels or the regime, raising concerns of potential terrorist acts upon their return. The Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Region's petition for independence from Azerbaijan in 1988 sparked armed conflict between ethnic Armenians and Azerbaijanis. The Nagorno Karabakh conflict began in 1988 when the region sought independence from Azerbaijan. A ceasefire agreement was signed in 1994, with ongoing peace talks facilitated by the Minsk Group. The conflict has resulted in casualties, refugees, and displaced persons, with an average of 30 deaths annually along the \"line of contact.\" Participants in the Nagorno Karabakh conflict include Belarus, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Finland, and Turkey. An OSCE planning group of military officers was established for peacekeeping post-agreement. A personal representative appointed by the OSCE chairman-in-office aids in peace settlement efforts, with monitoring missions along the line of contact and Armenia-Azerbaijan border. UNHCR reports 3,135 refugees in Armenia and 600,336 displaced persons at the start of 2014. Armenia has granted citizenship and housing to ethnic Armenians who fled Azerbaijan. At the beginning of 2014, there were still 600,336 displaced persons in Azerbaijan. The Minsk Group has presented four proposals for peace talks, but a settlement has been elusive. In 2007, a draft text called Basic Principles for the Peaceful Settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict was presented to the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan. In 2008, Russian President Medvedev hosted talks in Moscow between Armenian President Sarkisyan and Azerbaijani President Aliyev on a settlement of the NK conflict. A joint declaration upheld a mediating role for the Minsk Group, but Russia's intention to play a major role in mediating the conflict was evident. The joint declaration was the first document on the NK conflict signed by the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan since the ceasefire in 1994. The Basic Principles for the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict were updated in 2009, calling for the phased return of territories to Azerbaijan, an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh, a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh, determination of its final legal status through a binding expression of will, the right of displaced persons to return, and international security guarantees. Meetings between the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan in 2009 and 2010 aimed at reaching an agreement, with progress made on a preamble to a potential agreement. In 2010, progress was made on a preamble to a peace agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan. However, by July 2010, there were concerns about faltering progress. At a summit in December 2010, hopes for talks between the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan were dashed. In March 2011, Presidents Medvedev, Sargisyan, and Aliyev vowed to peacefully resolve disputes. A prisoner exchange took place on March 17, 2011, following calls for the removal of snipers from the line of contact. In March 2011, Azerbaijani Defense Minister Safar Abiyev criticized the Minsk Group talks as \"worthless\" and stated that Azerbaijan had to strengthen its military capabilities to liberate NK and surrounding areas. The Minsk Group co-chairs released a report in late March 2011, echoing findings from a 2005 assessment that most towns and villages in the conflict area were abandoned and in ruins, with some areas being farmed. There are approximately 14,000 people living in small settlements and towns, mainly ethnic Armenians who were relocated. In May 2011, the presidents of the United States, France, and Russia urged Armenian and Azerbaijani presidents to finalize agreement on Basic Principles in a meeting in Kazan, Russia. Presidents Sargisyan and Aliyev announced agreement on some issues with further talks planned. In October 2011, the Minsk Group co-chairs issued a statement after talks with Presidents Aliyev and Sargisyan that the two leaders agreed on border incident investigation procedures. A call for finalizing these procedures was made at the OSCE Ministerial Council Meeting in Vilnius in December 2011. President Aliyev emphasized the importance of negotiations for preventing war at a meeting with the Armenian president in Sochi in January 2012. At the Sochi meeting, the two presidents issued a joint statement requesting Russia to facilitate humanitarian ties and pledged to speed up efforts to agree on basic principles. The OSCE Minsk Group presented a draft plan for setting up a group to investigate incidents along the line of contact, with further work called for by the presidents. Azerbaijani official Ali Hasanov acknowledged talks mediated by Russia as crucial for settling the NK conflict, emphasizing Russia's influence over Armenia and Azerbaijan's goal to persuade Russia to use its influence for conflict resolution. Azerbaijan's main goal is to convince Russia to help resolve the conflict. In June 2012, the US, France, and Russia expressed disappointment over lack of progress. Azerbaijani Foreign Minister emphasized the need for Armenian troops to withdraw from occupied lands. Tensions escalated in August 2012 when Hungary extradited an Azerbaijani citizen. In August 2012, Hungary extradited Ramil Safarov, an Azerbaijani citizen who killed an Armenian officer, to Azerbaijan. Safarov was pardoned and rewarded by Azerbaijani President Aliyev, leading to protests and the breaking off of diplomatic relations with Hungary. The White House and Members of Congress expressed disappointment, while the OSCE Minsk Group raised concerns about the impact on peace efforts. President Aliyev defended the pardon, criticizing the Minsk Group's lack of success in resolving the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict. In December 2012, the Minsk Group expressed concerns about tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan, urging the presidents to prepare for peaceful coexistence. President Sargisyan advised against Armenian recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh's independence to avoid disrupting peace talks. The co-chairs of the Minsk Group met with Azerbaijani and Armenian foreign ministers to discuss moving the peace process forward. The presidents of the US, France, and Russia pledged support for a settlement but criticized efforts by the conflict parties to gain one-sided advantages. They urged both sides to consider the basic principles as a whole. On October 17, 2013, OSCE teams led by Ambassador Andrzej Kasprzyk experienced shooting during a monitoring exercise along the line of contact. Presidents Aliyev and Sargisyan met in Vienna on November 19, 2013, agreeing to continue negotiations for a peace settlement. The Minsk Group co-chairs visited the region in December 2013, urging both sides to refrain from violence. Tensions in Armenia-Azerbaijan relations appeared to increase in January-February 2014. Tensions escalated in Armenia-Azerbaijan relations despite a pledge to refrain from military actions during the Sochi Olympics. Azerbaijani media reported over 1,500 ceasefire violations in January, with the Minsk Group expressing deep concern over escalating violence. Georgia's ethnic minorities increased dissidence in the late 1980s and early 1990s, leading to the loss of central government control over South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Russia's increasing control over these regions transformed the separatist conflicts into essentially Russia-Georgia issues. Abkhazia and South Ossetia's separatist conflicts evolved into Russia-Georgia disputes. Most residents were granted Russian citizenship before the 2008 conflict and desired independence or union with Russia. U.S. initially urged Georgia to work within existing peace frameworks but later supported alternative mechanisms due to breakdown in talks. Abkhazia declared independence in 1992, leading to conflict with Georgian guardsmen. In October 1992, the UNSC approved sending a U.N. Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) to help parties reach a settlement after an attack by Georgian national guardsmen. Russian and North Caucasian \"volunteers\" routed Georgian forces in 1993, resulting in about 10,000 deaths and over 200,000 displaced persons, mostly ethnic Georgians. A framework for a political settlement and the return of refugees was agreed upon by Georgia and Abkhazia in April-May 1994. Russian troops were deployed as CIS \"peacekeepers\" between Abkhazia and the rest of Georgia. The U.S. deputy assistant secretary of State worked with the Special Representative of the U.N. Secretary General and other \"Friends of the Secretary General\" to facilitate a settlement. In July 2006, a warlord in the Kodori Gorge area of northern Abkhazia caused further tensions. In July 2006, a warlord in the Kodori Gorge area of northern Abkhazia defied the Georgian government, leading to a military confrontation. Peace talks between Georgia and Abkhazia were suspended in October 2006. Concerns were raised by the international community when Russia announced an increase in \"peacekeepers\" in Abkhazia in response to alleged Georgian military buildup in the region. In late May 2008, Russia deployed 400 railway construction troops to Abkhazia for \"humanitarian\" work, who reportedly left after repairing tracks and bridges. The region had lobbied for joining North Ossetia in Russia or independence in 1989. Conflict erupted in 1990 due to repressive efforts by former Georgian President Gamsakhurdia, resulting in thousands of deaths and displacement. Russia brokered a cease-fire in June 1992. In June 1992, Russia brokered a cease-fire in South Ossetia, leading to the deployment of Russian, Georgian, and Ossetian peacekeeping units totaling around 1,100 troops. President Saakashvili increased pressure on South Ossetia in 2004 by tightening border controls and breaking up a smuggling operation involving Russian organized crime. Georgia maintained a peacekeeping contingent of 500 troops as permitted by the cease-fire agreement. In late 2004, both sides pulled back most undeclared forces after inconclusive clashes. In November 2006, a referendum in South Ossetia reaffirmed its \"independence\" from Georgia. Tensions escalated in August 2008 when South Ossetia accused Georgia of launching an artillery barrage, leading to intense bombing in Georgian villages. Georgia claimed South Ossetian forces did not respond to a ceasefire appeal, prompting Georgia to send in troops. In August 2008, Russia intensified shelling in Georgia, leading to Georgian troops controlling Tskhinvali. Russian troops engaged Georgian forces in Tskhinvali and occupied South Ossetia, reaching the border with Georgia. Russian warplanes bombed Tbilisi and Russian ships landed troops in Abkhazia. President Medvedev declared the operation successful in coercing Georgia to peace. The operation in Georgia resulted in heavy losses for the aggressor. Medvedev supported elements of an EU peace plan endorsed by Sarkozy. The Georgian government accepted a French-brokered cease-fire, leaving Russian forces in control of South Ossetia, Abkhazia, and security zones in Georgian territory. International condemnation followed. The international community condemned then-President Medvedev's decree recognizing the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Only a few countries have extended diplomatic relations to these regions. A ceasefire accord was signed by Medvedev and Sarkozy, outlining provisions for Russian forces to withdraw, Georgian forces to return to barracks, and an increase in international observers. The EU called for Russia to allow at least 200 observers to patrol in Abkhazia and South Ossetia by October 1. Russia's position is that these observers need approval from the regions, which they have not received. Medvedev stated that Russia recognized the regions as independent in 2008 and aimed to consolidate control over them. Russia aimed to achieve its goal in Georgia by occupying Tbilisi and removing Saakashvili, or indirectly triggering his overthrow. The EU and US diplomacy helped Saakashvili remain as president, ending Russia's offensive. By October 1, 2008, the EU Monitoring Mission deployed over 200 monitors, and Russia announced troop withdrawal from buffer zones. However, Georgia claimed Russian troops remained in Akhalgori and the Kodori Gorge, and objected to OSCE observers in the region. The EU Monitoring Mission (EUMM) became the sole international group of monitors in Georgia after observers from various organizations pulled out in June 2009. With around 200 monitors based in three field offices near contested borders, the EUMM has effectively debunked allegations of ceasefire violations by Georgia, contrasting its cooperation with the refusal of Russia, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia to permit patrols in the regions. In April 2012, Abkhazia declared the head of the EUMM persona non grata for advocating patrols inside the breakaway region. Abkhazia declared the head of the EUMM persona non grata for advocating patrols inside the breakaway region. The incident prevention group meetings have not resumed since then, as the EUMM head normally would attend. An international conference in Geneva discussed security, repatriation, and status issues related to the conflict. Russia, South Ossetia, and Abkhazia reject challenges to the claimed independence of the breakaway regions and insist on an arms embargo on Georgia. In March 2010, Russia proposed that Georgia, South Ossetia, and Abkhazia provide written pledges of non-use of force to the United Nations before signing agreements with the breakaway regions. Significant meetings at the Geneva conference included setting up an incident prevention mechanism along the South Ossetian border and discussing cross-border travel issues between Abkhazia and Georgia. At a meeting in Gali, Abkhazia on July 14, 2009, a group was established to address cross-border travel issues between Abkhazia and Georgia. Russia announced the withdrawal of its troops from Perevi, Georgia near South Ossetia on October 14, 2010, which was completed by October 18, 2010. Georgia raised concerns about alleged Russian terrorist attacks at a meeting on June 7, 2011, and suggested reconsidering participation in the Geneva conference. At a meeting on December 14, 2011, discussions on non-use of force agreements with international monitors were rejected by Russia, South Ossetia, and Abkhazia. At the end of December 2011, Georgia and South Ossetia exchanged detainees who had crossed disputed borders. In June 2012, Russia criticized Secretary Clinton's announcement about recognizing travel documents from Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The new Ivanishvili government expressed disappointment after a December 2012 meeting in Geneva. In March 2013, Russia accused Georgia of hindering talks. Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister accused Georgia of hindering talks to convince them to sign a non-use of force agreement with breakaway regions. Russia refused to pledge not to use force against Georgia. Tensions rose as Russia's border guards erected obstacles along the South Ossetia border, violating ceasefire accords. Georgia rejected attempts to change the format of talks. The next round of talks is scheduled for March 25-26, 2014. In sessions of the European Parliament and the OSCE in Astana, Kazakhstan, pledges were made for the non-use of force except in self-defense. South Ossetia and Abkhazia also made oral statements, but Russia refused to make the pledge, citing non-involvement in the conflict. The Georgian legislature reaffirmed the non-use of force pledge in March 2013. The International Crisis Group estimated a declining population in South Ossetia, with reliance on Russian aid and personnel for governance and economic sustainability. In March 2011, the U.S. reiterated that Georgia's territory is \"occupied\" by Russian troops. Georgia apprehended Russian terrorist infiltrators planning attacks, alleging Russian security agencies were involved. Russia denied the allegations as \"artificially fabricated arrays of data.\" In response to allegations of Russian involvement in bombings near the U.S. Embassy in Tbilisi and government offices in Zugdidi, Georgia, Russia denied the claims and intensified border construction efforts in South Ossetia, drawing criticism from the United States and NATO. Georgian Foreign Minister Panjikidze stated that Georgia would not re-establish diplomatic relations with Russia until Russia recognizes Georgia's territorial integrity, including sovereignty over Abkhazia and South Ossetia. An EU fact-finding mission concluded that the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict began with a Georgian military operation in South Ossetia, which was deemed unjustifiable under international law. The mission criticized the artillery attack as unjustifiable under international law, citing escalating tensions and provocations. It also condemned Russian military actions in South Ossetia and Abkhazia as violations of international law. Additionally, the mission found that actions by South Ossetian militias against ethnic Georgians violated humanitarian and human rights laws. The economies of the South Caucasus states declined in the early 1990s due to various factors. GDP began to rebound in the mid-1990s, with Azerbaijan's growth fueled by oil and gas investments. High emigration and remittances have been significant, while Armenia's economic growth was hampered by the 2008 global economic downturn. The global economic downturn in 2008 affected Armenia's economic growth and added to Georgia's economic stresses after the August 2008 conflict. Azerbaijan's energy revenues helped it weather the downturn with continued GDP growth. International assistance to Georgia mitigated the impact of the conflict and the world economic crisis. Russia provided a $500 million loan to Armenia in 2009 for economic stabilization. All regional economies reported GDP growth in 2011 and beyond. Major economic accomplishments included poverty reduction in Azerbaijan and Georgia's progress in business regulatory reforms. Azerbaijan obstructed railways and pipelines to Armenia, facing transport and communication issues. Russia hindered trade links with Georgia and Azerbaijan, impacting economic development. The 2008 conflict disrupted trade shipments to Armenia through Georgia's Black Sea ports. In the aftermath of the conflict, Black Sea ports disrupted trade to and from Armenia. Gas transit from Russia to South Ossetia via Georgia was disrupted, leading to the construction of a new gas pipeline by Russia. Trans-border road traffic between Georgia and South Ossetia/Abkhazia is severely restricted. Armenia hoped for the reopening of a railway through Georgia to Abkhazia and Russia, but faced obstacles due to political tensions. Armenia faced economic challenges due to trade disruptions and energy dependency. Azerbaijan offered gas supply to Armenia through a disused pipeline, but the proposal was rejected. Turkey's closure of land borders with Armenia hindered direct aid shipments. The U.S. aid cutoffs mandated by P.L. 104-107 and P.L. 104-208 aim to pressure countries allowing the transit of U.S. aid. Azerbaijan threatened to shoot down planes landing in Stepanakert without permission, but later pledged not to attack civilian aircraft. In January 2013, Azerbaijani air force officials reiterated that unpermitted flights would be prevented, with new regulations allowing for shooting down intruding airplanes. Plans to build a road from Armenia into northern NK were discussed in October 2013, as Azerbaijan blocked the airport's operation. Border crossings between Azerbaijan and Iran were closed in November 2013, leading to restrictions on heavy truck cargoes entering Nakhichevan. In 2013, Armenia and Georgia were ranked as \"partly free\" while Azerbaijan was classified as \"not free\" in terms of political rights and civil liberties. Georgia was the region's only \"electoral democracy\" according to the NGO Freedom House. Armenia had better respect for civil liberties compared to Azerbaijan, where media restrictions were increasing. Azerbaijan was also criticized for violating property rights. Georgia showed improvement in political rights and civil liberties, attributed to media diversity and free elections. Selective prosecutions against former Saakashvili raised concerns. In 2013, Armenia and Georgia were ranked as \"partly free\" while Azerbaijan was classified as \"not free\" in terms of political rights and civil liberties. Among disputed territories, South Ossetia was \"not free,\" while Abkhazia and Nagorno Karabakh were \"partly free.\" Armenia and Georgia were ranked as \"free\" in terms of Internet rights, while Azerbaijan was ranked \"partly free.\" The State Department's human rights report highlighted corruption, lack of transparency, and limited judiciary independence in Armenia. Persistent corruption undermined the rule of law, with politically motivated prosecutions and sentencing. In Azerbaijan, human rights abuses included politically motivated prosecutions, torture by police, arbitrary arrests, lack of privacy enforcement, and limited media diversity. Religious restrictions and human trafficking were also issues. In Azerbaijan, human rights abuses included politically motivated prosecutions, torture by police, arbitrary arrests, lack of privacy enforcement, limited media diversity, religious restrictions, and human trafficking. Amendments further restricted NGO financing, with concerns raised about arbitrary arrest, politically motivated imprisonment, executive influence over the judiciary, lengthy pretrial detentions, lack of due legal process for property rights, criminal investigations against election-monitoring NGOs, invasions of privacy, restrictions on religious freedom, constraints on political participation, impediments to human rights NGOs registration, and trafficking in persons in Georgia. In Georgia, human rights issues in 2013 included government employee dismissals, violence against LGBTQ+ individuals, government inaction on perpetrators, interference with religious minorities' rights, police abuse, politically motivated harassment, and judiciary influence. UNM members faced harassment, job loss, and arrests post-2012 election. Media environment concerns persisted. The media environment in Georgia improved, but government pressure on the media, especially Georgia's Public Broadcaster, was reported. Trafficking in persons remained a problem. The government charged 50 former senior Saakashvili administration officials with various crimes. Electoral reforms were implemented in anticipation of legislative and presidential elections. In anticipation of the May 2012 legislative election, reforms were called for by the Venice Commission and ODIHR to improve electoral processes, including easing candidate restrictions, ensuring separation of state and party structures, enhancing transparency in vote counting, and improving complaint procedures. The opposition introduced a bill to transition to a proportional system for electing deputies, arguing against the control of single member district voting by local officials. The bill proposed transitioning to a proportional system for electing deputies to increase opposition representation. Despite some support from Prosperous Armenia deputies, the ruling coalition rejected the bill. In the May 2012 legislative election, eight parties and the Armenian National Congress ran on party lists for 90 seats, while 155 candidates competed for 41 single-mandate constituencies. Official campaigning started on April 8, with a voter turnout of nearly 63%. Six parties won legislative seats in the party list portion. In the recent election, voters turned out with six parties winning legislative seats. The Republican Party secured 40 seats, followed by the Prosperous Armenia Party with 28 seats. The election was deemed competitive and largely peaceful by the OSCE monitoring mission, but there were concerns about an unequal playing field and deficiencies in the complaint process. Media coverage and candidate registration processes were fair, although there were issues with voter lists accuracy. The recent election in Armenia raised concerns about voter list accuracy and violations of electoral codes by local authorities and party-linked organizations. Election monitors observed unauthorized persons or group voting in 12% of polling stations. Vote counting and tabulation were negatively assessed in some polling stations and higher-level electoral commissions. Despite some progress in democratization, there were still issues reported by OSCE monitors. On May 30, 2012, the Republican Party and the Orinats Yerker Party formed a coalition, with some problems reported by OSCE monitors. Hovik Abrahamyan was elected Speaker on May 31, 2012, and Tigran Sargisyan was re-appointed as prime minister on June 2, 2012. Armenia's Central Electoral Commission registered eight candidates for the February 18, 2013, presidential election. Several major political parties and politicians, including former President Robert Kocharyan, Prosperous Armenia Party head Gagik Tsarukyan, and Armenian National Congress (ANC) head Levon Ter-Petrosyan, failed to field candidates for the February 18, 2013, presidential election in Armenia. Ter-Petrosyan cited his age as a reason for not running and criticized past fraudulent election practices. Campaigning began dramatically with candidate Andreas Ghukasyan starting a hunger strike to protest the election's legitimacy. Other contenders also raised concerns about the fairness of the election. On February 25, 2013, the Central Election Commission (CEC) declared Serzh Sargisyan as the winner of the presidential election in Armenia with 58.64% of the votes, followed by Hovannisyan with 36.74%. Hovannisyan contested the results, claiming victory, but his party's election complaints were rejected by the CEC. His Heritage Party organized protests following the election. The Heritage Party's complaints about the election were dismissed by the CEC. They organized protests calling for new elections. The National Security Service indicted presidential candidate Vardan Sedrakiyan for allegedly ordering an attack on another candidate. OSCE observers found the election well-administered but noted issues like lack of impartiality and voter pressure. The voting process was negatively impacted in 5% of polling stations due to overcrowding and interference. Vote counting and tabulation were also criticized in less than 10% of observed stations. OSCE observers raised concerns about the correlation between turnout and votes for Sargisyan, treatment of complaints, and media coverage. Government-owned TV stations presented a biased view of the election, raising doubts about their objectivity. President Sargisyan promised to strengthen democracy and address issues like emigration and poverty in his inaugural address. President Sargisyan promised to strengthen democracy, address emigration, poverty, and unemployment. Hovannisyan's protest led to detentions by police, resulting in Sargisyan's cabinet resigning. The controversial pension law mandating salary transfers was suspended but the government aims for continued implementation. Protest actions against the law have called for Sargisyan's resignation. The Sargisyan government faced criticism for high gas prices and increased fines for unauthorized demonstrations, leading to concerns about civil society constraints. In 2013, efforts to detain protesters escalated, with arrests made after a soldier's death sparked unauthorized protests in Baku. In 2013, protests in Azerbaijan against non-combat deaths led to arrests and heavy fines for demonstrators. Activists were detained on charges of incitement to violence. The U.S. Embassy objected to the suppression of the protest and allegations against the National Democratic Institute. Azerbaijan requested the OSCE to downgrade its office in Baku. In early April 2013, the Free Thought University in Azerbaijan was raided and closed by the Prosecutor General's Office. The closure raised concerns from U.S. Ambassador Morningstar and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Melia. Azerbaijan's presidential administration stated that the university may reopen if it meets all legal requirements. Ten candidates, including the incumbent President, were registered for the October 9, 2013, Azerbaijani presidential election. For the October 9, 2013 Azerbaijani presidential election, incumbent President Aliyev ran for his third term. The main opposition candidate was Jamil Hasanli, nominated by the National Council of Democratic Forces. Other opposition candidates included Iqbal Agazada, Ilyas Ismayilov, and Sardar Calaloglu. President Aliyev received 84.54% of the vote, followed by Hasanli with 5.53% and Agazada with 2.4%. The election was well according to the final report of the OSCE. The OSCE final report on the 2013 Azerbaijani presidential election highlighted limitations on freedoms of expression, assembly, and association that favored the sitting president's campaign. Campaigning was marred by allegations of intimidation, limited media access for most candidates, and harassment of journalists. The government restricted venues for candidate-voter meetings and campaign poster displays. Coercion to attend presidential rallies and disruption of National Council rallies were observed, with investigations into National Council member activities. Hasanli faced warnings for insulting the president's dignity. The 2013 Azerbaijani presidential election was marred by restrictions on freedoms of expression, assembly, and association, favoring the sitting president's campaign. Campaigning faced allegations of intimidation, limited media access, and harassment of journalists. Voting day saw serious shortcomings like multiple voting and ballot box-stuffing. The ballot-counting process was problematic in a majority of polling places, with unauthorized individuals involved in vote-counting and votes being reassigned. Post-election, the government harassed and detained opposition party members. After the 2013 Azerbaijani presidential election, the State Department expressed regret over the election falling short of international standards. Serious vote-counting issues and a repressive campaign environment were noted by the OSCE and other monitors. The government detained opposition party members and election monitors, while the presidential administration head criticized assessments as flawed and rejected accusations of falsification. An investigation was launched by the prosecutor general in October 2013. In late 2013, Azerbaijan saw a crackdown on opposition activists, religious figures, and others with arrests and convictions on various charges. The European Union criticized amendments to Azerbaijan's NGO law in February 2014. Amendments to Azerbaijan's law on NGOs have raised concerns about limiting human rights and democracy advocacy by civil society groups. Over 100 NGOs called for the repeal of the 2014 changes to the NGO law. The Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry defended the changes, stating they were made in consultation with NGOs. In Georgia, a parliamentary election was held in October 2012, with 16 parties and blocs participating. The main opposition was the Georgia Dream coalition led by Bidzina Ivanishvili. In the 2012 Georgian parliamentary election, Bidzina Ivanishvili's Georgia Dream coalition won 85 out of 150 legislative seats, defeating then-President Saakashvili's United National Movement. The election was deemed free and reflective of the people's will by OSCE observers. The White House praised the election as a milestone for Georgia's democracy and called for a peaceful transition of power between Ivanishvili and Saakashvili. Several Members of Congress and the Senate commended Saakashvili for his efforts in transforming the country. The post-election statement commended President Saakashvili for his efforts in transforming Georgia into a prosperous democracy. The new legislature approved Ivanishvili as prime minister and relations between parties were contentious leading up to the 2013 presidential election. The Ivanishvili government arrested officials from the previous Saakashvili government. The Ivanishvili government arrested officials from the previous Saakashvili government, including former defense and interior minister Bacho Akhalaia and chief of the armed forces Georgy Kalandadze. Akhalaia was acquitted in two trials and pardoned by Saakashvili after a conviction in a third trial, while Kalandadze was acquitted in August 2013. Other prosecutions included former Prime Minister Vano Merabishvili detained on corruption charges and former Defense Minister Davit Kezerashvili detained on bribery and money laundering charges. In December 2013, a Tbisili court suspended UNM member Gigi Ugulava as mayor of Tbilisi for misspending funds. The Georgian legislature overrode a presidential veto of a law on amnesty for \"political prisoners\" in January 2013, leading to the release of nearly 200 alleged victims, including 13 individuals sentenced as Russian espionage agents. Elected local councils and executive leaderships, previously dominated by UNM members, faced challenges from GD supporters, resulting in resignations, party switches, and declarations of independence. Some observers criticized GD for attempting to take over local politics instead of cooperating with the UNM. In October 2013, a presidential election was held in Georgia. Prime Minister Ivanishvili planned to step down after the election. Giorgi Margvelashvili from the GD party won with over 50% of the votes, avoiding a second round of voting. Other candidates included Davit Bakradze from the UNM, Nino Burjanadze, Giorgi Targamadze, and Shalva Natelashvili. Voter turnout was 46.6% of 3.54 million registered voters. In the 2013 presidential election in Georgia, Margvelashvili won with over 62% of the vote, avoiding a second round of voting. Observers noted low turnout, attributed to the new president's limited powers and lack of charismatic candidates. The election was deemed efficiently administered, with rights of expression respected. In the 2013 election in Georgia, observers reported isolated instances of harassment and violence during the campaign period. Voting and vote counting were evaluated as free and fair in most polling stations. Ivanishvili proposed Garibashvili as the new prime minister, who emphasized Georgia's shift towards a European-style democracy and prioritizing integration with the EU and NATO. Ivanishvili retired from public office. The new prime minister of Georgia, Garibashvili, has been given more power under the new constitutional system, raising concerns about the presumption of innocence. He accused former Prime Minister Merabashvili of misusing budget funds and ordering killings, leading to a debate on the rule of law and presumption of innocence. President Margvelashvili emphasized the importance of presumption of innocence in the state. On February 17, 2014, Merabishvili was found guilty of theft and misuse of public funds to support the UNM in the 2012 election, resulting in a five-year prison sentence. He is also under investigation for further allegations. In late January 2014, Ivanishvili announced the establishment of a new NGO called \"Citizen\" to enhance citizen participation in governance. The United States is the largest bilateral aid donor to Armenia and Georgia, providing assistance through various programs since FY1992. The United States provides significant aid to Armenia and Georgia through various programs, including food aid, Peace Corps, and security assistance. Congress created a South Caucasian funding category in FY1998 to emphasize regional peace and development, which has been upheld in yearly appropriations. The Administration's estimated spending for FY2014 and FY2015 has declined, reflecting progress in the region and other global priorities. The Administration planned to target FY2014 aid to Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan to support various aspects such as democratization, civil society, energy security, and government accountability. Congress also directed humanitarian aid for displaced persons in NK, totaling about $41 million from FY1998 through FY2012. In FY2009 and FY2010, up to $8 million was allocated for aid to NK, with actual aid averaging $2 million per year since FY2002. Aid has been provided for various projects such as rehabilitating homes, health clinics, water systems, providing micro-loans for agriculture, and demining efforts. The US also contributes to multilateral organizations aiding the South Caucasus region. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) initiated a global assistance program focused on poverty reduction in countries meeting specific criteria. Despite Georgia's lack of anti-corruption efforts, MCC deemed it eligible for a $295.3 million compact in 2005. Projects included road improvements, gas pipeline repairs, business investment fund, agricultural grants, and water supply enhancements. After the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict, an additional $100 million was allocated for infrastructure projects. In April 2011, the MCC completed its compact with Georgia and announced plans for a second compact in January 2011. Georgia aimed to enhance education, and preliminary funding was provided by MCC in 2012. A $140 million agreement was signed in July 2013 to improve secondary education and higher education programs in science, technology, engineering, and math. In December 2005, a $235.65 million compact was approved for Armenia to boost rural agriculture through various projects. The MCC signed a compact with Armenia in December 2005 to boost rural agriculture through road-building and irrigation projects. Concerns were raised about democratization progress, leading to the cancellation of $67.1 million in funding for road building in June 2009. The MCC completed its compact with Armenia by disbursing $177 million, benefiting 428,000 rural residents. Armenia has not been selected for a new compact due to concerns about fiscal policy, government expenditures, political rights, and freedom of information. Lesotho was chosen for a compact in FY2014 over Armenia due to higher scores in political rights and freedom of information. The United States has provided security assistance to the region. The United States has provided security assistance to the region, particularly after September 11, 2001. Admiral James Stavridis highlighted the instability in the Caucasus, including Russia's non-compliance with cease-fire agreements. The South Caucasus remains a concern due to unresolved conflicts and potential for destabilization. EUCOM continues engagement in the region due to its strategic importance as a global energy corridor and potential for illicit activities. The South Caucasus region has frozen conflicts that could escalate into wider wars. US security cooperation priorities focus on ensuring access, countering threats, solidifying defense reforms, and enhancing partner capacity. EUCOM initiatives include the Georgia Deployment Program and Caspian Regional Maritime Security Cooperation program, supporting Georgian forces in Afghanistan. The Caspian Regional Maritime Security Cooperation program aims to coordinate U.S. security activities in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, promoting maritime safety and security in the Caspian Sea. This program combines elements of the former Caspian Guard and Hydrocarbons programs, with efforts to enhance Azerbaijan's capabilities in observing, evaluating, and responding to events in their maritime domain. U.S. Naval Forces Europe also cooperates with Azerbaijan and U.S. Central Command on activities involving Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. The Administration requested FMF assistance for Azerbaijan to enhance Caspian Sea maritime security. State Department reports $223 million to Armenia, $327 million to Azerbaijan, and $896 million to Georgia for peace and security, including law enforcement, border security, counter-narcotics, and counter-terrorism funds. Funding includes IMET, FMF, Section 1206, and other Defense Department funding. Section 907 waiver may apply. The Section 907 waiver allows for U.S. security aid to Azerbaijan, including FMF and IMET. Aid to Armenia and Azerbaijan had been unequal until the waiver provision was enacted. Congress usually directs equal amounts of IMET and FMF assistance to both countries. The State Department's Congressional Budget Justification for FY2015 calls for $1.7 million in FMF and $600,000 in IMET for each country. In FY2012, 269 Armenian students completed training at a cost of $1.88 million, with the largest share for troops trained by USEUCOM in Germany. In Azerbaijan, 415 students completed training at a cost of $1.92 million, funded by FMF, FMS, and Section 1206. In the wake of the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict, General Craddock assessed Georgia's defense needs. The Defense Department identified deficiencies in Georgian Armed Forces and Ministry of Defense. General James led training by Navy seals on diving and mine response.

The United States has not provided lethal military assistance to Georgia since the 2008 conflict, despite calls from some in Congress for defensive arms transfers. Senator John McCain urged the Obama Administration to resume defensive arms transfers, including early warning radars, to bolster Georgia's territorial defense capabilities. EUCOM Commander Stavridis confirmed that high-end military defensive weapons were not being provided to Georgia at that time. Senator McCain criticized the lack of military assistance to Georgia, stating that it is incomprehensible given the Russian occupation of Georgian territory. Representative Mike Turner called for NATO states to consider arms sales to Georgia for collective defense. A report led by Senators Shaheen and Graham recommended normalizing defense relations with Georgia, including allowing sales of defensive weapons. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2012 called for the normalization of U.S. defense cooperation with Georgia, including the sale of defensive weapons. President Obama signed the act into law on December 31, 2011, but stated that conflicting provisions would be considered non-binding. The required report on bilateral security collaboration was submitted to Congress on April 30, 2012. The report on bilateral security collaboration highlighted the progress made since the 2008 conflict, including the revision of Georgia's national security strategy, defense plan, and armed forces reorganization. U.S.-Georgia defense cooperation focused on modernizing Georgia's armed forces and supporting its contributions to ISAF. Georgia had 63 cooperative training contacts in FY2011 and 23 in FY2012. All 19 requests for foreign military sales equipment and services since May 2010 were fulfilled. The report highlighted progress in U.S.-Georgia defense cooperation since the 2008 conflict, focusing on modernizing Georgia's armed forces and supporting its contributions to ISAF.

She mentioned the $10 million U.S. assistance to rebuild Georgia's Coast Guard and other security cooperation efforts. EUCOM Commander Stavridis testified in March 2013 about expanding the Georgia Deployment Program for training. Commander Stavridis expanded the Georgia Deployment Program to train and deploy two battalions every six months to ISAF's Regional Command Southwest. Georgian troops utilized training at U.S. Army Europe's Joint Multinational Training Center for mission rehearsal exercises before ISAF deployment and participated in Agile Spirit training. U.S. Naval Forces Europe led Eurasia Partnership Capstone, including training with Georgian naval forces and providing non-commissioned officer development and maritime training. Georgian naval forces received training in various operations from U.S. Naval Forces Europe, including maritime interdiction, search and rescue, and environmental protection.

NATO pledged enhanced attention to South Caucasian and Central Asian Partnership for Peace members in 2004. A Special Representative of the NATO Secretary General was appointed to encourage democratic civil-military relations and transparency in defense planning. In 2004-2005, regional states agreed to participate in NATO's Individual Partnership Action Plans for military and civil-military reforms. Troops from these states have served as peacekeepers in NATO missions in Kosovo and Afghanistan. Armenia's President did not attend a NATO summit in 2012 due to concerns about upholding Azerbaijan's territorial integrity, which was reflected in the summit declaration. The declaration's impact on negotiation process and fragile peace in the region was criticized. NATO's support for Georgia's reforms was reaffirmed at the Riga Summit in 2006. The issue of a Membership Action Plan for Georgia was contentious at the April 2008 NATO Summit. After the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict, concerns were raised about Georgia's readiness for a MAP due to military infrastructure destruction by Russia. After the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict, NATO agreed to work towards Georgia's eventual membership by stepping up efforts within the Georgia-NATO Council. The first annual national plan for Georgia's progress towards NATO membership was implemented in May 2009. President Obama reassured then-President Saakashvili of continued US support for Georgia's NATO aspirations in January 2012. Ambassador-designate to Georgia Richard confirmed this support at his confirmation hearing in March 2012. At his confirmation hearing in March 2012, Ambassador-designate to Georgia Richard Norland reported that the Administration planned to signal acknowledgment for Georgia's progress at the upcoming May 2012 NATO summit in Chicago. The Chicago Summit Declaration strengthened NATO ties with Georgia, reaffirming support for its territorial integrity and calling on Russia to pledge not to use force against Georgia. The Declaration also raised concerns about Russia's military buildup in breakaway regions and called for international observers to have access to the regions. In mid-November 2012, then-Prime Minister Ivanishvili met with Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen at NATO headquarters in Brussels, giving assurances of due process for arrested officials and inviting NATO to set up a commission in Georgia. Georgian Defense Minister Alasania stated at a NATO-Georgia Commission meeting that post-election Georgia was more stable and a stronger NATO partner. Secretary General Rasmussen reiterated at a follow-on meeting that NATO would continue to monitor judicial developments. General Rasmussen emphasized NATO's commitment to monitoring judicial developments in Georgia and expressed anticipation for a stronger relationship with Georgia in 2013 and beyond. NATO praised Georgia's annual plan for 2013 and offered assistance for its implementation, urging political factions to collaborate for the country's democratization. During a visit to Tbilisi in June 2013, Rasmussen raised concerns about the arrests of former officials and called for further democratization and protection of minority rights in Georgia's path towards NATO integration. Georgia is committed to joining NATO and supporting peacekeeping in Afghanistan. A major issue discussed by the NATO-Georgia Commission was the movement of border barriers by Russian border guards in South Ossetia. Rasmussen called for Russia to remove obstacles in South Ossetia and reverse recognition of breakaway regions. Georgia will join NATO's Response Force in 2015. Rasmussen stated there was \"new momentum\" in military and democratic reforms in Georgia, but work remains before Georgia gains NATO membership. Georgian officials express the importance of NATO membership, with concerns raised about potential anti-Western forces if a Membership Action Plan (MAP) is not offered. Prime Minister Garibashvili remains optimistic about eventual MAP approval, emphasizing the country's desire for European integration. Despite challenges, polls show strong public support for NATO membership. The U.S. Congress has supported Georgia's NATO aspirations through the NATO Freedom Consolidation Act of 2007. The NATO Freedom Consolidation Act of 2007 urged NATO to extend a Membership Action Plan (MAP) for Georgia and designate it eligible for security assistance. In 2011, the U.S. delegation called for a MAP for Georgia at the NATO Summit in 2012. In 2012, Senator Richard Lugar introduced The NATO Enhancement Act to reaffirm an \"open door\" policy for NATO aspirant countries like Georgia. Efforts at the Chicago NATO Summit to provide a clear roadmap for granting a MAP to Georgia and other aspirants were unsuccessful. Representative Turner and other Members of Congress urged Secretary Kerry to advocate for a MAP for Georgia at the September 2014 NATO Summit, emphasizing the importance of NATO membership for democratic institutions and regional stability. U.S. Administrations have supported privatization and free markets to benefit U.S. national interests. Efforts have been made to open markets for U.S. goods and services in the region, with bilateral trade agreements and investment treaties in place. U.S. investment is focused on Azerbaijan's energy sector, but corruption and regional instability have deterred investors. Georgia and Armenia have been admitted to the WTO, with Title IV trade restrictions lifted for both countries. The application of Title IV was terminated with respect to Armenia in January 2005. A U.S.-Armenia Joint Economic Task Force has held annual meetings since 1992. At the 22nd meeting in November 2013, a $180 million purchase by U.S. firm Contour Global of three hydro-electric power plants in Armenia was hailed as the largest U.S. private investment in the country. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) offered partial financing for this investment. Additionally, a U.S.-Azerbaijan Intergovernmental Commission on Economic Cooperation was founded in early 2007, and an Economic, Energy, and Trade Working Group meets regularly as part of the U.S.-Georgia Strategic Partnership Commission. At a Working Group meeting in December 2013, the U.S. and Azerbaijan discussed progress towards a free trade agreement. Azerbaijan has significant oil and gas reserves, with potential for boosting energy security in Europe. Gas exports from Azerbaijan are set to increase with the start of phase two production at the Shah Deniz gas fields in 2019. The U.S. aims to support the development of new oil and gas resources in Eurasia to diversify global energy supplies, benefitting both the U.S. and European energy security. The Administration is backing the Southern Corridor project to establish new gas export routes through Turkey to Europe. The U.S. supports the Southern Corridor project for gas exports from Azerbaijan to Europe through Turkey. The Administration prioritizes projects that bring gas quickly and reliably to Europe. There is a Working Group on Energy under the U.S.-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission to address Caspian energy supplies. Azerbaijani gas is seen as crucial for the development of the Southern Corridor. In August 2007, the U.S. granted Azerbaijan $1.7 million for feasibility studies on building oil and gas pipelines across the Caspian Sea to link Central Asia. The U.S. supported the construction of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline as part of a strategy to prevent Russia from monopolizing export pipelines. In November 1999, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkey, and Kazakhstan signed the \"Istanbul Protocol\" for the construction of the BTC oil pipeline. The BTC oil pipeline was constructed by the BTC Company in 2002, with the first tanker loading Azeri oil in May 2006. The pipeline has transported 1.33 billion barrels of oil to the Ceyhan terminal since then. Additionally, the South Caucasus Pipeline (SCP) was completed in 2007, with exports reaching 159 billion cubic feet in 2011. The ultimate capacity of the SCP is about 706 billion cubic feet per year. The joint venture for the South Caucasus Pipeline (SCP) includes Norway's Statoil, British Petroleum, Azerbaijan's Ministry of Industry and Energy, and companies from Russia, Iran, France, and Turkey. Some in Armenia object to lack of access to the BTC and SCP pipelines. The August 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict did not harm the pipelines, but the BTC pipeline was temporarily closed for other reasons. Kazakhstan started pumping oil through the BTC pipeline in October 2008, but a transit price increase by Azerbaijan in 2011 led Kazakhstan to restrict its use of the pipeline. In 2011, a transit price increase by Azerbaijan led Kazakhstan to restrict its use of the BTC pipeline. Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan are in talks to expand the barging of oil to the BTC pipeline. Some Turkmen oil started to be transported through the BTC pipeline in June 2010. The completion of the BTC and SCP pipelines raised awareness of the strategic importance of the South Caucasus. In mid-November 2007, a gas pipeline connecting Greece and Turkey was inaugurated. The Nabucco pipeline, funded by the European Investment Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the World Bank, aimed to provide gas supplies from Azerbaijan to the EU as an alternative to Russian gas. Delays in construction were caused by Russia's counter-proposals for competing pipelines. Construction was planned to begin in 2012 with a capacity of 1.1 trillion cubic feet, but higher cost estimates in 2011 posed challenges. In 2009, a declaration was signed to bolster east-west energy transport, including the Nabucco gas pipeline and other projects. Azerbaijan diversified gas export routes due to negotiations with Turkey over transit fees and prices. In October 2009, Azerbaijan's State Oil Company (SOCAR) signed agreements with Russia's Gazprom to supply 17.7 billion cubic feet of gas per year. The gas would be transported through a 140-mile pipeline from Baku to Russia's Dagestan Republic. In September 2010, Azerbaijan agreed to provide up to 35.4 billion cubic feet of gas per year to Russia. President Aliyev assured that this agreement would not affect plans to supply gas for Nabucco, as Azerbaijan had significant gas reserves. In April 2010, Azerbaijan, Romania, and Georgia signed a memorandum to transport liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Azerbaijan to the EU through Georgia and Romania. The AGRI project involves constructing a gas pipeline to transport LNG from Azerbaijan to Georgia and Romania. The output is expected to be 247 billion cubic feet per year, with 71 billion cubic feet used by Romania and the rest by other EU countries. The Baku Declaration was signed in September 2010 to show political support for the project. In June 2010, tensions between Turkey and Azerbaijan over energy issues eased during President Aliyev's visit to Turkey. They signed agreements for the sale and transportation of Azerbaijani natural gas to Turkey and other countries. A memorandum of understanding allowed Azerbaijan to make direct gas sales to Greece, Bulgaria, and Syria through Turkey. In January 2011, President Aliyev committed to supplying substantial gas volumes to the EU in a joint declaration with the President of the European Commission. Concerns were raised about the availability of enough Azerbaijani gas for proposed pipelines and projects without a trans-Caspian gas pipeline. In October 2011, the Shah Deniz Export Negotiating Team received final proposals for pipelines to export gas from the second phase development of the Shah Deniz offshore oil and gas fields. Proposals were received from consortia backing the ITGI, Nabucco, and Trans-Adriatic Pipeline projects, as well as from BP, which proposed building the \"South East Europe Pipeline\" (SEEP) from western. BP proposed building an 808-mile \"South East Europe Pipeline\" (SEEP) from western Turkey through Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary to Austria. Azerbaijan and Turkey signed accords for the transit of Shah Deniz phase 2 gas through Turkey, with 565-706 billion cubic feet of gas transiting Turkey. Another accord allowed for the construction of a new Trans-Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP) to bypass the existing Turkish pipeline system. This pipeline could potentially link to BP's SEEP, TAP, or a new version of the Nabucco pipeline called \"Nabucco West.\" In late December 2011, Azerbaijan and Turkey signed a memorandum of understanding to construct the TANAP pipeline. SOCAR initially holds an 80% share in the consortium, with plans for completion in 2018. The Nabucco consortium submitted new pipeline proposals to the Shah Deniz consortium, including the Nabucco West route. The Shah Deniz Export Negotiating Team indicated a preference for the TAP pipeline. In early 2012, the Shah Deniz Export Negotiating Team favored the TAP proposal over the ITGI pipeline. By mid-2012, SEEP was rejected, leaving TAP and Nabucco West as options. In March 2013, refined proposals were submitted to the Shah Deniz Team, with a final decision expected in June 2013. Meanwhile, Russia advanced the South Stream gas pipeline project, with construction starting in late 2012. The pipeline, spanning nearly 600 miles under the Black Sea, aims to reach European markets via transit states like Bulgaria, Serbia, Hungary, and Slovenia to Austria. Some analysts question its economic viability, suggesting it is a counter to the Nabucco West and TAP pipelines. Russia is proposing a gas pipeline project to counter the Nabucco West and TAP pipelines, aiming to maintain dominance in Europe. The Shah Deniz consortium chose TAP to transport gas to Italy based on commercial viability and funding availability. BP reported a significant commercial difference between TAP and competing projects, with interest from companies in five countries to purchase gas. Gas from TAP will be used by Albania, Greece, and Italy. The TAP pipeline will deliver gas to Albania, Greece, and Italy, with plans to extend to Central Europe and the Balkans. There are proposals for connections to the 321-mile Ionian Adriatic Pipeline (IAP) in Albania, which could supply gas to Montenegro, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Croatia. The European Commission aims to build interconnectors to allow TAP-supplied gas to reach states vulnerable to Russian gas cut-offs, such as Bulgaria and Hungary. The final investment decision on the Shah Deniz gas field's phase II development was made on December 17, 2013, costing $28 billion. The construction of the TAP pipeline, costing $28 billion, is crucial for the economic viability of Shah Deniz phase II development. While some analysts doubt TAP's impact on reducing Europe's reliance on Russian gas, it will diversify gas supply sources, strengthen Greece's economy, promote cooperation between Greece and Turkey, include Albania in European gas transit routes, and attract investment. Albania included in European gas transit routes. Austria's OMV seeks alternative gas sources after Nabucco West decision. Romania focuses on developing indigenous gas supply. EU continues talks with Turkmenistan for trans-Caspian gas pipeline. US State Department supports TAP decision for Southern Corridor gas supply to Europe. The TAP decision in the Southern Corridor aims to strengthen European energy security by bringing new gas sources to Europe. Azerbaijan sees this as an opportunity to boost its economy and enhance its Euro-Atlantic orientation. Talks with Turkmenistan for a trans-Caspian pipeline have faced obstacles from Iran and Russia. The EU approved talks with Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan for a trans-Caspian gas pipeline to support the Nabucco project. EU Energy Commissioner Oettinger praised the decision, emphasizing the importance of the pipeline for Europe's gas supply. Russia criticized the plans, citing a previous agreement among Caspian Sea littoral states. In April 2012, Lavrov urged the EU to respect Caspian littoral states before advocating for a trans-Caspian pipeline. Tensions rose in June 2012 when Azerbaijan turned back a Turkmen survey ship. However, in September 2012, President Aliyev expressed support for the project if Turkmenistan deemed it important. In November 2012, European Energy Commissioner Oettinger discussed the pipeline at the Frankfurt Gas Forum. In November 2012, European Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger highlighted the EU's plan for the Southern Corridor to carry 45-90 bcm per year, with gas from Shah Deniz phase 2 only contributing a fraction. To achieve this goal, more gas, possibly from Turkmenistan, would be required. The United States supported a trans-Caspian pipeline, emphasizing that no country should veto Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan's decision to build it. However, obstacles like the Azerbaijan-Turkmenistan border dispute and Turkmenistan's reluctance to sign agreements with Western energy firms hinder pipeline construction. Armenia has built oil and gas pipelines to Iran to reduce reliance on Russian supplies. Azerbaijan competes with Iran in energy development in the Caspian region. Increasing sanctions on Iran have decreased its regional energy role, while Azerbaijan has collaborated with Western energy firms to export oil and gas. In 2007, a gas pipeline from Iran to Armenia was inaugurated, with a second section completed in 2008. Gazprom Armenia now operates the pipeline. Gazprom Armenia, the sole owner since 2014, controls gas distribution in Armenia. Armenian-Iranian gas trade faces uncertainty due to Gazprom's control. Discussions on a petroleum products pipeline from Iran to Armenia have been delayed by international sanctions. Construction of the Meghri Hydroelectric Power Plant on the border with Iran began in 2012. A proposal for a rail line between the two countries has also been delayed. Azerbaijan's gas exports to Iran have been affected by international sanctions, leading to delays in the proposed rail line between the two countries. Despite this, Azerbaijan signed an agreement with Iran to supply gas through a pipeline, with potential for increased supplies in the future. Iran's Naftiran Intertrade Company has stakes in gas projects in Azerbaijan. The Shah Deniz gas field project was exempted from sanctions under the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012. The Shah Deniz gas field project was exempted from sanctions under the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012. S.Res. 317 expresses U.S. support for Georgia's territorial integrity, defense cooperation, NATO membership aspirations, and democratic processes. P.L. 113-76 H.R. 3547, Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, was passed to support various initiatives related to Georgia. The bill was signed into law on January 17, 2014, stating that funds appropriated to Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia shall be used to advance agreements with the European Union and reduce vulnerability to external pressure. It also calls for a report on potential non-tariff barriers by Russia and actions by the U.S. government to ensure sovereignty. The bill H.Res. 402 supports the European aspirations of Eastern Partnership countries, calls for funds for democracy programs, and a report on a multi-year strategy. It also urges Russia to respect states' rights to sign Association Agreements with the EU and commends Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia for progress. The European Union supports the progress of Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia in adopting democratic norms and urges the State Department to continue supporting their rights to enter into partnerships. H.Res. 284 promotes energy security through the Southern Gas Corridor, while H.Res. 227 calls for equitable Armenian-Turkish relations. H.Res. 227 calls for equitable Armenian-Turkish relations based on acknowledgment of the Armenian Genocide and a fair international resolution. S. 1548 aims to assist Haiti and Armenia in reducing deforestation. H.R. 1960 pertains to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014. The Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 was introduced on May 14, 2013, passed the House on June 14, 2013, and was placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar on the same day. Section 1244 of the Act addresses concerns about democratization issues in Georgia affecting bilateral cooperation."
