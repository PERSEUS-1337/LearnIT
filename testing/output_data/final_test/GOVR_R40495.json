    "content": "The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) is seen as crucial by Congress and the Executive Branch for promoting liberalizing international trade and investment in Asia. APEC also serves as a platform for the U.S. to engage in discussions on non-economic issues like international security and human rights. Congressional interest in APEC is evident in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006, which called for a strategy to address China's economic, diplomatic, and military emergence, promote trade relations, and encourage adherence to international norms. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 emphasizes the importance of revitalizing U.S. engagement in East Asia through regional initiatives that complement bilateral efforts. APEC is highlighted as a key forum for advancing U.S. interests in trade, international security, and human rights. The Bush and Obama Administrations have both recognized the significance of APEC in U.S. foreign policy. The Obama Administration values relations with APEC for U.S. foreign policy in Asia. The role of APEC in future U.S. trade policy in Asia is uncertain. The Bush Administration used APEC for regional economic integration in the Asia Pacific. The United States announced negotiations with Brunei Darussalam, Chile, New Zealand, and Singapore for the TPP. It was unclear if U.S. interest in the TPP shifted focus from APEC. The uncertainty about APEC's future role in U.S. trade policy arises as the 111th Congress may consider financial support, U.S. commitments, and oversight of APEC-related issues. The 111th Congress may increase oversight of APEC-related activities and programs of the U.S. Trade Representative and other federal departments. APEC's unusual organizational structure may hinder the U.S. in promoting its positions on various issues within the organization. APEC is an association of 21 member economies bordering the Pacific Ocean, working to promote economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region. It aims for free and open trade by 2010 for industrialized economies and 2020 for developing economies, with decisions made via consensus. APEC operates on a consensus-based decision-making forum with voluntary commitments for trade liberalization. There are no formal enforcement mechanisms, and members can join cooperative arrangements at their own pace. The approach of \"open regionalism\" aims to achieve easier and more likely implementation of commitments compared to traditional negotiated agreements. APEC aims to achieve consensus views for rapid progress towards its goals, avoiding confrontation seen in traditional trade agreements. Members work towards liberalizing trade in merchandise, services, and investments to meet the Bogor Goals. Compliance issues may arise if parties feel agreements are inequitable. APEC focuses on liberalizing trade in merchandise, services, and investments to achieve the Bogor Goals. Members engage in Economic and Technical Cooperation to facilitate international business. The Osaka Action Agenda emphasizes APEC's commitment to global free trade through fundamental principles like WTO consistency and non-discrimination. APEC's unique approach to trade liberalization is reflected in its small Secretariat in Singapore. APEC's organization includes a small Secretariat in Singapore overseeing various groups like the Leaders' Meeting, Business Advisory Council, Ministerial Meeting, and Sectoral Minister Meetings. The Secretariat supervises committees and working groups, with each member sending representatives to serve as program directors. The annual Leaders' Meeting sets goals and provides momentum for the process, usually held in October or November each year. The annual APEC Leaders' Meeting, usually held in October or November, is attended by heads of state except for Taiwan. The first meeting was in 1993 on Blake Island, near Seattle. Major decisions are made at the meeting, which focuses on economic issues but also includes discussions on international security and human rights. Ministerial Meetings throughout the year precede the Leaders' Meeting, covering various topics such as trade, finance, and environment. The annual APEC Leaders' Meeting is attended by heads of state, excluding Taiwan, and major decisions are made at this meeting. Ministerial Meetings precede the Leaders' Meeting and make recommendations, with the Senior Officials coordinating activities within APEC. The APEC Business Advisory Council provides advice on implementing the APEC agenda and specific business-related issues. APEC addresses economic issues through committees, working groups, and expert groups. The Committee on Trade and Investment is crucial for implementing the Bogor goals. APEC has ten working groups focusing on areas like trade, technology, and tourism, each led by shepherds. The APEC chair rotates annually among member countries. APEC is chaired annually by member countries such as Singapore, Japan, and the United States. Decisions are made through consensus, and actions must align with the Osaka Action Agenda. Members can delay or refrain from actions without facing sanctions. Working groups in APEC must adhere to the Osaka Action Agenda, operating at three levels: individual member actions, APEC internal actions, and collective APEC actions with other organizations. Individual Action Plans (IAPs) are submitted annually by members at the Ministerial Meeting to outline trade regime advancements towards the Bogor Goals. IAPs cover sectoral and topical areas, promoting comparability, transparency, and cooperation. APEC's internal actions involve research on trade-related topics. APEC's internal actions involve research on trade-related topics, creating working groups for collective action plans. One example is the APEC Business Travel Card, allowing fast-track entry for business travelers. In September 2007, the United States joined the ABTC scheme, offering expedited visa appointments and immigration processing. APEC focuses on advancing trade liberalization and completing the Doha Round of the WTO. Key areas include trade-distorting farm support and market access in agriculture. The key areas discussed in the APEC meetings included trade-distorting farm support, market access in agriculture, real cuts in industrial tariffs, and new openings in services trade. Concerns arose about the 2008 APEC meetings due to disinterest from some Asian members and the impact of the global financial crisis. There was speculation that some members might send alternative representatives to the Leaders' Meeting. The possibility of senior officials not attending due to economic constraints was also raised, especially with the G20 Summit taking place in Washington, DC. The 2008 APEC meetings in Lima had concerns about attendance due to the global financial crisis and the G20 Summit. Despite speculation, there was no decline in the profile of attending representatives, with President George W. Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice present. The theme chosen by Peru for the meeting was \"A New Commitment to Asia-Pacific Development,\" focusing on reducing the gap between developed and developing economies. The 20th APEC Ministerial Meeting in Lima, Peru in 2008 was attended by President George W. Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. The global financial crisis was the main focus of the meetings, as reflected in the joint statements issued. The ministers acknowledged the challenging economic conditions faced by all APEC economies. The 20th APEC Ministerial Meeting in Lima, Peru in 2008 focused on the global financial crisis. A joint statement emphasized the need for a rapid, coordinated response to the crisis and to stand against protectionist sentiments. Efforts to strengthen financial markets in Asia and discussions on regional economic integration were also key topics. The Ministerial Meeting in Lima, Peru discussed regional economic integration and progress towards an FTAAP. They highlighted the development of model measures for RTAs and FTAs to promote high-quality agreements. APEC's trade facilitation efforts, including e-trade promotion and alignment of domestic standards with international ones, were also commended. Mexico's full implementation of the ABTC program and overall progress were noted. The APEC Business Trade Card (ABTC) program implementation by Mexico was praised, along with progress by Canada and the United States. Key economic and trade issues discussed included intellectual property rights, corporate social responsibility, food safety, and security. The Leaders' Meeting in Lima on November 22 & 23, 2008, chaired by Peru's President Alan Garcia, was attended by President Bush. The U.S. delegation outlined five priorities for the APEC meetings, building on the G20 meeting in Washington. The priorities for the APEC meetings included advancing the work of the G20 meeting on the global financial crisis, deepening regional economic integration, enhancing competitiveness, addressing human security needs, and discussing energy security and climate change. The global financial crisis was the top priority, with the United States using the Leaders' Meeting to explain their decision to join the TPP. The APEC leaders released a statement on the global financial crisis after their discussions. The APEC leaders issued a statement addressing the global financial crisis, emphasizing the importance of ongoing financial sector reform and supporting the G20's action plan. They also recognized the critical role of international financial institutions in the economic recovery and pledged to refrain from raising new trade barriers for the next 12 months. Additionally, they reaffirmed their commitment to the Bogor Goals as a key principle for APEC. The APEC Leaders addressed the global financial crisis, committing to take necessary economic measures to resolve it. They also reaffirmed their commitment to APEC's Regional Economic Integration Agenda and discussed the challenges of creating a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific. The APEC leaders discussed the challenges of creating a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific, with some ambivalence over its economic benefits. They also welcomed the completion of new measures for RTAs and FTAs. President Bush held bilateral meetings with other APEC members during the 2008 meeting. During the 2008 APEC meeting, President Bush held bilateral meetings with leaders such as Hu Jintao, Taro Aso, Dmitry Medvedev, and Lee Myung-bak. President Bush expressed gratitude to Peru for hosting the meetings and discussed the U.S.-Peru FTA with President Garcia. He also met with President Hu to discuss various issues, including China's participation in the G20 meeting. Additionally, there was a notable meeting between Hu Jintao and Lien Chan from Taiwan. During the APEC meeting, President Bush met with leaders like Hu Jintao, Taro Aso, Dmitry Medvedev, and Lee Myung-bak. He discussed various issues, including China's participation in the G20 meeting and the importance of Sino-U.S. economic relations. President Bush also called on China to continue dialogue with the Dalai Lama. Prime Minister Aso praised President Bush for strengthening the alliance between their nations and both leaders agreed on the desirability of resuming the six-party talks. A bilateral meeting between Russia and the United States was held on November 22, the first between President Bush and President Medvedev since Medvedev took office in May 2008. Relations between the two nations were tense at the time due to military conflicts. During the APEC meeting, President Bush had a meeting with President Lee Myung-bak on November 22, 2008. They discussed various issues including the proposed bilateral free trade agreement, the delay in Congress, the six-party talks, and the global financial crisis. President Lee did not provide any indication on when the Korean parliament would take up the proposed trade pact. President Hu and Chairman Lien also met during the APEC Leaders' Meeting on November 21, 2008. During the APEC Leaders' Meeting on November 21, 2008, President Hu and Chairman Lien met for the first time at an APEC event, signaling improved bilateral relations. They discussed building on four agreements signed between ARATS and SEF, aiming to foster peaceful development and cooperation. The global financial crisis overshadowed the official theme of the 2008 APEC meetings in Lima, with focus shifting to the impending milestone for the Bogor Goals in 2010. The APEC members pledged in 1994 to achieve free and open trade by 2010. Japan and the United States have different perspectives on APEC's future orientation. Singapore hosted the 2009 meetings with the theme \"Sustaining Growth, Connecting the Region.\" The relevance of APEC for future meetings is a key issue. The premier issue facing future APEC meetings is its relevance for creating an open trade and investment association in the region. The TPP may supplant APEC as a vehicle for liberalization, with the United States finding TPP's administrative process easier to understand. Another top priority for APEC is addressing the ongoing effects of the global financial crisis. The International Monetary Fund predicts a global economic decline of 0.5-1.0% in 2009, with a gradual recovery in 2010. During the APEC meetings in Singapore in November 2009, the global economy may still be in a recession. APEC could serve as a platform to discuss coordinated responses to economic issues in Asia. One concern for the 2009 meetings is Singapore's plan to tighten restrictions on assembly rights for security reasons. The proposed legislation in Singapore would give police the authority to order people to leave public areas if they believe a law will be broken and require permits for \"cause-related\" outdoor activities. Opposition politicians and activists have criticized the legislation. APEC aims to promote international trade through liberalization and facilitation, with members reducing trade restrictions since 1989. The question remains whether this has led to increased foreign trade among APEC members. Since 1989, APEC members have reduced trade restrictions to promote international trade. A corresponding rise in APEC members' foreign trade has been observed, with noticeable downturns in 1998 and 2001 due to the Asia financial crisis and the attacks on the World Trade Center. Import statistics show a similar pattern to exports, with APEC's import growth rate increasing significantly since 1981. Since 1981, APEC's imports have grown faster than world imports, with a notable decline in 1997 due to the Asian financial crisis. Import levels recovered in 1999 and 2000 but dropped again after the September 11 attacks. Import growth accelerated from 2003 onwards, with APEC outpacing global import growth rates. While APEC's trade growth appears to support international trade promotion, the results are inconclusive. APEC's trade growth may be attributed to its higher economic growth rate compared to the global average, potentially driven by changes in the global supply chain. The production of consumer goods is increasingly decentralized, with major retailers and multinational corporations sourcing products from manufacturers worldwide. This decentralized production process involves subcontracting to companies in different countries, contributing to the higher trade growth among APEC members. The multinational supply chain networks among Asian APEC members involve the production of consumer goods through decentralized processes, with parts sourced from various countries and final assembly often in China. These supply chains are initiated by orders from major retailers or brand distributors from the US, Europe, or Japan, leading to significant international trade flows exceeding the value of the final goods produced. The multinational supply chain networks among Asian APEC members involve decentralized production processes with parts sourced from various countries and final assembly often in China. Concerns arise about possible trade diversion within APEC due to the growth of intra-APEC trade, potentially stemming from lower trade barriers and preferential bilateral agreements among members. The decline in orders from Europe, Japan, and the United States could impact APEC members' trade and economic growth. The global financial crisis has led to a decline in orders from Europe, Japan, and the United States, impacting the network of trade in intermediate goods associated with Asian supply chains. APEC has been viewed as a potential vehicle for liberalizing regional and global trade, with efforts to promote trade and investment liberalization through coalition-building in WTO negotiations. The APEC Geneva Caucus has been cited as an example of APEC's positive influence on trade liberalization within the WTO. The growth of Asia-Pacific bilateral trade agreements (BTAs) has led to a competitive form of liberalization, with complex trade diplomacy and varying models of FTAs. Experts warn that the unsystematic proliferation of BTAs among APEC members could eventually result in the formation of an APEC-wide regional trade agreement (RTA) like the proposed FTAAP. The unsystematic proliferation of Asia-Pacific bilateral trade agreements (BTAs) among APEC members could lead to the formation of a regional trade agreement (RTA) like the proposed FTAAP. However, some experts believe that the growing number of BTAs may hinder trade and investment liberalization due to fragmented, uncoordinated, and economically motivated agreements with issues such as WTO-incompatibility, narrow sector focus, and discriminatory rules of origin. The unpredictable outcomes of foreign policy-driven FTA negotiations often result in quick-fix sectoral deals, with politically sensitive sectors being excluded. Progress in addressing domestic regulatory barriers is limited, and power dynamics can lead to asymmetrical agreements, especially with major players. Concerns exist that merging various BTAs into an Asia-Pacific RTA could institutionalize trade barriers. Some argue that the increasing number of BTAs in the region is hindering trade liberalization efforts. The rising number of BTAs in the region is hindering the formation of a FTAAP and progress in the Doha Round, despite APEC's efforts. Scholars are skeptical about APEC's potential contribution to regional economic integration, citing challenges in harmonizing heterogeneous bilateral FTAs. Some believe the stalled Doha Round is leading to further disintegration of the global trading system. The stalled Doha Round is fueling the rise of BTAs and the potential creation of a discriminatory East Asia Free Trade Area (EAFTA). To counteract this, experts suggest APEC should advocate for a more inclusive FTAAP. This could help limit the growth of BTAs in Asia and ensure any new agreements are WTO-compatible. Supporters of APEC see the organization playing four key roles in advancing regional trade: organizing meetings of trade and finance ministers, reinforcing free trade goals, developing measures for trade agreements, and promoting WTO-plus FTAs. Initially focused on economics, APEC avoided political issues to prevent divisions among members like China, Japan, Russia, Taiwan, and the United States. In 1995, the issue of expanding APEC to include regional security discussions was raised, but consensus was to address security in other forums. However, since 2001, security has been on the Leaders' Meeting agenda, with a focus on terrorism, disease, and human security. The October 2001 meeting in Shanghai was overshadowed by the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks, leading to APEC's first joint statement condemning the attacks. APEC's focus on human security includes addressing terrorism, disease, and disasters. Concerns about terrorism among members include domestic extremists, international terrorist networks like Al Qaeda using financial institutions in the region, restricting movement of suspected terrorists, and ensuring trade security. APEC established the Counter-Terrorism Task Force in 2002 to oversee efforts in combating terrorism. The Counter-Terrorism Task Force (CTTF) was established by APEC in 2002 to address counter-terrorism needs, coordinate capacity building programs, and enhance trade security. In 2007, a study group was set up to develop a plan for trade recovery after a terrorist event. Each APEC member has a Counter-Terrorism Action Plan (CTAP) in addition to the CTTF's efforts. The STAR Initiative focuses on enhancing security and efficiency in the APEC region's seaports and airports. The STAR Conference in Lima in 2008 focused on enhancing security and safety in APEC region's access points. APEC established the Health Task Force in 2003 to address emerging infectious diseases like SARS and avian influenza. In 2004, APEC responded to outbreaks of avian influenza H5N1 and SARS. The Health Task Force was transformed into the Health Working Group in 2008, focusing on exchanging medical information, rapid response programs, and sharing best practices for disease containment. APEC also addresses the threat of HIV/AIDS through information exchange and prevention programs. APEC's Health Working Group focuses on exchanging medical information, rapid response programs, and sharing best practices for disease containment. APEC also addresses the threat of HIV/AIDS through prevention programs. APEC established a Task Force for Emergency Preparedness in response to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, aiming to improve natural disaster response and preparedness. The Task Force for Emergency Preparedness (TFEP) within APEC has conducted seminars and training sessions to enhance seismic monitoring systems, disaster response infrastructure, and public education on natural disasters. APEC members are increasing funding for warning systems, with Congress passing the \"Tsunami Warning and Education Act\" to improve the Pacific Tsunami Warning System. This act authorizes $25 million in FY2008, with incremental funding increases until FY2012. APEC is recognized as the primary regional institution in the Asia-Pacific for promoting open trade. APEC is the primary regional institution in the Asia-Pacific for promoting open trade and economic cooperation. Congressional interest in APEC focuses on financial support and oversight of U.S. participation. The U.S. provides $900,000 per year in direct financial support for APEC, with additional funding for preparation work. The National Defense Authorization Act of 1996 allowed non-communist APEC member nations to participate in a loan guarantee program for defense articles. Congress recognized opportunities for fairer trade in agricultural products through negotiations with the World Trade Organization and free trade agreements with APEC and the Americas. The United States should utilize opportunities in economic and regional fora like APEC to promote fair trade in agricultural products. Congress emphasizes the need for comprehensive strategies to address China's emergence economically, diplomatically, and militarily, promote trade relations, and encourage adherence to international norms. The United States should utilize opportunities in economic and regional fora like APEC to promote fair trade in agricultural products and encourage China's adherence to international norms in trade, security, and human rights. The 111th Congress may address issues related to APEC, including U.S. financial support, policy expressions, oversight of U.S. participation, and the 2011 APEC meetings in the United States. During the 111th Congress, a Senate resolution (S.Res. 76) expressed the need for the US and China to reduce trade barriers in clean energy through APEC and the WTO. In the 110th Congress, a proposed bill (H.R. 3272) aimed to allocate funds for a new consulate in China. During the 110th Congress, a proposed bill aimed to allocate funds for a new consulate in China, additional personnel for the U.S. diplomatic mission, Chinese language programs, and rule of law initiatives. Patricia M. Haslach was confirmed as the U.S. Senior Coordinator for APEC. The U.S.-Australia Defense Trade Cooperation Treaty signed during APEC meetings awaits Senate approval. The issue of U.S. financial support for APEC remains a concern. The U.S. Congress may need to address the level of financial support for APEC, with potential considerations for setting funding levels and expressing preferences for the agenda of upcoming meetings. Past Congresses have recognized APEC's role in promoting free trade. Additional funding beyond the $2.3 million already appropriated for the 2011 meetings may be necessary. Negotiations under APEC may raise issues related to labor rights and environmental protection, as well as the U.S. response to violations of standards. The U.S. entering into TPP negotiations has raised questions about its commitment to APEC and the FTAAP. Membership in TPP aligns with APEC's goal of forming a FTAAP, with TPP seen as a short-term objective and FTAAP as a long-term goal. The APEC-based FTAAP is a long-term goal, but negotiations with existing TPP members may divert attention from APEC. The completion of the Doha Round was a trade priority for the Bush Administration, and it is uncertain if it will be a high priority for the Obama Administration. Congress may also address human security issues related to U.S. involvement in APEC, such as concerns about the APEC Business Travel Card and potential influenza pandemics. The pandemic may increase support for APEC's Health Working Group. APEC is a key forum for US engagement in the Asia-Pacific region, where China's rise poses a challenge to US leadership. Experts suggest APEC could help advance US interests in Asia amidst China's growing influence. Many argue for increased U.S. involvement in Asian trade through APEC to assert leadership, advocating for financial assistance and policy changes. Others suggest APEC should focus on trade facilitation, reform its mission, and strengthen the Secretariat. APEC's annual Leaders' Meeting provides prestige and opportunities for interaction. Taiwan and Hong Kong are included as member economies. The table summarizes past APEC Meetings. For more details, visit http://www.apec.org/."
