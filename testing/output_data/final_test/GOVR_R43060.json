    "content": "In the 113th Congress, former House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp introduced the Tax Reform Act of 2014 (H.R. 1). Tax reform remained a key issue in the 114th Congress, with bipartisan working groups evaluating options and committees holding hearings. Policy options include base-broadening reform with reduced rates or a complete overhaul of the current tax system. Tax reform legislation in the 114th Congress has focused on alternative tax bases, such as taxing consumption instead of income. Options include a federal retail sales tax or a flat tax, which can be revenue-neutral or change the revenue outlook. Congress may also consider targeted tax changes for individuals or businesses, in addition to comprehensive reform efforts. Tax reform aims to enhance economic efficiency, equity, and simplicity in the tax system. Balancing these objectives involves trade-offs, such as base-broadening to raise additional tax revenue. Policymakers face challenges in implementing tax reform, which can be achieved by modifying the existing income tax system or changing the source of tax revenue. In tax reform, base-broadening can increase tax revenues to reduce rates or the deficit. Debate focuses on revenue-neutral reform with lower individual and corporate income rates. Dynamic scoring may be used to evaluate tax proposals. Concerns exist about the cost of tax expenditures like mortgage interest deductions. The tax reform debate involves evaluating tax expenditures like mortgage interest deductions and property tax deductions on owner-occupied residences. Congress considers whether the benefits of these expenditures outweigh the costs. Reforms aim to broaden the tax base by scaling back or eliminating tax expenditures to lower rates, reduce the deficit, or a combination of both. Previous tax reform proposals have included repealing or reforming major tax expenditures to fund reduced tax rates.

Reforms aim to broaden the tax base by scaling back or eliminating tax expenditures to lower rates, reduce the deficit, or a combination of both. Previous tax reform proposals have included repealing or reforming major tax expenditures to fund reduced tax rates, with a focus on individual and corporate tax differences in potential revenue generation. The potential revenue gain from individual tax expenditures is significant, with many popular provisions making base-broadening challenging. The tax reform debate involves evaluating tax expenditures like mortgage interest deductions and property tax deductions on owner-occupied residences. Congress considers whether the benefits of these expenditures outweigh the costs. Reforms aim to broaden the tax base by scaling back or eliminating tax expenditures to lower rates, reduce the deficit, or a combination of both. Retaining key tax credits and benefits could reduce individual income tax rates by 4%, with potential base-broadening provisions outside of tax expenditures like taxing large pass-through entities or restricting interest deductions. Corporate tax expenditures are relatively small, allowing for a reduction in the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to roughly 28% to 29%. Enacting base-broadening reforms could lower the corporate tax rate below what eliminating tax expenditures alone could achieve. There is a focus on the tax treatment of foreign source income of multinationals, with proposals to either eliminate U.S. taxation on foreign income or increase taxation through limiting deferral. Increasing taxation on foreign-source income would broaden the tax base. Increasing the amount of foreign-source income subject to tax would broaden the tax base and has been a factor in lowering the corporate tax rate. Corporate tax reform, business tax reform, or individual tax reform in isolation would be challenging due to the interconnected nature of the corporate and individual tax systems. The Tax Reform Act of 2014 proposed reducing individual income tax brackets to 10% and 25%, with a top rate of 35%, and reducing corporate tax rates to 25% phased in over time. The Tax Reform Act of 2014 proposed reducing individual income tax brackets to 10% and 25%, with a top rate of 35%, and reducing corporate tax rates to 25% phased in over time. Alternative revenue options may be sought to fill the gap if base-broadening does not fully finance desired rate reductions. Congress may seek alternative revenue sources to reduce the budget deficit and national debt, such as an add-on tax or a consumption tax base. Several options for imposing a broad-based consumption tax include a value-added tax (VAT), a retail sales tax, and a flat tax. The VAT is collected at each stage of production, while the retail sales tax is levied only at the retail stage. Both taxes have the potential for a robust revenue yield. Another option is to implement a flat tax for a broad-based consumption tax. A flat tax proposal, like the Hall-Rabushka flat tax, consists of a wage tax and a cash-flow tax on businesses. It is a modified VAT with wages and pensions subtracted from the tax base. Other potential revenue sources include environmental taxes, like a carbon tax on carbon emissions. A carbon tax could be imposed on carbon emissions, along with higher gasoline taxes. Taxes on the financial sector could include a securities transaction tax or taxes on systemically important financial institutions. The Tax Reform Act of 2014 suggested an excise tax on the assets of these institutions exceeding $500 billion. When evaluating tax policy changes, considerations include equity, efficiency, and simplicity, with potential tradeoffs between these objectives. Economic theory suggests that making interpersonal utility comparisons is not feasible, making judgments on income distribution changes a matter of value. The distribution of tax burdens is evaluated based on horizontal and vertical equity. Horizontal equity states that taxpayers with similar incomes should face similar tax burdens, while vertical equity examines the distribution of tax burdens across different income groups. The fairness of tax preferences and deductions is often debated in relation to these concepts. The fairness of tax policy is evaluated based on vertical equity, which looks at the distribution of tax burdens across different income groups. Policy questions include whether taxation should be proportional or progressive based on ability to pay, and if tax reform should aim to be distributionally neutral. Other considerations involve the impact on taxpayers in different age groups and regions. Tax policy should promote economic efficiency by minimizing distortions with low marginal tax rates and broad-based taxes. Efficiency questions focus on household decisions regarding savings and labor choices, which can impact economic growth. Tax policy should aim for simplicity to reduce administrative and compliance costs, which can help minimize the tax gap. It should eliminate unnecessary complexity and promote transparency to ensure efficiency in decision-making for households and firms. Tax reform options are actively debated in Congress, with potential changes to administrative costs for state and local governments, compliance costs for households, and business compliance costs. Various forms of tax reform are being considered, including comprehensive reform or targeting specific sectors of the economy. Legislation has been proposed to make temporary tax provisions permanent, with some already enacted in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016. The Ways and Means Committee in the 114th Congress held tax reform hearings and created tax reform working groups to provide recommendations in five areas. Stakeholder input was sought to simplify, make fairer, and more efficient the tax code. Working groups' reports were released in July 2015, and hearings on tax reform were held. As of the date of this report, comprehensive tax reform legislation has not been introduced in the 114th Congress. The Tax Reform Act of 2014 (H.R. 1) was introduced in the 113th Congress. Base-broadening and reducing tax rates are believed to promote economic growth, but the impact depends on changes in effective marginal tax rates. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) conducted a macroeconomic analysis of the Tax Reform Act of 2014. The JCT's analysis of the Tax Reform Act of 2014 found that it would reduce effective marginal tax rates on labor, increase after-tax income, and stimulate the economy. However, base-broadening provisions would lead to higher effective tax rates on some capital investments, reducing domestic firms' investment in capital stock. Overall, the JCT estimated that the Act would increase economic output. Several proposals to replace the income tax system have been introduced in the 114th Congress, including the Fair Tax Act of 2015, the Flat Tax Act, and the SMART Act. These proposals aim to replace the current income tax system with a national retail sales tax or a flat tax system similar to the Hall-Rabushka proposal. Additionally, the American Business Competitiveness Act suggests replacing the corporate income tax with a cash flow tax on business income, with a top rate of 25% and repealing most business tax credits and deductions. The proposal aims to repeal business tax credits and deductions, as well as the current system of depreciation. Businesses would expense capital purchases, interest would no longer be deductible, and net operating losses could be carried back five years. The alternative minimum tax for business income would be repealed, and a territorial system for taxing overseas income would be implemented. A cash flow tax, similar to a flat tax, is proposed for increased economic efficiency. A flat tax (or consumption tax) system is often seen as a way to increase economic efficiency by imposing taxes on a broad definition of income with limited deductions. This can lead to additional capital accumulation and investment. However, it may be less progressive than the current tax system, resulting in reduced equity as higher-income groups see their tax burdens decline. A flat tax system aims to increase economic efficiency by taxing a broad definition of income with limited deductions, potentially leading to more capital accumulation and investment. However, it may reduce equity as higher-income groups see tax burdens decrease while lower-income groups face increased taxes. Simplifying the tax system by imposing one tax rate and eliminating deductions could also contribute to tax simplicity. The flat tax system proposed in H.R. 1040 could create complexity for taxpayers deciding between flat tax treatment and the current income tax system. Horizontal inequities may arise, with taxpayers facing different tax liabilities despite identical incomes. Reduced tax rates, especially for corporations, could bring economic benefits, but revenue implications must be considered. The Joint Committee on Taxation has not released revenue estimates for the tax reform proposals. If a reform leads to increased deficits financed by government debt, higher interest rates could offset economic benefits. Legislation in the 114th Congress addresses these tax reform issues. The Tax Code Termination Act (H.R. 27) introduced in the 114th Congress aims to eliminate the current tax code and create a new, simple, and fair tax system. It includes provisions such as applying a low rate to all Americans, providing tax relief for working Americans, protecting taxpayers' rights, promoting economic growth, and not penalizing marriage or families. The House and Senate have not yet agreed on a budget resolution for FY2017, but a resolution was reached for FY2016 (S.Con.Res. 11) which includes enforceable revenue levels. The budget resolution S.Con.Res. 11 for FY2016 includes enforceable revenue levels and supports congressional action on tax reform with a deficit-neutral reserve fund in the Senate. Reserve funds allow adjustments to budget allocations for future legislation related to tax reform. The budget resolution S.Con.Res. 11 for FY2016 includes support for tax reform in the House, with policy statements expressing the need for fundamental tax reform to stimulate economic growth and job creation. The resolution also includes reconciliation instructions to key committees, such as the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee, to initiate the reconciliation process for tax reform. During the reconciliation process, individual committees develop legislation to achieve budgetary goals. The Senate Finance Committee or House Ways and Means Committee may include tax policy changes in their reconciliation legislation. The President's FY2017 budget proposal includes nearly 150 revenue proposals, with many similar to previous budget proposals. The President's FY2017 budget includes nearly 150 revenue proposals, divided into two categories: business tax system reforms and international tax system reforms. Key proposals include a 19% minimum tax on foreign earnings and a 14% one-time tax on previously untaxed foreign income. Additionally, there are plans to eliminate fossil fuel tax preferences and close perceived loopholes. The President's FY2017 budget includes revenue proposals to raise $299.4 billion, with $38.2 billion from eliminating fossil fuel tax incentives, $34.7 billion from tax treatment reform for financial products, and $153.1 billion from closing loopholes. Some of this revenue would fund incentives for research, manufacturing, clean energy, small businesses, and infrastructure. Manufacturing, research, and clean energy incentives are estimated to cost $89 billion over 10 years, with the largest item being the renewable electricity production tax credit at $24.1 billion. Small business tax relief proposals are estimated at $47.5 billion between 2017 and 2026. The President's FY2017 budget includes tax proposals affecting various groups, with the least expensive incentives for increased infrastructure investment costing $9.3 billion over 10 years. Other costly proposals include a new second-earner tax credit, expansion of the EITC, education tax incentives, and child care tax incentives, totaling billions between 2017 and 2026. The President's FY2017 budget includes tax proposals affecting various groups, with costly provisions such as capping tax expenditures, imposing fees on crude oil and financial institutions, increasing capital gains rate, setting estate and gift tax parameters, raising tobacco taxes, and implementing a \"Buffett Rule\" or \"Fair Share Tax\", totaling billions between 2017 and 2026. The President's FY2016 budget proposed tax changes following previous budgets, using an adjusted baseline assuming certain tax credit expansions would be made permanent. The tax proposals were divided into two groups, with the first group aimed at revenue-neutral business tax reform, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 28%. The President's FY2016 budget proposed a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 28%, with an effective rate of 25% for manufacturing. It also included a one-time $268 billion allowance for transportation infrastructure spending, funded through unspecified revenues from a reformed business tax system. Additionally, the budget proposed incentives for research, manufacturing, clean energy, and small businesses, including modifications to the research and experimentation tax credit and the extension of increased expensing allowances for small businesses. These proposals were later made permanent in P.L. 114-113. The President's business tax reform in the FY2016 budget included revenue-raising provisions such as changes in tax treatment of derivatives and insurance products, repeal of tax incentives for fossil fuels, and reforms to the U.S. international tax system. These changes aimed to generate $238.3 billion between 2016 and 2025. Overall, the reform would create a reserve of $141.5 billion for revenue-neutral tax reform. The FY2016 budget included revenue proposals for tax reform, such as incentives for manufacturing, clean energy, infrastructure, and expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit. The most costly proposal was a new second-earner tax credit for working couples. Overall, the revenue proposals not related to baseline adjustments would have raised $1.5 trillion between 2016 and 2025, with the most significant revenue generators being capping tax expenditures at 28% and imposing a one-time tax on untaxed overseas earnings. In the 113th Congress, major tax reform proposals were introduced, including a one-time tax on untaxed overseas earnings, increasing the maximum capital gains rate, setting estate and gift tax parameters at 2009 levels, imposing a fee on certain financial institutions, increasing tobacco taxes, and implementing a \"Buffett Rule\" or \"Fair Share Tax.\" The House Committee on Ways and Means also worked towards comprehensive tax reform, with Chairman Camp releasing a draft Tax Reform Act of 2014 to broaden the tax base and restructure statutory regulations. The Tax Reform Act of 2014 proposed broadening the tax base, restructuring tax rates, changing the treatment of foreign-source income for U.S. multinational corporations, and making various other changes to the federal tax system. It built on earlier discussion drafts released by Chairman Camp during the 112th Congress, including proposals for international tax reform. The Tax Reform Act of 2014 proposed a 5.25% tax on undistributed foreign earnings, with higher rates for cash and intangibles. It also suggested marking derivatives to market at year-end for tax purposes. The Act did not include broader reform options for small businesses. The Tax Reform Act of 2014 proposed changes to pass-through and partnership tax rules, including taxing carried interest as ordinary income and restricting publicly traded partnerships. Former Chairman Max Baucus released discussion drafts on international tax reform, tax administration, cost recovery, and energy tax policy. The Baucus discussion draft proposes taxing foreign-earned income at 80% of the U.S. statutory rate or taxing 60% of foreign active business income at the U.S. rate. Undistributed foreign earnings would be subject to a one-time tax at a rate of 20%. Reforms include eliminating the MACRS system and implementing asset pools with longer lives for depreciation. The Tax Reform Act of 2014 proposes capitalizing intangibles like research and advertising expenses, repealing LIFO inventory rules, and increasing small-business expensing allowances. Former Chairman Baucus's discussion draft includes proposals for tax administration and energy tax reform, aiming to reduce the tax gap and provide clean energy production and investment tax credits. The Tax Reform Act of 2014 (H.R. 1) includes new tax credits for clean transportation fuels and proposes phasing out credits once greenhouse gas emissions fall below a certain threshold. The Family Fairness and Opportunity Tax Reform Act (S. 1616) in the 113th Congress suggested consolidating tax brackets, repealing the alternative minimum tax, and providing additional child and personal credits. Several proposals in the 113th Congress aimed to reform the tax system, including the elimination of standard deductions and most itemized deductions. The Fair Tax Act of 2013 (H.R. 25 / S. 122) proposed replacing income taxes with a national retail sales tax, shifting from taxing income to taxing consumption. The Flat Tax Act (H.R. 1040) and SMART Act (S. 173) proposed a flat tax rate of 19% for the first two years and 17% thereafter on individuals' wages and business taxable income. The American Growth & Tax Reform Act of 2013 (H.R. 2393) would have required a legislative proposal for a progressive consumption tax. The Progressive Consumption Tax Act of 2014 (S. 3005) proposed a 10% consumption tax on goods and services, reducing individual and corporate income tax rates to a maximum of 28% and 17% respectively. It aimed to broaden the income tax base and eliminate certain tax expenditures. The legislation introduced in the 113th Congress aimed to eliminate the existing tax code and replace it with a new, simple, and fair tax system. The Tax Code Termination Act (H.R. 352) would have terminated the Internal Revenue Code, while the End Wasteful Tax Loopholes Act (S. 8) proposed eliminating wasteful tax loopholes and corporate tax breaks. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 aims to reform the tax code by eliminating wasteful tax loopholes, enhancing tax fairness, cracking down on tax cheaters, and promoting job creation and economic growth. The legislation includes deficit-neutral tax reform-related reserve funds for Senate budget enforcement. The House-passed budget resolutions recommend significant changes in tax law, aiming for revenue-neutral comprehensive tax reform. The House resolution seeks to simplify the tax code, reduce compliance burdens, lower tax rates for individuals, and consolidate tax brackets. The House-passed budget resolutions aim for revenue-neutral comprehensive tax reform, including a top individual rate of 25%, consolidating tax brackets, repealing the Alternative Minimum Tax, reducing the corporate tax rate to 25%, and transitioning to a more competitive international taxation system. H.Con.Res. 25 required tax reform to be reported by the Committee on Ways and Means by December 31, 2013, for enactment in FY2014. The Senate budget resolution (S.Con.Res. 8) passed on March 23, 2013, also addressed revenue legislation. The Senate Committee on Finance was to report revenue legislation on October 1, 2013, aiming to raise $975 billion by 2023 through tax increases on the wealthy and corporations. The President's FY2015 budget proposed changes to tax policy for economic growth and competitiveness. The President's FY2015 budget proposed tax reforms including incentives for research, manufacturing, clean energy, and small businesses. It also allocated $150 billion for transportation infrastructure, to be funded through a reformed business tax system. The President's FY2015 budget proposed tax reforms including incentives for research, manufacturing, clean energy, and small businesses. The proposed modifications and extensions of tax credits would cost $108.1 billion between 2015 and 2024. Revenue-raising provisions included changes to the U.S. international tax system, derivatives, insurance products, and repeal of certain tax incentives for fossil fuels. These changes would generate $248.3 billion for revenue-neutral tax reform. The revenue proposals in the budget included provisions for manufacturing, clean energy, infrastructure incentives, EITC expansion, and individual-level tax incentives. The most costly proposal was the EITC expansion at $59.7 billion between 2015 and 2024. Overall, revenue proposals related to baseline adjustments or revenue-neutral business tax reform would have raised $1,048.1 billion between 2015 and 2024. Key revenue-generating provisions included a 28% cap on tax expenditures, estate and gift tax adjustments, increased tobacco taxes, FUTA wage base expansion, a financial crisis responsibility fee, and a \"Buffett Rule\" or \"Fair Share Tax.\" Tax reform remains a key focus in the 114th Congress, with discussions on comprehensive tax reform that addresses individual and corporate income tax systems. There is also consideration for international or business-only reforms. The debate includes whether the federal tax system should continue relying on income as the primary revenue source. Several proposals have been introduced, but the feasibility and policy objectives of these reforms are still uncertain. Several tax reform proposals in the 114th Congress aim to shift the tax system from taxing income to taxing consumption."
