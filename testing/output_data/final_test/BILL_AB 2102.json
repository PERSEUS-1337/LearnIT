    "title": "AB 2102",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Controller, in consultation with the California Gambling Control Commission, will divide the County Tribal Casino Account into Individual Tribal Casino Accounts for each tribe operating a casino in the county. Funds from these accounts will be used to make grants to local jurisdictions impacted by tribal casinos, based on each tribe's contributions to the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund in the prior fiscal year. The Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee in each county where Indian gaming is conducted selects grants from Individual Tribal Casino Accounts or County Tribal Casino Accounts based on established priorities and requirements. The committee is responsible for establishing grant application policies, assessing eligibility, and ensuring grants mitigate the impact of the casino on the applicant. The Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee determines reimbursement for county administrative costs from the aggregate county tribal account, capped at 2 percent per fiscal year. The committee is composed of seven representatives, including two selected by the county board of supervisors. Three elected representatives from cities near a tribal casino in the county are selected by the county board of supervisors. If no cities are within four miles of a tribal casino, other local representatives may be chosen by mutual agreement between the county board of supervisors and the tribes contributing to the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund. If only one city is near a tribal casino located in the unincorporated area, specific selection criteria apply. If a tribal casino is located entirely within the unincorporated area of a county, only one elected representative from the nearest city will be included on the Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee. The Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee selects two representatives recommended by tribes paying into the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund in each county. If no tribes contribute to the fund in a county, representatives may be chosen from tribes operating casinos in that county. The committee must adopt a Conflict of Interest Code in compliance with Article 3 of Chapter 7 of Title 9. Sixty percent of the Individual Tribal Casino Account is allocated for yearly nexus grants to cities and counties impacted by contributing tribes. Grants are selected based on a nexus test using geographical proximity to tribal casinos. Grant awards are administered by each county's Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee. Grants may be awarded on a multiyear basis and are prioritized based on the proximity of local government jurisdictions to tribal lands. The allocation of funds from the Individual Tribal Casino Account for yearly nexus grants to local government jurisdictions is based on a nexus test involving proximity to tribal casinos. Grants are prioritized based on specific criteria, including bordering Indian lands, access routes to casinos, and distance from casinos. Fifty percent of the funds are awarded to jurisdictions meeting all criteria, while the remaining funds are distributed to those meeting other requirements. Twenty percent of the funds from the Individual Tribal Casino Account will be awarded to local government jurisdictions meeting two nexus test criteria, with the remaining funds going to jurisdictions meeting other requirements. If no eligible jurisdiction meets the criteria, the funds will be distributed to other qualifying jurisdictions. Twenty percent of the Individual Tribal Casino Account funds will be used for discretionary grants to local jurisdictions impacted by tribes contributing to the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund. Grant awards will be determined by each county's Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee and administered by the county, available to all local jurisdictions in the county regardless of specific tribal casino impacts. Grants may be awarded on a multiyear basis and accounted for annually. Twenty percent of the Individual Tribal Casino Account will be allocated for discretionary grants to local jurisdictions impacted by tribes not contributing to the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund. Grant awards will be chosen by each county's Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee and managed by the county, available to all local jurisdictions in the county regardless of specific tribal casino impacts. Multiyear grants may be awarded and accounted for annually. Grants awarded under this subdivision are limited to addressing service-oriented impacts and assisting with one-time large capital projects related to Indian gaming impacts. The grants are subject to the sponsorship of the tribe paying into the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund and recommendations of the Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee. If an eligible county lacks a tribal casino paying into the fund, discretionary grants will be distributed according to subdivision (d). Funds from County Tribal Casino Account may be released for grants to local jurisdictions impacted by tribal casinos, regardless of specific casino affiliation. Unallocated funds revert to Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund annually. Grants focus on service impacts and capital projects related to Indian gaming, with input from sponsoring tribe and Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee. The priorities for grant moneys from Individual Tribal Casino Accounts include law enforcement, fire services, emergency medical services, environmental impacts, water supplies, waste disposal, behavioral health, planning, public health, roads, recreation, youth programs, and child care programs. The Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee selects grants to mitigate casino impacts on local jurisdictions. Grants must be used for approved purposes, or funds revert to the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund. Grants finance only the proportionate share of expenditures that mitigate casino impacts. All grants from Individual Tribal Casino Accounts require tribal sponsorship and must have a reasonable relationship to casino impact. Grants cannot support opposition to Indian gaming and will be terminated if used for prohibited purposes. Unused funds will be reallocated for qualified nexus grants. Local government jurisdictions receiving grants from Individual Tribal Casino Accounts must notify the public of funding source. County Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committees approve projects for funding, with funds reverting back to the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund if not allocated by the end of the fiscal year. Moneys allocated for fiscal years 2003\u201304 and 2008\u201309 must be spent by December 31 of the following year. Local government jurisdictions receiving grants from Individual Tribal Casino Accounts must deposit funds in an interest-bearing account for mitigating casino impacts. Any misuse of funds will result in reverting the remaining portion to the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund. Compliance with fund usage must be demonstrated to the county to receive further funds. The Legislature intends to enact legislation related to tribal gaming in California. If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act imposes state-mandated costs, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts will be provided according to the Government Code."
