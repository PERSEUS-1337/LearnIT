    "content": "The trade-off between quantization noise and clipping distortion in low precision networks is analyzed. By optimizing expressions for mean-square-error degradation due to clipping, significant improvements over standard quantization schemes are achieved. Accurate clipping values can lead to over 40% accuracy improvement in quantizing VGG-16 to 4-bits precision. These results have broad applications for neural network quantization in both training and inference. A drawback of deep learning models is their high computational costs. Low precision techniques are being studied to address this issue, with hardware support enabling more operations per second, reduced memory bandwidth, and power consumption. A low-precision scheme involves converting floating-point to integer, introducing quantization noise. This noise is linked to the dynamic range, which can be limited by clipping values in the tensor to reduce quantization noise. The curr_chunk discusses the trade-off between clipping and quantization effects in tensors to minimize information loss. It explores the distribution of values within tensors, noting a bell-curve pattern where large values are rare. This suggests that improving the resolution of common smaller values may compensate for information loss due to clipping, emphasizing the importance of understanding the underlying distribution of tensor elements. The distribution of tensor elements is crucial before applying clipping. Activation tensors follow Gaussian or Laplacian distributions, aiding in quantization optimization. When batch norm is applied after a convolution layer, the output is invariant to the norm of the output on the preceding layer, emphasizing the preservation of tensor directionality during quantization. Quantization preserves tensor information by minimizing quantization error power, as shown by BID0. Analytical Clipping for Integer Quantization (ACIQ) optimizes activation tensor quantization using Gaussian and Laplace priors. These results have applications for neural network quantization in training and inference. In neural network quantization, quantizing weights and activations to 8-bit fixed point representation has minimal impact on model accuracy. However, further reduction of precision can degrade performance, necessitating an optimal clipping scheme to minimize information loss. Exploiting activation tensor statistics can complement other quantization techniques and be easily implemented by adjusting clipping values analytically. This approach demonstrates applicability in quantizing pre-trained networks efficiently. In neural network quantization, reducing precision of weights and activations to 8-bit and 4-bit respectively without re-training is a challenge. Prior methods show accuracy degradation, with some requiring additional re-training which may not be practical in all scenarios. ACIQ is compared against traditional clipping and iterative methods to address this issue. The Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) measure is used to determine a good clipping threshold in neural network quantization. ACIQ outperforms KLD in terms of validation accuracy, with ACIQ and gemmlowp being faster non-iterative methods. KLD is time-consuming as it requires 4000 passes for evaluation. The methods introduced in this work can be beneficial for training in low precision settings without significant loss. Recent research has shown that quantizing neural networks to 8-bit precision can maintain accuracy without re-training. However, reducing precision below 8-bits often leads to significant accuracy loss. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, such as training with quantization constraints or modifying network structure. Some recent work has successfully quantized weights and activations to 4-bits, but it requires a lengthy training time. Concepts like per-channel scale and non-uniform quantization have also been explored to enable quantization below 8-bits. Recently, there have been various methods proposed to optimize activation clipping parameters during training. In contrast to previous works, a new method is introduced to find the optimal clipping threshold analytically by minimizing MSE error from the tensor distribution. This method considers both target precision and tensor statistics, proving analytically its effectiveness in minimizing MSE error. The approach is demonstrated on several Imagenet topologies. In this section, an estimate of the underlying probability density function of activation tensors is constructed to optimize activation clipping parameters. The goal is to reduce quantization noise and increase resolution by finding the best clipping value that balances low clipping rate and improved resolution. This method considers the bell-shaped distributions of activation tensors and aims to minimize MSE error from the tensor distribution. In this section, the data distribution of activation tensors is analyzed to optimize clipping values for improved resolution. The best fit is found to be Laplace and Normal distributions, as shown in the normalized distributions plot for Resnet50. The goal is to establish optimal clipping values under Gaussian or Laplace distributions to reduce quantization noise and enhance resolution. The optimal clipping values are derived for Gaussian or Laplace distributions to reduce quantization noise and enhance resolution in activation tensors. The expected MSE is calculated as a function of clipping value, leading to specific expressions for each distribution. Optimal clipping values are determined by solving equations where the derivative with respect to clipping value is set to zero. The text discusses the suboptimal choice of clipping value \u03b1 for quantization in tensors and proposes a model where values are clipped to reduce noise. The quantization step \u2206 is determined by partitioning the range [\u03b1, -\u03b1] into equal regions. Values are rounded to the midpoint of each region, and the expected mean-square-error between the original and quantized tensors is calculated. The text discusses the contribution of clip(x, \u03b1) to the expected mean-square-error for quantization in tensors. It approximates the density function f with a piecewise linear function and considers smooth probability density functions like Gaussian or Laplace. The quantization noise is approximated by Equation FORMULA4 in the appendix. Equation FORMULA4 represents the rounding error due to quantization in tensors. By assuming a uniform distribution in the range [-\u03b1, \u03b1], the analytic results align well with simulation results. Substituting a uniform density function into the equations simplifies the rounding error computation. Additionally, a closed form solution is provided for symmetrical distributions. Equation FORMULA4 represents rounding error from quantization in tensors with a uniform distribution in the range [-\u03b1, \u03b1]. A closed form solution is provided for symmetrical distributions. For Laplace distribution, Equation 6 is derived by evaluating \u03a8(x) as the correct antiderivative. The minimum MSE \u03b1 is found by setting the derivative equal to zero. For Gaussian distribution, Equation 6 is evaluated using \u03a8(x) for X \u223c N (0, \u03c3 2 ). Equation FORMULA6 can be written for the Gaussian distribution by evaluating \u03a8(x) for X \u223c N (0, \u03c3 2 ). Optimal clipping values for minimizing mean-square-error are found by differentiating E[(X \u2212 Q(X)) 2 ] with respect to \u03b1 and setting the derivative to zero. The mean-square-error is presented as a function of clipping value for various bit widths in FIG1, with theoretical derivations in Equations 9 and 12 compared against the resulting MSE. Theoretical derivations in Equations 9 and 12 are compared against MSE resulting from clipping and quantization of values generated from a Gaussian/Laplace distribution. The proposed analytical clipping method is shown to quantize neural networks aggressively without significant accuracy drop, by adjusting clipping values according to an analytical formula. The method does not require re-training and is compared against standard quantization methods. The code to replicate these experiments can be found online. The goal is to quantize activation layers to 4-bit precision without significant accuracy loss. Activation tensors are clipped before ReLU, while weight tensors remain at 8-bit precision. Expected MSE is evaluated using equations 9 and 12 to decide on quantization. Code for experiments is available online. The goal is to quantize activation layers to 4-bit precision without significant accuracy loss. Weight tensors are kept at 8-bit precision. Calculations are optimized by storing clipping values for N(0,1) and Laplace(0,1) and scaling them by estimated \u03c3 and b. Experiments on quantizing activation layers from 8 to 4 bits were conducted with batch normalization and Inception-v3 on ImageNet dataset. Results show the potential of the optimized clipping method in achieving accuracy-quantization tradeoff. Our optimized clipping method allows for quantizing layers to 4 bits with minimal accuracy drop. Unlike the standard approach, degradation is more predictable and follows a linear trend, enabling convenient control over the accuracy-quantization trade-off. Our optimized clipping method, ACIQ, improves quantization of neural networks by selecting the distribution with the better estimate for mean-square-error. It shows a drastic impact on quantization in various models due to statistical dispersion of activations. The clipping process is formulated as an optimization problem with a simple polynomial-exponential equation that can be calculated numerically and stored in a lookup table for fast retrieval. The work focuses on quantization of activations in neural networks, with potential benefits for weights and gradients. The framework is not limited to inference settings and can be extended to training. Optimized clipping is crucial for quantization, demonstrating its major importance in neural network quantization. In the context of quantization of activations in neural networks, a more accurate analysis related to quantization noise is provided. A piece-wise linear function is constructed to approximate the density function, resulting in small approximation errors for smooth probability density functions. Linear equations are calculated for each line segment of the piece-wise linear function. The piece-wise linear function approximates the density function with small errors for smooth probability density functions. Linear equations are calculated for each line segment. The second term in Equation 3 is then calculated using the midpoint values."
