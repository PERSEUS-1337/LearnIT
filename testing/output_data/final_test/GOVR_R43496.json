    "content": "Financial data breaches in recent years have exposed personal information like finances, PII, health care, and legal issues. The theft of this information was done by outsiders hacking systems, insiders with or without authorized access, loss of physical media, and accidental publication. 78% of compromised records in the first half of 2014 were due to outsiders. Major breaches include Target in 2013, Adobe in 2013, Home Depot in 2014, Heartland in 2009, and TJX in 2007. The report highlights major financial data breaches, including Heartland in 2009 with 130 million payment card records, TJX in 2007 with 94 million payment card records, Sony in 2011 with 77 million personal information records, JPMorgan in 2014 with 76 million customer names, and Tricare in 2011 with 4.9 million medical records lost. Other breaches occurred in Korea in 2014 with 220 million records stolen and China in 2012 with 150 million records stolen. In 2013, Target experienced a data breach where 40 million payment cards and personal information of 70 million customers were compromised. The breach involved malware placed on point-of-sale registers capturing unencrypted credit and debit card information, along with some encrypted PINs. Target's executive vice president testified that an intruder used a vendor's access to the system. The Secret Service is investigating the breach, but details have not been released. It is unlikely that all compromised cards will be used in fraudulent transactions. Payment cards compromised at Target will be used in fraudulent transactions, with some cards canceled or denied by financial institutions. Some institutions issued new cards, while others rely on antifraud monitoring. Target's detailed timeline of the breach is an exception, possibly due to senior management testifying before Congress. Key dates in the breach were provided by John J. Mulligan, Target's executive vice president and chief financial officer. The Target breach timeline, provided by the CFO, includes key dates such as the intrusion on November 12, 2013, detection by security systems, hiring of outside experts on December 14, confirmation of malware on December 15, and public announcement on December 19. On December 19, 2013, Target publicly announced the breach, followed by the disclosure of encrypted PIN data theft on December 27, 2013. On January 9, 2014, Target discovered the theft of PII, and on January 10, 2014, they announced the PII theft. The breaches affected 98 million customers, with 12 million people impacted by both the payment card and PII data breaches. Fazio Mechanical Services, a contractor for Target, had its computer compromised, leading to the breach of Target's payment system. Reports suggest that a phishing email containing malware was used to infiltrate Fazio's network and subsequently Target's POS system. Target's POS system was certified as compliant with PCI rules in September 2013. A memory scraper malware captured payment card information before encryption, leading to a data breach. Other related breaches were reported at Neiman Marcus, Michaels, Home Depot, OneStopParking, and White Lodging. It is suspected that someone obtained a vendor's credentials to access Target's system. The cyberattack on Target involved obtaining a vendor's credentials to access the billing system, escalating access to the POS system, introducing malware, spreading it through Target software to POS devices, storing credit card data in files sent to external servers, and ignoring warnings. JPMorgan Chase reported a cyberattack compromising PII of 76 million households and 7 million small businesses to the SEC. JPMorgan Chase reported a cyberattack compromising PII of users, but no account information or sensitive data was compromised. The company reassured customers of no liability for unauthorized activity and stated previous experiences with security breaches. Hackers gained access to JPMorgan servers storing customer contact information in mid-June 2014. The company discovered the data breach in mid-August and took steps to stop unauthorized access. The FBI investigated the hacking attack on JPMorgan and other financial institutions. JPMorgan reassured customers of no unusual fraud activity. JPMorgan reassured customers that there was no unusual fraud activity following a data breach in mid-June 2014. Hackers, believed to be overseas, infiltrated the bank's network and the JPMorgan Corporate Challenge website. Despite their efforts, the hackers were unable to monetize the stolen information. The breach did not occur through the Corporate Challenge website. The New York Times reported on the breach, comparing it to data breaches at Target and Home Depot. Target, Home Depot, and JPMorgan data breaches incurred significant costs, including direct expenses like hiring consultants and compensating business partners for losses. Target reported $248 million in breach-related expenses, with $90 million expected from insurance. Legal costs may not be fully known for years. Target incurred significant costs related to the data breach, including call center staffing, legal expenses for defending against lawsuits, and reimbursement claims from payment networks for fraud losses. Industry expert Julie Conroy estimates that millions of cards will be used fraudulently, with card issuers typically liable for the fraud except in cases where the card is not present during the transaction. The Payment Cards Industry Council was established in 2006 by major payment card companies to set standards. Industry expert Julie Conroy estimates that payment card companies could fine Target between $400 million and $1.1 billion for the data breach. She noted that the largest payment card issuers have better fraud detection systems, with 10%-15% of their cards experiencing fraudulent charges compared to 20%-30% for other issuers. Visa's chief risk officer testified that 2%-5% of compromised Visa cards face fraud, potentially resulting in $240-$600 million in fraudulent charges for Target. Target could face a PCI fine of $240-$600 million, which would be 37% of their 2013 net income and 7% of their stockholders' equity. Home Depot reported unusual payment system activity in September 2013, compromising 56 million payment cards. Home Depot reported a data breach compromising 56 million payment cards, leading to legal actions and $43 million in expenses. The breach was attributed to the same malware used against Target. The payment card system includes credit cards, debit cards, ATM cards, and prepaid cards, with two basic approaches to transactions. The payment card system involves a four-party system used by MasterCard and Visa, and a three-party system used by companies like Diners Club, Discover, and American Express. The four-party system includes a merchant, an acquirer, an issuer, and a cardholder. The process involves the card being swiped, transaction information sent to the acquirer, anti-fraud analysis conducted by the payment card company, and verification by the issuer. The issuer verifies the account, available credit, and performs anti-fraud analysis. The issuer notifies the payment card company of the authorization decision. The acquirer notifies the merchant of the authorization decision. The cardholder pays the monthly bill. In the payment card system, interchange fees and merchant discounts are determined by factors like transaction method, card type, merchant type, and cardholder type. The three-party system involves the merchant sending transaction info to the payment card company, while the four-party system dominated by Visa and MasterCard in 2013. Visa had a 56% share and MasterCard had 26% share in dollar volume. In 2013, Visa had a 56% share and MasterCard had a 26% share in the payments system. American Express had a 15% share and Discover had a 3% share. Payment processors, approved by PCI, manage the payment process between the point of sale, acquirer, and payment card. Security risks exist at various points in the system, including at the point of sale, during information transmission, at banks, or at the payment card company. Payment card breaches continue due to economic, technological, and strategic reasons. Criminals find stealing financial data online profitable with little risk of arrest. International cooperation in identifying and prosecuting offenders is lacking, reducing risks for criminals. Merchants, banks, and payment cards share costs, but minimizing expenses may shift the burden to others. A new technology to deter payment card breaches involves shifting expenses to others. Cyber technology and business efficiencies for merchants, banks, payment cards, payment processors, and cybercriminals are constantly evolving. Incentives to improve cybersecurity are divided along the transaction path. Some merchants suggest replacing magnetic stripe and signature systems with Chip and PIN technology for encryption. Adoption of this technology presents a coordination problem until the entire payment system adopts it. The payment card industry has announced that liability for fraudulent transactions will be assigned to merchants or issuers not Chip and Signature compliant starting October 1, 2015. Chip and Signature/PIN technology allows for approval of purchases even without a computer connection to the issuing bank. Chip-based systems, like Chip and Signature cards, are being issued by some banks in the United States to reduce fraud. These cards are more difficult to duplicate compared to traditional cards. However, they do not prevent account information theft. Outside the US, the majority of terminals and payment cards use EMV chips. While chip-based cards can lower fraud costs, they do not eliminate the risk entirely. The current payment card system in the United States is based on magnetic stripe cards that contain unencrypted account information. While secure card readers encrypt data before transmission, interception is still possible. PCI standards only require encryption for data transmitted over public networks or stored. The magnetic stripe and signature card system used in the United States has weaknesses such as unencrypted card information, easy forging of cards, and difficulty in verifying signatures. However, the system allows for online real-time authorization, preventing unauthorized purchases. In contrast, the rest of the world uses a more secure Chip system for payment cards. In the United States, the Chip and PIN system is considered more secure than the magnetic stripe system. The Chip card encrypts information and changes encryption with each use, making it difficult for criminals to capture cardholder information. However, Chip and PIN cards may still have security vulnerabilities, as demonstrated by British researchers. Chip and PIN cards have security vulnerabilities that can be bypassed. Chip and Signature cards increase security through encryption and difficulty in duplication. PIN adds two-factor authentication. Merchants not supporting Chip and Signature will be liable for counterfeit transactions. Gas stations and ATMs will shift to Chip and Signature by October 1, 2017. MasterCard's president argues that signatures are easier for customers than PINs. According to experts, the cost of producing a chip card is significantly higher than a magnetic stripe card. New POS terminals could cost between $300-$600 each, with some estimates suggesting over $1,000 per unit. Tokenization is a emerging technology solution for secure transactions, where each transaction is indexed by a unique token stored on secure servers. Tokenization is a secure process where transaction information is encrypted into cipher text, making it unusable by outsiders. This method relies on the security of the vault and encryption keys. While it may make analyzing customer records more cumbersome for merchants, the benefits of tokenization outweigh the risks of potential compromise. Internet transactions commonly use https for encryption, ensuring secure communication. Mobile payments and mobile banking are emerging as alternatives to traditional payment methods, where mobile devices like phones and tablets are used for financial transactions. Security concerns arise regarding the encryption of transaction information, especially if a mobile device is lost or stolen. Questions also arise about the security of the system when using accounts with merchants and the transmission security between customers and merchants, particularly with technologies like Bluetooth and NFC. The cost of data breaches can have a significant impact on businesses, with estimates ranging from $90 to $305 per record. For Target, the compromise of 40 million cards could result in costs of $3.6 billion to $12.2 billion. Factors influencing these losses include industry, security policies, type of information, and storage methods. The cost of data breaches can have a significant impact on businesses, with estimates ranging from $90 to $305 per record. Table 1 summarizes various estimates of the cost to Target its data breach, ranging from $4.9 billion down to $11 million after insurance and taxes. Ponemon estimated that a 2013 data breach in the retail sector would cost an average of $122 per record. The cost of the Target breach is estimated to be $4.9 billion if each record costs $122. Target has reported losses of $11 million after insurance and taxes. The report discusses the distribution of costs among merchants, banks, payment processors, and consumers, with the possibility of reallocating costs through private contracts and lawsuits. The cost of reversing fraudulent transactions is relatively small if funds can be recovered through chargebacks by issuing banks. The Target breach resulted in a chargeback possibility for customers to retrieve funds from the merchant. Sales declined for Target after the breach announcement, while Walmart and Costco saw varying sales trends. Research shows that payment breaches have little long-lasting impact on a company's stock price. The cost of issuing replacement cards after a data breach can be significant, with estimates around $10 per card. Issuers must decide which cards to replace, considering that not all compromised cards will be used fraudulently. Some issuers may choose to replace fewer cards if they have better fraud detection measures in place. Payment processors play a crucial role in connecting merchants with financial institutions for credit card processing. They offer services ranging from handling transactions to ensuring PCI compliance. Small merchants use them to avoid hiring security specialists, while large merchants outsource for efficiency. However, payment processors can also be vulnerable to data breaches, as seen with Global Payments in 2012. Global Payments was suspended as an authorized provider due to a data breach in 2012. Costs incurred totaled $156.9 million, with $35.7 million in fraud losses. Insurance covered $20.0 million. A class action lawsuit against Global Payments was dismissed. Approximately 1.5 million payment cards were affected, with a cost per card of $104. Payment card companies like MasterCard and Visa seem to avoid financial responsibility for data breaches. In contrast, three-party payment systems bear credit risk from lending funds to cardholders. In a four-party payment system, the issuing bank bears the credit risk, not the payment card company. This means that the issuing bank is responsible for costs related to payment card fraud. While MasterCard and Visa do not explicitly mention expenses from fraud and data breaches in their annual reports, American Express, Global Payments, and Heartland do. The maximum cost to a consumer for a stolen credit card is $50 by law, and for a stolen debit card, it varies depending on how quickly the consumer notifies the issuer. The cost to consumers for fraudulent transactions can range from $50 to $500, depending on how quickly they notify the card issuer. Payment card issuers typically do not charge cardholders for fraudulent transactions and often absorb the charges. However, consumers may face increased identity theft risks and additional costs such as loss of privacy, time spent monitoring card use, and inconvenience of getting new cards. Breached organizations may incur costs such as lost sales, damage to reputation, forensic examinations, hiring experts, notifying cardholders, and expanding call centers. In data breaches, costs include creating or expanding call centers, offering credit monitoring, legal expenses, regulatory fines, and enhanced security. Liability for costs depends on contracts among retailers, banks, credit card companies, and payment processors. Financial institutions may sue retailers for data breaches, with costs including card reissuance and fraudulent charges. Smaller institutions have filed lawsuits against Target in Minnesota for damages related to the breach, such as notifying customers, reissuing cards, and refunding losses from unauthorized charges. In some data breach cases, merchants have paid significant costs, like T.J. Maxx setting aside $203 million to cover expenses from a breach involving 45 million cards. Courts decide who bears losses from breaches like Target's, leading to calls for Congress to examine responsibility for preventing and covering losses. Some have called on Congress to allocate liability for cybercrime prevention to parties best able to protect consumers at the least cost. Determining responsibility for cybersecurity over consumers' data is complex due to data sharing among retailers, payment companies, processors, and financial institutions. Congressional hearings on Target breaches have focused on policy solutions like notifying consumers of breaches and clarifying the FTC's authority. The discussion on policy options following the Target breach has focused on the need for a federal data breach notification law. Currently, 47 states have their own notification laws, but there is ambiguity in the definition of \"data breach notification.\" The focus is on clarifying the FTC's authority and sanctioning lax data security practices. A data security breach occurs when unauthorized access compromises sensitive personally identifiable information (PII). Currently, only specific sectors are required by federal law to notify consumers of potential data breaches, such as financial institutions under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and healthcare entities under HIPAA and HITECH Act. There is no comprehensive federal law governing data protection by private actors. Currently, 47 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have laws requiring notification of security breaches involving personal information. Three states - Alabama, New Mexico, and South Dakota - have not passed such laws. Businesses have raised concerns about the burden of complying with multiple data breach notification laws. Recent calls for a federal data breach notification law have been made by the Services Roundtable and the National Retail Federation. While some state regulators and consumer groups are concerned about potential preemption of state laws, businesses see cost savings in a federal law that could eliminate the need to comply with multiple state laws. The executive branch also supports a federal notification law, and bipartisan consensus is reportedly growing, although details in various proposals remain divergent. Data breach notification laws address entities, information protection, breach definitions, harm thresholds, notice delivery, exceptions, preemption of state laws, penalties, enforcement, and remedies. Bills in the 113th Congress varied in their approach to these elements, with some including preemption clauses. Calls for a federal law have been made by business groups, with bipartisan support growing despite divergent proposals. Some in Congress are pushing for a federal law to strengthen the FTC's authority in penalizing businesses for not adequately protecting consumers' personal information. The FTC currently relies on Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act to enforce data security violations. If a company makes misleading statements about its data security practices, it could be considered unfair and deceptive under Section 5. The FTC can take action against companies that engage in unfair and deceptive practices related to data security, as prohibited by Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. This can include negotiating a consent agreement, denying the FTC's claim, or facing a lawsuit. The FTC has settled numerous cases based on allegations of inadequate safeguarding of consumer data, totaling more than 50 cases. The FTC has settled over 50 cases related to data security breaches since 2001. However, the FTC lacks explicit statutory power to impose civil penalties specifically for unfair trade practices in data breaches. Settlements typically involve companies agreeing to stop deceptive practices without additional penalties. For instance, TRENDnet settled with the FTC over a data breach involving insecure video cameras that allowed hackers to access consumers' live feeds. The FTC settled with TRENDnet over a data breach involving hackers posting consumers' live feeds online. TRENDnet must maintain a security program, notify consumers about security issues, and provide free technical support. The FTC lacks explicit statutory power to impose monetary penalties for unfair trade practices related to data breaches and has asked Congress for legislation to grant this authority. The FTC's authority over data breach practices has been challenged in court, potentially affecting its enforcement authority. In 2012, the FTC sued Wyndham hotel chains for misrepresenting security measures. Wyndham argued that the FTC cannot set data-security standards for the private sector. The U.S. District Court denied Wyndham's motion to dismiss the FTC's lawsuit over data security practices, ruling that the FTC had valid claims of unfair and deceptive practices. Several bills introduced in Congress could have impacted the FTC's powers regarding data breaches. The FTC was granted the power to impose civil penalties on companies for failing to comply with data security standards through various bills introduced in Congress. These bills aimed to enhance the FTC's authority in enforcing cybersecurity regulations and addressing data breaches. Critics advocate for federal standards on data security to combat breaches, as current regulations lack clarity. The FTC lacks authority to enforce detailed regulations, leading to a patchwork of state standards. Congress debates the need for a federal standard, with concerns about rigidity and lagging behind technology. Critics argue for federal data security standards to address breaches due to unclear regulations. Proponents suggest a flexible federal statute mandating \"reasonable\" security measures based on organization size and data sensitivity. Bills in Congress propose varying federal standards for data security and breach notification. Bills in Congress, such as S. 1897, S. 1976, S. 1995, and S. 1927, aim to establish data security standards for covered entities. These bills require the implementation of data privacy and security programs, vulnerability testing, risk assessments, and employee training. Civil penalties would be enforced for violations of these standards. S. 1927 specifically mandates covered entities to maintain policies and procedures to protect sensitive information. The proposed bills in Congress aim to establish data security standards for covered entities, requiring the implementation of privacy and security programs, vulnerability testing, risk assessments, and employee training. Enforcement of civil penalties for violations would be under the authority of each institution's prudential regulator, such as the OCC, Federal Reserve, FDIC, SEC, CFTC, FHFA, or FTC depending on the type of institution. S. 1976 and S. 1995 propose data security standards and privacy programs, giving the FTC authority to set detailed regulations. Requirements include risk assessments, controls, employee training, and vulnerability assessments. Enforcement includes civil penalties by the Department of Justice and state attorneys general, with a private right of action. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released a voluntary framework for data security among critical infrastructure industries. The retail sector, including Target, is not included in this framework. Target joined the financial services information sharing and analysis sector (FS-ISAC) after its data breaches. The NIST framework for data security is voluntary and lacks direct enforcement measures. It could potentially set a standard of conduct for liability in data security breaches. The allocation of costs for improved cybersecurity across different entities in the payment chain is a key issue. The allocation of cybersecurity costs in the payment chain is a key issue, with participants trying to shift the responsibility to others. Congressional hearings have highlighted finger-pointing among merchants, banks, and payment card companies regarding inadequate payment card security. Inadequate payment card security has led to finger-pointing among merchants, banks, and payment card companies. Merchant trade groups argue that payment card companies have too much power, shifting cybersecurity costs unfairly onto merchants. Banks complain about bearing the costs of reissuing cards and reimbursing fraudulent charges, often due to merchants' security errors. A 2010 Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia discussion paper examined the issue of payment card fraud and data security. It found that merchants are concerned about protecting data to maintain their reputation and avoid chargebacks, but some feel they lack ownership over fraud mitigation systems they are required to comply with. Banks and payment card companies worry that making data security a competitive factor could hinder information sharing and cooperation. Consumers may see competition for better data security as beneficial. The costs of payment card fraud and the debate over adopting Chip and PIN technology were discussed during Target hearings. Members of Congress questioned why the US had not switched to this more secure system. Senator Warren suggested government intervention to promote adoption, while Senator Durbin raised concerns about the pace of technology upgrades given the costs borne by retailers and customers. Members of Congress questioned the slow adoption of more advanced technology like the European Chip and PIN standard in America, but stopped short of advocating for federal government mandates.
