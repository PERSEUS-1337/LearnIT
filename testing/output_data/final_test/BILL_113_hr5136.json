The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a 5-year demonstration project for payment to participating States for medical assistance in community-based institutions for mental diseases treating substance use conditions. States eligible for participation must have a State plan covering inpatient substance use disorder treatment services. States seeking to join the project must submit an application. The Secretary will select participating States for a 5-year demonstration project for payment to provide medical assistance in community-based institutions for mental diseases treating substance use conditions. States must submit an application to the Secretary, who will waive payment limitations for care and services. The Secretary may waive certain requirements of the Social Security Act to carry out the demonstration project for payment of medical assistance in community-based institutions for mental diseases. The Secretary will conduct an evaluation of the project's impact and report to Congress. The evaluation of the demonstration project under this section will assess access to substance use disorder treatment services, discharge planning by healthcare providers, and the impact on costs. The evaluation of a demonstration project will assess the costs of health care services, including inpatient, emergency, and ambulatory care, as well as readmissions to mental health institutions. A report with findings is due by December 31, 2020. The Secretary will evaluate the demonstration project's findings and make recommendations on whether the limitations should be reviewed by Congress and if the project should continue nationally after December 31, 2020. $300,000,000 is appropriated for fiscal year 2015 for this purpose. Funds allocated to states based on criteria determined by the Secretary. Payments to states made quarterly, limited to $300,000,000 in total. In this section, payments to participating States are limited to $300,000,000 and cannot be made after December 31, 2024.

The term \"qualified individual\" refers to someone aged 21 to 65 who needs substance use disorder treatment and is eligible for Medicaid.
