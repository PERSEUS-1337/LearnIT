    "content": "Pension plans are classified as single-employer or multiemployer plans. Multiemployer plans are sponsored by employers in the same industry, while multiple employer plans are sponsored by more than one employer. This report focuses on multiemployer plans, specifically defined benefit (DB) plans. In 2017, there were an estimated 10.6 million participants in 1,374 multiemployer pension plans. In 2017, there were 10.6 million participants in 1,374 multiemployer plans. Approximately 10% to 15% of participants are in plans that may become insolvent within 19 years. When a plan becomes insolvent, the PBGC provides financial assistance to continue paying benefits, up to $12,870 per year for an individual with 30 years of service. PBGC reported a deficit of $65.1 billion in the multiemployer insurance program at the end of FY2017. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) provided estimates of PBGC's financial condition, including cash-based estimates indicating insufficient resources to pay claims from 2017 to 2036. CBO's fair-value estimate of PBGC's future obligations was $101 billion, with no federal government obligation to provide financial assistance. Plan insolvencies are projected, leading to PBGC challenges. PBGC is facing financial challenges due to projected plan insolvencies, which may lead to insufficient resources to provide maximum guarantee level assistance starting in 2025. Participants may receive less than $2,000 annually as PBGC's assistance is limited to its premium revenue. Employers in troubled plans may leave to avoid future liabilities, contributing to a potential \"death spiral\" in multiemployer plans. This report does not cover all policy options available to stakeholders. The report provides an overview of policy options discussed in committee hearings and the multiemployer pension plan community, including assistance for financially-troubled plans, changes to benefit limits, premium structure, funding rules, and pension plan designs. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 created new joint select committees in response to concerns raised by policymakers and stakeholders. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 established the Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans with 16 members tasked with improving pension plan solvency and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. The committee must vote on a report with recommendations and legislative language by November 30, 2018, for expedited consideration in the Senate. Some Members of Congress emphasize the urgency of taking action. In 2025, PBGC is projected to run out of resources, leading to insolvency of plans and inadequate benefits for participants. PBGC's multiemployer program had $2.3 billion in assets at the end of FY2017. Once assets are exhausted, PBGC can only provide assistance equal to premium revenue, with most participants receiving less than $2,000 per year. Concerns about contagion effects causing financial strain on employers have been raised. Increased withdrawal liability assessments may cause financial distress for employers in multiemployer plans, affecting their contributions to other plans. Disclosure of withdrawal liability amounts in financial statements could limit access to credit. Policymakers acknowledge the challenges of addressing insolvencies in multiemployer plans, with Senator Orrin Hatch stating that solutions will not please everyone. Representative Marcy Kaptur calls for a \"shared sacrifice\" approach, emphasizing the need for concessions from all stakeholders. Finding the balance needed to gain buy-in from all stakeholders is crucial for the success of the Joint Select Committee on multiemployer plans. Some stakeholders are against providing loans or financial assistance to these plans, citing concerns such as potential bailout perceptions, high costs for taxpayers, and lack of precedent for government assistance to private-sector pension plans. Several employers have pledged to offset benefit reductions for certain former employees in some multiemployer pension plans. Some employers are offsetting benefit reductions for former employees in multiemployer pension plans to avoid financial losses. United Parcel Service (UPS) and Kroger agreed to offset reductions in pension benefits for certain former employees in the Central States plan. If proposals are enacted without benefit reductions, these employers would not need to offset any reductions. The absence of financial assistance to PBGC or Central States could lead to large offsets for companies like UPS and Kroger. UPS estimated its obligation at $4.0 billion in 2016, while Kroger's potential financial responsibility remains undisclosed. Policy options to help financially-troubled plans include federal government subsidized loans, direct funding, and partitions to remove specified liabilities. Two proposals in the 115th Congress suggest U.S. Treasury loans for financially-troubled plans, with varying loan amounts and potential benefit reductions for participants. Repayment of loan principal is a key consideration for the effectiveness of this approach. One proposal suggests allowing plans in critical status to receive loans, while another proposal focuses on providing loans to the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) 1974 Plan. The Butch Lewis Act of 2017 and the Rehabilitation for Multiemployer Pensions Act aim to establish the Pension Rehabilitation Authority (PRA) in the U.S. Treasury to provide loans to multiemployer plans. The PRA would provide loans to multiemployer plans equal to the total lifetime benefits for participants in pay status. Plans may also receive financial assistance from PBGC. Loan proceeds must be used to purchase annuities or kept in a secure portfolio. Plans would pay interest for 29 years and repay the loan in year 30. Benefits for participants would not be reduced. Plans that received approval for benefit suspensions under the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 (MPRA) would be required to apply for loans under S. 2147 and H.R. 4444. The loans would allow plans to restore the benefit reductions and accumulate funds to repay the loan principal from investment proceeds. This would increase plan assets available for investment, as benefit payments in the early years would be paid from loan proceeds. The bills do not require changes to funding rules for multiemployer plans, and CBO estimates they may increase federal deficits. The analysis of S. 2147 estimated that the bill could increase federal deficits by over $100 billion from 2019-2028. The bill aims to provide financial assistance to the UMWA 1974 Pension Plan through direct assistance and loans from the U.S. Treasury, with an annual cap of $490 million. There are uncertainties around key elements of the bill, such as when financial assistance payments would be made, which could significantly impact the final cost estimate. The Treasury would transfer any remaining amount, up to $490 million annually, to the UMWA 1974 Plan after funds are allocated to health plans and states/tribes reclaiming abandoned coal mines. S. 1911 and H.R. 3913 propose annual loans to prevent the plan's insolvency, with a maximum of $600 million per loan at a 1% interest rate over 30 years. The NCCMP proposes a loan program for multiemployer plans at 1% interest over 30 years, with interest-only payments for the first 15 years. The program aims to help plans earn their way out of funding problems. The proposal includes three alternatives, one of which involves providing loans to plans in critical status. UPS suggests loans equal to five times the plan's shortfall, with repayment conditions. The proposal suggests a loan program for multiemployer plans at 1% interest over 30 years, with interest-only payments for the first five years. Plans in critical status could apply for a second loan after five years and a third loan after ten years. Benefit payments would be reduced by 20% for all participants, and a risk reserve pool would be set up for repayment assistance. The proposal includes a risk reserve pool funded by increased premiums and payments from employers, participants, and unions. Multiemployer plans can apply for partitioning, creating a successor plan with reduced benefits under the MPRA. PBGC provides financial assistance to the successor plan to pay participants' benefits. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act (MPRA) allows for plan partitioning, where a successor plan receives PBGC financial assistance to pay benefits up to maximum guarantee levels. To approve a plan partition, the plan must be in critical status, the sponsor must take measures to avoid insolvency, and PBGC must certify that the partition is necessary for solvency without impairing existing obligations. The partition cost is covered by PBGC's multiemployer fund. Some policy analysts suggest expanding PBGC's partitioning authority to intervene in troubled multiemployer plans before insolvency, given the expected insolvency of PBGC's multiemployer insurance program. Currently, PBGC provides financial assistance to plans once they become insolvent. In comparison, PBGC's single-employer program can initiate termination proceedings if the long-run loss to PBGC may unreasonably increase without termination. Expanding partitioning authority could help preserve financially troubled plans with active employers. Expanding PBGC's partitioning authority to troubled multiemployer plans before insolvency could save money by requiring benefit reductions or increased employer contributions to make the original plan financially sound. Transferring benefits of orphan participants to the successor plan would ensure all participants have contributing employers, potentially leading to a well-funded original plan. The Keep Our Pension Promises Act, introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Marcy Kaptur, aims to partition plans in critical status to prevent financial troubles. A legacy fund within PBGC would cover costs, financed by changes to the tax code. Full benefits would be maintained without requiring reductions for participants. Participants in multiemployer plans would receive their full benefits as promised, and plans approved for benefit reductions under MPRA would need to apply for partitioning to restore the reduced benefits. The PBGC provides financial assistance to multiemployer plans, which must reduce participants' benefits based on a formula tied to years of service. For example, a participant with 30 years of service could receive up to $12,870 per year. The maximum benefit for multiemployer plans is lower than that for single-employer programs. The multiemployer guarantee for PBGC benefits is not indexed to inflation and was last increased in 2001. As participants' benefits increase, more may see reductions due to the maximum guarantee. In 2013, 79% of participants in plans receiving financial assistance get their full benefit, while 49% in terminated plans have benefits below the maximum guarantee. The PBGC maximum guarantee level may result in benefit reductions for participants in plans receiving financial assistance in the future. Some policymakers believe the guarantee is too low, with Senator Sherrod Brown calling it \"miniscule.\" Experts have also noted that the guarantee level is low and that the increase in premiums since 2005 did not align with a rise in the benefit guaranty. Solvency-driven benefit reductions could impact household incomes. The PBGC maximum benefit guarantee could offset household income reductions from solvency-driven benefit cuts. Discussions on multiemployer plan solvency focus on PBGC, which insures these plans. PBGC multiemployer premiums have increased over the years, with proposals for new premiums based on underfunding, employer exits, and risk levels. In FY2017, PBGC received $291 million in premium revenue. The FY2019 budget proposed new premiums for multiemployer plans, including a variable-rate premium based on underfunding and an exit premium for employers leaving a plan. The exit premium would be 10 times the variable-rate premium cap. The budget proposed new premiums for multiemployer plans, including a variable-rate premium based on underfunding and an exit premium for employers leaving a plan. The exit premium would be 10 times the variable-rate premium cap, with suggestions for premiums based on riskiness of investment portfolios to incentivize well-funded and conservatively invested plans. The economic recession from December 2007 to June 2009 contributed to the current multiemployer problem, with plan assets heavily invested in equities leading to significant losses. Business bankruptcies resulted in fewer employers participating in multiemployer plans, increasing orphan liabilities. To prevent large unfunded liabilities in DB pension plans, changes like variable benefit or composite plans may be necessary. DB pension plans need to be 100% funded and invested in safe assets to avoid insolvency. Stricter funding requirements could lead to increased employer contributions or decreased benefits for participants. This is necessary to address the current multiemployer problem caused by the economic recession and business bankruptcies. Pension plans must be fully funded to ensure participants receive their benefits. The discount rate used to value future obligations is crucial, with experts differing on the appropriate rate. Several viewpoints exist on the appropriate discount rate for pension plans to value liabilities. Actuaries and economists debate whether to use the expected rate of return on investments or a lower rate reflecting the likelihood of benefit payments. This decision impacts required employer contributions and future benefit promises. Members of Congress have also weighed in on the issue. Some Members of Congress suggest that multiemployer plans may use a high discount rate for their benefits. An alternative proposal involves adjusting benefits based on the plan's investment performance, with contributions remaining unchanged. Legislation has been introduced for composite pension plans combining features of defined benefit and defined contribution plans. The GROW Act proposes composite plans for multiemployer DB plans, offering options like benefit reductions to maintain funding at 120%. These plans provide certainty for sponsors' contributions, are not PBGC-covered, and protect participants from longevity risk. Composite plans offer certainty for sponsors' contributions and protect participants from longevity risk by providing benefit payments for life, although the dollar amount is not guaranteed. Concerns about potential benefit reductions in composite plans could be alleviated by requiring conservative investments to ensure a specified level of benefit."
