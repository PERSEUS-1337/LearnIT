    "content": "The \"Fairness in Tobacco and Nicotine Regulation Act of 1993\" is referenced in this Act. Any amendments or repeals mentioned in the Act are considered to be related to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Congress finds that cigarette smoking and tobacco use cause 450,000 deaths annually in the US, costing $65 billion in lost productivity and healthcare expenses. Environmental tobacco smoke harms nonsmokers, and despite known risks, there is no federal regulation on tobacco products. Tobacco is as addictive as cocaine and heroin, with the industry spending $4 billion yearly on promotion. The voluntary advertising code by the tobacco industry aims to restrict sexual attraction images. The Tobacco Control Act was enacted to prohibit the use of images of sexual attraction, sophistication, and athletic abilities in tobacco advertising. It highlighted concerns such as the lack of enforcement, the high number of children trying cigarettes daily, the absence of a federal minimum age for tobacco sales, inadequate labeling of tobacco products, undisclosed chemical additives, and the absence of a list of harmful constituents in tobacco smoke. The Food and Drug Administration is the most qualified Federal agency to regulate tobacco products, including mainstream and sidestream smoke. It is inconsistent for the FDA to regulate other nicotine-containing products but not tobacco products in a comparable manner. The term 'tobacco product' includes cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, smokeless tobacco, snuff, and chewing tobacco. A 'tobacco additive' is any substance that affects the characteristics of a tobacco product. A 'constituent' refers to elements in cigarette smoke that pose health risks. 'Tar' is the total articulate matter in smoke minus nicotine and water. Enforcement of regulations is outlined in Section 4. SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT.\n\nSection 301 (21 U.S.C. 331) is amended to include regulations on the manufacture, labeling, sale, distribution, advertising, and promotion of tobacco products.\n\nSEC. 5. REGULATION OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS.\n\nThe Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include regulations for tobacco products under a new chapter VII. The Secretary is required to promulgate regulations for tobacco products within 12 months of receiving recommendations from the Tobacco and Nicotine Products Advisory Committee. These regulations must be consistent with regulations for other ingested products, but cannot ban the sale of tobacco products based solely on their health risks. Regulations will make it illegal to sell tobacco products intended for consumption. The sale of tobacco products to individuals under 18 years old is prohibited, as well as distributing free samples or using coupons to obtain discounted tobacco products. Additionally, tobacco products must have a label stating \"Federal Law Prohibits Sale To Minors.\" The Secretary is responsible for enforcing these regulations to prevent underage access to tobacco products. The regulations prohibit the sale of tobacco products to individuals under 18 years old and require proper labeling, including warnings about the dangers of environmental tobacco smoke and listing chemical additives. The regulations require proper labeling of tobacco products, including restrictions on health claims like \"light\" or \"nicotine free\" unless approved by the Secretary based on scientific data. The regulations mandate tobacco product manufacturers to provide consumers with information on adverse effects, warnings, directions for use, contraindications, and other necessary details through labeling requirements. Additionally, regulations govern advertising and promotion consistency. The regulations for advertising and promoting tobacco products must align with those for prescription drugs containing nicotine. It is prohibited for tobacco manufacturers to sponsor public events if they display their brand's name or logo. These regulations do not diminish the Federal Trade Commission's authority. Regulations for manufacturing tobacco products require safe additives, classify nicotine products as drugs if they don't meet tobacco product definition, and have authority to subpoena manufacturing documents. The advisory committee provides guidance on regulations for manufacturing tobacco products and has the authority to subpoena manufacturing documents. The Tobacco and Nicotine Products Advisory Committee, established in the Food and Drug Administration, consists of 10 members appointed by the Secretary to evaluate and make recommendations for regulations governing tobacco products to promote public health without banning the product. The Tobacco and Nicotine Products Advisory Committee, under the FDA, comprises 10 members appointed by the Secretary to evaluate regulations for tobacco products. Members include experts in nicotine addiction, pharmacology, food and drug law, marketing, public education, toxicology, family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, and consumer representatives from the public health community. Ex officio members include Directors of various health institutes and the Surgeon General. The Tobacco and Nicotine Products Advisory Committee, under the FDA, comprises 10 members appointed by the Secretary to evaluate regulations for tobacco products. The committee's chairman is appointed by the Secretary with the advice and consent of the Commissioner of Food and Drugs. The advisory committee reviews scientific evidence on the effects of tobacco products on human health and the manufacturing process of tobacco products. The Tobacco and Nicotine Products Advisory Committee, appointed by the FDA, evaluates regulations for tobacco products. It reviews the use of additives, nicotine's addictive properties, marketing techniques, and current laws governing tobacco products. The committee has the authority to hold hearings and make recommendations for regulations. The Tobacco and Nicotine Products Advisory Committee, appointed by the FDA, evaluates regulations for tobacco products and makes recommendations for regulations within 12 months of its appointment. \"Each tobacco product manufacturer must register with the Secretary within 120 days of the enactment of this Act. A fee is required for tobacco product manufacturers.\" Each tobacco product manufacturer must pay an annual fee by January 31 to cover implementation costs. The fee is determined by the Secretary based on market share. Collected fees are credited to the FDA's account and available until expended. The fees authorized by subsection (a) must be collected annually to cover implementation costs and are only available for this purpose. The Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act is amended to include warnings about the addictive nature of smoking. The Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986 is amended to include warnings about the addictive nature of smokeless tobacco products. The amendment includes adding tobacco products to regulations regarding interstate shipment and factory inspections under the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986. The amendment expands regulations to include tobacco products in interstate shipment and factory inspections under the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986. Additionally, it allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to modify warning labels through regulation. The amendment allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to modify warning labels on tobacco products to strengthen the health message and serve the public interest by increasing label size and placement. The amendment allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to modify warning labels on tobacco products to strengthen the health message and serve the public interest."
