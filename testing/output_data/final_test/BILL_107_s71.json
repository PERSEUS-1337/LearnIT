    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Hydroelectric Licensing Process Improvement Act of 2001\". Congress recognizes the importance of hydroelectric power as a clean, renewable energy source with various benefits to the United States. The relicensing process for hydroelectric projects by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is highlighted as needing improvement. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's relicensing process for hydroelectric projects is criticized for not producing optimal decisions, being inefficient, burdened by uncoordinated environmental reviews, and leading to litigation. Alternative licensing procedures offer opportunities for collaborative resolution. While alternative licensing procedures offer opportunities for collaborative resolution in hydroelectric project licensing, they are not always suitable and cannot replace necessary statutory reforms in the process. The purpose of this Act is to improve the relicensing process for hydroelectric power projects by requiring agencies to consider all effects of conditions on a license, imposing deadlines for agencies to submit proposed conditions, and making other improvements in the licensing process. The Act aims to enhance the relicensing process for hydroelectric power projects by mandating federal agencies to review all impacts of conditions on a license and setting deadlines for the submission of proposed conditions. The Act defines key terms related to conditions and consulting agencies for hydroelectric power project licensing on Federal reservations. The Act defines key terms related to conditions and consulting agencies for hydroelectric power project licensing on Federal reservations. Factors considered in determining conditions include impacts on economic values, power generation, air quality, and water supply compatibility with other license conditions. The Act outlines factors for determining conditions for hydroelectric power project licensing on Federal reservations. Consulting agencies must document all proposals, comments, facts, and analyses to demonstrate full consideration of factors before submitting conditions for review. The consulting agency must document all proposals, comments, facts, and analyses for conditions submitted to the Commission. Conditions must undergo substantiated scientific review based on current data and peer review. In the case of a condition for the first proviso of section 4(e), each condition by a consulting agency must be directly related to project impacts within the Federal reservation. Consulting agencies must provide proposed conditions to license applicants for review before submission to the Commission. The consulting agency must consider the impact on energy and economic values of a project when implementing a condition. The review of a proposed condition should be completed within 180 days after the license applicant notifies the agency. Failure to complete the review on time allows the Commission to handle the condition. The Commission may treat a condition submitted by the consulting agency as a recommendation under section 10(j). If the administrative law judge or reviewing body deems a proposed condition unreasonable or finds non-compliance with requirements, they must render a decision explaining the reasons and may provide recommendations for a more reasonable condition formulation. After administrative review, a consulting agency must take necessary action to withdraw, adjust, or comply with conditions as recommended by the administrative law judge or reviewing body. After an applicant files a license application, a consulting agency must submit a final condition to the Commission within 1 year of the application being ready for environmental review. The final condition must include the record on administrative review and documentation of any actions taken after the review. The consulting agency must submit a final condition to the Commission within 1 year of the application for environmental review. If the agency fails to do so, they lose the authority to recommend conditions, and the Commission may recommend conditions that align with the law and Act requirements. The Commission may grant one extension. The Commission may grant one extension of up to 30 days for a deadline set under paragraph (1). The Commission shall conduct an economic analysis of conditions submitted by a consulting agency to determine if they would make the project uneconomic. When requested by a license applicant, the Commission will make a written determination on the effect of conditions. The Commission will assess conditions submitted by a consulting agency to determine public interest, scientific review, project impacts, reasonableness, evidence support, and consistency with the Act for licensing. Amendments to the Federal Power Act include criteria for evaluating conditions. Amendments to the Federal Power Act include criteria for evaluating conditions related to public interest, scientific review, project impacts, reasonableness, evidence support, and consistency with the Act for licensing. SEC. 33. COORDINATED ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS is added to Part I of the Federal Power Act, focusing on streamlining the environmental review process for projects. The Commission is responsible for conducting a consolidated environmental review for projects licensed under the National Environmental Policy Act. Consulting agencies are not allowed to perform additional environmental reviews. The Commission must set deadlines for the submission of comments by government agencies. The Commission must set deadlines for government agencies to submit comments for environmental impact statements or assessments required for projects, considering the applicant's need for a prompt decision, resources of involved agencies, and statutory requirements. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must study the feasibility of a separate licensing procedure for small hydroelectric projects with a generating capacity of 5 megawatts or less."
