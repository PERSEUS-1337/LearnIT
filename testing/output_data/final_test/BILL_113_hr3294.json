    "content": "The \"State-Run Federal Lands Act\" may be cited as the short title of this Act. Definitions are provided in Section 2. Section 2 of the \"State-Run Federal Lands Act\" defines key terms such as \"qualifying Federal land\" and \"Secretary concerned\" in relation to federal land management agencies. SEC. 3. PETITION BY STATES FOR MANAGEMENT OF CERTAIN QUALIFYING FEDERAL LANDS. States can submit a petition to the Secretary concerned to manage certain qualifying Federal lands, with approval or denial required within 90 days. Approval is based on the State demonstrating sufficient funds and a complete petition. States can submit a petition to the Secretary concerned for managing Federal lands, with approval or denial within 90 days. The petition must be complete and contain all required terms. If denied, the State will receive written notice with reasons for the denial. If the Secretary does not approve or deny a petition within 90 days, it is deemed approved. The petition must include a letter from the State Governor to the Secretary. If a petition is denied, the State can resubmit a corrected petition. The petition to transfer management of qualifying Federal lands to the State must include a description, map, proposed cooperative agreement, proof of funding, and any additional required documentation. The cooperative agreement should state that the State will manage the lands for a specified term of years after the transfer. The State must provide at least 50 percent of the total management costs for qualifying Federal lands, determined by the Governor and Secretary after a cost assessment. In case of a natural disaster, the State takes over recovery efforts. The State and Federal entities will share the cost of damages to structures on qualifying Federal lands, with the State assuming the cost of repair for damages from natural disasters. Revenue from the lands will be distributed according to cost-sharing agreements. The cost-sharing agreement dictates the percentages for funds designated to the Federal entity, allowing the Secretary concerned to use them at their discretion. Procedures for transitioning from Federal to State management of qualifying Federal lands include guarantees for Federal employees to remain employed and for the State to use its allocated funds for hiring. The transfer of authority over qualifying Federal lands to the State includes hiring additional staff, transferring special use permits, and allowing State directives to be implemented in conjunction with Federal employees. Lands open to mineral entry under the General Mining Act of 1872 may also be affected. The General Mining Act of 1872 allows Federal lands to remain open to mineral entry under State law unless changed by a State mineral closing order. State laws supersede Federal laws on qualifying Federal lands under a cooperative agreement if they are more restrictive. Ownership of qualified Federal lands under a cooperative agreement is retained by the United States. Termination of the agreement can occur if the state defaults on payments, breaches the agreement, or if intentional termination is specified. If the State no longer finds the cooperative agreement beneficial, a petition must be submitted to the Secretary showing credible purpose. Within 90 days, the Secretary will decide to approve or deny the petition."
