Section 9 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act is amended to include a provision for the distribution of revenue to Alaska, specifically defining \"coastal political subdivision\" and its proximity to the coastal zone. The term \"institution of higher education\" is defined in section 102 of the Higher Education Act of 1965.

'State' means the State of Alaska, and 'workforce investment board' refers to a State or local board established under subtitle B. For fiscal years 2016-2026, the Secretary will allocate qualified revenues as follows: 50% to the general fund, 27.5% for deficit reduction, 7.5% to the State, 7.5% to coastal political subdivisions, and 2.5% to a special account. The Secretary will allocate 2.5 percent of qualified revenues to a special account in the Treasury for the North Slope Science Initiative and to provide grants for workforce programs in Alaska. In subsequent fiscal years, 2.5 percent of qualified revenues will be allocated to a special account in the Treasury for offshore leasing and development programs in the State, as well as for the development of pipelines to transport oil or gas produced offshore through land under the jurisdiction of the Secretary in the State. For fiscal year 2027 and beyond, the Secretary will allocate 50% of qualified revenues to the general fund, 30% to a special account for State distribution, 12.5% for low-income energy assistance and Arctic infrastructure, and 7.5% to coastal political subdivisions.

Amounts required to be deposited for the fiscal year will be made available in the following fiscal year without further appropriation and will remain available until expended.
